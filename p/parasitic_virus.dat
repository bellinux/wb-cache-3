40|$|Abstract: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection of CD 4 T lymphocytes leads to their progressive loss, whereas HIV- 1 -infected macrophages appear to resist HIV- 1 -mediated apo-ptotic death. The differential response {{of these two}} host-cell populations may be critical in the devel-opment of immunodeficiency and long-term persis-tence of the virus. Multiple contributing factors may favor the macrophage as a resilient host, not only supporting infection by HIV- 1 but also pro-moting replication and persistence of this member of the lentivirus subfamily of primate retroviruses. An encounter between macrophages and R 5 virus engages a signal cascade eventuating in transcrip-tional regulation of multiple genes including those associated with host defense, cell cycle, nuclear factor-B regulation, and apoptosis. It is important that enhanced gene expression is transient, declin-ing to near control levels, and during this quiescent state, the virus continues its life cycle unimpeded. However, when viral replication becomes promi-nent, an increase in host genes again occurs under the orchestration of viral gene products. This bi-phasic host response must fulfill {{the needs of the}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>virus</b> as viral replication activity occurs and leads to intracellular and cell surface-associ-ated viral budding.

40|$|Mutator {{bacteria}} are frequently found in natural populations of bacteria and although coevolution with <b>parasitic</b> <b>viruses</b> (phages) {{is thought to}} be one reason for their persistence, it remains unclear how the presence of mutators affects coevolutionary dynamics. We hypothesized that phages must themselves adapt more rapidly or go extinct, in the face of rapidly evolving mutator bacteria. We compared the coevolutionary dynamics of wild-type Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25 with a lytic phage to the dynamics of an isogenic mutator of P. fluorescens SBW 25 together with the same phage. At the beginning of the experiment both wild-type bacteria and mutator bacteria coevolved with phages. However, mutators rapidly evolved higher levels of sympatric resistance to phages. The phages were unable to "keep-up" with the mutator bacteria, and these rates of coevolution declined to less than the rates of coevolution between the phages and wild-type bacteria. By the end of the experiment, the sympatric resistance of the mutator bacteria was not significantly different to the sympatric resistance of the wild-type bacteria. This suggests that the importance of mutators in the coevolutionary interactions with a particular phage population is likely to be short-lived. More generally, the results demonstrate that coevolving enemies may escape from Red-Queen dynamics...|$|R

Quant. measurements conducted both in lab. and in the field demonstrated that both mechanisms of environmental diffusion of neonicotinoids can produce high exposure levels for bees, with lethal effects compatible with CCD phenomenon: the death manifests within few minutes if bees consume guttation drops or within few hours if they are exposed to particulate matter produced by the sowing machine...|$|R

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{decline in}} honeybee colonies {{during the past}} 50 years has often {{been linked to the}} spread of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and its interaction with certain honeybee viruses. Recently in the United States, dramatic honeybee losses (colony collapse disorder) have been reported; however, there remains no clear explanation for these colony losses, with <b>parasitic</b> mites, <b>viruses,</b> bacteria, and fungal diseases all being proposed as possible candidates. Common characteristics that most failing colonies share is a lack of overt disease symptoms and the disappearance of workers from what appears to be normally functioning colonies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR to monitor the presence of three honeybee viruses, deformed wing virus (DWV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV), during a 1 -year period in 15 asymptomatic, varroa mite-positive honeybee colonies in Southern England, and 3 asymptomatic colonies confirmed to be varroa mite free. All colonies with varroa mites underwent control treatments to ensure that mite populations remained low throughout the study. Despite this, multiple virus infections were detected, yet a significant correlation was observed only between DWV viral load and overwintering colony losses. The long-held view has been that DWV is relatively harmless to the overall health status of honeybee colonies unless it is in association with severe varroa mite infestations. Our findings suggest that DWV can potentially act independently of varroa mites to bring about colony losses. Therefore, DWV may be a major factor in overwintering colony losses...|$|R

A practical application of this property has been the use of bacteriophage for the identification or phage typing of certain strains of a given species. Fisk (1942) introduced a method of phage typing of staphylococci which has been successfully used for tracing sources of infection in epidemic outbreaks of staphylococcal enterotoxin food-poisoning and of staphylococcal infections of the skin in babies in maternity hospitals. Although this method is relatively simple and rapid, many strains of staphyloccoi are resistant to the action of the available phages and the absolute specificity of the phage types is questionable. The purpose of this work is to investigate the growth and multiplication requirements and the stability of the staphylococcus bacteriophages now available, and to use anti-bacteriophage sera (prepared by immunizing rabbits with selected phage strains) as a means for recognition of specificity. If the phages could be divided into a few representative groups, it is hoped that by a careful selection of these phages, a simpler method of phage typing applicable in every laboratory may be developed...|$|R

The family Totiviridae of dsRNA viruses is characterized by virions with a non-segmented dsRNA genome that infect yeast, smut, filamentous fungi, protozoa and shrimp [2 - 4]. The subject of this study, Helminthosporium victoriae virus 190 S (HvV 190 S) was discovered in 1978 in the filamentous fungus Helminthosporium victoriae (H. victoriae) [2, 4]. Virions have a capsid with a smooth outer surface and a maximum diameter of ~ 400 Å. The single dsRNA genome segment codes for two viral proteins: coat protein (CP, 81 kDa) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 92 kDa) [2 - 4].

It has occurred to a number of investigators to seek evidence as to the nature of bacteriophage by a study of its reaction to ultraviolet light, in the hope that a direct comparison with the bactericidal action of ultraviolet energy would show significant similarities or differences. In each instance the results have been disappointing. Though it has been shown repeatedly that bacteriophages are destroyed by exposure in broth, in salt solution, or on agar plates to the total or filtered radiations of the sun or of artificial fight sources, no critical estimates of the incident energies involved or of the effective wave-lengths have been undertaken. Without describing in detail the methods used or the results obtained, for example by Zoeller (1), Gerretsen, Gryns, Sacks, and Sohngen (2), Gfldemeister (3), Biemond (4), or Appelmanns (5), one may conclude with the authors themselves that their studies were not sufficiently critical to give an unequivocal result.

40|$|The {{complement}} system comprises a complex array of enzymes and non-enzymatic proteins {{that is essential}} for the operation of the innate as well as the adaptive immune defence. The {{complement system}} can be activated in three ways: by the classical pathway which is initiated by antibody-antigen complexes, by the alternative pathway initiated by certain structures on microbial surfaces, and by an antibody-independent pathway that is initiated by the binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL; first described as mannan-binding protein) to carbohydrates. MBL is structurally related to the complement C 1 subcomponent, C 1 q, and seems to activate the complement system through an associated serine protease known as MASP (ref. 4) or p 100 (ref. 5), which is similar to C 1 r and C 1 s of the classical pathway. MBL binds to specific carbohydrate structures found on the surface of a range of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, <b>parasitic</b> protozoa and <b>viruses,</b> and exhibits antibacterial activity through killing mediated by the terminal, lytic complement components or by promoting phagocytosis. The level of MBL in plasma is genetically determined, and deficiency is associated with frequent infections in childhood, and possibly also in adults (for review, see ref. 6). We have now identified a new MBL-associated serine protease (MASP- 2) which shows a striking homology with the previously reported MASP (MASP- 1) and the two C 1 q-associated serine proteases C 1 r and C 1 s. Thus complement activation through MBL, like the classical pathway, involves two serine proteases and may antedate the development of the specific immune system of vertebrates. 7320...|$|R

We provide completed local and global analysis for the full system and its subsystems. Our analytical and numerical results allow us {{have a better understanding of}} the synergistic effects of parasitism and virus infections on honeybee population dynamics and its persistence. Interesting findings from our work include: (a) Due to Allee effects experienced by the honeybee population, initial conditions are essential for the survival of the colony. (b) Low adult honeybee to brood ratios have destabilizing effects on the system, generate fluctuated dynamics, and potentially lead to a catastrophic event where both honeybees and mites suddenly become extinct. This catastrophic event could be potentially linked to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) of honeybee colonies. (c) Virus infections may have stabilizing effects on the system, and could make disease more persistent in the presence of parasitic mites. Our model illustrates how the synergy between the <b>parasitic</b> mites and <b>virus</b> infections consequently generates rich dynamics including multiple attractors where all species can coexist or go extinct depending on initial conditions.

Samples were collected from two locations within hives in fall, mid-winter and spring of 2009 / 2010. Although fall parasite and pathogen loads were similar in outdoor and indoor-wintered colonies, the outdoor-wintered colonies had greater relative reductions in bee population score over winter. Seasonal patterns in deformed wing virus (DWV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and Nosema level also differed with the wintering environment. DWV and Nosema levels decreased over winter for indoor-wintered colonies but BQCV did not. Both BQCV and Nosema concentration increased over winter in outdoor-wintered colonies. The mean abundance of Varroa decreased and concentration of Sacbrood virus (SBV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) increased over winter but seasonal patterns were not affected by wintering method. For most viruses, either entrance or brood area samples were reasonable predictors of colony virus load but there were significant season*sample location interactions for Nosema and BQCV, indicating that care must be taken when selecting samples from a single location. For Nosema spp., the fall entrance samples were better predictors of future infestation levels than were fall brood area samples. For indoor-wintered colonies, Israeli acute paralysis virus IAPV concentration was negatively correlated with spring population size. For outdoor-wintered hives, spring Varroa abundance and DWV concentration were positively correlated with bee loss and negatively correlated with spring population size.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a member of the β- herpesvirus sub-family, has the capacity to influence the expression of many host genes in an effort to create an optimal environment for infection. One mechanism utilized by HCMV to alter gene expression is the host RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. This is evidenced by a requirement of host factors to process viral micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and by the dynamic expression of host miRNAs during infection. The work presented in this dissertation demonstrates that productive HCMV infection reprograms host miRNA expression in order to positively influence infection. I was able to identify a cohort of infection-associated host miRNAs whose change in expression during infection was highly significant. Using the enhancer-promoter sequences of this panel of host miRNAs, I statistically enriched for the presence of functional transcription factor binding sites that regulated the expression of two highly conserved clusters of host miRNAs: miR 132 / 212 and miR 143 / 145. Given that inhibiting their infection-associated change in expression during infection was detrimental to viral replication, it suggests that HCMV mechanistically influences the expression of these miRNA clusters. In order to determine the functional relevance of these miRNAs, I assembled a cohort of potential miRNA target genes using gene expression profiles from primary fibroblasts. By statistically enriching for miRNA recognition elements (MRE) in the respective 3 ’-UTR sequences, I generated a miRNA target network that includes thousands of host genes. I evaluated the efficacy of our novel miRNA target prediction algorithm by confirming the functionality of enriched MREs present in the 3 ’-UTR of KRas and by confirming anecdotal miRNA targets from published studies. Gene ontology terms enriched from infection-associated host miRNA target networks suggest that the utility of host miRNAs may extend to multiple host pathways that are required for viral replication. The targeting of multiple miRNAs to shared genes increased the statistical likelihood of target site enrichment. I propose that identifying cooperative miRNA networks is essential to establishing the functional relevance of miRNAs in any context. By combining contextual data on the relative miRNA/mRNA abundance with statistical MRE enrichments, one will be able to more accurately characterize the biological role of miRNAs...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi), or Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS), is {{a biological}} process which uses small RNAs to regulate gene expression on a cellular level, typically by causing {{the destruction of}} specfic mRNA molecules. This biological pathway is found in both plants and animals, {{and can be used}} as an effective strategy in defending cells against <b>parasitic</b> nucleotide sequences, <b>viruses</b> and transposons. In the case of plants, it also constitutes a major component of the adaptive immune system. RNAi is characterised by the ability to induce sequence-specific degradation of target messenger RNA (mRNAs) and methylation of target gene sequences. The small interfering RNA produced within the initiated cell is not only used locally but can also be transported into neighbouring cells, thus acting as a mobile warning signal. In {{the first part of the}} thesis I develop and analyse a new mathematical model of the plant immune response to a viral infection, with particular emphasis on the role of RNA interference. The model explicitly includes two different time delays, one to represent the maturation period of undifferentiated cells, and another to account for the time required for the RNAi propagating signal to reach other parts of the plant, resulting in either recovery or warning of susceptible cells. Analytical and numerical bifurcation theory is used to identify parameter regions associated with recovery and resistant plant phenotypes, as well as possible chronic infections. The analysis shows that the maturation time plays an important role in determining the dynamics, and that long-term host recovery does not depend on the speed of the warning signal but rather on the strength of local recovery. At best, the warning signal can amplify and hasten recovery, but by itself it is not competent at eradicating the infection. In the second part of the thesis I derive and analyse a new mathematical model of plant viral co-infection with particular account for RNA-mediated cross-protection in a single plant host. The model exhibits four non-trivial steady states, i. e. a disease-free steady state, two one-virus endemic equilibria, and a co-infected steady state. I obtained the basic reproduction number for each of the two viral strains and performed extensive numerical bifurcation analysis to investigate the stability of all steady states and identified parameter regions where the system exhibits synergistic or antagonistic interactions between viral strains, as well as different types of host recovery. The results indicate that the propagating component of RNA interference plays a significant role in determining whether both viruses can persist simultaneously, and as such, it controls whether the plant is able to support some constant level of both infections. If the two viruses are sufficiently immunologically related, the least harmful of the two viruses becomes dominant, and the plant experiences cross-protection. In the third part of the thesis I investigate the properties of intracellular dynamics of RNA interference and its capacity as a gene regulator by extending a well known model of RNA interference with time delays. For each of the two amplification pathways of the model, I consider the cumulative effects of delay in dsRNA-primed synthesis associated with the non-instantaneous nature of chemical signals and component transportation delay. An extensive bifurcation analysis is performed to demonstrate the significance of different parameters, and to investigate how time delays can affect the bi-stable regime in the model...|$|R
