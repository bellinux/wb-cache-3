25|$|Operation Spanner in the UK {{proves that}} BDSM {{practitioners}} still {{run the risk}} of being stigmatized as criminals. In 2003, the media coverage of Jack McGeorge showed that simply participating and working in BDSM support groups poses risks to one's job, even in countries where no law restricts it. Here a clear difference can be seen to the situation of homosexuality. The psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public. Nevertheless, it leads to a difficult <b>psychological</b> <b>situation</b> in which the person concerned can be exposed to high levels of emotional stress.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} used {{to know about the}} <b>psychological</b> health <b>situation</b> for middle and primary school {{students}} in Xianning City and provide a certain empirical basis for meaningful development of psychological health education and psychological assistance. This paper uses the MHT scale prepared by Bucheng Zhou professor et al. to conduct a test for 1000 students in 7 middle and primary schools in Xianning City. The detection rate of psychological health problem accounts for 1. 6 % where the positive detection rate of study anxiety ranks first (43. 2 %). The <b>psychological</b> health <b>situations</b> have much difference in sex (t = - 4. 624, P< 0. 001), and it’s lower in male students than female ones. There is {{a significant difference between the}} <b>psychological</b> health <b>situation</b> for only and non-only children (t = - 2. 519, P< 0. 01). There is a significant difference on the <b>psychological</b> health <b>situation</b> for primary school, middle school and high school students (F = 11. 3, P< 0. 001), and the <b>psychological</b> health <b>situation</b> of primary school students is better than that for middle school students.

Literary critic Greg Harris describes her use of historical circumstances and historical source materials as largely, [...] " [...] "true" [...] {{to the extent that the}} lives of the real-life characters, including Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, and Robert Graves, did intertwine." [...] Moreover, Harris argues that Barker accurately captures the <b>psychological</b> <b>situation</b> in which the characters, especially the literary characters, were producing their poetry. French literary critic Marie-Noëlle Provost-Vallet highlights different misinterpretations and anachronistic cultural references supporting a critique of the novel by blogger and critic Esther MacCallum-Stewart.

6000|$|Will our contrary-minded {{correspondent}} {{believe that}} these studies, these finished pictures, which so perfectly [...] "reflect the common life ... of the day," [...] are full of the license, the tinkle, the German divorce of verb and subject, the twisted grammatical sequence which her soul abhors in verse? Crabbe chose for his vehicle the heroic couplet in which English poetry had jog-trotted ever {{since the time of}} Pope, as it often had before; and he made it go as like Pope's couplet as he could, with the same cæsura, the same antithetical balance, the same feats of rhetoric, the same inversions, and the same closes of the sense in each couplet. The most artificial and the most natural poets were at one in their literary convention. Yet such was the freshness of Crabbe's impulse, such his divine authority to deal with material unemployed in English poetry before, that you forget all the affectations of the outward convention, or remember them only for a pleasure in the quaintness of their use for his purposes. How imperishable, anyway, is the interest of things important to the spirit, the fancy, and how largely does this interest lie in the freshness of the mind bringing itself to the things, how little in the novelty of the things! The demand for strangeness in the things themselves is the demand of the sophisticated mind: the mind which has lost its simplicity in the process of continuing unenlightened. It is this demand which betrays the mediocre mind of the Anglo-Saxon race, the sophistication of the English mind, and the obfuscation (which is sophistication at second-hand) of the American mind. The non-imaginative person is nowhere so much at home as in a voluntary exile; and this may be why it was sometime said that travel is the fool's paradise. For such a person to realize anything the terms are that he shall go abroad, either into an alien scene or into a period of the past; then he can begin to have some pleasure. He must first of all get away from himself, and he is not to be blamed for that; any one else would wish to get away from him. His exaction is not a test of merit; it is merely the clew to a <b>psychological</b> <b>situation</b> which is neither so novel nor so important as to require of our hard-worked civilization the production of an order of more inspired criticism than it has worried along with hitherto.|$|E

60|$|The other {{utterance}} {{of the two}} I have {{alluded to}} above consisted in the observation that in this volume of mine the whole was greater than its parts. I {{pass it on to}} my readers merely remarking that if this is really so then I must take it as a tribute to my personality since those stories which by implication seem to hold so well together as to be surveyed en bloc and judged as the product of a single mood, were written at different times, under various influences and with the deliberate intention of trying several ways of telling a tale. The hints and suggestions for all of them had been received at various times and in distant parts of the globe. The book received a good deal of varied criticism, mainly quite justifiable, but in a couple of instances quite surprising in its objections. Amongst them was the critical charge of false realism brought against the opening story: The Planter of Malata. I would have regarded it as serious enough if I had not discovered on reading further that the distinguished critic was accusing me simply of having sought to evade a happy ending out of a sort of moral cowardice, lest I should be condemned as a superficially sentimental person. Where (and of what sort) there {{are to be found in}} The Planter of Malata any germs of happiness that could have fructified at the end I am at a loss to see. Such criticism seems to miss the whole purpose and significance of a piece of writing the primary intention of which was mainly aesthetic; an essay in description and narrative around a given <b>psychological</b> <b>situation.</b> Of more seriousness was the spoken criticism of an old and valued friend who thought that in the scene near the rock, which from the point of view of psychology is crucial, neither Felicia Moorsom nor Geoffrey Renouard find the right things to say to each other. I didn't argue the point at the time, for, to be candid, I didn't feel quite satisfied with the scene myself. On re-reading it lately for the purpose of this edition I have come to the conclusion that there is that much truth in my friend's criticism that I have made those people a little too explicit in their emotion and thus have destroyed to a certain extent the characteristic illusory glamour of their personalities. I regret this defect very much for I regard The Planter of Malata as a nearly successful attempt at doing a very difficult thing which I would have liked to have made as perfect as it lay in my power. Yet considering the pitch and the tonality of the whole tale it is very difficult to imagine what else those two people could have found to say at that time and on that particular spot of the earth's surface. In the mood in which they both were, and given the exceptional state of their feelings, anything might have been said.|$|E

It does not require that one be aware of the relations among these attributes of their significance.|$|R

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{empirical}} evidence for an asymmetry {{in the way}} that adults use positive versus negative information to make sense of their world; specifically, across an array of <b>psychological</b> <b>situations</b> and tasks, adults display a negativity bias, or the propensity to attend to, learn from, and use negative information far more than positive information.

The authors argue for the existence of the negativity bias in early development and that it is evident especially in research on infant social referencing but also in other developmental domains. They discuss ontogenetic mechanisms underlying the emergence of this bias and explore not only its evolutionary but also its developmental functions and consequences.
