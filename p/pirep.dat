The purpose of the report is to summarize the quality of IIDA diagnoses, in anticipation of IIDA’s transition through the D 4 /D 5 decision point of the Aviation Weather Technology Transfer process. The report includes (a) a brief summary of previous evaluations of IIDA and other in-flight icing forecasts and algorithms; (b) results from an intensive evaluation of IIDA diagnoses from winter 2000; and (c) results from ongoing operational verification of IIDA and other icing forecasts by the Forecast System’s Laboratory’s Real-time Verification System (RTVS).

Aircraft receiving traffic information through the TIS-B service will see other aircraft in a manner that is similar to how all aircraft will be seen after they have equipped by 2020. The availability of a non-subscription weather information service, FIS-B, provides general aviation users with a useful alternative to other monthly or annual fee-based services.|$|R

40|$|Although pilots regard pilot weather reports (PIREPs) as {{valuable}} flight planning resources, {{the number of}} PIREPs that pilots submit is relatively small.

In this study the authors attempt to address obstacles to submitting PIREPs by proposing two alternative designs of a cockpit <b>PIREP</b> interface that: (1) provides pilots with the <b>PIREP</b> form, (2) reduces the process of filling it out to a few button presses, and (3) includes a feature by which pilots can request specific weather reports from other pilots.

40|$|As {{the volume}} of small {{unmanned}} aircraft systems (UAS) operations increases, the lack of weather products to support these operations becomes more problematic. One early solution to obtaining more information about weather conditions is to allow operators to share their observations and measurements with other airspace users. This {{is analogous to the}} AIREP and <b>PIREP</b> reporting systems in traditional aviation wherein pilots report weather phenomena they have observed or experienced to provide better situational awareness to other pilots. Given the automated nature of the small (under 55 lbs.) UAS platforms and operations, automated reporting of relevant information should also be supported. To promote automated exchange of these data, a well-defined data schema needs to be established along with the mechanisms for sending and retrieving the data. This paper examines this concept and offers an initial definition of the necessary elements to allow for immediate implementation and use...|$|E
40|$|Pilot weather reports (commonly {{referred}} to as PIREPs) are {{an essential part of}} flight planning and situational awareness for pilots. These reports are provided by pilots to flight services stations for dissemination to other pilots. PIREPs are used during pre-flight planning as well as en route by pilots to make more informed decisions about their flight. In some areas, PIREPs are not available (before or after departure) due to lack of traditional aviation communication infrastructure. With the concept of <b>PIREP</b> compression presented here, multiple PIREPs can be bundled together for a single transmission over throughput-limited channels not typically used for aviation. For example, 10 to 20 compressed PIREPs might be transmitted via a cellular text message and even more might be sent via satellite using this concept, which is an increase of up to 10 times the amount of data. In this paper, the compression algorithm is presented along with some analysis of the loss of information incurred through the compression-decompression cycle. I...|$|E

The other two groups of islands in the Pacific are Melanesia and Polynesia) country in the Pacific. The energy sources utilised in Kiribati include petroleum products, biomass, solar energy and wind power. Solar energy was introduced in Kiribati in the early 1980 s (Wade H. Survey of RESCO projects - prepared for OPRET, Fiji Department of Energy, 2003; p. 36).

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{of positive and}} negative (smooth) turbulence pilot reports (PIREPs) to cloud top height and base is examined in an attempt to determine the relative frequency of turbulence in-cloud, above cloud, below cloud, and in clear air. Since PIREPs usually do not include information on whether the turbulence was encountered in or out of cloud, two different methods for determining where a <b>PIREP</b> was in relation to clouds are compared and presented. Three complete years of PIREPs, sounding data, and Current Icing Potential (CIP, formally known as the Integrated Icing Diagnosis Algorithm, IIDA) are included in the evaluation. The data is broken down into three altitude bands: low (surface- 10, 000 ft), mid (10, 000 ft- 20, 000 ft), and high (20, 000 ft and above), and comparisons are done seasonally as well as annually. Examination of the entire volume of air space shows that smooth turbulence reports are in clear air 20 % of the time and in-cloud 40 % of the time, on average. These values decrease to 15 % and 25 %, respectively, for moderate or greater (MOG) turbulence reports. The vertical distributions show that the majority of in-cloud turbulence occurs at mid-levels while clear air turbulence is more frequent at upper- and low-levels. In addition, the average volume of clouds versus clear air present over the CONUS is also estimated to make the comparisons more meaningful. Using two different methods it is estimated that the annually averaged cloud volume percentage is about 14 % to 18 %...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedVertically propagating waves (VPWs) generated by prominent mountain ridges are a severe hazard to military aircraft operations. Properly forecasting the initiation {{and duration of}} such a phenomenon is critical, yet quite often missed by turbulence forecasters. A primary reason for poor forecast skill is vague VPW forecasting guidelines at the Air Force operational centers, focusing a majority of attention on the less severe, more common trapped lee wave response. The United States Air Forces in Europe Operational Weather Squadron (USAFE OWS) has requested a tool to aid in improving forecast ability of VPW events. Satellite analysis from October 2003 through March 2004 indicated an occurrence of six major VPW events to the lee of the Alps. Actual verification of turbulence in each VPW was unavailable due to the minimal pilot report (<b>PIREP)</b> database kept for military flights over Europe, therefore, a subjective assessment of turbulent conditions was determined depending on the resulting cloud signature. Using NCEP GFS model analysis and upstream upper air soundings during these events, an average synoptic condition and critical weather parameters were created. These developed tools were then tested from October 2004 through March 2005 to prove their reliability. In a limited data set these tools identified all VPW events, with only a 25 % false alarm rate. This is compared to a 6 % forecast ability with 0 % false alarm rate determined during the 2003 - 2004 winter season by USAFE OWS forecasters. These new rules should be valuable in that they will provide a much needed capability for synoptic scale turbulence forecasters to better determine hazardous aviation conditions associated with VPWs.
