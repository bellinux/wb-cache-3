5|$|Kelly pool {{has long}} been {{associated}} with gambling—so much so, that it was made illegal in some municipalities in the US and Canada. In the state of Montana, for example, the <b>playing</b> <b>of</b> kelly pool was punishable by a $25 fine until the law was repealed in 1964. Likewise, the <b>playing</b> <b>of</b> kelly pool was banned in the Canadian province of Manitoba at least as of 1918. Gambling exploits associated with kelly pool were often depicted in Clare Briggs' comic strip of the same name, which centered on the game. The Kelly Pool strip (panel pictured at right), ran in the New York Tribune's sports section from 1912 to 1917.|$|E
5|$|Although he had stated an {{interest}} in playing the trumpet, Marmarosa's parents persuaded him {{to take up the}} piano, which he began at the age of 9. He received classical music lessons, but was influenced by the jazz <b>playing</b> <b>of</b> Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and others after fellow pianist Erroll Garner, four years Marmarosa's elder, introduced him to their music. Marmarosa practiced a lot, until his left and right hands were equally strong.|$|E

40|$|A long-standing open {{question}} {{raised in the}} seminal paper of Kalai and Lehrer (1993) {{is whether or not}} the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> a repeated game, in the rational learning model introduced there, must eventually resemble the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> exact equilibria, and not just the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> approximate equilibria as demonstrated there. This paper shows that play may remain distant – in fact, mutually singular – from the <b>play</b> <b>of</b> any equilibrium of the repeated game.

Beer also became one of Muzio Clementi's pupils while Clementi was in Berlin. The boy made his public debut in 1801 playing Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto in Berlin. The Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung reported: 'The amazing keyboard <b>playing</b> <b>of</b> young Bär (a Jewish lad of 9), who carried off the difficult passages and other solo parts with aplomb, and has fine powers of rendition even more rarely found {{in one of his}} age, made the concert even more interesting'.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the <b>playing</b> <b>of</b> the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E
5|$|Dungeons & Dragons {{has been}} the subject of rumors {{regarding}} players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes.

The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather.
