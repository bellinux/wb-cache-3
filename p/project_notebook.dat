40|$|Abstract. Process {{management}} {{is a method}} for improving Boeing’s business processes, however many aspects {{have been difficult to}} implement. eQuality is a software system based on a framework called DDUCKS that is being designed to support the process management life cycle. We take a knowledge acquisition approach {{to the development of the}} tool, emphasizing the importance of mediating and intermediate knowledge representations. Sharing and reuse of tools, models, and representations is facilitated through a layered architecture. eQuality’s process documentation capability includes a number of views, that can be used either in sketchpad or model mode. Using the views, an integrated business enterprise model may be developed. Analysis and simulation tools supporting process improvement are implemented with attribute, function, and task editors that make use of a user scripting language and extensible function library.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{examined}} how scaffolds and student achievement levels influence inquiry {{and performance in}} a problem-based learning environment. The scaffolds were embedded within a hypermedia program that placed students {{at the center of}} a problem in which they were trying to become the youngest person to fly around the world in a balloon. One-hundred and eleven seventh grade students enrolled in a science and technology course worked in collaborative groups for a duration of 3 weeks to complete a project that included designing a balloon and a travel plan. Student groups used one of three problem-based, hypermedia programs: (1) a no scaffolding condition that did not provide access to scaffolds, (2) a scaffolding optional condition that provided access to scaffolds, but gave students the choice of whether or not to use them, and (3) a scaffolding required condition required students to complete all available scaffolds. Results revealed that students in the scaffolding optional and scaffolding required conditions performed significantly better than students in the no scaffolding condition on one of the two components of the group project. Results also showed that student achievement levels were significantly related to individual posttest scores; higher-achieving students scored better on the posttest than lower-achieving students. In addition, analyses of group notebooks confirmed qualitative differences between stu-dents in the various conditions. Specifically, those in the scaffolding required condition produced more highly organized <b>project</b> <b>notebooks</b> containing a higher percentage of entries directly relevant to the problem. These findings suggest that scaffolds may enhance inquiry and performance, especially when students are required to access and use them...|$|R

40|$|ShovelWare is {{a project}} {{designed}} for an ongoing field research project analyzing the Bronze and Iron Ages of Mongolia. Accessible through a web interface and cross-platform mobile application, it is a replacement for pencil-and-paper data collection and excessive, error-ridden input into digital spreadsheets. In the Mongolia project, pottery, bronze tools, human bones, artifacts tied to burial mounds, monuments, deer stones, rock art, habitation sites, and agricultural animal bones benefit from instant digital recording. Information taking further evaluation includes carbon dating of horse teeth and analysis of carbon, strontium, and oxygen isotopes, however entry into the consolidated project database assists in expediting the process. Features include importation and exportation of existing Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. This enables ShovelWare to blend together data from previous field seasons and provide backups of data. Deploying ShovelWare on smart tablets allows for use of features such as automatic collection of metadata {{in the form of}} GPS coordinates and timestamps; additionally, it allows for access to a camera, microphone, and further features such as computational power and barometric sensors. The management structure hierarchically organizes specific <b>Notebooks</b> within broader <b>Projects.</b> <b>Notebooks</b> hold three forms of notes: Text, Audio, and Photo. Tagging photo notes instantly is superior over captioning photos of artifacts hours or days after recording. Although ShovelWare emphasizes archaeology, the project structures can be used in any discipline. The mobile applications are designed for use in remote places with no internet connectivity, so databases between multiple tablets attempt to locally synchronize before synchronizing with the entire project post-field season. Data storage and project service hosting was accomplished through the use of various AWS services. Along with making internal data sharing amongst a project easier, ShovelWare allows archaeologists to share their findings globally...|$|R

40|$|Computers are now {{essential}} in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught {{the equivalent of}} basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the push for student {{teachers}} to develop competencies in using {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) in teaching and learning has increased. This paper examines the implementation of the Mobile Teaching Facility (MTF) <b>project</b> (wireless <b>notebook</b> computers in trolleys) in the Faculty of Education at Deakin University. The use of these resources has enabled us to be more responsive to the needs of staff and students to effectively incorporate technology into teaching and learning in ways that are contextualised and authentic. The implementation of the MTFs has supported the professional development of staff and students and led to exciting possibilities in using technology to support practice. Not all staff and students are keen to adopt technology that often leads to new thinking about pedagogy and methods to overcome this issue are discussed. Our experience shows that the integration of ICTs into the classroom with a focus on teaching and learning rather then computers themselves, helps support users other than early adopters to participate in the project using these tools. <br /...|$|R

30|$|Collaborative {{problem solving}} environments (CPSE) are another analogy for this concept. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{has a long}} history of {{building}} CPSEs for U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) scientists [17], such as the DOE 2000 Electronic <b>Notebook</b> <b>Project</b> [18] and Velo [19]. Watson [20] reviewed a number of organizations pursuing CPSEs including other DOE sites (e.g., the Common Component Architecture, Collaboratory Interoperability Framework, and Corridor One Project) as well as the U.S. Department of Defense (e.g., Gateway), NASA (e.g., the Intelligent Synthesis Environment, Collaborative Engineering Environment, and Science Desk) and numerous university efforts (Rutgers University’s Distributed System for Collaborative Information Processing and Learning, the University of Michigan’s Space Physics and Aeronomy Research Collaboratory, and Stanford's Interactive Workspaces). Shaffer [21], in his position statement on CPSEs, defined them as a “system that provides an integrated set of high level facilities to support groups engaged in solving problems from a proscribed domain.” These facilities – for example, components to enable three-dimensional molecular visualization for biologists – are most often directly related to the domain.|$|R
40|$|This is the {{beginning}} of a larger <b>project,</b> a <b>notebook</b> of sorts intended to clarify, elucidate, and/or illustrate the principal ideas in A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology. Many of the “worthwhile exercises ” suggested in the text will be done in relatively complete detail, one-line proofs expanded, constructions illustrated, and definitions given as assertions that a certain diagram commutes (which, when I try to explain to my friends, I am walked away from) given explanations anyway. The bulk of this paper focuses on the categorical intuition that the book assumes, with the concepts illustrated in the category of topological spaces. Following that is a careful illustration of a proof that well illustrates the utility of such intuition, which I first presented as part of a directed reading program during the previous academic year. This paper concludes with a list of currently intended illustrations for chapters 5 - 10, which will be added to a working version of this document as they are done. p. 16, on limits and colimits in Top and Grp At this point, anyone who hasn’t seen category theory before will probably be utterly despondent. Some pictures will help. We’ll do the product and coproduct, initial and terminal object, equalizer and coequalizer, pullback and pushout in the categories of topological spaces and of groups – these are the most important examples, and in practice the only ones that come up all that often. Let’s start with the product in Top. Remember, in this category the objects are topological spaces, and the arrows are continuous maps between spaces. Effectively, with the product we start with a collection of unrelated topological spaces. We want the limit of this collection, and assert that it is their Cartesian product endowed with the product topology, along with the canonical projection maps onto each coordinate...|$|R
50|$|The second {{argument}} advanced against Open Notebook Science {{is that it}} constitutes prior publication, {{thus making}} it impossible to patent and difficult to publish the results in the traditional peer reviewed literature. With respect to patents, publication on the web is clearly classified as disclosure. Therefore, while there may be arguments over the value of patents, and approaches that get around this problem, it is clear that Open Notebook Science is not appropriate for research for which patent protection is an expected and desired outcome. With respect to publication in the peer reviewed literature the case is less clear cut. Most publishers of scientific journals accept material that has previously been presented at a conference or {{in the form of a}} preprint. Those publishers that accept material that has been previously published in these forms have generally indicated informally that web publication of data, including Open Notebook Science, falls into this category. Open <b>notebook</b> <b>projects</b> have been successfully published in high impact factor peer reviewed journals but this has not been tested with a wide range of publishers. It is to be expected that those publishers that explicitly exclude these forms of pre-publication will not accept material previously disclosed in an open notebook.|$|R
40|$|Written, {{edited and}} {{published}} in a networked environment, the networked book makes the process of collaboration between its authors and readers visible. This collaboration is recorded in the peripheries of the text through a record of interactions, shared ideas, conversations and annotations and {{becomes part of the}} book. The presence of this documentation of the collaborative process challenges the traditionally held positions of author and reader and produces a new form of collaborative work. The divisions between the author, reader and the text become blurred as the book in the networked environment moves from being a physical product and the process of its creation becomes a collaborative experience. Authorship becomes an activity of exchange as the networked book champions the idea that multiple authors can take part in textual production. 	This thesis uses Gerard Genette’s theory of paratextual analysis to examine in depth the peripheries of three networked books; A Million Penguins, The Golden <b>Notebook</b> <b>Project</b> and Paddlesworth Press. It argues that the paratexts of the networked book are where the dialogues between authors and readers are located and an in depth examination of these is crucial for an understanding of how the process of their collaboration is made visible. Using this approach, the thesis examines and identifies the thresholds between author, reader and text. The text of each of the three case studies is examined as a space where authors and readers communicate through an analysis of behaviour, an identification of roles and a consideration of hierarchies in the collaborative process. The thresholds, boundaries, freedoms and restrictions of both the author and reader positions are explored. The collaborative experience of textual production is one of multiplicity; there is no one author, reader or text and the thesis concludes that a networked book is a book about the dialogue between author and reader and that these dialogues become part of the book...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{notebooks}} are {{documents that}} serve dual purposes: {{they serve as}} an archive format containing code, text, images and equations; {{but they can also}} be run like computer programs. This paper explores the use of these new computational notebooks to teach AI and introduces tools that we have developed — ICalico and Calysto — to facilitate that use. Not only do these new tools broaden the languages and contexts available to students exploring notebook-based AI computing, but they offer a new mode of teaching and learning for the AI classroom. A computational notebook is a document that can be read like a journal paper and run like a computer program. Al-though the idea is not new, the computational notebook ap-proach has just recently begun to be widely adopted by com-puter science educators. For example, Peter Norvig recently shared notebooks on the web presenting topics in Artifi-cial Intelligence such as the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP, see Figure 1). A new computational notebook system, called Jupyter (Pérez and Granger, 2007), is being devel-oped and appears to be an excellent medium for teaching many topics, especially AI. This paper explores the use of these new computational notebooks to teach AI and intro-duces tools that we have developed — ICalico and Calysto — to facilitate that use. Not only do these new tools broaden the languages and contexts available to students exploring notebook-based AI computing, but they offer a new mode of teaching and learning for the AI classroom.
