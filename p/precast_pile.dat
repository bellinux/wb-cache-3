A 3 D finite element model (FEM) is utilised for interpreting five TRTs by inverse modelling. The calibrated estimates of soil and concrete thermal conductivity are consistent with independent laboratory measurements. Due to the computational cost of inverting the 3 D model, simpler models are utilised in additional calibrations. Interpretations based on semi-empirical pile G-functions yield soil thermal conductivity estimates statistically similar to those obtained from the 3 D FEM inverse modelling, given minimum testing times of 60 hours. Reliable estimates of pile thermal resistance can only be obtained from type curves computed with 3 D FEM models.

Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZM Bridge) {{is located}} in the LingDing Sea area outside the Pearl River estuary, where the hydrological and meteorological are very complex. Because the effective operating time was short and environmental protection requirements were high, the bridge construction is very difficult. For this feature, the method of non-navigable pier construction was used factory prefabrication and on-site installation. Unlike the traditional way of the bridge pier construction, this method can greatly shorten the time to operations at sea, by which all piers will be prefabricated in the factory and these will be only installed at the on-site. The construction of water stop between precast cap and steel pipe pile is the key aspects, and also one of the main focuses.

The lengths of these tested piles were 24. 7 m, 26. 6 m and 28 m with the same cross-section. The soil was removed before these piles {{were placed in the}} required location. The horizontal and vertical movements of these piles under cycling loading and progressive loading were investigated through static load tests. Furthermore, six pairs of vibration wire strain gauges were welded in one pile which was applied with uplift loading for load transfer observation and shaft resistance analysis. Results suggest that the critical and ultimate loads of lateral loaded piles and ultimate loads of uplift loaded piles increase with the pile length, and in the pile with the welded gauges, that the axial force decreases with depth along the pile, increasing with applied loads provided by hydraulic jacks. In addition, the distribution of unit shaft resistances is determined and the propagations of friction resistances are analyzed. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|The {{direct costs}} of bridge construction, such as materials, labor, and {{equipment}} are all well known. Recently however the indirect costs {{such as the}} cost of traffic disruptions, and construction safety are beginning to be factored into design decisions. These new considerations have led the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to explore Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC), which is also known as a ?get in, get out, stay out? approach to bridge construction and replacement. Accelerated Bridge Construction is defined as replacement, or new bridge construction that uses design and construction methods to minimize impacts to the traveling public, river traffic, railroads, and the environment ? all while maintaining high levels of quality and safety. In other words, make bridge construction faster, and safer, while also making bridges last longer by using modern technology. This project focuses on one approach to ABC construction, using more precast elements, in an attempt to move towards an all precast bridge. Precast elements are fabricated offsite, in a controlled environment, and shipped to the project, where a crane is used to place them. Systems being examined in this project include precast stay?inplace forms for short to medium span bridges, and <b>precast</b> <b>pile</b> bent caps. Both of these systems can be used to dramatically reduce the amount of cast?in?place concrete on a typical bridge project. For the precast stay?in?place formwork system, this report first examines current practices of using precast concrete and bridges, and then identifies possible precast sections for further study in the proposed system. Double?T beam sections are identified for further study, next a series of analyses are run to identify a group of characteristics that would make a newly designed section more efficient. Using these characteristics, a new Channel section is designed, and analyzed against the Double?T section, the new section is found to offer a broader span range, and is designed to reduce several key 12 maintenance issues prevalent in adjacent member bridges. A list of recommendations for further study and discussion on this topic is included. Also included in this report is a construction study done on a bridge near Reynolds Wisconsin which used <b>precast</b> <b>pile</b> bent caps. The report follows the project from the precasting of the pile caps at County Materials in Roberts Wisconsin, to the placement and connection of caps to the piles, in Reynolds Wisconsin.

Throughout this development, much has been learned and has resulted in Iowa being viewed as a national leader {{in the area of}} ABC. However, at this time, the Office of Bridges and Structures does not have a complete set of working standards nor design examples to accompany ABC portions of the bridge design manual (now called the Load and Resistance Factor Design/LRFD Bridge Design Manual). During the fall of 2013, the Iowa DOT constructed a bridge on IA 92 in Cass County using an ABC technique known as slide-in bridge construction. During the design of the Cass County Bridge, several questions were raised about the performance of critical design and construction details: the pile-to-pile cap connection and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated bearing pads on which the bridge would slide. The timing of this specific need and the initiation of this project offered a unique opportunity to provide significant short- and long-term value to the Office of Bridges and Structures. Several full-scale laboratory tests, which included several variations of the pile-to-pile cap connection and bearing pad slides, were completed. These tests proved that the connection was capable of achieving the desired capacity and that the expected coefficient of friction of the bearing pads was reasonably low.

40|$|Pile heat {{exchangers}} are fast {{emerging as a}} potentially viable alternative to the more prevalent borehole {{heat exchangers}} {{for the provision of}} space heating and cooling. In the last decade or so, the use of geothermal piles has increased sharply in many countries including Belgium, China, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States, among others. In Sweden, however, interest in geothermal piles has been surprisingly scant. This is despite {{the fact that most of}} the infrastructure and buildings in Sweden are founded on piled foundations. Early estimates suggest that approximately 75 % of heating requirements and 90 % of cooling requirements of a typical Swedish office building could be provided by geothermal piles. Initial studies also indicate quick payback and large carbon savings. On the other hand, as several Swedish cities are founded in areas with very soft soil conditions with high groundwater tables, there are concerns that pile heat exchangers with cyclic thermal loading could trigger excessive creep deformations. Most of the Swedish research on geothermal piles and cyclic thermal loading dates back to 1980 s. Today, both analysis and test methods for understanding soft clay behaviour have improved significantly. Hence, there is a need to revisit the topic of cyclic heating and cooling of Swedish soft clays to fully understand the implications of the use of geothermal piles. This project, funded by Swedish Energy Agency, has dealt with the development of mathematical models for thermal modelling of geothermal piles in Swedish soft clay conditions. The new models include a method to determine the thermal impact of the building on the underlying pile heat exchangers, and calculation methods to evaluate the thermal resistance of the pile heat exchangers. An existing borehole model has also been updated for modelling of irregular configurations of geothermal piles. The mathematical models developed in this project can be implemented in any computer code to be incorporated in existing building energy simulation software. The models can also be used to develop controllers and control schemes to maximize the performance of pile heat exchangers. The project has also demonstrated the application of driven steel and <b>precast</b> <b>pile</b> heat exchangers in Swedish soft clays and has established the importance of acquiring in-situ measurements to determine key design parameters.
