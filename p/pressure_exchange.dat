50|$|By {{means of}} the {{application}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> system, which is already used in other domains, a considerably higher efficiency of energy recovery of reverse osmosis systems may be achieved than with the use of reverse running pumps or turbines.The <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> system is suited, above all, for bigger plants i.e. approx. â‰¥ 2000 m3/d permeate production.|$|E
50|$|An example where a <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> engine finds {{application}} {{is in the}} production of potable water using the reverse osmosis membrane process. In this process, a feed saline solution is pumped into a membrane array at high pressure. The input saline solution is then divided by the membrane array into super saline solution (brine) at high pressure and potable water at low pressure. While the high pressure brine is no longer useful in this process as a fluid, the pressure energy that it contains has high value. A <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> engine is employed to recover the pressure energy in the brine and transfer it to feed saline solution. After transfer of the pressure energy in the brine flow, the brine is expelled at low pressure to drain.|$|E

40|$|Nastic {{structures}} are potentially high-energy density smart materials {{that will be}} capable of achieving controllable deformation and shape change due to internal microactuation that functions on principles found in the biological process of nastic motion. In plants, nastic motion is accomplished through osmotic pressure changes causing a respective increase or decrease in cell volume, thereby causing net movement. In nastic structures, osmotic pressure is increased by moving fluid from low concentration to high concentration areas by means of active transport, powered by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Power analysis involves calculating possible ranges of actuation {{as a result of}} interior <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanges</b> and hydraulic flux rates which will determine the speed of actuation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by a long-range goal of developing {{a new class of}} turbomachine where fluid impellers, created through supersonic wave structures, replace mechanical impellers. This paper is an exploratory study to show how effectively supersonic wave structures can fulfill this goal, and to provide some fundamental insight as to the behavior. A comparison, at a fundamental level, of the spectrum of flow induction devices from mechanical turbomachinery to direct flow induction including steady flow ejectors, wave rotors, and <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> devices is explored. While the authors have been studying various flow induction devices intended to lead to practical solutions, the details of the flow interactions are obscured by geometries and the complex interactions. This paper attempts to take a step backward and look at the simplest conceivable model that demonstrates the phenomena thought to be the key to a new technology. This model is a crypto-steady supersonic <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> process occurring behind a supersonic frictionless semi-infinite flat plate having a pressure differential between both sides of the plate. It is found that very high compressor efficiencies and energy transfer rates are possible even with the presence of supersonic flow structure. Because of the high efficiencies, the analysis shows that there is a potential {{for the development of a}} new generation of direct flow induction devices far simpler and more compact than conventional turbomachinery, yet far more efficient than conventional ejectors and wave rotors. Fundamental information is provided which will facilitate exploiting supersonic <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> in practical crypto-steady flow induction devices.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{there is an}} upsurge in foreign capital flows to {{developing}} economies, particularly into emerging markets. One view argues that capital inflows do help to increase efficiency, a better allocation of capital and to fill up the investment-saving gap. Adherents to that view advise countries to launch capital account liberalisation. In this study, we investigate the effects of capital inflows on domestic price level, monetary expansion and exchange rate volatility. To proceed with this, linear and nonlinear cointegration and Granger causality tests are applied in a bi-variate {{as well as in}} multivariate framework. The key message of the analysis {{is that there is a}} significant inflationary impact of capital inflows, in particular during the last 7 years. The finding suggest that there is a need to manage the capital inflows in such a way that they should neither create an inflationary pressure in the economy nor fuel the exchange rate volatility.

40|$|MIng (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 In {{the process}} of {{electricity}} generation, water is used as the working fluid to transport energy from the fuel to the turbine. This water has to be ultrapure {{in order to reduce}} maintenance cost on the boilers. For the production of ultrapure water, a desalination process is used. This process consists of an ultrafiltration pretreatment section, two reverse osmosis stages and a continuous electrodeionisation stage. Reverse osmosis desalination plants are, however, inherently inefficient with a high specific energy consumption. In an attempt to improve the efficiency of low recovery seawater applications, energy recovery devices are installed on the brine outlet of the reverse osmosis stages. The energy recovery device recovers the energy that is released through the high pressure brine stream and reintroduces it to the system. The investigated desalination process has a fresh water feed with a salinity of 71 ppm and is operated at recoveries above 85 %. The plant produces demineralised water at a salinity lower than 0. 001 ppm for the purpose of high pressure boiler feed. A thermodynamic analysis determined the Second Law efficiencies for the first and second reverse osmosis sections as 3. 85 % and 3. 68 % respectively. The specific energy consumption for the reverse osmosis plants is 353 Wh/m 3 and 1. 31 Wh/m 3. This was used as the baseline for the investigation. An exergy analysis determined that energy is lost through the brine throttling process and that a <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanging</b> system can be installed on all reverse osmosis brine streams. Energy recovery devices are untested in high recovery fresh water applications due to the low brine pressure and low brine flow. It was determined that <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanging</b> systems can reduce the specific energy consumption of the first reverse osmosis stage with 12. 2 % whereas the second RO stage energy consumption can be improved with 7. 7 %. The Second Law efficiency can be improved by 25. 6 % for the first reverse osmosis stage while the efficiency is improved with 18. 1 % for the second stage. The optimal operating recovery for the PES is between 80 % and 90 %. Master...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a political economy model of exchange rate policy. The theory {{is based on}} a common agency approach with rational expectations. Financial and exporter lobbies exert political pressures to influence the governmentâ€™s choice of exchange rate policy, before shocks to the economy are realized. The model shows that political <b>pressures</b> affect <b>exchange</b> rate policy and create an over-commitment to exchange rate stability. This helps to rationalize the empirical evidence on fear of large currency swings that characterizes exchange rate policy of many emerging market economies. Moreover, the model suggests that the effects of political <b>pressures</b> on the <b>exchange</b> rate are lower if the quality of institutions is higher. Empirical evidence for a large sample of emerging market economies is consistent with these findings. exporters and financial lobbies, exchange rate stability...|$|R

40|$|Currencies can {{be under}} severe pressure, {{but in a}} managed {{exchange}} rate regime that is not fully visible via {{the change in the}} exchange rate. The literature has proposed a way to measure such exchange market pressure (EMP) indirectly, by adding interest rate changes and forex interventions to the exchange rate change. We demonstrate that this measure is not consistent with the definition of EMP and develop a new measure that is consistent. This is first derived within the commonly used monetary exchange rate model. Then we generalize the analysis by avoiding the use of an exchange rate model. We find that the interest rate should not be taken in the first-difference form used so far, but rather in level form and relative to the interest rate chosen if the country had no exchange rate objective. Applications on the European Monetary System and East Asian crises confirm that this improvement is highly relevant in practice.

40|$|Abstract. Movable {{thin film}} {{membrane}} {{is one of}} the crucial part in a thermal actuated micropump development that acts as actuator to control the fluid flow. The working principle of this device is due to <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> produced by thermal expansion of air in an isolated chamber. In this paper a deformation analysis of actuator membrane deposited on silicon substrate using Finite Element Analysis (FEM) is reported. The analysis is aimed to study the mechanical and physical behavior of the actuator structure. Parameters such as shape, size, dimension, material and thickness of the membrane are studied to find the optimum design. Correlation between the pressure and membrane structure are also observed. Simulation results show that circular membrane shape gives the largest deflection due to the lowest stress on its edges compared with other shapes of membrane at the same pressure. It is also found that membrane deformation decreases with the increasing of the thickness. However, only suitable deformation will be chosen for the pump application due to the limited chamber space. Comparisons at four types of membrane materials in this analysis indicate that polyimide has the largest deflection. Furthermore, polyimide shows the best capability to handle very hot temperatures since its melting point is very high. It is also elastic, robust and easy to fabricate. From the results, an appropriate membrane parameter selection are important in designin...|$|E
40|$|EGU General Assembly 2011, 3 - 8 Abril 2011, Viena (Austria) Spatial {{heterogeneity}} of hydraulic conductivity {{can lead to}} anomalous behaviour in the pressure response to hydraulic stimulation. The classical interpretation framework of Theis, based on a homogeneous bi-dimensional equivalent medium is well known, but cannot describe the anomalous pressure behavior observed in nature. In order to explain anomalous behaviours with a physical meaningful model we considered a double permeability model. The model is constituted by two layers characterized by different hydraulic parameters, which constitute the mobile and immobile zone. Unlike the Barenblatt model (1960), which assumes quasi-steady pressure distribution in the mobile and immobile zone, we choose a non-equilibrium approach of kinetic <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> between mobile and immobile zones. We obtain a temporally non-local governing equation for the hydraulic head that can model observed sub-diffusive drawdown behavior. We compare our model to the Theis model (1935) and the fractional flow models by Barker (1988) and Acuna and Yortsos (1995). We derive solutions for 1, 2 and 3 dimensions and apply them to the experimental data of pumping tests performed in a highly fractured aquifer (La Borgne, 2004). The Theis model clearly fails to explain the observed hydraulic variation, in particular the sub-diffusive trend of drawdown. The proposed double permeability model can explain the data of the drowdawn curves {{and the evolution of}} the characteristic drawdown time and the characteristic drawdown amplitude with the distance from the pumping well.

40|$|The natrolite {{family of}} zeolites {{undergoes}} volume expansion under pressure. Natrolite {{itself is a}} three dimensionally porous zeolite with 8 -ring channels. It shows an unusual unit cell volume expansion when under hydrostatic pressure where it undergoes two distinct, reversible phase transitions to paranatrolite and then super-hydrated natrolite. The behaviour of gallosilicate natrolite, a synthetic analogue of the aluminosilicate mineral, was investigated in this thesis. Two forms exist, orthorhombic (as per the mineral) and tetragonal. These two forms have been synthesised and structurally characterised by powder neutron diffraction and synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques at ambient pressure to elucidate details of the ordering. In addition, high pressure neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction data have been collected on both the tetragonal and the orthorhombic forms. These data confirm pressure-induced hydration and pore swelling in both the gallosilicate materials, {{as seen in the}} aluminosilicate form but at much lower pressures. The neutron data has also allowed a full study of the changes in hydrogen-bonding in the normal and superhydrated states. The natrolite family will not normally undergo ambient ion-exchange due to the small pores and the strongly bound framework cations. Exploitation of the pressure-induced state offered a high pressure ion-exchange route, with trapping of large exchanged cations upon pressure release. Ion exchange investigations using the aluminosilicate and gallosilicate natrolites have provided the first evidence of high pressure cation trapping. Exposure to a saturated CsCl solution at a pressure of 1 GPa and a temperature of 100 Â°C led to cesium trapping within the framework upon pressure release. Back-exchange treatment in a sodium chloride reflux did not leach the trapped cesium. For the aluminosilicate natrolite up to 33 % Na/Cs exchange was trapped within the framework via this high <b>pressure</b> <b>exchange</b> method.
