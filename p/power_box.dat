Girlschool were opening act for Heaven & Hell in 2007, for Dio in 2008 and for Hawkwind and Motörhead in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{signal box}} at Leamington {{saw the first}} {{conventional}} use of British Rail Solid State Interlocking (SSI) in 1985 when control was transferred from the original Leamington North mechanical box to a new <b>power</b> <b>box</b> situated nearby. In 2006 trials of the new Westinghouse Rail Systems Westlock Interlocking commenced, which replaced the old SSI completely in 2008. The signal box now covers an area from a point near Warwick to Little Bourton, just north of Banbury railway station.|$|E
25|$|On 7 October 1957, the {{signalling}} at St Pancras was upgraded, {{replacing the}} three original boxes with a <b>power</b> <b>box</b> controlling 205 route switches and 33 points over {{a network of}} 1,400 relays. From 1960 to 1966, electrification work on the West Coast Main Line between London and Manchester saw a new Midland Pullman from Manchester to St Pancras. These trains and those to Glasgow were withdrawn following {{the completion of the}} rebuilding of Euston and the consolidation of these services.|$|E

This part of the 'Old Station' building is currently in use as a car park, but will be remodelled as terminating platforms for services to London Paddington.

25|$|Hamilton led Vettel by 24 seconds by {{the next}} lap and {{wanted to make a}} pit stop because he was worried his tyres would fail but was advised to further extend his {{advantage}} over the following three laps. Hamilton made his final pit stop of the race on lap 52 for the soft compound tyres. He rejoined in second behind Vettel and narrowly ahead of Ricciardo. Hamilton quickly caught Vettel, used DRS leaving turn five, and passed him around the inside to reclaim the lead two corners later on lap 54. Button stopped his car {{at the side of the}} track with a <b>power</b> <b>box</b> failure on the same lap, ending his race. His retirement promoted Räikkönen into seventh and Bottas became slower because of his worn tyres, enabling Hülkenberg, Vergne and Pérez to run close behind him. Maldonado's aspiration for his first point of the season was not realised when Magnussen passed him for tenth place on lap 56. Three laps later, Hülkenberg was passed by Vergne for eighth position. Vergne moved into sixth after overtaking Räikkönen around the inside entering the first corner and Bottas shortly afterwards. Pérez had superior traction than teammate Hülkenberg and passed him between turns 17 and 18.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Mitsubishi introduced one year ahead of schedule a device called MiEV <b>Power</b> <b>Box</b> that enables the i-MiEV to supply power to home electric appliances {{in the event of a}} power outage or natural disasters. The device provides 100-volt outlets, converting the i-MiEV's direct current (DC) battery power into 100 volts alternating current (AC) to power up to 1,500 watts of small electrical equipment. Mitsubishi estimates that the i-MiEV total battery capacity is enough to provide power for between 5 and 6 hours, equivalent to one day of power consumed by an average Japanese home. [...] The device was scheduled to be available by the end of April 2012, at a cost of [...] (...) but as of November 2013 it is not clear if this is widely available.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the track, points and signals were also replaced and the 1967 <b>power</b> <b>box</b> closed – control being {{handed over to the}} signalling centre at [...] [...] The most visible change to passengers, however, was the replacement of the 1967 metal canopy with a new glass roof, considerably increasing the amount of daylight on the platforms. A new footbridge was also provided, replacing the previous underpass. Ancillary improvements included a new multi-storey car park and railway station entrance, refurbishing the North Concourse and expanding retail facilities.|$|E

50|$|In Dead Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a figure code-named Vandal, a newly converted Unitologist, {{on a mission}} in the mines of Titan Station, orbiting Saturn. Vandal is directed over a headset to destroy a series of <b>power</b> <b>boxes,</b> thus cutting off communications to {{certain parts of the}} station. After doing so, however, Vandal is attacked by a group of Necromorphs and forced to flee towards a tram system. On the way there, the head of Unitology, Daina Le Guin, tells Vandal that destroying the <b>power</b> <b>boxes</b> has released a Necromorph infestation onto the station and that Vandal's death, and the deaths of all the miners, will be a glorious event. Disgusted, Vandal decides to reveal the Unitologists' plans to the government, as they are quite clearly insane. Meanwhile, the station's director, Hans Tiedemann, contacts Vandal and orders the restoration of all quarantine seals. After doing so, Vandal is contacted by Tyler Radikov, a Unitologist contact, who swears that Le Guin duped him too, and that {{he had no idea what}} Vandal's real mission was. Radikov promises to guide Vandal in escaping.|$|R

Nor can a fighter just rush their adversary. A quick redirection will send a charging opponent off the stage. And falling off can hurt, so fighters must deal with an added psychological factor when they approach the edge. Like Japanese Sumo, a fighter must stand their ground. Falling out-of-bounds constitutes a loss.|$|R

50|$|Many interurbans did {{substantial}} freight business. In 1926, the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway moved 57,000 ST of freight per month. By 1929, {{this had}} risen to 83,000 ST per month. During the 1920s freight revenue helped offset the loss of passenger business to automobiles. A typical interurban freight train consisted of a <b>powered</b> <b>box</b> motor pulling one to four freight cars. These often operated at night as local ordinances forbade daytime freight operation on city streets. Interurban freight in the Midwest was so extensive that Indianapolis constructed a very large freight handling warehouse which all of Indianapolis' seven interurbans companies used.|$|R
5000|$|Two more coaches without {{separate}} smoking compartments {{were purchased}} in 1915. These coaches had less powerful [...] traction motors and were incapable {{of the speed}} required for express service. They were used exclusively for the slower schedules making local stops. <b>Powered</b> <b>box</b> express cars operated as extra trains making two round trips daily handling {{less than carload freight}} including cans of raw milk from rural dairy farms to a Portland milk processor. The Baldwin electric locomotive ran on these extra runs with a PLI boxcar when there were a few PLI stock cars of cattle or bulky loads for PLI's ten flatcars.|$|R
