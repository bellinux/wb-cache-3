30|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> are {{fundamentally}} different from conventional plates [2, 3, 5]. The biomechanical properties of <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> are, more appropriately, likened to external fixators than traditional plates and screws [5, 17]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> rely on fixed angle screws to provide stability rather than the friction between the plate and bone generated by screw torque [17]. This intrinsic dissimilarity makes conventional <b>plates</b> and <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> suited for use in different clinical scenarios [3, 18]. Conventional plates are ideal for achieving union through primary bone healing, with precise reduction, interfragmentary compression and rigid fixation [5, 17, 18]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> {{on the other hand}} are better suited for providing elastic fixation that result in secondary fracture healing with callus formation [3, 5, 17, 18].|$|R
30|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>plate</b> {{biomechanics}} are {{distinctly different}} from conventional <b>plating.</b> When <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> principles are not adhered to, non-unions and fixation failure may result. The salvage for these cases {{can be difficult}} as broken metalware, bony destruction and deformity is encountered frequently. This treatment strategy using a hexapod circular external fixator provides the option of gradual reduction of deformities together with stable fixation that allows immediate functional rehabilitation.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Axial {{dynamization}} of fractures {{can promote}} healing, and overly stiff fixation can suppress healing. A novel technology, termed active plating, provides controlled axial dynamization by the elastic suspension of locking holes within the plate. This prospective, controlled animal study evaluated {{the effect of}} active plates on fracture-healing in an established ovine osteotomy model. We hypothesized that symmetric axial dynamization with active plates stimulates circumferential callus and delivers faster and stronger healing relative to standard <b>locking</b> <b>plates.</b> METHODS: Twelve sheep {{were randomly assigned to}} receive a standard <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> or an active <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> for stabilization of a 3 -mm tibial osteotomy gap. The only difference between <b>plates</b> was that <b>locking</b> holes of active plates were elastically suspended, allowing up to 1. 5 mm of axial motion at the fracture. Fracture-healing was analyzed weekly on radiographs. After sacrifice at nine weeks postoperatively, callus volume and distribution were assessed by computed tomography. Finally, to determine their strength, healed tibiae and contralateral tibiae were tested in torsion until failure. RESULTS: At each follow-up, the active <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group had more callus (p < 0. 001) than the standard <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group.

30|$|A {{previous}} study at our institution looked at giant cell tumor defects in distal femurs reconstructed {{with three different}} techniques—intramedullary Steinmann pins, crossed screws, and <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> constructs [6].

The <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group was 43 and 53  % stiffer than the intramedullary pin group and the crossed pin group, respectively. The failures noted in the <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group were extra-articular, which as previously stated by Toy et al., is desirable compared to intra-articular failures [13]. The <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> were hypothesized to be stronger because they transferred the load from the joint surface to the intact femoral shaft more effectively than the other groups.

This review was conducted to compile evidence that <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> and screws improve fixation of fragility fractures. A search of PubMed was performed to identify biomechanical studies as well as clinical series of fragility fractures treated with <b>locking</b> <b>plates.</b> Biomechanics papers had to use models of osteoporotic bone and had to directly compare <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> with traditional plates. Clinical studies included case series in which <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> were applied to elderly patients with fractures of the proximal humerus and periprosthetic distal femur fractures. Most studies are retrospective case series. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> lead to greater stability and higher loads to failure than traditional plates. When applied to proximal humerus fractures, uncomplicated healing occurs in 85 % of patients. Constant and Dash scores approach normal values. For distal femoral periprosthetic fractures, union rates of 75 % are reported with a malunion rate of 10 %. Early evidence suggests that <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> improve results of treatment of proximal humerus fractures and distal femoral periprosthetic fractures in the elderly.

As design variant of classic <b>locked</b> <b>plates,</b> the polyaxial <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> has the ability to alter the screw angle and thereby, enhance fracture fixation. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate clinical and radiographic results in 89 patients with 90 fractures of the distal femur treated, between June 2006 and November 2011, with such a polyaxial <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> system (Polyax™ <b>Locked</b> <b>Plating</b> System, DePuy, Warsaw, IN, USA). Seventy-seven fractures formed the report of this study. These cases were followed up until complete fracture healing or for a mean time of 77  weeks. At the time of last follow-up, 58 of 77 fractures (75.3  %) progressed to union without complication and radiographic healing occurred at a mean time of 16.3  weeks. Complications occurred in ten fractures that did not affect the healing and in nine fractures that showed delayed or non-union. The mean American Knee Society Score at the time of final follow-up was 83 for the Knee Score and 71.1 for the Functional Score. In conclusion, there is a high union rate for complex distal femoral fractures associated with a good clinical outcome in this series.|$|R

30|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> technology for periarticular distal femur fracture fixation {{led to the}} design of a similar fixation construct for the proximal lateral tibia [17, 18]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> function as internal fixators with the locking screws creating a fixed angle construct providing angular stability. The fixed angle nature of the <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> circumvents the need for additional medial stabilization, reducing the risk of injury to medial soft tissues [19]. Some literature has suggested that the use of <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> technology to be biomechanically equivalent to the historical control of double plating [20 – 22], with the advantage of less soft tissue dissection. Numerous studies have reported successful outcomes with the use of single lateral <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> fixation of complex bicondylar tibial plateau fractures [9, 20, 23 – 26]. Concerns arise when there is significant metaphyseal comminution for a long segment or with certain patterns of medial articular involvement that may not be adequately supported by the trajectory of fixation from a solely laterally based implant.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Locked</b> bridge <b>plating</b> {{relies on}} {{secondary}} bone healing, which requires interfragmentary motion for callus formation. This study evaluated healing of fractures stabilized with a <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct and a far cortical locking construct, {{which is a}} modified <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> approach that promotes interfragmentary motion. The study tested whether far cortical locking constructs can improve fracture-healing compared with standard <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs. Methods: In an established ovine tibial osteotomy model with a 3 -mm gap size, twelve osteotomies were randomly stabilized with <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> or far cortical locking constructs applied medially. The far cortical locking constructs were designed to provide 84 % lower stiffness than the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs and permitted nearly parallel gap motion. Fracture-healing was monitored on weekly radiographs. After the animals were killed at week 9, healed tibiae were analyzed by computed tomography, mechanical testing in torsion, and histological examination. Results: Callus on weekly radiographs was greater in the far cortical locking constructs than in the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs. At week 9, the far cortical locking group had a 36 % greater callus volume (p = 0. 03) and a 44 % higher bone mineral content (p = 0. 013) than the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> group. Callus in the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> specimens was asymmetric, having 49 % less bonemineral content in the medial callus than in the lateral callus (p = 0. 003).

40|$|Background: <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> {{transmit}} load through fixed-angle locking screws instead {{of relying on}} plate-to-bone compression. Therefore, locking screws may induce higher stress at the screw-bone interface than that seen with con-ventional nonlocked plating.

It further investigated the effect of replacing the locked end screwwith a conventional screw {{on the strength of}} the fixation construct. Methods: Three different bridge-plate constructs were applied to a validated surrogate of the osteoporotic femoral diaphysis.

A <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct was compared with a nonlocked conventional plating construct.

40|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> are {{increasingly}} used to surgically treat proximal humerus fractures. Knowledge {{of the bone}} quality of the proximal humerus is important. Studies have shown the medial and dorsal aspects of the proximal humeral head to have the highest bone strength, and this should be exploited by fixation techniques, particularly in elderly patients with osteoporosis. The goals of surgery for proximal humeral fractures should involve minimal soft tissue dissection and achieve anatomic reduction of the head complex with sufficient stability to allow for early shoulder mobilization.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether one can achieve stable fixation of a two column (transverse) acetabular fracture by only fixing a single column with a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> and unicortical <b>locking</b> screws. We hypothesized that a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> applied to the anterior column of a transverse acetabular fracture would create a construct that is more rigid than a non-locking plate, and that this construct would be biomechanically comparable to two column fixation. Methods Using urethane foam models of the pelvis, we simulated transverse acetabular fractures and stabilized them with 1) an anterior column plate with bicortical screws, 2) an anterior <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> with unicortical screws, 3) an anterior plate and posterior column lag screw, and 4) a posterior plate with an anterior column lag screw. These constructs were mechanically loaded on a servohydraulic material testing machine. Construct stiffness and fracture displacement were measured. Result and Discussion We found that two column fixation is 54 % stiffer than a single column fixation with a conventional plate with bicortical screws. There was no significant difference between fixation with an anterior column <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> with unicortical screws and an anterior plate with posterior column lag screw. We detected a non-significant trend towards more stiffness for the anterior <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> compared to the anterior non-locking plate. Conclusion In conclusion, a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> construct of the anterior column provides less stability than a traditional both column construct with posterior plate and anterior column lag screw. However, the locking construct offers greater strength than a non-locking, bicortical construct, which in addition often requires extensive contouring and its application is oftentimes accompanied by the risk of neurovascular damage. </p...|$|R
