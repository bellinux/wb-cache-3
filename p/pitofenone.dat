50|$|Algifen is {{trademark}} of compositional analgesic drug based on mixture of metamizole, <b>pitofenone</b> and fenpiverinium. It {{was produced by}} Zentiva in tablet-form, it was marketed in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Fenpiverinium is an {{anticholinergic}} and antispasmodic compound; it is {{marketed as}} a combination drug with <b>pitofenone</b> hydrochloride and either nimesulide or metamizole in Eastern Europe and India to treat smooth muscle spasms and pain.|$|E
50|$|Similar drug {{combinations}} are now marketed by Teva {{under the}} name Algifen Neo (in the form of peroral drops). Composition (per 1 ml):metamizole 500 mg, <b>pitofenone</b> 5 mg. It is frequently used during urinary infection to relieve pain.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} a parenteral formulation of 'Manyana™ ' (a combination of diclofenac + <b>pitofenone</b> + renpiverinium) in ureteric, biliary and intestinal colic, an open labelled study was conducted at two centres. A total of 206 patients were enrolled and evaluated for decrease in pain with time on a visual analogue scale. A statistically significant difference was observed in pain within 30 minutes of drug administration and the pain relief lasted {{for as long as}} 24 hours post dosing. The study shows definite synergism between the antispasmodics <b>pitofenone</b> and fenpiverinium with the NSAID-diclofenac, reducing the prostaglandin levels and also the spasm related to colic...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{research}} have gained an orientation towards developing efficient strategies using innocuous reagents. The earlier reported transition-metal catalyzed carbonylations involved either toxic carbon monoxide (CO) gas as carbonylating agent or functional group assisted ortho sp 2 C-H activation (i. e. ortho acylation) or carbonylation by the activation of carbonyl group (i. e. via {{the formation of}} enamines). Contradicting to these methods, here we describe an environmentally benign process, [Pd]-catalyzed direct carbonylation starting from simple and commercially available iodo arenes and aldehydes, for the synthesis {{of a wide variety}} of ketones. Moreover, this method comprises direct coupling of iodo-arenes with aldehydes without the activation of carbonyl and also without directing group assistance. Significantly, the strategy was successfully applied to the synthesis n-butylphthalide and <b>pitofenone...</b>|$|E
40|$|Transition-metal-catalyzed {{oxidative}} {{coupling reactions}} are important tools {{for the construction}} of carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon-heteroatom (C-X) bonds from simple starting materials. A series of novel and synthetically useful reactions have been developed and are herein described. ^ Palladium-catalyzed chemoselective decarboxylative cross-coupling of benzoic acids with α-oxocarboxylic acids was realized via an arene sp 2 C-H functionalization process. This work represents the first example of transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with two acids acting in different roles. The synthetic utility of this method was confirmed by the synthesis of <b>pitofenone,</b> an antispasmodic used in the combined drug Spasmalgon. ^ A highly site-selective and diastereoselective fluorination of aliphatic amides via a palladium-catalyzed bidentate ligand-directed C-H bond functionalization process on unactivated sp 3 carbons was developed. A wide variety of β-fluorinated amino acid derivatives and aliphatic amides, important motifs in medicinal and agricultural chemistry, were prepared with palladium acetate as the catalyst and selectfluor as the fluorine source. ^ The synthesis for cinnolines from N-phenylhydrazones was performed through an oxidation/cyclization sequence, representing the first copper-catalyzed coupling reaction of hydrazones through a C(sp 3) -H bond functionalization process. The method provides an environmentally friendly and atom-efficient approach to biologically active cinnoline derivatives. ^ A novel rhodium-catalyzed imination of sulfoxides using O-(2, 4 -dinitrophenyl) -hydroxylamine was developed under mild conditions with good functional group tolerance. The reaction provides an efficient access to free NH-sulfoximines, an important structural unit in a variety of biologically active compounds. ...|$|E
40|$|Frequent episodic tension-type {{headache}} (ETTH) is {{a serious}} medical problem that is primarily due to its high prevalence. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) whose efficiency {{is determined by the}} rapid and complete regression of cephalgia are primarily used to relieve an ETTH attack. One of the ways to enhance the effect of NSAIDs is their combination with agents that accelerate their absorption or potentiate their action, with caffeine in particular; however, the use of combination agents is limited by a risk for drug-induced headache. A step {{on the road to the}} design of effective and safe analgesics has been the development of the combination drug Novigan that contains ibuprofen (400 mg) and the spasmolytics <b>pitofenone</b> (5 mg) and fenpiverinium (0. 1 mg). Objective: to study the efficacy of Novigan versus ibuprofen 400 mg in relieving an ETTH attack. Subjects and methods. Fifty patients (mean age 37. 1 ± 10. 9 years) with frequent ETTH that met the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2 nd Edition, were examined. For relief of ETTH attacks, 30 patients used Novigan and 20 took ibuprofen in a dose of 400 mg. Results. There was a significant reduction in the intensity of cephalgia 49. 9 ± 35. 8 and 68. 2 ± 45. 9 min after drug administration in the Novigan and ibuprofen 400 mg groups, respectively (p = 0. 007). The proportion of respondents was higher in the Novigan group (73. 3 %) than that in the ibuprofen 400 mg group (60 %), which is close to the statistically significant difference (p = 0. 085). The efficacy predictors were less pain intensity (p < 0. 001) and a shorter time after onset (p < 0. 001) in the ibuprofen 400 mg group at administration of the drug and only less pain intensity in the Novigan group at that moment (p = 0. 07). Conclusion. Novigan is a combination analgesic that rapidly and effectively relieves an ETTH attack, including that of high intensity, as well as extended ETTH attack...|$|E
