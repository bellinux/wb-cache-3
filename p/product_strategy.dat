40|$|In market-driven product development, {{large numbers}} of {{requirements}} flow in continuously. It is critical for product management to select the requirements aligned with overall business goals and discard others as early as possible. It has been suggested in literature to utilize <b>product</b> <b>strategies</b> for early requirements triage and selection. However, no explicit method/model/framework has been suggested as how to do it. This thesis presents a model for early requirements triage and selection utilizing <b>product</b> <b>strategies</b> based on a literature study and interviews with people at two organizations about the requirements triage and selection processes and <b>product</b> <b>strategies</b> formulation. The model is validated statically within the same two organizations. 073553032...|$|R

25|$|In 1997, Jobs {{cancelled}} {{almost all}} of the product lines, and introduced a new <b>product</b> <b>strategy</b> focusing only on desktop and laptop computers for both consumer and professional customer. With the Power Macintosh G3 filling the role of a desktop computer marketed at professional customers, Apple began to focus on an entry-level desktop computer suitable for consumers. The result was the iMac released in 1998, a computer with an innovative design intended to be friendly and easily accessible for average computer users. For the iMac's development, Rubinstein assembled a team and with a deadline of only 11 months (a timeline they considered impossible). The iMac was an immediate success, not only helping to revitalise Apple as a company, but also popularising new technologies at the time, such as USB, which would then go on to become an industry standard. The iMac also shipped without a floppy disk drive (rare for computers of the era), relying solely on the optical drive and new technologies such as USB and Firewire for data transfer. Rubinstein was responsible for both of these decisions.|$|E

40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} organizations adopt <b>product</b> production <b>strategies</b> {{that influence}} {{a wide range}} of factors within the company. These strategies define policies, procedures and structures that affect the same areas as a software <b>product</b> line <b>strategy.</b> When an organization initiates a <b>product</b> line <b>strategy,</b> that strategy must be integrated with existing strategies while not losing the benefits of the software <b>product</b> line <b>strategy.</b> This paper is a brief report of our experience integrating a software <b>product</b> line <b>strategy</b> similar to that developed by the Software Engineering Institute with a specific <b>product</b> production <b>strategy,</b> the PACE model. Problems such as conflicts in terminology and clashes in organizational structure were identified and resolved.

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{suggested in}} the thesis is a sophisticated process for research and planning of market <b>product</b> <b>strategies.</b> This methodology provides a program for a correctly focusing innovation on the target marketplace and ensuring that only viable <b>product</b> <b>strategies</b> get to the production stage. It provides to small and medium companies a structured way of discovering the real needs and wants of customers. The process starts by researching marketplace {{in order to identify}} competition product position, continues by determining of product goals, developing the <b>product</b> <b>strategies</b> and projecting them into marketing plans. In also involves realisation of marketing plans and assessment of records. Understanding the market dynamics and identifying its opportunities gives a possibility of further development of products that customers want. The process also involves methods of determining technical, economical and marketing competency of a product, assessment competition power of a product and assessment of market attraction. The methodology shows how to exploit effectively the market potential, to appraise the market for new products, to avoid product failures and to measure the potential and expected success of <b>product</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>Product</b> marketing should actively participate in strategic decision making and planning of industrial enterprises.

The paper offers a general framework explaining the relevant product structure concepts {{that could be used}} to improve <b>product</b> <b>strategies</b> and the management of the development process. The main relationships between these concepts are analysed, highlighting major constraints and opportunities...|$|R

40|$|The {{selection}} of appropriate <b>product</b> <b>strategies</b> by firms must {{account for the}} expected long-run returns from the market a firm contemplates entering, relative to the expected long-run returns from the market it is currently serving. These expected returns must also reflect the capabilities a firm has to implement this strategy and the resulting competitive situations it will face. The mathematical techniques of Markov processes and dynamic programming are used in this paper to develop an analytic framework which will select optimal <b>product</b> <b>strategies</b> for a firm {{that are consistent with}} its capabilities, that will meet its competitive situations, and that will maximize expected returns in the long run. This model is applied to a selected set of Michigan machine tool firms. The results indicate the general importance of total firm capabilities and the greater importance of management capability over the supporting capabilities in the {{selection of}} optimal <b>product</b> <b>strategies.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Is there a {{relationship}} between home-country competitive advantages, MNC price/quality <b>product</b> <b>strategies,</b> and firm performance? A cross-national contingency framework is developed, identifying three “regional stereotypes” of price/quality relationships, fueled by history and consumer perceptions, which appear to result in superior MNC performance. Findings indicate that the “stereotypes'” influences have diminished over time (as MNCs shift from home country advantages to global firm-specific advantages). However, Triad MNCs that use these <b>product</b> <b>strategies</b> (Japan [superior value], EU [premium] and U. S. [economy]) still, on average, demonstrate superior performance. © 2000 JIBS.

40|$|The {{ability for}} a product {{developer}} to successfully launch useful products {{is tied to the}} company’s <b>product</b> design <b>strategies.</b> Due to the complexity of perception and expectations on new product design from customers and the diverse perspectives of the product developer, any approaches without systematically analyzing these complex criteria to assess decision making on <b>product</b> design <b>strategies</b> are therefore deemed as inappropriate. A systematic approach to determine appropriate <b>product</b> design <b>strategies</b> based on the attributes of product design and customer expectations should thus be considered. This research focuses on the investigation of shape formulation process using evolutionary grammars (EG) and non-linear product design analysis with Kano model to refine <b>product</b> design <b>strategies.</b> Through the strategic integration of evolutionary grammars and Kano model, the complex effects on the evolutionary design process and <b>product</b> design <b>strategies</b> are revealed. In order to demonstrate the viability of the approach, experiments are described and a comparison analysis on three EG-Kano reference models is performed.
