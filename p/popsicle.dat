25|$|During this period, Frank Epperston started {{marketing}} frozen ice on a {{stick and}} formed the <b>Popsicle</b> Corporation. Six months after <b>Popsicle</b> received its patent in August 1924, Good Humor sued <b>Popsicle</b> Corporation, and by October 1925 the parties settled out of court. <b>Popsicle</b> agreed to pay Good Humor a licence fee to manufacture what was called frozen suckers from ice and sherbet products. Good Humor reserved the right to manufacture these products from ice cream, frozen custard, and the like.|$|E

25|$|Harry Burt died in 1926, and {{two years}} later his widow sold her {{interest}} to the Midland Food Products Company, owned by a group of Cleveland businessmen. They changed the company's name to the Good Humor Corporation of America and started selling franchises with a $100 down payment. Cora Burt retained the license agreement with <b>Popsicle.</b> Thomas J. Brimer (1900–1978) purchased the Good Humor franchise for the Detroit territory and by 1929 opened his second plant in Chicago. The mob demanded $5,000 protection money and destroyed part of the Chicago fleet when Brimer refused. The resulting publicity helped put Good Humor on the map.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Good Humor was {{acquired}} by Thomas J. Lipton, the U.S. subsidiary of the international Unilever conglomerate. Profits declined when the baby boomers aged and costs increased because of labor issues, gasoline, and insurance. The company sold its fleet in 1978 but continued to distribute its products through grocery stores and independent street vendors. By 1984, Good Humor returned to profitability. Starting in 1989, Unilever expanded Good Humor through its acquisition of Gold Bond Ice Cream that included the <b>Popsicle</b> brand. Four years later, Unilever bought Isaly Klondike and the Breyers Ice Cream Company. As a result, Good Humor-Breyers is now a large producer of branded ice cream and frozen novelties, {{as part of the}} Unilever Heartbrand.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensation}} of thirst {{plays an important}} role in the consumption of water or other fluids to rehydrate the body in order to keep bodily functions working properly. An increase in saliva secretion, wetting the mouth by ingestion of liquids, and cooling and sour components in products can alleviate this sensation already before absorption of fluids by the body. This study aimed to investigate the thirst-quenching ability of water-based products differing in temperature and texture (cold solids and cool liquids), flavour (flavoured and non-flavoured) and sugar content in two consecutive experiments. The first experiment tested four products of 10 ml each (flavoured <b>popsicles,</b> flavoured beverages, ice cubes, and water). 45 healthy, thirsty participants (8 men and 37 women, mean age 25. 7 years SD ± 6. 6) were randomly assigned to a flavour group representing the flavour of the <b>popsicles</b> and beverages: mint, lemon, raspberry. Each flavour group tasted all four products (<b>popsicles,</b> beverages, water, ice cubes) in four sessions on consecutive days. Participants rated their thirst and four attributes (flavour intensity, thirst-quenching, refreshing, saliva stimulating) during 3 min of consumption on a 100 mm VAS scale and ranked all four products on thirst-quenching ability at the end of the last session. The second experiment was performed similarly (n = 61, 6 men and 55 women, mean age 23. 5 years SD ± 2. 87), but used sugar-reduced <b>popsicles</b> to compare to the regular <b>popsicles</b> from the first experiment. In addition, saliva was collected before and after consumption. In the first experiment, cold solid (55. 8 ± 0. 99) and flavoured (55. 9 ± 0. 95) products were found to be more thirst-quenching than cool liquid (52. 8 ± 0. 96) and non-flavoured products (52. 8 ± 0. 96). The second experiment confirmed that saliva production increased upon consumption of these <b>popsicles,</b> with an increase of saliva weight from 1. 7 g SD ± 0. 15 before consumption to 2. 0 SD ± 0. 22 after consumption. Sugar-reduced <b>popsicles</b> were similar in thirst-quenching ability compared to regular <b>popsicles.</b> Overall, cold, solid, flavoured products (such as <b>popsicles)</b> performed best in quenching thirst, and it appeared that sugar-reduction in these products to create healthier alternatives can be achieved without compromising on thirst-quenching abilities. These results can be useful for optimisation of products to alleviate thirst in daily life, as well as in clinical settings for patients where fluid restriction is needed...|$|R
25|$|In 1917, an {{attraction}} called Neptune Beach {{was built in}} the area now known as Crab Cove. Often compared to Coney Island, the park was a major attraction in the 1920s and 1930s. The original owners of the facility, the Strehlow family, partnered with a local confectioner to create tastes unique to Neptune Beach. Both the American snow cone and the <b>popsicle</b> were first sold at Neptune Beach. The Kewpie doll, hand-painted and dressed in unique hand-sewn dresses, became the original prize for winning games at the beach– another Neptune Beach invention. The Strehlows owned and operated the beach on their own, even filling in a section of the bay to add an additional Olympic-size swimming pool and an exceptional roller coaster which must have given riders a tremendous view of the bay. The Cottage Baths were available for rent.|$|E

2500|$|An ice pop is {{a frozen}} {{water-based}} dessert on a stick. It {{is made by}} freezing a colored, flavored liquid around a stick. Once the liquid freezes solid, the stick {{can be used as}} a handle to hold the ice pop. The ice pop was invented by 11-year-old Frank Epperson in 1905. Living in San Francisco, California, Epperson had left a fruit drink out overnight, with a stirrer in it, thus making it freeze. In 1923, Epperson got a patent on his [...] "frozen ice on a stick".

2500|$|Dickson {{found another}} usage, {{referring}} to a high foul ball that travels a great distance, usually behind home plate. In Stephen King's 1980 short story [...] "The Monkey", anthologized five years later in Skeleton Crew, the protagonists' father recalls days watching sandlot games during his own childhood, when he [...] "was too small to play, but he sat far out in foul territory sucking his blueberry <b>Popsicle</b> and chasing what the big kids called 'Chinese home runs'". Dickson wrote to King, who told him two years later that he had first heard the term when learning to play baseball in his own childhood, {{during a time when}} he lived, briefly, in Stratford, Connecticut. After he returned to his native Maine in 1958, the same year the Giants and Dodgers moved west, he recalled hearing it again. [...] "In both cases", he told Dickson, [...] "a Chinese home run was a foul ball, usually over the backstop". Dickson concluded from his correspondence that that use may well be limited to New England. All three definitions submitted to the online Urban Dictionary in the early 21st century are in accord with this usage.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, Hill {{committed}} {{to one of}} her greatest ambitions: photocopying the Palace of Versailles. She cited four reasons for this venture: 1) she considered Versailles to be simultaneously [...] "self-centered" [...] and [...] "public-spirited"; 2) it shared connections between the United States and France, and she considered herself to be a citizen of both countries; 3) she wanted to [...] "do something big"; 4) she wanted to see what [...] "a modern device would make of something old." [...] Additionally, she explained, [...] "I conceived the idea of photocopying the château of Versailles because, among other reasons, it is so well known through painting and photography. It gives me a dramatic opportunity to show the difference between those disciplines and that of copying. The great variety of subject matter would allow full range to the copier's artistic capacity within a single framework." [...] She copied a bellpull, cobblestones, and a pear tree, roots and live worms included, all of which were pulled from Versailles. Her work with Versailles further introduced her experimentation with colored toner, frottage, and photogravure. Hill intended to have several exhibitions of her Versailles work, including shows titled Weeds, Worms, Water and <b>Popsicle</b> Sticks, Stone and Iron, Walls and Words, and Lace and Glass. Nevertheless, Hill insisted, [...] "I am not interested in Copy Art per se but rather in what I can do with a copier." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Flyboat is {{the primary}} mode of {{transportation}} in the series. The main base is a red flying disc with 4 blue and yellow wheels, it has 3 lights: 1 green, 1 orange and 1 purple; the Flyboat has a clear plastic bottom where 5 gears, that are possibly part of the engine, are visible. The Flyboat's rocket boosters are 2 felt marker caps that are controlled by a green <b>Popsicle</b> stick that when lifted up makes boosters point down, which allows the Flyboat to hover in the air. Lastly, the boat has a mast made out of blue Erector pieces with a marble on top and a sail (the color, design, and print varies) with the Wonder Pets logo on it. Usually, Linny pilots the Flyboat, but there are episodes where Ming-Ming or Tuck pilot it instead. Most other modes of transportation are {{a variation of the}} Flyboat and primarily use the same components such as the Flysub, which is basically a modified Flyboat capable of traveling underwater or modify it to fit a specific theme tied to the theme of the episode such as The Circusboat in [...] "Join the Circus!". In [...] "Save the Raccoon", the Flyboat breaks down during their rescue of a Baby Raccoon stuck in a Recycling Bin and find that its gears have come loose, forcing them to create a new vehicle called the Flycycle from recyclable materials in order to save the Baby Raccoon. In [...] "Save the Loch Ness Monster", it is shown that the Flyboat can be converted in a sail/motor boat by changing the position of the wheels and the boosters, called the Boat-Boat. In [...] "Three Wonder Pets and a Baby", Linny decides to create Babyboat, using a red Baby carriage as its main base instead of the Flyboat's red disc. The Wonder Pets have trouble building it at first as they are all trying to do everything at the same time so Linny suggests that they build it step-by-step and this solution to build the Babyboat would later inspire them of how to deal with pacifying the crying Baby Piglet. In [...] "Ollie to the Rescue", Ollie creates his own version for his Thunder Pets team, which he calls the Ollieboat. He uses the Flyboats red flying disc as its main base and a carrot for a mast. However, Ollie is a poor flyer and requires the Wonder Pets assistance to fly the Ollieboat out of the classroom.|$|E
