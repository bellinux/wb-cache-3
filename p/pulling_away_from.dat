5|$|The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at {{position}} 22 and thereafter declined. The track was promoted by a music video, which {{was directed by}} Marco Brambilla. The video features a long take of the camera <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> West. The video received positive reviews from critics and received two nominations for MTV Video Music Awards. West performed the song on Saturday Night Live, at the 2010 BET Awards, at the 2011 Coachella Music Festival, and his Watch the Throne Tour. When performing the song, West often wore clothes made from red leather. A remix of the track featuring rapper Jay-Z was released on August 20, 2010, {{as a part of}} West's weekly GOOD Fridays series.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the day {{the chase}} continued, the British frigates gaining slowly on their quarry and as {{darkness}} fell Pique closed with the larger French ship. At 23:00 Milne {{was close enough to}} open fire on Seine, to which Bigot responded without reducing speed. For the next {{two and a half hours}} the frigates exchanged broadsides at full speed as the French coastline rapidly approached ahead. At 01:35 a shot from Seine struck the main topmast on Pique, bringing it crashing down. The consequent loss of speed forced Milne back, Seine <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the smaller ship but unable to escape Jason which was steadily gaining.|$|E
5|$|During the {{engagement}} between Streatham and Caroline, Lord Keith and Europe had fired sporadically at the French ship with little effect. <b>Pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his surrendered opponent, Féretier then fired on Lord Keith, whose captain, Peter Campbell, realised that his ship stood no chance against the frigate and turned eastward, running before {{the wind to}} escape despite suffering severe damage to Lord Keith rigging as he did so. William Gelston, captain of Europe, also attempted to flee, but his battered ship was in no condition to outrun the virtually untouched frigate, and he surrendered at 10:00. Lord Keith eventually arrived safely at Penang on 9 June. Casualties on the British ships were six killed and at least four wounded, while the French lost one killed and three wounded.|$|E

5|$|Gordon led on the lap-38 restart, {{followed}} by Truex and Burton. One lap later, Burton, with assistance from Johnson, passed Gordon for the lead. Kenseth claimed first position on lap 40 after {{driving on the}} outside lane. Vickers followed Johnson on the inside line to reclaim the lead on the following lap, before Sadler passed Vickers around the outside for the lead on the 44th lap. On lap 45, Mears led after passing Sadler, and debris was located on the backstretch, triggering a second caution. All drivers, including Mears, elected to make pit stops. Sadler reclaimed first position and led the field back up to speed at the lap-49 restart, ahead of Mears and Kyle Busch. Hamlin and Kyle Busch led the cars driving on the outside lane, with Busch claiming the lead on lap 51, <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{the rest of the}} field. Kurt Busch, with help from Vickers, got ahead of Kyle Busch to move into first place.|$|E
5|$|The next storm formed well to {{the east}} of the Lesser Antilles on September 3 and moved westward, {{attaining}} tropical storm status about a day later. The storm slowed and curved toward the southwest, nearing the northern coast of Colombia before <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> land and strengthening into a hurricane. It further intensified to Category 2 status before striking Nicaragua on September 10. Quickly weakening to a tropical storm, the cyclone continued westward across Central America and briefly entered the eastern Pacific Ocean. It dissipated shortly thereafter. In the town of Corinto, a report indicated the deaths of 10 people and 50 additional injuries. About 250 houses were destroyed, leaving approximately $2 million (1911 USD, $ 2014 USD) in damage. Data on this storm is extremely scarce; as such, only minor revisions could be made to its chronology in the hurricane database.|$|E

Oh Land is then seen wearing pink {{overalls}} entering the building and sitting down in a folding chair towards the center. As the first verse begins, she stands up and dances around the open space, which continues into the chorus. For the second verse, she is joined by four background dancers, who are now sitting in chairs, much like Oh Land. The singer has changed outfits and is now shown knitting. The next scene has the five women standing spaced apart, before they all begin dancing again. Two female children watch the dancers with curiosity. For the song's refrain, Oh Land rides an all-terrain vehicle, before the video concludes with {{a large group of}} children joining the women for a final dance.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E

Michigan State came out in the second half and secured the momentum in slowly, but surely, <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Duke. The Spartans got out to a nine-point lead, allowed Duke to get within two, but then, scoring their last ten points of the game on free throws, moved on to the Regional Finals.|$|E

25|$|Mansell and Patrese were <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Senna {{while there}} was a battle for fourth between Prost, Alesi and Piquet. On lap 26, Senna retired with {{alternator}} troubles and two laps later Prost was out with a failed gearbox. Alesi was third but on lap 35, his engine expired. This put Mansell in front of Patrese, Piquet, Modena, Andrea de Cesaris and Ivan Capelli. Patrese had to pit with a puncture and rejoined behind Piquet. He then had gearbox troubles and was passed by Modena as Capelli spun off.|$|E
25|$|The First Great Awakening was {{an evangelical}} and {{revitalization}} movement that swept through Protestant Europe and British America, especially the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American Protestantism. It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners {{a sense of}} deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. <b>Pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> ritual, ceremony, sacramentalism and hierarchy, it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering {{a deep sense of}} spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality.|$|E
25|$|While the Ferraris {{pulled away}} (Alesi <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Berger), Häkkinen passed Herbert (in the spare Lotus, an older car) who retired on lap 13 when his {{alternator}} failed. Alesi then pitted but his car refused to {{engage a gear}} when he tried to rejoin resulting in his retirement. During Berger's stop, he was blocked by another car which was going into the pit. In his frustration, he accidentally stalled the car exiting his stop and lost over 10 seconds, dropping back to third. Coulthard also got ahead of Hill during the stops, however Hill passed Coulthard on lap 29 to take the lead.|$|E

25|$|By {{the fourth}} {{week of the}} campaign, polls showed the Liberals <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Conservatives with a margin of at least 10 points. It was widely {{believed}} that only a disastrous performance in the leader's debate stood between Dalton McGuinty and the Premier's Office. McGuinty - who had stumbled badly in the 1999 debate - was able to play off low expectations and a surprisingly low-key Eves to earn the draw he wanted. The debate itself was also subject to criticism from the Green Party of Ontario, which denounced a Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission decision not to allow leader Frank de Jong to participate.|$|E
25|$|The Williamses {{pulled away}} from the McLarens who were <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Ferraris (Prost had by now passed Alesi). On lap 18, Patrese waved Mansell through and decided to follow him. The McLarens stopped first and Senna got ahead of Berger. When Mansell stopped on lap 29, his crew had trouble fixing the wheelnut of his right rear properly. As the Williams {{mechanic}} went to get a spare nut, the lollipop man, unaware of the trouble signalled for Mansell to depart. Immediately, his right rear fell off and he stopped {{in the middle of the}} pitlane. The team retrieved the tyre, fixed it on Mansell's car and sent him on his way but he had dropped to 17th.|$|E
25|$|Early on, as Senna was <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Prost, Alesi {{got past}} Patrese for fourth. However, Patrese repassed him on lap 16 and closed up on Mansell. He {{attacked}} on lap 22 but shot into an escape road and rejoined behind Alesi and Berger. He quickly closed {{up on them}} with Berger attacking Alesi but unable to pass. Patrese passed Berger on lap 34. On the next lap, Mansell's gearbox failed and soon afterward, on lap 36, Berger had fuel pump trouble, which forced him to retire. Patrese then passed Alesi who pitted on lap 43. He closed in on Prost and the Ferrari pitted on lap 46, with right rear troubles putting him down to seventh.|$|E

With less than 20 laps to go, Unser got challenges from Tom Sneva who led the most laps. With help from his son - who was several laps down - Unser began <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Sneva. However Sneva got by Al Jr., and set sail for Unser Sr.. Sneva caught up to Unser within 1 lap of passing Al Jr., and passed him to retake the lead with 9 laps to go. Sneva then easily pulled away to win the race by 11 seconds, avenging his firing from the team in 1978. After the race, Unser Jr. was penalized 2 laps for his actions as well as having passed 2 cars under caution on lap 170.|$|E
25|$|In many ways, the Paleocene {{continued}} {{processes that}} had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected. North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); {{the components of the}} former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> each other. Africa was heading north toward Europe, slowly closing the Tethys Ocean, and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas.|$|E
