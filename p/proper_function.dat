The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the <b>proper</b> <b>function</b> of other members of the antioxidant system. The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the <b>proper</b> <b>function</b> of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E

25|$|Neurotoxins are toxins {{that are}} {{poisonous}} or destructive to nerve tissue (causing neurotoxicity). Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue. The term {{can also be}} used to classify endogenous compounds, which, when abnormally contacted, can prove neurologically toxic. Though neurotoxins are often neurologically destructive, their ability to specifically target neural components is important in the study of nervous systems. Common examples of neurotoxins include lead, ethanol (drinking alcohol), manganese glutamate, nitric oxide , botulinum toxin (e.g. Botox), tetanus toxin, and tetrodotoxin. Some substances such as nitric oxide and glutamate are in fact essential for <b>proper</b> <b>function</b> of the body and only exert neurotoxic effects at excessive concentrations.|$|E

25|$|Pathologically, {{neurodegenerative}} {{diseases such}} as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are all characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, cognitive decline, motor impairments, and sensory loss. Collectively these diseases fall within a broad category referred to as proteinopathies, due to the common assemblage of misfolded or aggregated intracellular or extracellular proteins. According to the prevailing amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, the aggregation of amyloid-beta (a peptide normally produced in and cleared from the healthy young brain) into extracellular plaques drives the neuronal loss and brain atrophy that {{is the hallmark of}} Alzheimer's dementia. Although {{the full extent of the}} glymphatic system's involvement in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear, researchers have demonstrated through experiments with genetically modified mice that the <b>proper</b> <b>function</b> of the glymphatic clearance system was necessary to remove soluble amyloid-beta from the brain interstitium. In mice that lack the AQP4 gene, amyloid-beta clearance is reduced by approximately 55 percent.|$|E
500|$|Residual {{complications}} of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle paresis and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once {{the muscles in}} the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot (similar to club foot). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons {{at the back of}} the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed. In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps and leans to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine (such as scoliosis). Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of epiphyseal (growth) plate closure, the legs are more equal in length. Alternatively, a person can be fitted with custom made footwear which corrects the difference in leg lengths. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful. [...] Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of <b>proper</b> <b>function</b> of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs. Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, myocarditis and cor pulmonale.|$|E

40|$|Are {{learning}} processes selection processes? This paper takes {{a slightly}} {{modified version of}} the account of selection presented in Hull et al. (Behav Brain Sci 24 : 511 – 527, 2001) and asks whether it applies to learning processes. The answer is that although some learning processes are selectional, many are not. This has consequences for teleological theories of mental content. According to these theories, mental states have content in virtue of having <b>proper</b> <b>functions,</b> and they have <b>proper</b> <b>functions</b> in virtue of being the products of selection processes. For some mental states, it is plausible that the relevant selection process is natural selection, but there are many for which it is not plausible. One response to this (due to David Papineau) is to suggest that the learning processes by which we acquire non-innate mental states are selection processes and can therefore confer <b>proper</b> <b>functions</b> on mental states. This paper considers two ways in which this response could be elaborated, and argues that neither of them succeed: the teleosemanticist cannot rely on the claim that learning processes are selection processes in order to justify the attribution of <b>proper</b> <b>functions</b> to beliefs...|$|R
2500|$|While the {{specific}} function of CCDC130 is still unknown, {{there have been}} several studies and research papers identifying it as a component of the U5 portion of the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP that helps form Complex B of the human spliceosome after coming together with Complex A. Complex B then undergoes more modifications and conformational changes before becoming a mature spliceosome. In one study, the conservation of spliceosomal components is discussed by comparing the human spliceosome with that of yeast. In this study, CCDC130 is categorized as a known splicing factor and its homolog in yeast is Yju2. [...] This yeast protein is a splicing factor that helps form the complete, active spliceosome and promotes the first step of splicing, which involves cleavage at the 5' splice site of the first exon. Based on this information, it is likely that CCDC130 plays a similar role in the human spliceosome, but due to the higher complexity of the human spliceosome, this protein may perform other functions or a completely different function. Due to its high number of phosphorylation sites, it is likely that this protein is activated and recruited to the spliceosomal complex through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation (see Post-translational modifications). Since this gene is ubiquitously expressed and expressed 2.9 times higher than the average gene, it is clear that this protein plays an integral part in the <b>proper</b> <b>function</b> of the spliceosome.|$|E
