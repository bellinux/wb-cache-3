Their debut album is the fastest-selling debut album by a band in British chart history, and in 2013, Rolling Stone ranked it the 30th-greatest debut album of all time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of this attention, {{existing}} acts like Yeah Yeah Yeahs were able to sign to major record labels. A second wave of bands that managed to gain international recognition {{as a result of}} the movement included Interpol, the Killers, the Catheters, Mooney Suzuki and the Go in the US, and Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Maxïmo Park, Editors, the Cribs, the Libertines, the Fratellis, Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs in the UK. Arctic Monkeys were the most prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking, with two No. 1 singles and Whatever <b>People</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.|$|E

500|$|The band {{finished}} recording {{their debut}} album, Whatever <b>People</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not, at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire in September 2005 with British record producer Jim Abbiss producing. Whatever <b>People</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not became the fastest selling debut album in UK chart history, selling 363,735 copies {{in the first}} week. This smashed the previous record of 306,631 copies held by Popstars by Hear'Say, and sold more copies on its first day alone – 118,501 – {{than the rest of}} the Top 20 albums combined. The cover sleeve of Whatever <b>People</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not, showing Chris McClure, a friend of the band smoking a cigarette, was criticised by the head of the NHS in Scotland for [...] "reinforcing the idea that smoking is OK". The image on the CD itself is a shot of an ashtray full of cigarettes. The band's product manager denied the accusation, and suggested the opposite – [...] "You can see from the image smoking is not doing him the world of good." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{have usually}} been {{categorized}} under the indie rock, garage rock and post-punk revival genres. A {{key part of}} their sound, and one that translates across their whole discography, is lead singer and frontman Alex Turner's intricate and often rapidly delivered lyrics, sung in a distinctive strong Sheffield accent that their music became famed for in their early years. A large part of their iconic British sound is credited to the punk poet John Cooper Clarke from whom the Arctic Monkeys even borrowed lyrics and the title from in [...] "I Wanna Be Yours". Turner adapted Clarke's method of delivery mostly in their first album, Whatever <b>People</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am That's What I'm Not. Their early albums Whatever <b>People</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am That's What I'm Not and Favourite Worst Nightmare were rooted in garage rock and post-punk revival, with Turner's sharp lyrics the focal point. On the first album Alex Turner examined human behaviour in nightclubs and {{in the culture of}} the band's hometown, Sheffield. Turner describes [...] "Dancing Shoes" [...] as being about [...] "people always looking to [...] when they go out however much they mask it." ...|$|E

500|$|Arctic Monkeys {{achieved}} chart {{success with}} their first single [...] "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor" [...] which reached {{number one in the}} UK Singles Chart. Their first album Whatever <b>People</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not, released on 23 January 2006, was at the time the fastest-selling debut album in British music history. It received critical acclaim, winning both the 2006 Mercury Prize and the 2007 BRIT Awards for Best British Album. [...] The band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released on 23 April 2007, sold over 225,000 copies in its debut week, and was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize. The group also picked up the award for Best British Album and Best British Group at the BRIT Awards in 2008. Overall, the band has won five BRIT Awards, including [...] "Best British Breakthrough Act" [...] in 2006, [...] "Best British Album" [...] in 2007 for Whatever <b>People</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not, and [...] "Best British Group" [...] in 2008.

500|$|Arctic Monkeys' first release without Nicholson, {{the single}} [...] "Leave Before the Lights Come On", came on 14 August 2006. Turner {{said that the}} song {{was one of the}} last songs he wrote before their rise to fame, and {{suggested}} that [...] "it feels very much like it could be on the album". Peaking at No.4 in the UK, the single became the band's first single not to reach No.1. The band was re-united at the Leeds Festival when Nicholson met up with his former bandmates and his replacement bassist, O'Malley. Only the original band members, minus Nicholson, were present at the award ceremony when Whatever <b>People</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not won the 2006 Mercury Prize two weeks later.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "The Diamond Sea" [...] {{is notable}} for its 19:35 duration. Moore {{explained}} {{the length of}} some of the album's songs: [...] "We all have different aesthetics as to how songs should work. I generally push for a lot of abandon while some people in the group are more interested in truncating things. If I was the leader as much as <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am, every song would be 20 minutes long". The unlisted ninth track, officially called [...] "Becuz Coda", was originally part of the song [...] "Becuz", but the record label felt they needed to cut the seven-and-a-half-minute track to make the album's opening more accessible. The album was produced by Sonic Youth and John Siket, who also engineered the band's previous two albums. Audio mixing took place at Greene Street Studios in New York City in June 1995.|$|E

She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from Oprah Winfrey and the BBC. Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years. In December 2016, Vulović's friends became concerned for her well-being after she abruptly stopped answering her telephone. On 23 December, locksmiths discovered Vulović's lifeless body in her apartment after forcing open the door.

500|$|Against the Penguins in the Patrick Division Final, Hextall's {{performances}} were mixed: he under-performed {{early in the}} series, and in game five was swapped out of the net and then reinstated twice during a 10–7defeat for the Flyers. Hextall faced 17shots in the game, conceding nine of the Penguins goals. After the game, he denied being out of control, despite having assaulted one of the officials and chasing Rob Brown around the ice. He said, [...] "I like to think I'm strong mentally. Hey, if I was as out of control as <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am, I wouldn't be in the National Hockey League." [...] The Penguins coach, Gene Ubriaco, agreed with Hextall's assessment, and believed the goaltender lost control intentionally: [...] "He uses a loss of control to his advantage, in a way. He's the extreme example of controlled violence. And they [...] live and die with it." [...] The Flyers won the next game to force a decider, but Hextall was ruled out of the contest with a first degree sprain of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his right knee. Hextall's injury {{kept him out of}} the first three games of the series against the Canadiens, during which the Canadiens took a 2–1 lead. He returned for the fourth game, but could not prevent his side losing 3–0. The Flyers won the following game to extend the series to six games, but lost the next game 4–2, and were eliminated. Hextall displayed his violent side during the final minutes of game six, skating out of his crease to attack Chris Chelios. Hextall claimed that the attack was in retaliation for Chelios' hit on his Flyer teammate Brian Propp in game one, when Chelios caught Flyer Propp with a [...] "flying elbow" [...] {{to the side of the}} head, rendering him unconscious. Hextall was given a 12-game suspension for his actions, at the beginning of the 1989–90 season. Following the announcement of the suspension, Hextall stated his disappointment, and added that his intention was to fight rather than hurt Chelios.|$|E
