40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} cast rectifiers on the marginal misfit of cast UCLA abutments compared to <b>premachined</b> UCLA abutments. The influence of casting and porcelain baking on the marginal misfit of these components was also investigated. METHODS: Two groups were analyzed: test group - 10 cast UCLA abutments, finished with cast rectifier and submitted to ceramic application; control group - 10 <b>premachined</b> UCLA abutments, cast with noble metal alloy and submitted to ceramic application. Vertical misfit measurements were performed under light microscopy. In the test group, measurements were performed {{before and after the}} use of cast rectifiers, and after ceramic application. In the control group, measurements were performed before and after casting, and after ceramic application. Data were submitted to statistical analysis by ANOVA and Tukey's test (a= 5 %). RESULTS: The use of cast rectifiers significantly reduced the marginal misfit of cast UCLA abutments (from 25. 68 mm to 14. 83 mm; p< 0. 05). After ceramic application, the rectified cylinders presented misfit values (16. 18 mm) similar to those of <b>premachined</b> components (14. 3 mm). Casting of the <b>premachined</b> UCLA abutments altered the marginal misfit of these components (from 9. 63 mm to 14. 6 mm; p< 0. 05). There were no significant changes after porcelain baking, in both groups. CONCLUSION: The use of cast rectifiers reduced the vertical misfit of cast UCLA abutments. Even with carefully performed laboratory steps, changes at the implant interface of <b>premachined</b> UCLA abutments occurred. Ceramic application did not alter the marginal misfit values of UCLA abutments...|$|E
40|$|In recent {{clinical}} studies, {{contamination of}} the inner parts of dental implants through bacterial penetration along the implant components has been observed. The aim of the present in-vitro {{study was to investigate}} leakage of Fusobacterium. nucleatum through the interface between implants and <b>premachined</b> or cast abutments. Both <b>premachined</b> (n = 10) and cast (n = 10) implant abutment assemblies were inoculated with 3. 0 mu L of microbial inoculum. The assemblies were completely immersed in 5. 0 mL of tryptic soy broth culture medium to observe leakage at the implant-abutment interface after 14 days of anaerobic incubation. Bacterial growth in the medium, indicative of microbial leakage, was found only in 1 out of 9 samples (11. 1 %) in each group. Both <b>premachined</b> and cast abutments connected to external hexagonal implants provide low percentages of bacterial leakage through the interface in in vitro unloaded conditions if the manufacturer`s instructions and casting procedures are properly followed...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} misfit alterations at the implant/abutment interface of external and internal connection implant systems when subjected to cyclic loading. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standard metal crowns were fabricated for 5 groups (n= 10) of implant/abutment assemblies: Group 1, external hexagon implant and UCLA cast-on <b>premachined</b> abutment; Group 2, internal hexagon implant and <b>premachined</b> abutment; Group 3, internal octagon implant and prefabricated abutment; Group 4, external hexagon implant and UCLA cast-on <b>premachined</b> abutment; and Group 5, external hexagon implant and Ceraone abutment. For groups 1, 2, 3 and 5, the crowns were cemented on the abutments and in group 4 crowns were screwed directly on the implant. The specimens were subjected to 500, 000 cycles at 19. 1 Hz of frequency and non-axial load of 133 N in a MTS 810 machine. The vertical misfit (&# 956;m) at the implant/abutment interface was evaluated before (B) and after (A) application of the cyclic loading. Data were analyzed statistically by using two-away ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Before loading values showed no difference among groups 2 (4. 33 ± 3. 13), 3 (4. 79 ± 3. 43) and 5 (3. 86 ± 4. 60); between groups 1 (12. 88 ± 6. 43) and 4 (9. 67 ± 3. 08), and among groups 2, 3 and 4. However, groups 1 and 4 were significantly different from groups 2, 3 and 5. After loading values of groups 1 (17. 28 ± 8. 77) and 4 (17. 78 ± 10. 99) were significantly {{different from those of}} groups 2 (4. 83 ± 4. 50), 3 (8. 07 ± 4. 31) and 5 (3. 81 ± 4. 84). There was a significant increase in misfit values of groups 1, 3 and 4 after cyclic loading, but not for groups 2 and 5.

30|$|These {{results are}} in {{agreement}} with previous studies which stated that the difference in abutment screw RTV after load showed better results when less angulation abutment was used and studies have failed to show any contraindication to their use [4, 19, 29].

[30], in {{an evaluation of the}} influence of abutment angulation on screw loosening of implants in the anterior maxilla, found that the angled abutments showed higher RTV (P[*]<[*]. 05) than the straight and gold <b>premachined</b> UCLA-type abutments and the difference between them was not significant. This {{can be attributed to the}} off-axis force as loading on angled abutments is mostly off-axis, which raises the concern of how angled abutments generally perform with such an unfavorable loading regimen [28].|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of implantology, is {{recognized}} that microleakage at abutment/implant interface may cause inflammatory reactions in the peri-implant tissue. Although its established that microorganisms cause corrosion on metals in water environments, the role of bacteria at corrosion of dental alloys is unknown. The corrosion may result in biological, functional and aesthetic effects. The aim of this in vitro experiment is to evaluate the microleakage and corrosion by Streptococcus mutans at implant/abutment interface. The evaluated abutments are the following: <b>premachined</b> UCLA of Ag-Pd, <b>premachined</b> UCLA of tilite, calcinable UCLA of Co-Cr, calcinable UCLA of tilite, tilite preparable trunion and titanium preparable trunion. The inner of implants were contaminated with Streptococcus mutans culture. The abutments were screwed on implants, receiving closing torques of 32 N. cm and immerse in thioglycolate, keeping incubated for 28 days. The microleakage was evaluated in each 24 hours, for 14 days. After that, the culture environments that werent bleary were contaminated. The culture environments were analyzed in the 7 th, 14 th and 28 th days, with atomic absorption spectrophotometry, for corrosion analyze. With exception of the prosthetic component of Ag-Pd, all the tested components had {{an increase in the}} corrosion when immersed in way contend Streptococcus mutans, of significant form or not, and the <b>premachined</b> UCLA of Ag-Pd presented higher percentage of microleakage (40 %), but without difference significant statistics for the others tested groups. No âmbito da implantodontia é reconhecido que a microinfiltração na interface implante/pilar protético pode causar reações inflamatórias no tecido perimplantar. Apesar de estabelecido que microrganismos causem corrosão de metais em meio aquoso, a ação das bactérias na corrosão de materiais odontológicos tem sido pouco estudada. A corrosão pode gerar problemas biológicos, funcionais e estéticos. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar in vitro a microinfiltração e corrosão por Streptococcus mutans na interface implante/pilar protético. Foram avaliados pilares protéticos tipo UCLA calcinável fundidos em liga de Co-Cr e tilite, UCLA com cinta metálica pré-fabricada em duas diferentes ligas (Ag-Pd e tilite) e dois tipos de pilar reto personalizável (titânio grau 5 e tilite). O interior dos implantes foi inoculado com S. mutans, os pilares protéticos aparafusados sobre os implantes, recebendo torque de 32 N. cm e imersos em caldo tioglicolato, onde permaneceram incubados por até 28 dias. A microinfiltração foi avaliada a cada 24 horas por 14 dias e depois, os grupos que não apresentaram turvação, foram inoculados e incubados por mais 14 dias. Depois de sete, 14 e 28 dias de incubação, o meio de cultura foi analisado por espectrofotometria de absorção atômica. Com exceção do componente protético de Ag-Pd, todos os componentes testados tiveram um aumento na corrosão quando imersos em meio contendo Streptococcus mutans, de forma significativa ou não e os pilares UCLA com cinta pré-fabricada em Ag-Pd apresentaram maior porcentagem de microinfiltração (40 %) embora sem diferença estatística significativa para os demais grupos testados...|$|E
40|$|One {{application}} for repair welding is {{to restore the}} integrity of a component where a crack has been found. Cracks can appear during in-service or already in the manufacturing process. The latter is usually the case for large castings where cracks may have formed. The repair welding in this entry {{is the process of}} filling a <b>premachined</b> slot. This slot has been milled in order to remove the crack that has been found. The welding process can be any kind of arc, beam, or gas welding process. However, manual arc welding is the most common method for repair welding. Thereafter, the component may need to be heat treated in order to reduce residual stresses and/or restore material microstructure. Local heat treatment means that only a part of the structure is heat treated. This is in contrast to global heat treatment where the entire structure is heat treated by placing it in a furnace. We focus on the use of induction heating for local heat treatment in the current entry...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface under unloaded conditions. Twelve <b>premachined</b> abutments with plastic sleeves and 12 dental implants were used in this study. Prior to tests of bacterial leakage, samples from the inner parts of the implants were collected with sterile microbrushes to serve as negative controls for contamination. After casting, the abutments were tightened to 32 Ncm on the implants. The assemblies were immersed in 2. 0 mL of human saliva and incubated for 7 days. After this period, possible contamination of the internal parts of the implants was evaluated using the DNA Checkerboard method.

40|$|Background: Screw {{loosening}} of implant restorations {{continues to}} be a complication in implant prosthodontics. Screw joints are subjected to a loss of initially applied torque because of friction and component misfit. It has been suggested that the loss of applied torque is less in machined metal abutments than in cast plastic abutments. Purpose: This study compared the loss of applied torque (detorque) values in machined titanium and in cast UCLA-type abutments for external hex abutment/implant interface. Materials and Methods: Four groups of 12 samples each were evaluated: (1) machined titanium abutments, (2) <b>premachined</b> palladium abutments cast with palladium, (3) plastic abutments cast with nickel-chromium, and (4) plastic abutments cast with cobalt-chromium. Each abutment was torqued to 30 Ncm according to the manufacturer’s instructions and detorqued three times. The mean loss of applied torque (detorque) was recorded {{as a percentage of the}} torque applied. Group means were calculated and compared using ANOVA and Tukey’s LSD test. Results: Mean detorque values were (1) 92. 3 ± 2. 9 %, (2) 81. 6 ± 5. 0 %, (3) 86. 4 ± 4. 6 %, and (4) 84. 0 ± 7. 0 %. Machined abutments demonstrated significantly greater detorque values compared with all cast groups (p < 0. 05). No significant differences were found among cast groups...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{clinical}} {{application of}} prosthetic components obtained by different manufacturing processes lacks technological foundation: the dimensional tolerance of individual parts and their assembly accuracy are not known. The rotational misfit of the hexagonal connection {{is critical in}} single tooth implant restorations, but no standard control procedures are available for its evaluation. Purpose. The research aimed at proposing a new protocol for the dimensional assessment of implant-abutment connections, based on non-contact measurement and statistical data processing. The procedure was applied to machined- and cast-on abutments, as well of the matching implants. Materials and Methods. Three groups of 5 abutments each were studied: machined titanium abutments, <b>premachined</b> calcinable abutments before casting procedures and the same specimens after casting. A group of 5 corresponding implants was considered as well. Twice the apothem was measured on each hexagon through an optical measuring microscope. The data were processed to obtain the international tolerance (IT) grade. The rotational misfit was then calculated using the apothems of the external and the internal hexagon. Results. All the components were classified between IT 8 and IT 9 and the maximum rotational misfit was around 3 - 4 ° for all the assemblies, inferior to the critical limits for the screw joint stability. Conclusion. An original measuring protocol was developed, independent of parts assembly and based on international tolerances. An objective dimensional characterization of prosthetic components and assemblies has been achieved, which {{is the basis for}} their reliability in clinical applications...|$|E
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM An imprecise {{fit between}} {{frameworks}} and supporting dental implants in loaded protocols increases the strain {{transferred to the}} periimplant bone, which may impair healing or generate microgaps. PURPOSE The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the microstrain between <b>premachined</b> 1 -piece screw-retained frameworks (group STF) and screw-retained frameworks fabricated by cementing titanium cylinders to the prefabricated framework (group CTF). This procedure was developed to correct the misfit between frameworks and loaded implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four internal hexagon cylindrical implants were placed 10 mm apart in a polyurethane block by using the surgical guides of the corresponding implant system. Previously fabricated titanium frameworks (n= 10) were divided into 2 groups. In group STF, prefabricated machined frameworks were used (n= 5), and, in group CTF, the frameworks were fabricated by using a passive fit procedure, which was developed to correct the misfit between the cast titanium frameworks and supporting dental implants (n= 5). Both groups were screw-retained under torque control (10 Ncm). Six strain gauges were placed on the upper surface of the polyurethane block, and 3 strain measurements were recorded for each framework. Data were analyzed with the Student t test (α=. 05). RESULTS The mean microstrain values between the framework and the implants were significantly higher for group STF (2517 mε) than for group CTF (844 mε) (P<. 05). CONCLUSIONS Complete-arch implant frameworks designed for load application and fabricated by using the passive fit procedure decreased the strain between the frameworks and implants more than 1 piece prefabricated machined frameworks...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure {{marginal}} fit at cylinder-abutment interface, before and after overcasting procedure. A hexagonal implant was fixed to a stainless steel base and a Estheticone-like abutment used during all the experiment. Before casting procedure, gold (Group I) and Ni-Cr-Be (Group II) <b>premachined</b> cylinders were tightened to the abutment with gold and titanium screws (in both groups), with 10 Ncm and 20 Ncm torque values for the same screw type. Vertical measures were taken at the light microscope (Mitutoyo 5050, Tokyo, Japan) three times in six different parts along the abutment-cylinder interface for each torque value. Cylinders were overcast with Ag-Pd (Group I) or Ni-Cr-Be (Group II) alloy. After casting, the same measures and torque values were repeated. Intragroup differences (10 or 20 Ncm torque values, before and after casting) and intergroup differences (10 and 20 Ncm torque values, before or after casting) were analyzed by the Paired t Test; (p< 0. 05). Intragroup differences were observed for G-I (gold, 20 Ncm, titanium screw, p= 0. 044) and for G-II (Ni-Cr-Be, 10 Ncm, gold screw, p= 0. 002). Intergroup differences only were not observed in the G-II group (Ni-Cr-Be, 10 and 20 Ncm, titanium screw, p= 0. 534). Within the limits of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) Regardless of screw type, marginal misfit was higher for Ni-Cr-Be cylinders after casting, but within acceptable levels of fit; 2) The combination of gold cylinders with gold or titanium screws was the most effective to reduce marginal misfit; 3) Both screw types did not improve marginal fit of Ni-Cr-Be cylinders after overcastting, and 4) Although a 20 Ncm torque improved marginal fit in all situations, its use is not recommended due to the increased risk of prosthesis failure. Ni-Cr-Be alloys may be successfully used in single-tooth implant restorations, with no damage to the fit between abutment and prosthetic cylinder...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The ISOTRACE™ Super-Conducting Cyclotron is PMB-Alcen’s redeveloped and modernized {{version of}} Oxford Instrument’s OSCAR superconducting {{cyclotron}} [1]. Its extracted 80 + mi-croamperes of 12 MeV protons {{are used for}} the production of PET radioisotopes. Following the philosophy of Dickie, Stevenson, Szlavik [2] for minimizing dose to personnel, and as developed by Dehnel et al [3, 4], and Stokely et al [5], the ISOTRACE™ shall utilize an innovative, light-weight, integrated and self-supporting Mini-Beamline. This permits the relatively high residual radiation fields around PET targets to be moved ~ 1 metre away from the cyclotron, and facilitates the use of local shielding (around the targets) that limits prompt gammas and neutrons, but more importantly attenuates the residual target radiation, so that maintenance/research staff can work on the cyclotron in a relatively low activity environment. In addition, the mini-beamline for PET utilizes a compound quadrupole/steerer doublet that permits active and dynamic focusing/steering of the extracted proton beam for optimized production and minimized losses [3], so it improves on the successful work of Theroux et al [6]. The integrated beamline unit is extremely small, so that it is very unlike bulky traditional PET and SPECT beamlines that require substantial support structures, such as described by Dehnel in [7, 8]. Material and Methods The ISOTRACE™ cyclotron is pictured in FIG. 1. The exit port flange and gate valve to which the integrated mini-beamline for PET shall be mounted is shown. Immediately upstream of the exit port, hidden from view, is a 4 jaw collimator (called BPI for Beam Position Indicator) with spilled beam current readbacks to the control system. TABLE 1 shows the nominal beam emittance and Twiss parameter values at the exit port flange location. This ion-optical information is necessary to simulate ion beam transport, develop the mini-beamline, and determine a nominal tune (i. e. magnet settings). Results and Conclusion TABLE 2 shows the ion-optical system parameters. FIGS. 2 and 3 show the horizontal and vertical beam profiles. The Horizontally focusing Quadrupole magnet (HQ), and Vertically focusing Quadrupole magnet (VQ) aperture diameter, 33 mm, was chosen to give sufficient beam acceptance. The focusing strength is a function of BL, so the effective length, L = 150 mm, was chosen to ensure Bmax less than 0. 3 Tesla, while keeping overall magnet mass down. The quad-rupole magnets are fitted with water-cooled compound coils in which the copper/mylar strip wound portion of each coil is a winding for the quadrupole focusing function, and the wire wound portion is for the steering function. To increase beam acceptance and provide additional section strength for the pipe support function, the internal aperture of the low-activation aluminium beam pipe and the external shape are {{in the shape of a}} cross. FIG. 4 shows the beam crosssection at the mid-point of the downstream quadrupole magnet, and illustrates the additional acceptance as compared to a round beampipe. In order to machine the interior profile, the pipe is comprised of two <b>premachined</b> pieces that are friction stirwelded together. FIG. 5 is an isometric of the mini-beamline for PET. The four upstream HQ compound coils are excited with a 75 A power supply for the horizontally focusing quadrupole magnet function, and a ± 10 A power supply for a vertical steering function. The same power supplies are used for the four downstream VQ compound coils for the purpose of a vertically focusing quadrupole magnet function and horizontal steering function...|$|E
