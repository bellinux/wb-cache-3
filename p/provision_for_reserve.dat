5|$|In March 1935 {{the threat}} from Nazi Germany {{prompted}} a series of expansion schemes which pushed the number of squadrons up to 163 (as per Expansion Scheme M, the last before the outbreak of war) {{and the number of}} aircraft to 2,549. But it was never fully implemented, and Scheme F, 124 Squadrons and 1,736 aircraft, was the only scheme that ran its full course. It did produce modern aircraft and it made adequate <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> <b>reserves</b> (75 percent), but again, the bomber forces received no less than 50 percent which averaged 57 percent over all schemes. Maritime air units never made up more than 12 per cent of British air strength. From a pre-expansion strength of just five squadrons, four of which were flying boats, the figure of maritime squadrons rose to 18 by September 1939, with a strength of just 176 aircraft. Some 16 of these were allocated to trade defence, but given Trenchard's policy (which was still in place after his retirement) of developing bombers for the maritime arm which could bolster the air offensive, most were not specialised ASW aircraft, and the Air Ministry was thoroughly uninterested in any aircraft which fell outside the bomber function.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} submitted reservations when becoming parties to the Geneva Protocol, declaring that they only regarded the non-use obligations as applying with respect to other parties to the Protocol and/or that these obligations would cease to apply with respect to any state, or its allies, which used the prohibited weapons. Several Arab states also declared that their ratification did not constitute recognition of, or diplomatic relations with, Israel, or that the provision of the Protocol were not binding with respect to Israel. Generally, reservations not only modify treaty <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>reserving</b> party, but also symmetrically modify the <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> previously ratifying parties {{in dealing with the}} reserving party. Subsequently, numerous states have withdrawn their reservations, including the former Czechoslovakia in 1990 prior to its dissolution.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the relationship of managerial compensation to the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses. This study discusses the arguments that have made the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses an intuitively appealing concept within the broad agency literature, and, based on these arguments, conducts empirical tests aimed at determining whether managerial compensation does relate to the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses. ^ The most current means of studying the income-compensation relationship, the compensation coefficients, makes finding a good understanding of managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan loss <b>reserves</b> an important goal. The loan loss provision is hypothesized to be a function of loan quality and managerial compensation. If internal and external parties interested in bank performance and reporting better understand the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses, more efficient labor contracts can be written and financial performance and reporting should be improved. ^ The structure of the empirical tests flows from the argument that earnings management represents a cost to shareholders. This argument rests {{on the assumption that the}} <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses specifically plays a central role in managerial compensation at financial institutions. Recent work in agency theory is utilized to construct the setting in which the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses is tested for its ability to influence earnings. The empirical model constructed is a multiple regression equation with the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan loss as the dependent variable, and asset equity, income and compensation item as independent variables. ^ The empirical results show that the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses is much like the arguments would suggest. Although assets, equity and income are the dominant factors in explaining the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses, managerial compensation plays a role in explaining the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the loss given default (LGD) {{determinants}} in case of a typical loan portfolio consisting of SME loans in a commercial bank operating in one of the quickly developing banking markets, i. e. in Slovenia. Accurate LGD estimates of defaulted bank claims are important <b>for</b> <b>provisioning</b> <b>reserves</b> <b>for</b> credit losses, calculating adequate risk capital and determining fair pricing risky bank loans. While most of the empirical literature in the field concentrates on corporate bond markets to estimate losses in the event of default, we use a unique individual bank data set on SME loan losses. Due to the proprietary nature of data only few studies of this kind have been published so far and to our knowledge none of them covers the Eastern European banking markets. In the first stage of the analysis we estimate the LGD variable by applying the discounted cash flow approach, while in the second stage we analyse its determinants by using the ordinal regression analysis. Our findings suggest that reliable LGD estimates can be produced by discounting expected loan related future cash flows and that explanatory factors, such as type of collateral, type of industrial sector, last available loan rating, size of the debt and loan maturity satisfactorily explicate variability of the LGD variable in the specific banking market. All the results are not only relevant to the impairment policy determination and capital adequacy calculation in the specific bank, but also to the evaluation of SME loans characteristics in developing markets...|$|R

60|$|There {{would be}} {{adequate}} motives {{for a certain}} amount of saving, even if capital yielded no profit. There would be an inducement to lay by in good times a <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> bad; to <b>reserve</b> something <b>for</b> sickness and infirmity, or as a means of leisure and independence {{in the latter part of}} life, or a help to children in the outset of it. Savings, however, which have only these ends in view, have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence. The savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life, or to make a <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> children or others, independent of their exertions. Now, to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self-denial; which again depends on the rate of profit. And there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer, or of leaving others better off than themselves. Any accumulation, therefore, by which the general capital is increased, requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profit—a rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence, with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk.|$|R
50|$|Hoddle {{arrived in}} Port Phillip the future site for Melbourne, in March 1837 and was {{appointed}} senior surveyor with his assistants D'Arcy and Darke; {{he was to}} take charge of the surveying work which had been begun by Robert Russell. Whether Hoddle planned Melbourne or used Russell's ideas has been a subject of controversy. Hoddle's first map of Melbourne, completed on 25 March 1837, covered the area from Flinders Street to Lonsdale Street, and from Spencer Street to Spring Street. The principal streets were made one and a half chains wide (30 m), and the smaller, then intended merely to furnish back entrances, a half chain wide (10 m). Later Hoddle provided for wide exits from the city such as Wellington and Victoria parades, and the continuation from Elizabeth Street to Sydney and Mount Alexander roads. He also made <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> squares and <b>reserves</b> in the city itself and in the immediate suburbs. He was in no way responsible for the narrow streets which later were formed in Fitzroy, Collingwood and Richmond. These were made when comparatively large areas were subdivided by their owners.|$|R
40|$|With {{wind power}} {{penetration}} increasing in many systems worldwide, operational issues {{are beginning to}} emerge due to the uncertain nature of wind power.

40|$|This {{addendum}} provides revisions and {{addition to}} the May 2008 proposal (attached) on the Direct Strength Prediction of Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) Beam-Columns. This addendum provides a revised statement of work to provide a clear separation between Year 1 {{of the project and}} the out years. This addendum also includes a revised and updated Year 1 budget. 1. Background In {{addition to the}} background provided on the Direct Strength Method (DSM) in the 2008 proposal two additional new points worthy of mentioning have emerged: (1) Recently adopted DSM <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> inelastic <b>reserve</b> in bending allow for beams to have reliably predicted DSM strength in bending greater than My, where appropriate. This opens up additional space in the strength of beam-columns that the new provisions should explore taking advantage of under any loading condition. (2) The new CFS-NEES project (same PI as this project, see www. ce. jhu. edu/cfsnees) is developing a frame element appropriate for analysis of CFS. This element should incorporate the findings of this research and vastly increases the potential impact of the work – not only will code provisions result, but a new element {{that can be used in}} (frame) analysis. 2. Statement of Work The objective of the research remains the same as in the 2008 proposal, but is worth restating: Objective: The development and verification of a design method for beam-columns that explicitly and directly considers the applied actions, including axial loads and biaxial bending, in uniquely determining the stability and strength of a member under those actions.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{in the absence of a}} {{complete}} set of markets or under conditions of monopoly and imperfect competition, optimal provision of quality can not be taken for granted. Market set in the restructured electricity markets is not complete, physical networks per definition are natural monopolies, market-power issues are yet to be resolved, not all the services supplied through the restructured frameworks are private goods and risk of government intervention is high during the times when market prices signal shortages. Sole reliance on the energy-only markets <b>for</b> optimal <b>provision</b> of security of supply under such conditions is mistaken. On the other hand, centralisation of decisions <b>for</b> <b>provision</b> of <b>reserve</b> capacity, such as the gas-reserve capacity proposal in the Norwegian system is not an efficient substitute for missing or imperfect markets. The solution lies in the design of permanent market-mechanisms that enhance the ability of energy-only markets to handle the medium and long-term security of supply.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new stochastic framework <b>for</b> <b>provision</b> of <b>reserve</b> requirements (spinning and non-spinning reserves) {{as well as}} energy in day-ahead simultaneous auctions by pool-based aggregated market scheme. The uncertainty of generating units {{in the form of}} system contingencies are considered in the market clearing procedure by the stochastic model. The solution methodology consists of two stages, which firstly, employs Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) for random scenario generation. Then, the stochastic market clearing procedure is implemented as a series of deterministic optimization problems (scenarios) including non-contingent scenario and different post-contingency states. The objective function of each of these deterministic optimization problems consists of offered cost function (including both energy and reserves offer costs), Lost Opportunity Cost (LOC) and Expected Interruption Cost (EIC). Each optimization problem is solved considering AC power flow and security constraints of the power system. The model is applied to the IEEE 24 -bus Reliability Test System (IEEE 24 -bus RTS) and simulation studies are carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa—the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft {{in the first month}} of fighting. Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no <b>provisions</b> were made <b>for</b> <b>reserves</b> of men or equipment. But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow. After the long, but successful, Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it {{to be one of the}} major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the Battle of Moscow. Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the French invasion of Russia in 1812.|$|R
