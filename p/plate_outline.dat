40|$|Goal. Weight at {{delivery}} {{is a standard}} cumulative measure of placental growth. But weight is a crude summary of other placental characteristics, such as {{the size and shape}} of the chorionic plate and the location of the um-bilical cord insertion. Distributions of such measures across a cohort reveal information about the developmental history of the chorionic plate that is unavailable from an analysis based solely on the mean and standard devia-tion. Methods & Materials. Various measures were determined from digitized images of chorionic plates obtained from the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nu-trition Study, a prospective cohort study of preterm birth in central North Carolina between 2002 and 2004. The centroids (the geometric centers) and umbilical cord insertions were taken directly from the images. The chori-onic <b>plate</b> <b>outlines</b> were obtained from an interpolation based on a Fourier series, while eccentricity (of the best-fit ellipse), skewness, and kurtosis were determined from a shape analysis using the method of moments. The dis-tribution of each variable was compared against the normal, lognormal, and Lévy distributions. Results. We found only a single measure (eccentricity) with a normal dis-tribution. All other placental measures required lognormal or “heavy-tailed” distributions to account for moderate to extreme deviations from the mean, where relative likelihoods in the cohort far exceeded those of a normal dis-tribution. Conclusions. Normal and lognormal distributions result from the accumu-lated effects of a large number of independent additive (normal) or multi-plicative (lognormal) events.

40|$|A general {{algorithm}} for the prioritization {{and selection}} of plates for high-throughput screening is presented.

The complex and heterogeneous nature of boundary regions between major <b>plates</b> is <b>outlined</b> {{with reference to the}} Mediterranean and the Himalayas. Relatively aseismic regions have traditionally been defined as microplates but although they are presently acting as rigid blocks undergoing slow deformation, it is argued that this need not always have been the case, and that deformation may simply have moved elsewhere. Broad zones of deformation surrounding rigid blocks are highlighted as fundamental to the analysis and interpretation of continental tectonics. Detailed theoretical consideration is given to the kinematics of distributed formation and the dynamics of continental deformation. -A. J. Barke...|$|R

40|$|In {{almost every}} parish church in East Sussex there survive {{examples}} of commemorative art - ledger stones on the floor, wall-mounted inscriptions and monumental brasses {{and numbers of}} substantial carved-stone funeral monuments standing in chancels and family chapels. Never previously studied as a group, these objects cast dramatic light on the social, religious and family histories of the county. The media and artistic techniques involved in making these works of monumental art are many and varied: they are sculpted, engraved, cast and painted in stone, brass, iron and wood and are of interest to students of local history and of art and architecture. Some Sussex monuments were made locally, with important centres of production in Lewes and in the Weald where the celebrated cast-iron floor slabs were turned out. Other works were made outside the county and brought in, probably by water transport, from London and sometimes {{from as far away}} as continental Europe. At the heart of this volume is a set of catalogue entries, each one dedicated to one of the 1409 items that have been identified as a result of extensive field-work in 144 East Sussex churches. The whole project represents the largest published regional survey of English monumental art ever attempted.

40|$|The tightly curved Banda Arc (eastern Indonesia) plays {{a pivotal}} role in the {{convergent}} interaction of the Eurasian, Australian, and Pacific plates. Historically there have been two opposing hypotheses regarding its origin: either the arc has been formed by two opposite-dipping subduction zones joining at the apex, or a single slab has been wrought in its current position by surface kinematics and mantle processes. Using detailed tectonic reconstructions and mantle tomography, the latter view has recently gained substantial support by the work of Spakman and Hall (2010). Through numerical modelling of the instantaneous dynamics of the intricate subducting system, the research presented here aims to determine the factors that control the evolution of the single slab, but also to provide insight into the complexities of instantaneous numerical modelling of subduction in general. To aid the construction of very complex model geometries, we have developed a tool that allows us to digitally draw faults, slab sections, and <b>plate</b> <b>outlines</b> based on tomography, surface topography, and Wadati-Benioff zone geometry. The tool communicates with the finite element mesh generator, which then gives a composite mesh with highly desirable properties. Our results give a basic one-slab-model that satisfies both the predictions of the Spakman and Hall model and the stress state from CMT solutions and seismic fast directions. Better agreement can be attained by varying the buoyancy structure, to which the behavior of the model is found to be rather sensitive. Additionally, we propose that a mantle flow component is required {{in order to maintain the}} northern slab limb in the case that it has detached from the surface lithosphere. In the absence of flow-induced resistance, our results suggests that further convergent motion can effect a transition towards large-scale slab detachment progressing southward if there is little buoyant support at the d 660 phase transition...|$|R
