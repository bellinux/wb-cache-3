In this thesis, we present an IEEE 802. 11 e compatible power-efficient MAC protocol to improve the on-demand polling (ODP) scheme. In the ODP scheme, if two consecutive QoS Null frames are received by a QoS AP (QAP), the corresponding QoS station (QSTA) will {{be removed from the}} <b>polling</b> <b>list.</b> The proposed Power-Efficient Polling (PEP) scheme uses both the polling-based (HCCA) and contention-based (EDCA) channel access over the hybrid coordination function (HCF) mechanism. A QAP maintains a <b>polling</b> <b>list</b> dynamically. All QSTAs in the <b>polling</b> <b>list</b> are assured active.

3000|$|Conventionally, {{contention-based}} channel access schemes {{have been}} used for LP data transmission whereas [...] "polling" [...] and thereby dedicated channel access schemes have been thought of as the most appropriate way of transmitting HP (delay-sensitive) data. It is a well-established fact that if a MAC layer protocol has to cater to various types of traffic (both HP and LP), it is imperative that it employs both contention-based and polling channel access mechanisms. Thus, our fair MAC scheme alternates between a contention-based channel access mechanism, which we refer to as the CP, and a polling-based channel access scheme, which we refer to as the CFP as shown in Figure 6. Our system offers channel access opportunities to both traffic types (HP and LP) during the contention period, allocating higher preference to the HP traffic to grab the channel over the LP traffic. However, deviating from the norm, during the CFP, LP traffic is included in the <b>polling</b> <b>list</b> and thus polled by the HC along with the HP traffic. The duration of the CFP is equally distributed to allocate transmission time for all traffic flows in the network. The polling scheme is implemented in a circular queue such that all traffic flows gets polled almost equally. The HC, co-located with the AP, polls every station in the <b>polling</b> <b>list</b> starting with the traffic flow which has the highest priority and subsequently servicing the traffic flows on the <b>polling</b> <b>list</b> in the descending priority order till the lowest priority traffic flow is served. The HP flows still retain their precedence in the queue over the LP flows. However, such dedicated service during the CFP incentivizes LP traffic to deter from falsely classifying itself as HP and thus preserves system sanctity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — in this paper, {{we present}} a new policy for admitting Voice over IP (VoIP) {{sessions}} over wireless networks. Our pro-posed policy receives the admission information advertised by the VoIP gateway on the wired network, and uses it to decide whether a new VoIP session can be admitted or not. The proposed policy can be easily integrated with the current Call Admission Control algorithms used in wireless networks. We show that implementing the proposed policy increases the number of successful VoIP ses-sions admitted to the access point <b>polling</b> <b>list,</b> thus improving the wireless network utilization.

In particular, three key issues are discussed: managing a <b>polling</b> <b>list,</b> determining the polling sequence, and reducing polling overhead. These discussions motivate the proposal of an isochronous coordination function (ICF) for transporting voice packets over IEEE 802. 11 WLANs, which combines the advantages {{of some of the}} previous protocols.

40|$|Absrrad-Polling bused PCF is the {{optional}} channel access mode in MAC sub-layer of IEEE 802. 11 WLAN. The detnil of <b>polling</b> <b>list</b> arrangement is not defined in standards, and traditional Round Robin (RR) polling scheme is inefficient for pncketized voice transmission. This paper proposes two adaptive <b>polling</b> <b>list</b> arrangement schemes {{in order to}} decrease the average delay of voice packets, by means of reducing the possibility of null polls. One scheme is called Dynamic Descending Array (DDA), which resets the polling array after each bencon {{at the beginning of}} contention free period, in a descending order according to the number of packets queued in stations ' buffers. The other scheme combines RR and our DDA to further avoid waiting too long for some station, which is termed as Hybrid DDA and RR (HDR). The improvement of DDA and HDR on delay performance of our schemes is testified in dissimilar simulation scenarios,which nssume different indoor wireless channel quality, nehvork scale, traffic load and polling access policies e tc It is shown that the proposed DDA and HDR schemes outperform RR scheme from the delay viewpoint What's more, HDR works extremely well with gated access policy, when the signal-to-noise ratio of wireless channel is low and the network traffic load is high. I. INtRODUCTlON The IEEE 802. 11 wireless local area network (WLAN) [I] is gaining popularity for data applications in campus networks. While the use of 802. 11 LANs for Intemet applications, most commercially available offerings only implement the 802. 1 1 mode of operation that supports data services, called Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) mode, and not the second 802. 11 mode of operation designed for real-time senices. called the Point Coordination Function (PCF) [2] DCF is contention based channel access mode. where wireless terminals contend for the shared medium in a distributed manner according to- the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (C S W C A) protocols.

30|$|In the {{proposed}} mechanism, shown in Table 3, the operations at QAP {{can be divided}} into two major parts, TXOP duration calculation part (line 6 - 11) and checking for resource availability part (line 13 - 17). The first part composes of four steps for a particular flow i: (1) evaluate an event of the current flow, (2) evaluate a next state, (3) calculate a granted TXOP duration, and (4) calculate the sum of granted TXOP durations. Each step is a constant time, O(1). Let n be the number of active flows in the <b>polling</b> <b>list.</b> Therefore, the computational complexity for the first part is O(n). For checking resource availability shown in the second part, if the condition is valid (not enough resource), QAP will set the TXOP duration for all flows. The complexity in this part becomes O(n). Otherwise, the complexity is O(1). Thus, the overall computational complexity of {{the proposed}} mechanism becomes O(n).|$|E

30|$|The HCCA {{mechanism}} {{was proposed}} in the IEEE 802.11 e amendment [1] to improve the PCF scheme. It {{is based on a}} round-robin scheme and it is intended to guarantee bounded delay requirements. Like the PCF scheme, the PC also polls all the stations in the <b>polling</b> <b>list,</b> even though some stations may not have messages to transmit. When the PC polls a station that has no packets to transfer, the station will transmit a null frame. As a consequence, the polling overhead is roughly equal to the time interval from sending the polling frame till the end of the ACK frame [26]. A number of improvements have been recently proposed to reduce the HCCA polling overhead. For instance, Gao et al. [27] proposed a new admission control framework to replace the traditional CSMA mechanism. It uses the mean data rate and the mean packet-size values to calculate the resource needed by each message flow. Thus, this new mechanism is particularly adequate when dealing with variable resource bit rate (VBR) traffic over HCCA.|$|E
40|$|Deployment of {{wireless}} local area networks (WLANs) is growing consistently and demanding {{the support of}} multimedia applications with acceptable quality of service (QoS). This is attracting the interest of researchers globally. Under the optimum QoS, a number of VoIP calls can be supported by a WLAN. Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and Point Coordination Function (PCF), two MAC protocols specified in the IEEE 802. 11 standard have upper bound on VoIP connections. Under DCF mode 12 calls and in 20 calls in PCF mode[1, 2, 3, 4]. In this paper we are proposing an access media mechanism in which audio data is transmitted in PCF mode and best-effort traffic in DCF mode. In the proposed access media mechanism, <b>polling</b> <b>list</b> is dynamically updated so that only those stations are polled which have voice packets ready to transmit. We have proposed a multi-queued MAC architecture for the access point. We considered voice traffic in CBR mode.
