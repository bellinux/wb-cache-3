5|$|The cellars {{under the}} Houses of Parliament {{continued}} to be leased out to private individuals until 1678, when news of the Popish Plot broke. It was then considered <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> search the cellars {{on the day before}} each State Opening of Parliament, a ritual that survives to this day.|$|E
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{requisition}} promised to the legions, Germanicus paid {{them out of}} his own pocket. All 8 legions were given money, even if they didn't demand it. Both the armies of the Lower and Upper Rhine had returned to order. It seemed <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> satisfy the armies, but Germanicus took it a step further. In a bid to secure the loyalty of his troops, he led them on a raid against the Marsi, a Germanic people on the upper Ruhr river. Germanicus massacred the villages of the Marsi he encountered and pillaged the surrounding territory. On the way back to their winter quarters at Castra Vetera, they pushed successfully through the opposing tribes (Bructeri, Tubantes, and Usipetes) between the Marsi and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|When {{municipal}} graveyards {{began to}} overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries. Ware {{began with an}} agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government. Ware eventually concluded {{that it was not}} <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land, grant it in perpetuity, and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British. The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions, were accessible by public road, were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages. Similar negotiations began with the Belgian government.|$|E

5|$|After Rajrajeshwori {{took over}} the regency, she was {{pressured}} by Knox to pay the annual pension of 82,000 rupees to the ex-King as per the obligations of the treaty, which paid off the vast debt that Rana Bahadur Shah had accumulated in Varanasi due to his spendthrift habits. The Nepalese court also felt it <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> keep Rana Bahadur in isolation in Nepal itself, {{rather than in the}} British controlled India, and that paying off Rana Bahadur's debts could facilitate his return at an opportune moment. Rajrajeshowri's presence in Kathmandu also stirred unrest among the courtiers that aligned themselves around her and Subarnaprabha. Sensing an imminent hostility, Knox aligned himself with Subarnaprabha and attempted to interfere with the internal politics of Nepal. Getting a wind of this matter, Rajrajeshowri dissolved the government and elected new ministers, with Damodar Pande as the mul kaji, while the Resident Knox, finding himself persona non grata and the objectives of his mission frustrated, voluntarily left Kathmandu to reside in Makwanpur citing a cholera epidemic. Subarnaprabha and the members of her faction were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Though some emperors, such as Justin I and Justinian I, took low-born wives, dynastic intermarriages in {{imperial}} {{families were}} not {{unusual in the}} Byzantine Empire. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, the ruling families, the Laskarides and then the Palaiologoi, thought it <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> marry into foreign dynasties. One early example is the marriage of John Doukas Vatatzes with Constance, the daughter of Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire to seal their alliance. After establishing an alliance with the Mongols in 1263, Michael VIII Palaiologos married two of his daughters to Mongol khans to cement their agreement: his daughter Euphrosyne Palaiologina was married to Nogai Khan of the Golden Horde, and his daughter Maria Palaiologina, was married to Abaqa Khan of the Ilkhanate. Later in the century, Andronikos II Palaiologos agreed martial alliances with Ghazan of the Ilkhanate and Toqta and Uzbeg of the Golden Horde, which were quickly followed by weddings with his daughters.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{fires and}} {{insufficient}} insurance left the retail enterprise with only $1,000 left of its stock. In 1853 <b>Prudent</b> moved alone <b>to</b> Los Angeles, and succeeded in regaining a respectable amount of floating capital. In 1854 <b>Prudent</b> decided <b>to</b> invest in capital assets {{in addition to}} his retail store. He bought different tracts of land, which constituted the [...] "Beaudry Blocks".

25|$|The {{longevity}} of human space-faring technological society is uncertain, {{and it would}} be <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> start a directed panspermia program promptly.

25|$|The most {{authoritative}} source on {{the first}} Christianization of the Rus' is an encyclical letter of Patriarch Photius, datable to early 867. Referencing the Rus'-Byzantine War of 860, Photius informs the Oriental patriarchs and bishops that, after the Bulgars turned to Christ in 863, the Rus' followed suit so zealously that he found it <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> send to their land a bishop.|$|E
25|$|Although these {{treatments}} are very successful (in slowing or stopping further vision loss), {{they do not}} cure diabetic retinopathy. Caution should be exercised in treatment with laser surgery since it causes a loss of retinal tissue. It is often more <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> inject triamcinolone or anti-VEGF drugs. In some patients it results in a marked increase of vision, especially {{if there is an}} edema of the macula.|$|E

25|$|Considerable {{material}} {{is used to}} make up lightning protection systems, so it is <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> consider carefully where an air terminal will provide the greatest protection. Historical understanding of lightning, from statements made by Ben Franklin, assumed that each lightning rod protected a cone of 45 degrees.

A number of premiership players left the club and the Tigers faced a rebuilding period.|$|E

25|$|If the diver has {{difficulty}} locating the demand valve by these methods, the octopus DV or bailout set {{can be used}} in the interim. Occasionally the DV will get snagged {{in such a way that}} cannot be easily recovered. In some cases it may be <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> abort the dive and surface, but sometimes this is not practicable and it may be necessary to remove the harness partially or completely to recover the primary, after which the harness can be readjusted.|$|E
25|$|One aspect {{that arose}} {{during the early}} stages of the design process was the {{consideration}} that Boeing would be responsible for the final assembly of the aircraft. At the time, Lockheed Martin was making the mid-fuselage at its plant in Fort Worth, Texas, while assembling the plane in Marietta, Georgia. However, since Boeing was responsible for the manufacturing of parts of the fuselage and more crucially, the wings—as well as integrating the avionics—it was considered <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> give final assembly to Boeing.|$|E
25|$|In September 1906, the Buford {{was sent}} to rescue over 600 {{passengers}} and crew from the SS Mongolia, which had pierced her hull after running aground at Midway Island. Before Buford arrived on the scene, the Mongolia's crew had freed her. However, the two ship captains determined it <b>prudent</b> <b>to</b> send the passengers back on Buford. To ensure the safe arrival of Mongolias crew, should the passenger steamer's bilge pumps fail {{to keep pace with}} the leaks, the Buford escorted her during the five-day return to Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|Since it is {{accepted}} that ion suppression {{has the potential}} to affect the other analytical parameters of any assay, a <b>prudent</b> approach <b>to</b> any LC-MS method development should include an evaluation of ion-suppression.

50|$|It is <b>prudent</b> not <b>to</b> {{eliminate}} any candidate SWOT entry too quickly. The importance of individual SWOTs will be {{revealed by the}} value of the strategies they generate.
