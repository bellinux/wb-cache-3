The width of the peaks {{is determined by the}} resolution of the detector, a very important characteristic of gamma spectroscopic detectors, and high resolution enables the spectroscopist to separate two gamma lines that are close to each other. Gamma spectroscopy systems are designed and adjusted to produce symmetrical peaks of the best possible resolution. The <b>peak</b> <b>shape</b> is usually a Gaussian distribution.

Various solvents were tested including water, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, propan- 2 -ol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and a number of combinations of them. For the analysis of small MW compounds, best <b>peak</b> <b>shapes</b> were obtained with sample dissolved in pure ACN but, IPA or a mixture of ACN/IPA (50 : 50, v/v) could represent a viable alternative in the case of solubility issues with pure ACN. For drug discovery applications, DMSO can be employed but in combination with at least 80 % of ACN. For peptides analysis, acetonitrile, EtOH and IPA as sample diluents, provided similar chromatographic profiles, but pure EtOH or IPA were recommended to limit denaturation and samples solubility issues.

In HILIC they can {{also contribute to the}} polarity of the analyte, resulting in differential changes in retention. For extremely polar analytes (e.g. aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin) or Adenosine triphosphate), higher concentrations of buffer (ca. 100mM) are required to assure that the analyte will be in a single ionic form. Otherwise asymmetric <b>peak</b> <b>shape,</b> chromatographic tailing, and/or poor recovery from the stationary phase will be observed.

The following sources of peak broadening are listed in reference: dislocations, stacking faults, twinning, microstresses, grain boundaries, sub-boundaries, coherency strain, chemical heterogeneities, and crystallite smallness.

Rod sets with exact geometries that have quadrupole and octopole fields only in the potential, and round rod sets, with multipoles up to N = 10 (the twenty pole term) included in the calculations, show the same stability boundaries, island positions, and <b>peak</b> <b>shapes.</b> With the DC voltage applied to the rods so that the Mathieu parameter a 0, the resolution and transmission are poor preventing conventional mass analysis. In principle, mass analysis in an island is possible with operation at either of two tips.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of parameters influencing <b>peak</b> <b>shapes</b> in ion-exchange open tubular (OT) capillary electrochromatography (CEC) was conducted using adsorbed quaternary aminated latex particles as the stationary phase. The combination of separation mechanisms from both capillary electrophoresis and ion-exchange chromatography results in peak broadening in OT-CEC arising from both these techniques. The sources of peak broadening that were considered included the relative electrophoretic mobilities of the eluent co-ion and analyte, and resistance to mass transfer in both the mobile and stationary phases. The parameters investigated were the mobility of the eluent co-ion, column diameter, separation temperature and secondary interactions between the analyte and the stationary phase. The electromigration dispersion was found to influence <b>peak</b> <b>shapes</b> to a minor extent, indicating that chromatographic retention was the dominant source of dispersion. Improving the resistance to mass transfer in the mobile phase by decreasing the capillary diameter improved <b>peak</b> <b>shapes,</b> with symmetrical <b>peaks</b> being obtained in a 25 μm I.

A pulsed lens has been developed to reduce the velocity spread of ions in matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) ion sources, with the aim to increase sensitivity in orthogonal acceleration TOF mass analysers. The system gave an increase in sensitivity of approximately five times over a range of masses, however instrument resolving power was reduced. A rotating sample stage was developed for MALDI mass spectrometers which offers the potential of high sample density, high positional accuracy and repeatability, and low seek times. The system involves reading the position of a disk mounted with MALDI sample spots and timing the laser pulse to coincide with spot availability at an aperture.
