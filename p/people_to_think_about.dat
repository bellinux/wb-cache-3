5|$|Attitudes toward race in America {{began to}} change after the war, which had caused social and {{political}} upheaval and prompted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the future with more ambition and confidence. Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E
25|$|Agentic-personal self principle: When identity-fused {{individuals}} become strongly {{aligned with}} a group, they {{are assumed to}} maintain an active and agentic personal self, even when the social self is activated. Consistent with this idea, activating the personal self by increasing physiological arousal, or encouraging <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how they would react if they were personally threatened, may increase the person's endorsement of extreme pro-group sacrifices. In contrast, the social identification perspective assumes that the personal and social selves are hydraulically related to one another. As such, activating the personal self should diminish endorsement of pro-group behavior. However, {{this was not the}} case for strongly fused individuals, who actually demonstrated the exact opposite effect.|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and {{many members of the}} Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the [...] "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap." [...] Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a [...] "sleaze joint", as advantageous to the Village.|$|E

500|$|According to Ocias, {{the main}} themes of Loved were of {{dominance}} and power, but {{to provide a}} fuller answer would [...] "defy {{the point of the}} game". His intentions in making the game were to get <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the games they were playing—a direction he found much of the video game industry shying away from. The confrontational aspect of the game was motivated by two aspects: primarily to use [...] "the resource of emotions" [...] invoked by its risk and reward mechanic; and secondly to absorb the awareness of people online. Expanding upon his inspirations, Ocias cited individual games such as The Last Guardian and , along with companies such as Thatgamecompany and Eidos Montréal, as showing [...] "greater depth" [...] to video games as well as experimentation and research. Ocias ultimately stated that while he dislikes [...] "force-feeding" [...] players, he would try to take a different approach both mechanically and thematically for his next game.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, [...] Charlotte vanOyen Witvliet [...] asked <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{someone who}} had hurt, wronged, or {{offended}} them. As they thought to answer, she observed their reaction. She observed their blood pressure, heart rate, facial muscle tension, and sweat gland activity. To deliberate on an old misdemeanor is to practice unforgiveness. Interestingly enough, the outcome to the recall of the grudge the candidates’ blood pressure and heart rate increased, and they sweated more. Pondering about their resents was stressful, and subjects found the rumination unpleasant. When they adept forgiveness, their physical stimulation glided downward. They showed no more of an anxiety reaction than normal wakefulness produces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{college has}} {{sponsored}} panels on unusual {{topics such as}} face transplants (2009). Allegheny professors have joined highly visible initiatives; for example, Allegheny professor Michael Maniates, described as the [...] "nation's leading authority {{on the politics of}} consumption," [...] joined the board of a project about the twenty-minute film The Story of Stuff by filmmaker Annie Leonard, and generated headlines. Dr. Maniates said [...] "We really need to think of ways of making it possible for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> working less and getting by on less." [...] At present, environmental concerns are important at Allegheny, which in 2008 worked with Siemens to devise a [...] "total energy use reduction plan" [...] for the college.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{thousand}} independence supporters protested at the BBC Scotland headquarters, {{accusing the}} BBC of broadcasting pro-Union [...] "propaganda" [...] and [...] "lies".

Alastair Campbell said that the [...] "organised protests" [...] amounted to media censorship [...] "not far off" [...] Vladimir Putin's Russia, telling Twitter users they should [...] "Vote YES for intimidation". The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) asked <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the implications of alleging journalistic bias when its members were only asking difficult questions.

2500|$|In October 2008, John Bohannon of Science {{magazine}} {{assembled a}} team to review the game's portrayal of evolution and other scientific concepts. Evolutionary biologists T. Ryan Gregory of the University of Guelph and Niles Elredge of the American Museum of Natural History reviewed the Cell and Creature stages. William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist from the U.S. National Science Foundation, reviewed the Tribe and Civilization stages. NASA's Miles Smith reviewed the Space Stage. The Science team evaluated Spore on twenty-two subjects. The game's grades ranged from a single A in galactic structure and a B+ in sociology to Fs in mutation, sexual selection, natural selection, genetics, and genetic drift. In addition, Yale evolutionary biologists Thomas Near and Thomas Prum found Spore fun to play and admired its ability to get <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> evolutionary questions, but consider the game's evolutionary mechanism to be [...] "severely messed up.". With this noted, study of how players make meaning with the game suggest that the game prompts more sophisticated thinking about evolution than the model the game presents.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pedreira and Costa, few Portuguese monarchs have {{as large}} {{a place in}} the popular {{imagination}} as Dom João VI. That image is very varied, [...] "but rarely for good reason. ... It is not strange that the tribulations of his marriage and family life and the references to his personality and personal customs, inviting easy caricature and circulation of an unflattering, if not comic, tradition." [...] The king is popularly shown as indolent, silly and clumsy, subjugated by a shrewish wife, a disgusting glutton who always had baked chicken in his coat pockets to eat them at any time with greasy hands, a version typified by the Brazilian film Carlota Joaquina – Princesa do Brasil (1995), a parody mixed with sharp social criticism. That work had enormous repercussions, but, according to the critical commentary of Ronaldo Vainfas, [...] "it is a story full of errors of all types, misrepresentations, imprecisions, inventions"; for historian Luiz Carlos Villalta, [...] "it constitutes a broad attack on historical knowledge", in contrast to director Carla Camurati's stated intent [...] "to produce a cinematic narrative that would constitute a type of historical novel with pedagogic function and, at the same time, would offer the viewer knowledge of the past and would help, as a <b>people,</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the present. It does not offer new historical knowledge to the viewer, even if one were to treat history as a novel: it reinforces, in truth, the ideas that the viewers bring, being zero in terms of increased knowledge... In this way, it leads the viewer more to debauchery than to critical reflection on the history of Brazil".|$|E

6000|$|... "You ask {{me whether}} {{this land is}} happy; but must we not first decide what {{happiness}} is? And how difficult this will be you shall soon discover. For example, {{in the early days}} of the Great Skirmish, happiness was reputed non-existent; every family was plunged into anxiety or mourning; and, though this to my own knowledge was not the case, such as were not pretended to be. Yet, strange as it may appear, the shrewd observer of those days was unable to remark any indication of added gloom. Certain creature comforts, no doubt, were scarce, but there was no lack of spiritual comfort, which high minds have ever associated with happiness; nor do I here allude to liquor. What, then, was the nature of this spiritual comfort, you will certainly be asking. I will tell you, and in seven words: People forgot themselves and remembered other people. Until those days it had never been realised what a lot of medical men could be spared from the civil population; what a number of clergymen, lawyers, stockbrokers, artists, writers, politicians, and other persons, whose work in life is to cause <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> themselves, never would be missed. Invalids knitted socks and forgot to be unwell; old gentlemen read the papers and forgot to talk about their food; people travelled in trains and forgot not to fall into conversation with each other; merchants became special constables and forgot to differ about property; the House of Lords remembered its dignity and forgot its impudence; the House of Commons almost forgot to chatter. The case of the working man was the most striking of all--he forgot he was the working man. The very dogs forgot themselves, though that, to be sure, was no novelty, as the Irish writer demonstrated in his terrific outburst: 'On my doorstep.' But time went on, and hens in their turn forgot to lay, ships to return to port, cows to give enough milk, and Governments to look ahead, till the first flush of self-forgetfulness which had dyed peoples' cheeks----" ...|$|E
