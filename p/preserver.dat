5|$|Protecteur was {{decommissioned}} at {{a farewell}} ceremony on 14 May 2015. Plans for replacing Protecteur {{and her sister}} ship, <b>Preserver,</b> were first brought up in 2004. Lack of spare parts for the ship's boiler {{and the fact that}} she is a single-skinned tanker were the main driving points to replacing Protecteur and <b>Preserver.</b>|$|E
5|$|Artanis {{decided to}} launch an {{expedition}} to rescue the <b>preserver,</b> but didn't know where to start. Mohandar, however, believed he knew where Zamara was going – Ehlna, a Nerazim sanctuary moon. There, the Nerazim, who had no preservers, used modified khaydarin crystals to store memories.|$|E
5|$|In 2503, Mohandar {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Hierarchy to discuss Zamara, a missing <b>preserver.</b> There were none on Shakuras. A terran female, Rosemary Dahl, attended the meeting, along with Vartanil (a survivor from Aiur) and Executor Selendis; she was subject to protoss anti-female bias (due to their experiences with Sarah Kerrigan). Among the topics of conversation covered were Ulrezaj, a powerful dark archon and old enemy of the Khalai. During the meeting, Mohandar deferred to the judgment of Hierarch Artanis.|$|E
40|$|We study new {{classes of}} linear <b>preservers</b> between C^*-algebras and JB^*-triples. Let E and F be JB^*-triples with ∂_e (E_ 1). We prove that every linear map T:E→ F {{strongly}} preserving Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible elements is a triple homomorphism. Among the consequences, we establish that, given two unital C^*-algebras A and B, for each linear map T strongly preserving Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible elements, then {{there exists a}} Jordan ^*-homomorphism S: A→ B satisfying T(x) = T(1) S(x), for every x∈ A. We also study the connections between linear maps strongly preserving Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertibility and other clases of linear <b>preservers</b> between C^*-algebras like Bergmann-zero pairs <b>preservers,</b> Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertibility <b>preservers</b> and extreme points <b>preservers...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Preservers</b> take {{special care}} when {{preparing}} spells and only extract as much energy from the environment as they need, thus avoiding the sterilizing side effects. Striving to wield magic in harmony with nature, they cause no damage to the environment when they cast spells. Virtue comes with a price however, as <b>preservers</b> advance in level at a much slower rate than the self-serving defilers. <b>Preservers</b> and druids {{have a negative view}} of defilers, but both <b>preservers</b> and defilers are relatively rare.|$|R

5|$|According to {{professor}} Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic {{representation of a}} Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that Mother India could {{also be seen as}} a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of the}} film by playing the role of Vishnu the <b>Preserver</b> and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E

25|$|The Mae West was {{a common}} {{nickname}} for the first inflatable life <b>preserver,</b> which was invented in 1928 by Peter Markus (1885–1974) (US Patent 1694714), with his subsequent improvements in 1930 and 1931. The nickname originated because someone wearing the inflated life <b>preserver</b> often appeared to be as large-breasted as the actress Mae West. It was popular during the Second World War with U.S. Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force servicemen, who were issued inflatable Mae Wests {{as part of their}} flight gear. Air crew members whose lives were saved by use of the Mae West (and other personal flotation devices) were eligible for membership in the Goldfish Club.|$|E

25|$|As soon as Bakari was sighted, {{a member}} of the rescue team threw her a life <b>preserver,</b> but the waters were too rough, and she was too {{exhausted}} to grab it. One of the sailors, Maturaffi Sélémane Libounah, jumped into the water and handed her a flotation device, after which they were both pulled safely aboard the Sima Com 2, where she was given dry blankets and a hot drink.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many of the}} library’s books {{perished in}} the flames of 1814, the library {{expanded}} to over 5,000 volumes by 1830, largely through its role as <b>preserver</b> of all copyrighted material.

25|$|In Christianity, God is {{the creator}} and <b>preserver</b> of the universe. God {{is the sole}} {{ultimate}} power in the universe, but is distinct from it. The Bible never speaks of God as impersonal. Instead, it refers to him in personal terms– who speaks, sees, hears, acts, and loves. God is understood to have a will and personality and is an all powerful, divine and benevolent being. He is represented in Scripture as being primarily concerned with people and their salvation.|$|E
25|$|Critique by Fritz Lehman: Given {{that this}} book is {{intended}} as a textbook for Pakistani undergraduates, Shaikh Ahmed Sarhindi predictably appears as the chief <b>preserver</b> of separate Islamic identity in India, yet only a very general and most inadequate description of his ideas and his influence is given. Chapters on Akbar and Aurangzib are the longest and the most revealing. The tone of the book in general is more reasonable and moderate than such earlier publications. Assessment of the Marathas, for example, while unsympathetic is fair to the facts.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the manager of the life <b>preserver</b> manufacturer placed iron bars inside the cork preservers to meet minimum weight requirements at the time. Many of the life preservers had been filled with cheap and less effective granulated cork and brought up to proper weight by the inclusion of the iron weights. Canvas covers, rotted with age, split and scattered the powdered cork. Managers of the company (Nonpareil Cork Works) were indicted but not convicted. The life preservers had been manufactured in 1891 and had hung above the deck, unprotected from the elements, for 13 years.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA pair of m×n {{matrices}} (A,B) {{is said to}} be rank-sum-maximal if ρ(A+B) =ρ(A) +ρ(B), and rank-sum-minimal if ρ(A+B) =|ρ(A) −ρ(B) |. We {{characterize the}} linear operators preserving the set of rank-sum-maximal pairs over any field and the linear operators preserving the set of rank-sum-minimal pairs over any field except for { 0, 1 }. The linear <b>preservers</b> of the set of rank-sum-maximal pairs are characterized by using a result about rank <b>preservers</b> proposed by Li and Pierce [Amer. Math. Monthly 108 (2001) 591 – 605], and thereby the linear <b>preservers</b> of the set of rank-sum-minimal pairs are characterized.

25|$|Like Harrington, other reviewers {{recognize}} that Spybuck possessed a remarkable talent, but it often served a practical {{purpose in the}} domain of ethnography. His paintings served as illustrations for numerous anthropological writings. Dobkins calls this practice autoethnography, in which the artist or writer assimilates the techniques of ethnographers to create representations of themselves and their cultures, with the implication of an asymmetrical power relationship between the ethnographer patron and the Native artist. Along with Spybuck, Dobkins names Jesse Cornplanter (Seneca), Peter Pitseolak (Inuit), and Frank Day (Maidu) as artists who practiced autoethnography to regain control over representations of their cultures and to retrieve and preserve their traditions. Other reviewers recognize Spybuck as an Indian artist who is a recorder and <b>preserver</b> of traditional practices in the midst of social change.|$|E
25|$|The great {{breadth of}} the Mesoamerican pantheon of deities {{is due to the}} {{incorporation}} of ideological and religious elements from the first primitive religion of Fire, Earth, Water and Nature. Astral divinities (the sun, stars, constellations, and Venus) were adopted and represented in anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and anthropozoomorphic sculptures, and in day-to-day objects. The qualities of these gods and their attributes changed {{with the passage of time}} and with cultural influences from other Mesoamerican groups. The gods are at once three: creator, <b>preserver,</b> and destroyer, and at the same time just one. An important characteristic of Mesoamerican religion was the dualism among the divine entities. The gods represented the confrontation between opposite poles: the positive, exemplified by light, the masculine, force, war, the sun, etc.; and the negative, exemplified by darkness, the feminine, repose, peace, the moon, etc. (European ideology, Manichaeism).|$|E
