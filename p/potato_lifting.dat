40|$|The {{potential}} impact of future extreme weather events on horticultural crops was evaluated. A review was carried out of the sensitivities of a representative set of crops to environmental challenges. It confirmed that a range of environmental factors are capable of causing {{a significant impact on}} production, either as yield or quality loss. The most important of these were un-seasonal temperature, water shortage or excess,and storms. Future scenarios were produced by the LARS-WG 1, a stochastic weather generator linked with UKCIP 02 projections of future climate. For the analyses, 150 years of synthetic weather data were generated for baseline, 2020 HI and 2050 HI scenarios at defined locations. The output from the weather generator was used in case studies, either to estimate the frequency of a defined set of circumstances known to have impact on cropping, or as inputs to models of crop scheduling or pest phenology or survival. The analyses indicated that episodes of summer drought severe enough to interrupt the continuity of supply of salads and other vegetables will increase while the frequency of autumns with sufficient rainfall to restrict <b>potato</b> <b>lifting</b> will decrease. They also indicated that the scheduling of winter cauliflowers for continuity of supply will require the deployment of varieties with different temperature sensitivities from those in use currently. In the pest insect studies, the number of batches of Agrotis segetum (cutworm) larvae surviving to third instar increased with time, as did the potential number of generations of Plutella xylostella (diamond-back moth) in the growing season, across a range of locations. The study demonstrated the utility of high resolution scenarios in predicting the likelihood of specific weather patterns and their potential effect on horticultural production. Several limitations of the current scenarios and biological models were also identified...|$|E

5000|$|As well as {{ploughing}} and ridgemaking, the loy {{was also}} used for <b>lifting</b> <b>potatoes</b> and digging turf. [...] Loy digging is still a popular pastime in Ireland with a national Loy Digging Association. Loy digging {{is an integral part}} of the National Ploughing Championships.|$|R
50|$|A smaller {{version of}} such forks with shorter, closer-spaced, thinner tines (but a {{full-sized}} handle) {{is known as}} a border fork or ladies' fork, and is used for lighter work such as weeding amongst other plants. Forks with broader, flatter tines are made for <b>lifting</b> <b>potatoes</b> and other root crops from the ground. A pair of forks back-to-back is often used to lever apart dense clumps of roots.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, Charles, Prince of Wales visited Berneray in the Outer Hebrides, {{for a week}} {{to learn}} about crofting. During his stay, he planted and <b>lifted</b> <b>potatoes,</b> cut peat, helped dip sheep and planted trees on the 92 acre arable croft. The Prince {{required}} that the island's inhabitants maintain his privacy from the press. He returned in 1999, {{when he joined the}} 140 residents to officially open the Â£7 million causeway to North Uist.|$|R
5000|$|For {{many years}} after 1876, school {{attendance}} followed a seasonal pattern depending on the herring fishing. At this time many families travelled with the fishing fleet as they followed the herring around the coast of Britain. In September 1880, for example, the school opened with 83 in attendance. In {{the next two weeks}} attendance rose to 183 and then 255, but by July it had dropped to 65. School log books refer to the herring fishing, <b>lifting</b> <b>potatoes,</b> pupils [...] "jooking" [...] and the problem of pupils [...] "forgetting what they have been taught".|$|R
60|$|The {{voices of}} {{children}} {{playing in the}} street aroused her. Night had fallen. She groped {{her way to a}} lamp and lighted it. In the kitchen she stared, lips trembling, at the pitiful, half prepared meal. The fire had gone out. The water had boiled away from the <b>potatoes.</b> When she <b>lifted</b> the lid, a burnt smell arose. Methodically she scraped and cleaned the pot, put things in order, and peeled and sliced the potatoes for next day's frying. And just as methodically she went to bed. Her lack of nervousness, her placidity, was abnormal, so abnormal that {{she closed her eyes and}} was almost immediately asleep. Nor did she awaken till the sunshine was streaming into the room.|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} organic farmers <b>lift</b> <b>potatoes</b> which are damaged by wireworms (Agriotes spec. and Hemicrepidus niger). A {{nationwide}} status quo-analysis {{was carried out}} by the Chamber of Agriculture of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2002 and 2003. The survey included an intensive literature research, a questionnaire with 26 questions, on-site assessments, and on-farm trials. It was noticed that a long period of grass-clover cultivation in the crop rotation had a negative effect on the quality of potato tubers. Peas and lupines seemed to be the better pre-crops for a good quality of tubers in contrast to field beans and red clover. An autumn fertilization with manure resulted in a low feeding damage on potatoes by wireworms. Many perennial weeds some like twich-grass, dock and field thistle had a negative effect on the quality of potatoes fed by wireworms...|$|R
