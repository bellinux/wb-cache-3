40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the topic of active {{citizenship}} in democratic societies. An emphasis is placed on the clarification {{of the role of the}} citizen as an engaged actor who has the right to influence political processes and decision-making at the local level. Democracy is seen from a variety of angles in the theoretical part, particular attention is given to participatory democracy and deliberation. The practical part is devoted to the research that was carried out in the Dutch city Utrecht, where the specific tools used for engaging citizens in policy- making were investigated together with motivations of public officials as well as citizens to support civic participation. This thesis attempts to provide a picture of the functioning of democratic principles in Utrecht with reference to an example of good practice.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} the colonial American jury, particularly the petit jury, during the quarter century leading up to the American Revolution. The thesis argues that the colonial jury at the inferior and superior court levels was central to a "law court culture" that provided colonists with the education, language and experience to assume the responsibilities of <b>participatory,</b> autonomous <b>citizenship,</b> as opposed to a passive subjecthood that deferred to social and political authority. Within their law court culture, colonial American jurors acted as powerful, independent decision makers, representatives of their communities judging matters of law as well as fact. Jurors sometimes even acted as arbiters in highly charged political disputes, to challenge the power of governors and of the empire itself. When outside British forces threatened this colonial American law court culture and the independence of those citizen jurors, Americans began to perceive themselves as a people apart from the English, uniting to preserve and protect their institutions, particularly their law court culture...|$|R

A sample of over 1, 400 students from four cantons were surveyed on measures of political skills, participation and attitudes. Drawing from theory and research, I developed hypotheses for predictors of these scales and analyzed the data using hierarchical linear modeling. In this sample, comprised primarily of Catholic and Muslim youth, civic education and active teaching proved significant predictors for nearly all scales measuring political skills and attitudes conducive to <b>participatory</b> democratic <b>citizenship.</b> Gender was also a significant predictor across most scales, which indicated that girls were less skilled and felt less efficacious than boys. Students belonging to minority ethnic groups within classrooms scored lower across some measures, as did those coming from less privileged backgrounds. Significant interaction effects revealed that Bosnian Croats made greater gains in some instances than Bosniac students...|$|R

5000|$|Advocates of {{democracy}} in schooling, led by John Dewey (1859-1952), argued that public education was needed to educate all children. Universal voting, along with universal education would make our society more democratic. An educated electorate would understand politics and the economy and make wise decisions. Later, by the 1960s, public education advocates argued that educating working people {{to a higher level}} (such as the G.I. Bill) would complete our transition to a deliberative or participatory democracy. This position is well developed by political philosopher Benjamin R. Barber in Strong Democracy: Participatory Politics for a New Age, first published in 1984 and published again in 2003. According to Barber, multicultural education in public schools would promote acceptance of diversity. Levinson (2009) argues that “multicultural education is saddled with so many different conceptions that it is inevitably self-contradictory both in theory and in practice, it cannot simultaneously achieve all of the goals it is called upon to serve” (p. 428) Multicultural education should reflect the student body, as well as promote understanding of diversity to the dominant culture and be inclusive, visible, celebrated and tangible. Multicultural education is appropriate for everyone. According to Banks (2013), “a major goal of multicultural education is to change teaching and learning approaches so that students of both genders and from diverse cultural, ethnic, and language groups will have equal opportunities to learn in educational institutions” (p. 10). Citizens need multicultural education in order to enter into the dialogue with fellow citizens and future citizens. Furthermore, multicultural education should include preparation for an active, <b>participatory</b> <b>citizenship.</b> Multicultural education is a way to promote the civic good. Levinson (2009) describes four ways to do so: From learning about other cultures comes tolerance, tolerance promotes respect, respect leads to open mindedness which results in civic reasonableness and equality (p. 431-432) ...|$|E

While Digital Storytelling has been lauded as an exemplary model of <b>participatory</b> cultural <b>citizenship</b> (particularly in initiatives for and with marginalised people), many mediating influences make ‘authentic’ self-representation far from straightforward. In this article, I consider some of these mediating influences, from both theoretical and practical perspectives, and underline their regulatory and constitutive nature. While some of these mediating influences are timeworn and pre-date digital technology, others are perpetuated and amplified, as is the case in networked personal storytelling disseminated online. I draw on some well-established strategies derived from anthropology and narrative practices to propose a new purpose for old tools. These tools support the nuanced and sensitive facilitation of both face-to-face and online Digital Storytelling workshops as well as the curation of web spaces in which they eventually circulate. I argue that making complex mediating influences visible to participants affords redress of the inherent social and technical privileges of institutions, facilitators and platforms.

Through a hermeneutic phenomenological qualitative approach, I explore how the experiences of the January 25 Egyptian Revolution and subsequent events impacted the perceptions and actions of <b>participatory</b> <b>citizenship</b> for university students and educators in Egypt; To what extent does university students and educators in Egypt perceive their actions of participatory citizenship; and How do university students and educators conceive the current role of the university in fostering citizenship education?	I conclude that participants learn what it means to be a citizen from various sources, and practice those ideas in multiple spaces. The Revolution and subsequent socio-political events, in combination with other influences, have significantly impacted the perceptions of <b>participatory</b> <b>citizenship</b> for participants. And despite a number of challenges to <b>participatory</b> <b>citizenship,</b> the Revolution and subsequent socio-political events provided a critical pedagogical workshop where <b>participatory</b> <b>citizenship</b> was learned and practiced. 	The Revolution and subsequent events have also impacted teacher attitudes and pedagogies. The participants reveal a connection between social and political events and their perceptions and experiences of teaching and learning, and perceive teaching and learning as a political act of citizenship. 	Furthermore, participants perceive the university as important site where students can be change agents, where critical thinking is valued and promoted, where the university is seen as an essential part of the public sphere, where student empowerment is nurtured, and as a space where relevant pedagogy, peace education and the construction of good humans can occur.

This article discusses issues of democracy, citizenship participation, the public sphere, and how these are related to the information age and knowledge society in Latin America. Similarly, it reflects on other aspects of government, such as governance, which can enable wider and more active citizen participation.

25|$|Authors such as White and Cliffe drew {{attention}} {{to the way in which}} the 'broadening of aid objectives from pure survival support towards rehabilitation, development and/ or peace-building' led to the 'dilution of commitment to core humanitarian principles'. Furthermore, many humanitarian organisations have sought to develop rights-based approaches to assistance strategies which challenge the apolitical approach of traditional humanitarianism. Rights based approaches view poverty and vulnerability as rooted in power relations – specifically, the denial of power, which is itself related to the denial of human rights. Hence rights based approaches to humanitarian action relate the achievement of security for marginalized people to the realization of their human rights and often to broader social change. Multimandate humanitarian organisations that seek more inclusive and <b>participatory</b> forms of <b>citizenship</b> and governance and the achievement of broader social rights outcomes therefore risk enmeshing apolitical humanitarian responses in advocacy programmes that push for broader social changes.|$|R
40|$|Interlinking vital {{aspects of}} the legal, economic, {{political}} and social competencies of its participating member states the European Union as it is presently constituted represents a unique experiment {{in the development of}} a new type of supranational political system. Driven by the accelerating processes of globalisation and actioned through a variety of formal and informal mechanisms European integration is slowly shifting the centre of political authority to a new supranational European level. The challenge for the European Union is to reconcile these developments and create an institutional framework that provides democratic legitimacy promotes equality, social inclusion and social justice and creates a political system that can recognise and accommodate the differences inherent in an increasingly multi-cultural society. Recognising the close inter-relationship between the effects of integration and the exercise of meaningful political participation, the European Commission has explicitly identified European citizenship as the mechanism to legitimise continued integration. The purpose of this research is to analyse the implications of this decision and to explore whether over time European citizenship has the potential to create and foster a distinct European identity which can promote a genuine and meaningful form of <b>participatory</b> post-national <b>citizenship</b> based outside the nation state. Drawing together both integration and citizenship theory into a new synthesis, the research is seeking to develop a new syncretic model of integration that can satisfactorily explain both the complexity and sophistication of the European Union and explain the forces which are currently driving forward the momentum of integration towards an "ever closer" political Union.

The overall objective of the project is to provide an alternative and deepened understanding of justice and security based on empirical evidence of how to handle conflicts within intercultural contexts, mainly through the active participation of citizens. The project focuses conceptually on four main intertwined relationships, one is the relationship of discourses of justice and security, second is the relationship of restorative justice and interculturality, third is the relationship of action research and theory, and fourth is the relationship of restorative justice and active participation, citizenship and democracy. This paper focuses mainly on the relation of the concept of citizenship with restorative justice, especially as viewed and enacted in the four intercultural settings of the ALTERNATIVE project.

40|$|At a {{time when}} {{scientific}} literacy is recognised as essential for <b>participatory</b> Australian <b>citizenship,</b> science education has struggled to find a pedagogy that engages educationally marginalised students {{while at the same}} time assisting them to them becoming scientifically literate. The study reported here, titled Scaffolding science: a pedagogy for marginalised students, investigates an alternative pedagogic paradigm, scaffolding pedagogy, based on socio-cultural, language-focused principles. It draws on three complementary theories: Vygotsky’s sociocultural activity theory, Halliday’s systemic functional linguistics, and Bernstein’s theory of pedagogic discourse. The methodology is a classroom discourse analysis of a series of lessons around energy transformation with 7 - 8 year-old students in a suburban disadvantaged early primary classroom. Its focus is two-fold: firstly it provides a pre- and post-topic analysis of the oral and written performance of a number of case study students to ascertain changes in their language use. Secondly, it provides a discourse analysis of classroom interactions in the seven lessons in the topic. It identifies the changing nature of teacher scaffolding techniques across time as students gradually appropriate scientific language, as well as identifying the issues encountered by the teacher as she endeavoured to develop a principled scaffolding pedagogy in the teaching of science. The study argues that student use of scientific language is fundamental to the ongoing learning of scientific knowledge. It supports the development of summary texts, called focus texts, to assist the teacher in a consistent use of scientific language, increasing the opportunities for its appropriation by marginalised students. The study identifies the paradox of ‘hands-on’ science which brings about high student engagement, but neglects the development of the required language because of its situated nature. It proposes pedagogic strategies that may help to ameliorate the current situation in primary school science education. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Humanities, 201...|$|R

First, the form and expression of citizenship practice and ideal is explored through a qualitative interwiev study of ten citizens in the southern suburbs of Stockholm.

The essay calls attention to an observed lack of empirical studies in the field of deliberative theory of democracy as well as studies that more broadly bring the theory down to empirical earth. The method used here strives towards combining and interacting the theoretical and academic debate with empirical data of citizen experience.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{empirical}} research in South Africa to explore {{questions about the}} exclusionary nature of citizenship, the problems and possibilities of <b>participatory</b> <b>citizenship</b> and its potential reconceptualisation {{through the lens of}} gender. The paper examines some of the major debates and policies in South Africa around issues of citizenship, participation and gender and explores why the discursive accommodation of gender equity by the South African government is not fully realised in its attempts to construct substantive and <b>participatory</b> <b>citizenship.</b> It explores some of the emergent spaces of radical citizenship that marginalized groups and black women, in particular, are shaping in response. Findings suggest that whilst there are possibilities for creating alternative, more radical citizenship spaces, these can also be problematic and exclusionary. The paper draws on recent feminist writing to examine the possibilities for rethinking citizenship as an ethical, non-instrumental social status, distinct from both political participation and economic independence. This reframing of citizenship moves beyond notions of ‘impasse’ or ‘hollowness’, challenges the public/private distinction that still frames many debates about citizenship and considers the emancipatory potential of gendered subjectivity. The paper argues that citizenship is shaped by differing social, political and cultural contexts and this brings into sharp focus the problematic assumption of the universal applicability of western concepts and theories...|$|E

In our research project we video-recorded fourteen class councils in secondary schools, we interviewed the teacher and four pupils of each class, and all the pupils filled in a standardized questionnaire. Class councils are very popular forms of education with pupils although the actual power to influence decisions by deliberation is doubted to some extent. Quantitative analysis of the video-recordings shows the wide range of forms of class councils that exist in respect to the talking time of the pupils. To express one’s own viewpoint and to understand the standpoint of other discussants, construct arguments and counterarguments, participate, and lead discussions are difficult tasks.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns a}} re-evaluation of the ‘Enlightenment’ and its historiography within cultural theory {{in relation to}} contemporary debates concerning the limits and possibilities of active and inclusive <b>citizenship,</b> <b>participatory</b> democracy and a pluralistic public sphere. I interrogate what the eighteenth-century European Enlightenment encompasses and how this period and its legacy have been understood in relevant areas of philosophy and social theory. My contention is that an overly reductionist and negative understanding of the Enlightenment has come to dominate cultural theory over {{the past thirty years}} owing partly to a simplified reading of theorists including Foucault and Derrida. Using the work of, among others, Jürgen Habermas, I hope to demonstrate that a more nuanced understanding of the complexity of the Enlightenment and its legacy will aid contemporary social theory in formulating conceptions for a more just and equitable society. To this end, I show how contemporary figures within the Enlightenment, including Moses Mendelssohn, Mary Wollstonecraft and Olympe de Gouges, are relevant to current theoretical concerns. I identify with Habermas’s argument in favour of an ‘enlightened critique of the Enlightenment’ and his assertion that modernity represents an ‘unfinished project’ rather than a static model of social superiority. At a time when religious fundamentalism and ideological extremism are dominant forces in global relations, and nationalism and cultural essentialism inform much of the public discourse on citizenship and democracy, a considered affirmation of the precepts of the Enlightenment is necessary to the realisation of socially progressive theory...|$|R

However, this ostensibly gender-neutral concept is in fact deeply gendered.
