5|$|While {{announcing the}} Cocked, Locked, and Ready to Rock Tour in 2009, Tyler and <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> {{that the next}} item on the agenda was a new Aerosmith album, the group's first since 2004's Honkin' on Bobo. The group did some {{recording}} with producer Brendan O'Brien in 2008 but halted because of Tyler's health problems. Aerosmith bassist Tom Hamilton told the Boston Herald in September 2010 that Tyler believes he has the {{time and energy to}} continue fronting the band while also being a judge on American Idol.|$|E

500|$|For {{the death}} scenes, the crew used several lifecasts {{of the actors}} and {{chocolate}} syrup for fake blood. [...] Creating the Rube Goldberg effect for Ms. Lewton's death scene {{was the most difficult}} to plan according to the crew. [...] <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "it was very hard to generate an atmosphere of dread, to create suspense out of scenes that are common".|$|E

5000|$|Ellis' colleague, Richard Haines, {{attributed}} to him [...] "classic with a twist." [...] <b>Perry</b> Ellis <b>said</b> he was inspired [...] "to design clothes {{that are more}} obtainable, more relaxed, but ultimately more stylish and witty." ...|$|R
500|$|On January 20, 2010, Perry {{confirmed}} the band {{were about to}} audition for a new singer to replace Tyler. <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> Tyler's surgery to his legs would [...] "take {{him out of the}} picture" [...] for up to a year and a half, and in the meantime, the rest of the band wanted to continue performing. Perry also said that the band would be willing to continue working with Tyler in the future if the singer wanted to.|$|E
500|$|Boasting a full horn section, {{a penchant}} for stage theatrics and {{encouraging}} their audiences to dance, the Daddies sought to prove themselves the antithesis to the then-current state of Northwest rock. As <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> of the Daddies' ideology, [...] "It was our way of saying 'screw you' [...] "..."we wanted to have fun, outrageously have a good blast without even thinking about it". By the end of 1989, the Daddies had built a strong following within Eugene's counterculture, frequently selling out shows and gathering critical acclaim, earning praise from Eugene Weekly as being the city's best band [...] "by far".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios. [...] "Roar" [...] was {{recorded}} in four other studios: Luke's in the Boo, Playback Recording Studio and Secret Garden Studios, all located {{in the state of}} California, as well as MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden Perry co-wrote the song with Bonnie McKee and its producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut. All its development took place in March 2013. McKee told MTV that [...] "Roar" [...] is [...] "kind of a 'pick yourself up and dust yourself off and keep going', female-empowerment song" [...] and [...] "kind of an epiphany song." [...] <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> she wrote the song after undergoing therapy, saying she was [...] "sick of keeping all these feelings inside and not speaking up for myself".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Perry's</b> office <b>said</b> that Texas {{represents}} a model private-sector approach to health-care.

50|$|His father, a Democrat, was {{a long-time}} Haskell County {{commissioner}} and school board member. <b>Perry</b> has <b>said</b> that {{his interest in}} politics probably began in November 1961, when his father {{took him to the}} funeral of U.S. Representative Sam Rayburn.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, he was {{a policy}} advisor for the Bush-Cheney presidential {{transition}} team and an advisor on the Vice Presidential Debate preparation team. Of <b>Perry,</b> Cheney <b>said,</b> [...] "He was tough...much tougher than I {{would have been on}} my father-in-law." ...|$|R
500|$|Christina Aguilera. Slant Magazine Sal Cinquemani {{said the}} song [...] "sounds like {{something}} from Michael Jackson's last studio album as sung by Christina Aguilera...that the closest she gets to another human being involves being tied up and bitten is revealing." [...] Blogcritics' Clayton <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Teeth", along with the tracks [...] "Monster" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "thump harder than anything she's released thus far". In his review for Consequence of Sound, Tony Hardy describes the song as a [...] "repetitive chant which gets its point across in the first verse, rendering {{the rest of it}} almost redundant". Nick Levine of Digital Spy said [...] "Teeth" [...] is [...] "the most sonically intriguing thing GaGa's put her name to, an ode to rough sex conducted over an intense, tribal production that recalls Cher's 'Half Breed' and Fleetwood Mac's 'Tusk'." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{promising}} sales of Zoot Suit Riot, this period {{proved to be}} the most difficult of the Daddies' career. Consistently performing to little media recognition, full-time touring was becoming both a personal and financial strain, leading to frequent quitting among band members. The Daddies experienced at least fifteen line-up changes from 1996 to 1997, including the departure of original keyboardist Chris Azorr and co-founder Schmid, leaving Perry and trumpeter Dana Heitman as the sole remnants of the original line-up. With no label backing them, the band had trouble securing distribution and press outside of the Northwest, often being unable to get their CDs sold in cities they were touring through. Feeling they had finally hit a [...] as an independent band, <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> the Daddies were ultimately left with one of two options at this time: either sign to a label or break up.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was heavily}} criticised. <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> that {{those aspects of}} the game [...] "pale in comparison to 90% of the PlayStation 2's adventure or action-adventure games, and they actually hurt {{the rest of the}} game's best qualities", but that the new moves worked smoothly apart from the stealth actions. White criticised the new layout's negative effect on gameplay and the poor enemy AI, and Kasavin called the experience [...] "frustrating, difficult, and tedious", though stating that such moments stood out because many areas of the game were [...] "thrilling". Reed found the controls dated and the stealth mechanics and strength upgrade system unnecessary, while the GamesRadar reviewer cited both the gameplay and control layout as dated, citing the difficulty of effectively controlling Lara at multiple points in the game because of these issues. The camera was also criticised, with White, Perry, Reed, Kasavin and the GamesRadar reviewer all citing it as awkward to control and sometimes wayward or confusing during its scripted movements.|$|E
50|$|In early 2008, playwright Donna West {{filed suit}} against Perry, contending that he stole {{material}} from her 1991 play, Fantasy of a Black Woman. Veronica Lewis, <b>Perry's</b> attorney, <b>said</b> {{there was no need}} for her client to appropriate the work of others.|$|R

5000|$|Lankster {{got some}} playing {{time in the}} 2009 season as a cornerback in nickel defense situations, due to {{injuries}} to other defensive backs. Head coach <b>Perry</b> Fewell <b>said</b> of Lankster, [...] "we think he's gotten better every week for us." [...] He finished the 2009 season with five tackles.|$|R
500|$|Bradman denied {{this version}} of events. In 1983, two years after Fingleton's death, a book written by Michael Page, with Bradman's close co-operation, blamed Fingleton for the leak and {{dismissed}} Fingleton's story concerning Bradman and Corbett as [...] "an absurd fabrication", arising from a grudge against Bradman. The book pointed out that Fingleton only made the accusation after Corbett's death. Fingleton's executor, Malcolm Gemmell, summarised the evidence which supported Fingleton's accusation in a magazine article: that Bradman wrote for the Sun, was the prime target of Bodyline, and had previously urged the Australian Board of Control to object to the tactic. Fingleton's brother supported the claim that Bradman was responsible, repeating in 1997 the alleged view of Corbett that Bradman provided the information. In 1995, Bradman was interviewed for television, and {{when asked about the}} source of the leak, responded sharply: [...] "It wasn't me!" [...] In the same year, a biography of Bradman, written with his close co-operation, by Roland <b>Perry,</b> <b>said</b> that Bradman had confronted Corbett to ask who leaked the story, to be told it was Fingleton.|$|E
500|$|On {{the subject}} of {{returning}} for the sequel, Larter was chosen by New Line Cinema over her co-star Devon Sawa, who played as Alex Browning in the first film. [...] "We’ve brought back Clear in an interesting way and we just felt that to bring both of them back would make you wonder too much just what the hell they’d {{been doing for the}} past few months," [...] producer Craig Perry conveyed on developing the cliffhanger of Final Destination. <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating that there were no financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms of mentoring the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the main link to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that she had some input into the script. As a result, Sawa's character was killed off-screen in Final Destination 2, as divulged by Clear to Kimberly during their first meeting.|$|E
500|$|Steve Perry has {{expressed}} ambivalence towards the lasting vilification of the Daddies' name, admitting it's [...] "probably the most heinous {{name in the}} history of rock" [...] while emphasizing a disparate delineation between the band's roots in the [...] "bubble" [...] of Eugene's punk subculture and their unexpected longevity in the wider cultural mainstream: [...] "I started this band a long time ago, and we just used [...] We didn't know that in 10 years we'd turn into some sort of happy, peppy, feel-good things". Though Perry has occasionally voiced regret over not having changed the Daddies' name earlier in their career, he has nevertheless acquiescently embraced the name as his [...] "Holden Caulfield red hunting hat", while outright dismissing critics who choose to demonize the name based on literal interpretation than the jazz-era jive slang it drew from. [...] "It gives outrage addicts another soapbox they can jump up on", <b>Perry</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "If people want to just look at it , then that's their problem, but I don't write it that way"..."I assure you we don't cruise high schools for dates".|$|E

5000|$|In {{response}} to criticisms, Governor <b>Perry</b> has <b>said</b> that it [...] "is a pretty rare occurrence" [...] {{for him to}} know that political supporters have connections to firms that receive funding. [...] One such rare occurrence was Convergen Life Sciences, now called Genprex. The CEO, David Nance, was a donor and his company received a $4.5 million ETF award.|$|R

500|$|The 2010 TIP {{report also}} {{condemned}} Canada's {{lack of a}} national action plan, and said that Canada is a destination, source, and transit country for forced prostitution, unfree labour, the prostitution of children, {{and other forms of}} human trafficking. The report said that the federal and provincial governments of Canada were not cooperating sufficiently with respect to policing these crimes, and that a strategy for cooperation should be formulated in a national action plan. York Regional Police vice unit Detective Thai Truong agreed with the report's assessment, and said that [...] "a unified understanding and approach" [...] to human trafficking [...] "does not even exist at the municipal level of policing" [...] in Canada. Also in 2010, retired Toronto Police Service officer Dave <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> that Canada's lack of a national action plan had resulted in the country failing to adequately deal with North Preston's Finest, a gang that engages in sex trafficking between Nova Scotia and Toronto. Perry had led a police taskforce against the gang in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said that without a national action plan, politicians lost interest in the endeavour and funding ran out. Perry stated that a plan would need to be well-funded because traffickers in Canada are making [...] "big, big money...and {{the only way you can}} combat that is with a pretty healthy budget." ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the {{religious}} imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy. Simon Voxick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly felt that the move was calculated, saying, [...] "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be disappointed if no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." [...] He {{did not think that}} the risks were very original or as exciting as the ones in [...] "Telephone." [...] "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," [...] he said. The New York Timess Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] throne. He said, [...] ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... but I also think she's saying, 'This [...] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering you with my own style. I've learned this. I know how to do this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" [...] He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: [...] "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted." [...] Singer Katy Perry took to her Twitter account and wrote, [...] "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes." [...] The Huffington Post ascertained that while Gaga had not been mentioned directly by name that it was definitely a slam by Perry towards Lady Gaga. In an interview on NRJ Radio's Le 6/9, <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> that the tweet was not solely about Gaga, stating that it was based on her personal views of religion.|$|E
500|$|On November 1, 2007, {{the band}} entered {{the studio to}} work on the final studio album of their current {{contract}} with Sony. At the time, it was believed that the album would include both re-recorded tracks left off previous albums as well as brand new material. In an interview, guitarist Joe Perry revealed that in addition to creating a new album, the band was working closely with the makers of the Guitar Hero series to develop , a video game dedicated to the band's music. The game was released on June 29, 2008 and contains many of their most popular songs. Steven Tyler announced on VH1 Classic Radio on September 4, 2008 that Aerosmith intends to enter the studio at the end of September 2008 to complete the band's 15th studio album. Tyler also confirmed that the band plans to begin a new U.S. tour in June 2009, in support of the as-yet-untitled album. This tour was supposed to be preceded by a concert in Venezuela on February 1, 2009. However, on January 15, 2009, Tyler said the band would be unable to play the gig because of a second knee injury of guitarist Joe Perry. In mid-February 2009, it was announced that the album would be produced by the famed Brendan O'Brien and that the album would likely be recorded live, like their earlier records. Although the band had hoped to finish the album before the tour started in June 2009, <b>Perry</b> <b>said</b> that the group [...] "realized there wasn't any chance of getting [...] finished before we hit the road for the summer." [...] The tour featured ZZ Top as the opening act for most of the tour. The Aerosmith/ZZ Top Tour, presented by Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, was officially announced and the first dates released on April 8, 2009.|$|E
