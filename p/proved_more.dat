Testing with several other experimental ski configurations continued with the prototype through 1957, after which it was placed into storage.|$|E
5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} {{smaller and}} carried a third less bombload, it <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> {{reliable}} in service and easier to fly and land, and Navy pilots preferred it. In 1950 {{the decision was made}} to use the Mauler only from shore-based units and later that year all but Naval Reserve units abandoned the type. The aircraft operated with reserve squadrons until 1953.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> {{dangerous}} to Yamhad than Mari. The Assyrian king was an ambitious conqueror {{with the aim}} to rule Mesopotamia and the Levant, and called himself king of the World. Shamshi-Adad surrounded Yamhad by alliances with Charchemish, Hassum and Urshu {{to the north and}} by conquering Mari to the east forcing Zimri-Lim the heir of Mari to flee. Sumu-Epuh welcomed Zimri-Lim and aimed to use him against Assyria since he was the legitimate heir of Mari.|$|E

5|$|The two-cent {{piece was}} {{produced}} by the Mint of the United States for circulation from 1864 to 1872 and for collectors in 1873. Designed by James B. Longacre, there were decreasing mintages each year, as other minor coins such as the nickel <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> popular. It was abolished by the Mint Act of 1873.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{the failure of the}} operation, a second attack was {{launched}} which <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> successful in sinking a blockship {{at the entrance to the}} canal but ultimately did not close off Bruges completely. Further plans to attack Ostend came to nothing during the summer of 1918, and the threat from Bruges would not be finally stopped until the last days of the war, when the town was liberated by Allied land forces.|$|E
5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} {{it was not clear}} whether the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed to guide the missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E

On a personal level, relations between American and British officers and men were notably cordial.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{introduced}} new tactics, {{units and}} equipment based on Western models, but the Polish-Lithuanian forces <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors {{that kept the}} Russians from winning were the delay in moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry. A scapegoat was nevertheless needed: Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second-in-command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. Learning from this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish-Russian War (1654-1656).|$|E
5|$|Expected to {{last only}} two days, the {{evacuation}} of remaining evacuees <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure {{and a growing number}} of evacuees. By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in the Superdome was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.|$|E

5|$|Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, {{took the}} raw ore and {{dissolved}} it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. Ether was then {{added in a}} liquid–liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide. By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This {{became known as the}} Ames Project, and its Ames process became available in 1943.|$|E
5|$|More of the {{octagonal}} $50 {{pieces were}} sold {{than of the}} round, as the former <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, and pulled back with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated {{under the cover of}} part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E

5|$|The {{king had}} seen bitter resentment from the Scanian peasants during the Scanian War and was {{particularly}} tough on that province. The guerrilla Snapphane movement, in northern Scania, had attacked his soldiers and stolen his money. They also had {{strong support from}} the local villages. Charles remained sceptical about the Scanian inhabitants throughout his life. He did not allow soldiers from Scania in his Scanian regiment: the 1,200 soldiers that were to be stationed {{there had to be}} recruited from more northern provinces. He also advocated rough treatment of the inhabitants and the first Governor-General of Scania, his trusted aide Johan Gyllenstierna (governor-general 1679–1680), was notably brutal in his treatment of the locals. The rule of Rutger von Ascheberg (governor-general 1680–1693), <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> lenient.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} {{introduced}} in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on I-95. However, it <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> popular than expected, and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms that the line was too expensive to operate. The service has been continually upgraded since its inception with rebuilt stations and new rolling stock as well as extensions to New London in 1996 and to Stamford in 2001. Around 1,900 to 2,100 riders use the service every weekday depending on the season.|$|E
5|$|The winter 1941–42 {{passed by}} with {{relative}} inactivity. In the spring 1942, Arthur Harris began his campaign over Germany in earnest with {{an attack by}} RAF Bomber Command upon Lübeck. Adolf Hitler, enraged by the attack, ordered the Luftwaffe to begin retaliatory strikes which began the so-called Baedeker Blitz. On 4 April Cunningham engaged and damaged a Baedeker raider He 111 pathfinder operating over Exeter. It was able to escape into cloud. KGr 100, the specialist German pathfinder unit, was now operating with new navigational aids which allowed them to fly through and navigate in thick cloud and rain. They deliberately operated whenever the weather <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> difficult for night fighters. Nevertheless, Cunningham made an interception {{on the night of}} the 23 May 1942.|$|E

5|$|When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, its armored corps was {{composed}} of 1,445 Panzer Is, 1,223 Panzer IIs, 98 Panzer IIIs and 211 Panzer IVs; the more modern vehicles amounted to less than 10% of Germany's armored strength. The 1st Panzer Division had a roughly equal balance of types, with 17 Panzer Is, 18 Panzer IIs, 28 Panzer IIIs, and 14 Panzer IVs per battalion. The remaining panzer divisions were heavy with obsolete models, equipped as they were with 34 Panzer Is, 33 Panzer IIs, 5 Panzer IIIs, and 6 Panzer IVs per battalion. Although the Polish Army possessed less than 200 tanks capable of penetrating the German light tanks, Polish anti-tank guns <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> of a threat, reinforcing German faith {{in the value of}} the close-support Panzer IV.|$|E
5|$|After {{assuming}} his new position, Treloar {{was sent}} to AIF Headquarters in the Middle East where Australian forces were engaged in the North African Campaign. While {{en route to the}} Middle East he visited Malaya. Conditions in North Africa <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> challenging than those in World War I, however, as the combat was fast-moving and the Australian troops felt less motivation to collect artefacts than those of the First AIF. Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell out with his second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency. He also lacked a patron in the AIF and was handicapped by his relatively junior rank. Due to his absence from the Memorial, Treloar had only limited input into the design of its galleries and he was unable to attend its official opening in November 1941.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rain fell}} on Saturday morning, the track had dried by {{the start of}} the final free {{practice}} session. Lewis Hamilton again set the fastest time with 1:25.624, less than two-tenths of a second in front of teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third position close behind. The fastest times had been set on the super-soft tyre compound. However, Mercedes's advantage over Ferrari <b>proved</b> <b>more</b> significant, up to seven-tenths of a second on the harder soft compound, the tyre most likely {{to be used in the}} race. Toro Rosso confirmed their good pace for the weekend with fourth and sixth place for Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen respectively, being about half a second quicker than their sister team, Red Bull Racing. A major incident occurred just seconds after the beginning of the practice session, when Rio Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Both cars needed to equip new front wings and Haas also changed the floor on Grosjean's car. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points added to his licence.|$|E
