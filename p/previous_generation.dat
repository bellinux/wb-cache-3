5|$|Apple {{released}} {{the third generation}} of MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen during WWDC 2012 and discontinued the 17-inch variant. The <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> 13- and 15-inch unibody models continued to sell with updated processors. The third generation model was a quarter thinner than its predecessor and introduced the Retina Display with a much higher screen resolution. A 13-inch variant was released in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|On October 23, 2012, Apple {{announced}} the fourth generation iPad, which began shipping on November 2, 2012. The new hardware includes an A6X processor, HD FaceTime camera, improved LTE compatibility, and the all-digital Lightning connector. It {{is available in}} the same storage increments and pricing structure as the third generation. Following the announcement of the fourth-generation iPad, the <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> was discontinued.|$|E

5|$|All ports {{have been}} {{replaced}} with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals, any {{of which can be}} used for charging. The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals, including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them. Devices using HDMI, <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro. The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} March 2012, {{information}} was leaked hinting {{at a new}} series of Zenbooks and in early May Asus revealed the UX32 series, followed by their release on May 21. Two models were announced: the UX32A and the UX32VD, both including a thicker chassis to accommodate a 500GB/24GB flash hybrid drive and in the UX32VD an Nvidia Geforce GT 620M. The UX32A was designed to be a cheaper Zenbook with a <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> Sandy Bridge processor option, lower resolution screen and hybrid drive.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his copious output of madrigals and chansons, Arcadelt produced three masses, 24 motets, settings of the Magnificat, the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and some sacred chansons – the French equivalent of the madrigale spirituale. The masses {{are influenced by the}} <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> of Franco-Flemish composers, particularly Jean Mouton and Josquin des Prez; the motets, avoiding the dense polyphony favored by the Netherlanders, are more declamatory and clear in texture, {{in a manner similar to}} his secular music. Much of his religious music, except for the sacred chansons, he probably wrote during his years in the papal chapel in Rome. Documents from the Sistine Chapel archives indicate that the choir sang his music during his residence there.|$|E

50|$|Recently, Millennials are {{sometimes}} referred to as the Boomerang Generation or Peter Pan Generation, because of the members' perceived penchant for delaying some rites of passage into adulthood for longer periods than <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b> These labels were also a reference to a trend toward members living with their parents for longer periods than <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{beginning}} of Szabó’s career {{coincided with the}} {{beginning of}} a “new wave” in Hungarian cinema, one of several new wave cinemas that occurred around this time throughout Western and Eastern Europe. The Eastern European new waves were caused by political liberalization, the decentralization of film industries, and the emergence of films as valuable commodities for export to Western European markets. The resulting films were more formally experimental, politically anti-establishment, and, {{especially in the case of}} Szabó, psychologically probing than the films of the <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b> Hungarian filmmakers in particular experienced a significant increase in freedom of expression due to the reforms of the Kádár government.|$|E
5|$|When {{the game}} was renamed and changed platforms, the team chose Luminous Studio as the main game engine. The game's {{real-time}} graphics used 5,000 polygons per-frame, bringing its visual quality close to modern CGI cutscenes and to a level {{that would have been}} impossible for the previous generation's hardware. The game's native resolution was 1920 × 1080 pixels (1080p), with a frame rate of 30 frames per second: this was defined as being native to the game as opposed to upscaled games from the <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b> For polygon models, the combined number of visible and occluded polygons was estimated as being 5,000,000. This number was approximately five times the amount of equivalent detail from last-generation games. Models used over 600 character bones: 150 bones were created for the face, 300 for the hair, and 150 for the body. A bone-based physical simulation technology was applied so that clothing would react to the body's movements. The polygon count for character hair was estimated as 20,000, the same number used in an entire character in last-generation games. All of these were achievable {{due to the fact that}} the eighth-generation console hardware had approximately sixteen times the amount of storage available in the <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The LS 430 {{first went}} on sale in the U.S. with an initial base price of US$55,000, ranging up to US$70,000 when fully equipped. At the high end, the LS 430's pricing encroached on European rivals as Lexus became {{increasingly}} able to command higher price premiums for its vehicles. Sales for the LS 430 surpassed the <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> and production exceeded 140,000 units. The LS 430 was produced until July 2006, marking the last occasion the Lexus flagship was produced in a single body style. In Japan, the equivalent Toyota Celsior was also sold from August 2000 until March 2006, when the long-awaited introduction of Lexus Japan saw the arrival of new generation Lexus models. XF30 design patents were filed by Toyota in domestic Japan, on 8 March 1999 at the Japan Patent Office under patent number 1080448.|$|E

5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
5|$|Federer and Andre Agassi played {{each other}} 11 times between 1998 and 2005 before Agassi's {{retirement}} in 2006. Federer led the rivalry 8–3. This was Federer's most significant rivalry with an all-time great {{player of the}} <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b> They first met in only the third tournament of Federer's career at the 1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer's hometown, with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open and the finals of the Miami Masters in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round robin and the final. They played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open that spanned over two days with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the 2005 Dubai Championships, Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab. Their final match was {{at one of the}} most prestigious platforms in the sport, when they played in the finals of the 2005 US Open. Federer was victorious in four sets, claiming the 6th Grand Slam tournament of his career and denying Agassi his 9th.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned for 1992. The Taurus received a new dashboard that, like the <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> {{was designed to}} be user friendly. Like the <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> it had all of the vehicle's main controls located near {{the left side of the}} dash, to be within the easy reach of the driver. Also like the <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> all of the controls were designed to be recognizable by touch, and to be operated by the driver without taking their eyes off the road. The new dash also contained three buttons to the right of the gauge cluster that allowed the driver to operate the radio without taking their eyes off the road. The radio was also redesigned, while the rest of the lower dash was carried over from the <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> as was the steering wheel. The new dash was also designed to contain a passenger's side airbag, a first of its kind. It was optional in 1991 in 1992 models, and became standard in 1993, making the Taurus the first car of its kind to have dual front airbags.|$|E

25|$|The {{exterior}} of the second generation was completely redesigned from the first generation. Its length was increased by a few inches, {{and it was a}} couple of hundred pounds heavier, and had a more rounded roofline. Every body panel, save for the doors, was redesigned. However, many of the redesigned components closely resembled that of the <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> leading many to falsely believe that this generation is just a face-lift of the <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
