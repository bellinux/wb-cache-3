5|$|Quantification of the <b>proportion</b> of barbarian-born {{troops in}} the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has {{undertaken}} the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of the}} sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this <b>proportion</b> did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that the <b>proportion</b> of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise the <b>proportion</b> of barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E

40|$|When 18 th-century {{travellers}} saw the Doric {{temples of}} Paestum in Southern Italy {{with their own}} eyes, they observed {{for the first time}} true examples of the <b>proportions</b> of archaic Greek architecture. Contrary to the Roman proportional systems, the Greek ones had been largely unavailable to architects until then. With the rediscovery of Paestum, conveniently located south of Naples and not in far away Greece, the secret of Greek <b>proportions</b> was no more. Architects were able to precisely measure the temples and wrote many accounts about their primitive forms and <b>proportions.</b> But what did architects mean exactly when describing the <b>proportions</b> as primitive? What kinds of reflections did these <b>proportions</b> provoke? This article treats <b>proportions</b> as aesthetics, or as visible <b>proportions,</b> not as a numerical system. The discourse on <b>proportions</b> changed in this period, giving more weight to their cultural and historical meaning. The writings by such architects as Soane, Wilkins, and Labrouste demonstrate how Paestum functioned as a laboratory to unveil the secret of primitive <b>proportions,</b> and how, with the different meanings architects attached to them, it enlarged and renewed the debate on <b>proportions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom.

As a <b>proportion</b> of the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high <b>proportion</b> of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast.

40|$|In two {{experiments}} {{deviations from}} matching earned higher overall reinforcement rates than did matching. In Experiment 1 response <b>proportions</b> were calculated over a 360 -response moving average, updated with each response. Response <b>proportions</b> that {{differed from the}} nominal reinforcement <b>proportions,</b> by a criterion that was gradually increased, were eligible for reinforcement. Response <b>proportions</b> that {{did not differ from}} matching were not eligible for reinforcement. When the deviation requirement was relatively small, the contingency proved to be effective. However, there was a limit as to how far response <b>proportions</b> could be pushed from matching. Consequently, when the deviation requirement was large, overall reinforcement rate decreased and pecking was eventually extinguished. In Experiment 2 a discriminative stimulus was added to the procedure. The houselight was correlated with the relationship between response <b>proportions</b> and the nominal (programmed) reinforcement <b>proportions.</b> When the difference between response and reinforcement <b>proportions</b> met the deviation requirement, the light was white and responses were eligible for reinforcement. When the difference between response and reinforcement <b>proportions</b> failed to exceed the deviation requirement, the light was blue and responses were not eligible for reinforcement. With the addition of the light, it proved to be possible to shape deviations from matching without any apparent limit. Thus, in Experiment 2 overall reinforcement rate predicted choice <b>proportions</b> and relative reinforcement rate did not. In contrast, in previous experiments on the relationship between matching and overall reinforcement maximization, relative reinforcement rate was usually the better predictor of responding. The results show that whether overall or relative reinforcement rate better predicts choice <b>proportions</b> may in part be determined by stimulus conditions...|$|R

40|$|Objective: In recent years, {{the golden}} <b>proportions</b> have been {{evaluated}} by various researchers {{in the general population}} and orthodontic patients to establish their correlation with facial attractiveness and esthetics, but with conflicting results. The present study aimed to analyze the frontal facial golden <b>proportions</b> for three groups of young adult females, an attractive group, and two malocclusion groups. Our null hypothesis stated that the golden <b>proportions</b> of attractive females were analogous with or closer to the golden number than those with an established malocclusion. Materials and Methods: Frontal facial photographs of 80 female dental students were scored for facial attractiveness by 10 dental specialists. Thirty females with scores greater than the median score of 48 formed the attractive group. Thirteen females with Class I malocclusion and 15 females with Class II division 1 malocclusion formed the two malocclusion groups. Ten landmarks and 19 golden <b>proportions</b> were calculated for all subjects. One-way ANOVA and unpaired Student′s t-test was used to analyze the differences in golden <b>proportions</b> between the attractive and malocclusion groups. Results: Significant differences were observed for 10 <b>proportions</b> (P < 0. 04 to < 0. 0001). Five vertical <b>proportions</b> showed significant differences in both subgroups; Attractive versus Class I and Attractive versus Class II division 1; while one vertical and all transverse <b>proportions</b> showed significant differences only in Attractive versus Class II division 1 subgroup. The average values of these <b>proportions</b> varied both toward and away from the golden number for both attractive and malocclusion groups. Conclusion: Facial <b>proportions</b> of the attractive females were significantly different from those with malocclusion, but did not show a constant trend of being closer to the golden number. Furthermore, the golden <b>proportions</b> were not analogous with the facial esthetics of the attractive females...|$|R
