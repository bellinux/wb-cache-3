5|$|In July 2013, Jeff Wadlow {{was hired}} to write and direct a film {{adaptation}} of the X-Men spin-off comic-book series X-Force, with Lauren Shuler Donner attached to produce. Mark Millar, the creative consultant for 20th Century Fox's Marvel Comics based films, stated that the film will feature five characters as protagonists. After the release of Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds said that Deadpool would appear in the film. By May 2016, Simon Kinberg {{was in the process}} of rewriting the script. In February 2017, Joe Carnahan had signed on as director, as well as to be co-writer with Reynolds. By September of the same year, the studio moved on hiring Drew Goddard to write and direct, while Kinberg, Reynolds and Donner will produce the film. The following month, Brolin stated that <b>production</b> <b>will</b> begin at some point during 2018.|$|E
5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun <b>production</b> <b>will</b> be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E
5|$|There are {{at least}} five {{competing}} theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the book, or perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona, then brought to Kells, where the illuminations were perhaps added, and never finished. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona. Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells. Fourth, {{it may have been}} produced in the north of England, perhaps at Lindisfarne, then brought to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, {{it may have been the}} product of an unknown monastery in Pictish Scotland, though there is no actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland. Although the question of the exact location of the book's <b>production</b> <b>will</b> probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted. Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona.|$|E
