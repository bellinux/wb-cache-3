A consecutive 220 patients undergoing thyroidectomy were enrolled. All patients were intubated with the EMG endotracheal tube under direct laryngoscopy. The electrode position and tube displacement were routinely checked and measured by laryngofiberoscopy before and after patient positioning. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups. In Group I (n= 110), the EMG tube was taped and fixed to the right mouth angle before full neck extension. In Group II (n= 110), the EMG tube was disconnected from the circuit tube and was not taped until full neck extension. In all patients, we ensured that the final electrode position was the optimal position with laryngofiberoscopic examination. The tube displacement after neck extension ranged from 16  mm upward to 4  mm downward in Group I and from 12  mm upward to 5  mm downward in Group II.

30|$|However, ERD/ERS {{patterns}} are typically short-lasting (half to few seconds) and their frequency range may vary with subjects [13]. Thus, only optimizing the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> {{may not be}} sufficient to achieve a good classification, and a BCI system using bipolar recording also requires more precise user-specific time-frequency parameterization in the feature extraction step. To address this problem, a number of approaches were proposed to estimate time-frequency characteristics of motor imagery EEG [13 – 16], but only a few were successfully applied to bipolar recording data. Among those methods, the filter bank CSP (FBCSP) method seems to be the most effective one, yielding the best BCI performances on BCI competition datasets [17]. FBCSP was initially proposed only for frequency band optimization and then extended to include an optimal temporal selection process [14]. However, FBCSP-based methods involve feature selection procedures based on mutual information, which require tedious iterative steps that greatly increase their complexity. Moreover, the latest version of FBSCP selects the optimal time segment from only a few different options, which did not yield better results on bipolar recording data (BCI competition IV dataset IIb) compared to previous versions [14].|$|E

40|$|Abstract Electroporation-based {{treatment}} combining high-voltage electric pulses {{and poorly}} permanent cyto-toxic drugs, i. e., electrochemotherapy (ECT), is currently used for treating superficial tumor nodules by following {{standard operating procedures}}. Besides ECT, another electroporation-based treatment, nonthermal irreversible electroporation (N-TIRE), is also efficient at ablating deep-seated tumors. To perform ECT or N-TIRE of deep-seated tumors, following standard operating procedures is not sufficient and patient-specific treatment planning is required for successful treatment. Treatment planning is required because {{of the use of}} individual long-needle electrodes and the diverse shape, size and location of deep-seated tumors. Many institutions that already perform ECT of superficial metastases could benefit from treatment-planning software that would enable the preparation of patient-specific treatment plans. To this end, we have developed a Web-based treatment-planning software for planning electroporation-based treatments that does not require prior engineering knowledge from the user (e. g., the clinician). The software includes algorithms for auto-matic tissue segmentation and, after segmentation, gener-ation of a 3 D model of the tissue. The procedure allows the user to define how the electrodes will be inserted.

Recent advances in knowledge regarding the handling of MRI artifacts in cochlear implantees indicate that estimating the intracochlear electrode’s position with an MRI could be possible. This study’s aim was to evaluate the ipsilaterally <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> using MRI at 1. 5 [*]T.

40|$|Objective: To review {{literature}} {{pertaining to}} the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of elec-troconvulsive therapy (ECT) in treating late-life depression. Method: We undertook a literature review {{with an emphasis on}} research studies published in the last 10 years. Results: There is a positive association between advancing age and ECT efficacy. Age per se does not necessarily increase the risk of cognitive side effects from ECT, but this risk is increased by age-associated neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s dementia and cerebrovascular disease. With appropriate evaluation and monitoring, ECT can be used safely in patients of very advanced age and in those with serious medical conditions. Sev-eral technical factors, including dose of electricity relative to a patient’s seizure threshold, <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes,</b> frequency of administration, and total number of treatments, {{have an impact on the}} efficacy and cognitive side effects of ECT and need to be taken into account when administering ECT.

Conclusions: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in our understanding of the effect of technical factors on the efficacy and cognitive side effects of ECT. When ad-ministered in an optimal manner, ECT is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment in older patients. Relapse of depression after response to ECT remains a significant problem, and there is a need for further research into the prediction and prevention of post-ECT relapse.

40|$|Purpose – Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is an {{outstanding}} technique for treatment of tumor nodules which is currently used for treatment of skin metastases, {{and now it is}} being developed for treatment of internal organs such as, bone, liver, etc. In this work the authors’ goal was finding a simple and proper needles configuration, allowing electroporation of whole cancer cell membranes, possibly minimizing direct cell death of healthy tissue. Design/methodology/approach – This work shows numerical analysis of the ECT of a deep-seated tumor, like in bone tissue of human limb. The tumor is excited by a sequence of square-wave electric pulses (5 kHz), inducing a 1, 000 V/cm electric field through a suitable configuration of 30 mm long steel needle electrodes inserted in a part of limb long 20 cm. Treated element is numerically modeled in a very simplified 3 D geometry. All materials are assumed as homogeneous, linear and isotropic mediums. Findings – Electrochemotherapy is based on the local application of short and intense electric pulses that transiently permeabilizes neoplastic cells membrane, thus allowing cytotoxicity increase of a chemotherapeutic drug, bleomycin, and reducing its dosage. The local field in target tissues depends on geometry and <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes,</b> that have to be placed according cancer shape and size, and excited by electric pulses of opportune amplitude.

40|$|Spark plugs {{have been}} igniting {{combustible}} mixtures like {{those found in}} automotive engines for over a century, and {{the principles of the}} associated ignition techniques using thermal plasma (inductive or capacitive sparks) have remained relatively unchanged during that time. However, internal combustion engines are increasingly operating with boosted intake pressures (i. e. turbo- or super-charged) in order to maintain power output while simultaneously reducing engine size and weight, and they are also operating with increased recirculated exhaust gas dilution to reduce the production of harmful nitrogen oxides. This “downsizing” to increase fuel economy compounded with diluting to decrease emissions leads to challenges in both obtaining traditional ignition and promoting sufficiently fast combustion under this operating paradigm. In conjunction with appropriate electrode design, transient non-thermal plasma can exploit certain non-equilibrium chemistry and physics to bypass these challenges and ultimately promote more reliable ignition and faster combustion. Applied and fundamental experimental investigations of two different advanced ignition techniques are presented: 1) corona discharges igniting gasoline/air/exhaust mixtures in a boosted direct- injection single cylinder research engine and 2) repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharges igniting methane/air mixtures in a constant volume chamber. The engine experimental results show significant decreases in fuel consumption and nitrogen oxide emissions under boosted operation, and both experiments demonstrate more robust ignition and faster flame development. The constant volume chamber results in particular raise important questions about the relative contributions of chemistry and transport to the experimentally observed combustion enhancement. These results highlight the critical importance of electrode design in advanced ignition techniques—the shape and <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> greatly influences the hydrodynamics of developing flame kernels into fuel-air charges. While this work demonstrates that non-thermal plasma ignition is a promising solution to both increase fuel economy and decrease emissions of future automotive engines, much work remains to be done to understand the beneficial coupling between the detailed non-thermal plasma chemistry and the hydrodynamics associated with these real ignition devices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{electrical}} {{activity of the}} uterine muscle is representative of uterine contractility. Its characterization {{may be used to}} detect a potential risk of preterm delivery in women, even at an early gestational stage. Methods We have investigated the effect of the recording electrode position on the spectral content of the signal by using a mathematical model of the women's abdomen. We have then compared the simulated results to actual recordings. On signals with noise reduced with a dedicated algorithm, we have characterized the main frequency components of the signal spectrum in order to compute parameters indicative of different situations: preterm contractions resulting nonetheless in term delivery (i. e. normal contractions) and preterm contractions leading to preterm delivery (i. e. high-risk contractions). A diagnosis system permitted us to discriminate between these different categories of contractions. As the position of the placenta seems to affect the frequency content of {{electrical activity}}, we have also investigated in monkeys, with internal electrodes attached on the uterus, the effect of the placenta on the spectral content of the electrical signals. Results In women, the best electrode position was the median vertical axis of the abdomen. The discrimination between high risk and normal contractions showed {{that it was possible to}} detect a risk of preterm labour as early as at the 27 th week of pregnancy (Misclassification Rate range: 11 – 19. 5 %). Placental influence on electrical signals was evidenced in animal recordings, with higher energy content in high frequency bands, for signals recorded away from the placenta when compared to signals recorded above the placental insertion. However, we noticed, from pregnancy to labour, a similar evolution of the frequency content of the signal towards high frequencies, whatever the relative <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> and placenta. Conclusion On human recordings, this study has proved that it is possible to detect, by non-invasive abdominal recordings, a risk of preterm birth as early as the 27 th week of pregnancy. On animal signals, we have evidenced that the placenta exerts a local influence on the characteristics of the electrical activity of the uterus. However, these differences have a small influence on premature delivery risk diagnosis when using proper diagnosis tools. </p...|$|E
40|$|Published online February 5, 2016 OBJECTIVE Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) of the {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STN) {{is widely used}} in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, which target area of this region results in the highest antiparkinsonian efficacy is still a matter of debate. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a more accurate methodology to locate the electrodes and the contacts used for chronic stimulation (active contacts) in the subthalamic region, and to determine the position at which stimulation conveys the greatest clinical benefit. METHODS The study group comprised 40 patients with PD in whom bilateral DBS electrodes had been implanted in the STN. Based on the Morel atlas, the authors created an adaptable 3 D atlas that takes into account individual anatomical variability and divides the STN into functional territories. The locations of the electrodes and active contacts were obtained from an accurate volumetric assessment of the artifact using preoperative and postoperative MR images. Active contacts were positioned in the 3 D atlas using stereotactic coordinates and a new volumetric method based on an ellipsoid representation created from all voxels that belong to a set of contacts. The antiparkinsonian benefit of the stimulation was evaluated by the reduction in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III) score and in the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) at 6 months. A homogeneous group classification for contact position and the respective clinical improvement was applied using a hierarchical clustering method. RESULTS Subthalamic stimulation induced a significant reduction of 58. 0 % ± 16. 5 % in the UPDRS-III score (p < 0. 001) and 64. 9 % ± 21. 0 % in the LEDD (p < 0. 001). The greatest reductions in the total and contralateral UPDRS-III scores (64 % and 76 %, respectively) and in the LEDD (73 %) were obtained when the active contacts were placed approximately 12 mm lateral to the midline, with no influence of the position being observed in the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. In contrast, contacts located about 10 mm from the midline only reduced the global and contralateral UPDRS-III scores by 47 % and 41 %, respectively, and the LEDD by 33 %. Using the ellipsoid method of location, active contacts with the highest benefit were positioned in the rostral and most lateral portion of the STN and at the interface between this subthalamic region, the zona incerta, and the thalamic fasciculus. Contacts placed in the most medial regions of the motor STN area provided the lowest clinical efficacy. CONCLUSIONS The authors report an accurate new methodology to assess the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> and contacts used for chronic subthalamic stimulation. Using this approach, the highest antiparkinsonian benefit is achieved when active contacts are located within the rostral and the most lateral parts of the motor region of the STN and at the interface of this region and adjacent areas (zona incerta and thalamic fasciculus).

The X-ray machine will give the doctor a view of the heart and the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electrodes,</b> and the magnets will allow the doctor to guide the electrodes through the heart. The magnets are controlled with either a joystick or game controller. The electrophysiologist begins by moving the electrodes along the conduction pathways and along the inner walls of the heart, measuring the electrical activity along the way.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The optimal <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrode</b> arrays in the cochlea is {{extremely}} important. Our standard {{approach is to}} use a 3 -dimensional rotational x-ray for the intraoperative determination <b>of</b> the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electrode</b> array. We wanted to see if spread of excitation (SOE) is useful for determining the electrode array position within the cochlea. Study Design: Prospective blind study design. Setting: Tertiary University Referral Center (Cochlear Implantation Center Amsterdam-Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam). Patients: Seventy-two implanted ears with a Cochlear Freedom device. Intervention: After cochlear implantation, we compared the 3 -dimensional rotational x-ray imaging and SOE measurements. The investigators were blinded for the intraoperative surgeon findings and also for the imaging findings. Outcome Measure(s) : Electrode array foldovers within the cochlea and the reliability of the SOE measurements. Results: We placed implants in 72 ears in this study, and all procedures seemed to be surgically uneventful. To our surprise, we discovered 4 electrode foldovers in this group. Of the 4 foldovers, 3 were corrected intraoperatively. Conclusion: We found that intraoperative imaging and/or electrophysiologic measurements such as the SOE provide very useful information regarding electrode position within the cochlea. Spread of excitation is effective in detecting electrode array foldovers if the audiologist is experienced. Some software modifications are suggeste...|$|R
