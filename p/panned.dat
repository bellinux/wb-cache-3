40|$|Abstract—ZigBee {{is popular}} for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) devices {{because of its}} low power consumption, {{built-in}} security method and ratified specifications. With these features, it is also suitable {{to be used with}} medical sensor devices. Medical sensors in a human body self organize a ZigBee Personal Area Network (<b>PAN).</b> These <b>PANs</b> are interconnected and form a HealthNet. For the interconnection, a ZigBee <b>PAN</b> detects existence of another <b>PAN</b> with beacon detection or active channel scan. Different ZigBee interconnection schemes are used after detection. <b>PAN</b> bridge method uses special bridge node that works for different <b>PANs</b> with time division method. <b>PAN</b> merge method temporarily changes <b>PAN</b> coordinator’s role as bridge node and merges two <b>PANs.</b> Peer-to-peer network temporarily share all resources when two <b>PANs</b> are met, but all <b>PANs</b> have to use the same channel and operate as an ad-hoc network. In this paper, we perform extensive evaluations using NS- 2 simulations to compare <b>PAN</b> interconnection methods. Results show that the <b>PAN</b> bridge is the most useful method because it is not affected by router/node ratio and is applicable to different channel usages. I...|$|R
