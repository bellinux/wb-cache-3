50|$|Both {{agents are}} {{administered}} by spinal tap (lumbar puncture - LP or cisternal puncture at the cervicocranial junction). The human patient is rolled from the lateral decubitus (lying on the side) to prone. Ankles are {{strapped to the}} end of a hard X-ray, CT, or MRI table. To obtain images of the cervical region the patient is then carefully tilted cephalad (toward the head) so contrast agent (particularly Pantopaque) can enter the neck region. Care is given to prevent spilling dye into the posterior fossa (back of the head) or to enter the cranial cavity in general. This speaks to the inability to remove the heavier or more viscous Pantopaque without aspirating it with spinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar <b>puncture</b> <b>needle</b> in the low back (sticking up vertically) or back of the neck. With Metrizamide the issue is that if entering the cranial cavity and high dose exposure to the blood brain barrier, side effects are more likely encountered. Issues related to absorption into the general circulation are also encountered.|$|E

30|$|The IO {{approach}} is a very fast, simple infusion technique but non-negligible number of IO insertion failure even by trained emergency physicians remain (Simmons et al. 1994; Moscati & Moore 1990). One possible reason of high failure rate was caused mainly by the inability to control {{the path of the}} catheter. With manual bone marrow <b>puncture</b> <b>needle,</b> penetration of the bone needs relatively massive force especially in adult bones and it is also difficult to confirm the correct placement of the needle (Horton & Beamer 2008).

We conducted a prospective study in 2 French diabetes foot clinics. Transcutaneous bone biopsy specimens, <b>needle</b> <b>puncture</b> specimens, and swab samples were collected {{on the same day}} for each patient. Results. Overall, 31 patients were included in the study from July 2006 through February 2008. Twenty-one bone biopsy specimens (67. 7 %), 18 <b>needle</b> <b>puncture</b> specimens (58 %), and 30 swab samples (96. 7 %) had positive culture results. Staphylococcus aureus was {{the most common type of}} bacteria that grew from bone samples, followed by Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} which modification to a vascular <b>puncture</b> <b>needle</b> results in increased visualization during ultrasound (US) -guided vascular puncture. METHODS: We evaluated US {{images of a}} phantom made of degassed gelatin {{and each of the}} following four modified versions of a commercially available vascular <b>puncture</b> <b>needle</b> (18 G) : re-cut needle, dimple needle, rough-surface needle (rough over the sections of needle located 3 - 6 mm from the tip), and a needle with four side holes (side holes covered by the sheath). An unmodified commercially available <b>puncture</b> <b>needle</b> was used as a control. Five interventional radiologists evaluated image quality according to the following classification grade:&#x 2005;I, invisible; II, poor; III, moderate; IV, good; V, excellent. RESULTS: The highest score for needle visualization was obtained for the needle with four side holes. The re-cut needle scored the same as the control. Multiple comparisons were conducted using overall evaluation scores among the commercially available needle, dimple needle, rough-surface needle (3 - 6 mm), and the needle with four side holes. A significantly higher score was obtained for the needle with four side holes (P < 0. 05 / 6).

40|$|Introduction: We {{assessed}} the acoustic transmission, image quality, and vessel {{integrity of the}} Blue PhantomTM 2 Vessel Original Ultrasound Training Model with repeated use. Methods: The study consisted of two phases. During the first phase, {{a portion of the}} Blue PhantomTM rubber matrix (without a simulated vessel) was placed over a two-tiered echogenic structure and was repeatedly punctured with a hollow bore 18 -gauge needle in a 1 cm 2 area. During the second phase, a portion of the matrix with a simulated vessel was repeatedly punctured with another hollow bore 18 -gauge needle. During both phases we obtained an ultrasound image using a high-frequency linear probe after every 100 <b>needle</b> <b>punctures</b> to assess the effect of repeated <b>needle</b> <b>punctures</b> on image quality, acoustic transmission, and simulated vessel integrity. Results: Testing on the rubber matrix alone (first phase) without a vessel demonstrated a gradual decrease in image quality and visualization of the proximal and distal portions of the target structure, but they remained visible after 1, 000 <b>needle</b> <b>punctures.</b> The second phase demonstrated excellent acoustic transmission and image quality on both transverse and longitudinal images of the rubber matrix and simulated vessel after 1, 000 <b>needle</b> <b>punctures.</b> The anterior and posterior vessel walls and needle tip were well visualized without any signs of vessel leakage on still images or with compression and power Doppler. Conclusion: The Blue PhantomTM 2 Vessel Original Ultrasound Training Model demonstrated excellent durability after 1, 000 <b>needle</b> <b>punctures</b> in a 1 - cm 2 area.
