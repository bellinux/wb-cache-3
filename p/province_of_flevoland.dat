40|$|The {{distribution}} of beetles {{of the genera}} Cychramus, Pocadius and Thalycra in the Netherlands (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) The {{aim of this study}} is to review the status of the five recorded species of the genera Cychramus, Pocadius and Thalycra in the Netherlands. They are all mycetobiont, the larvae and the adult beetles feeding and breeding on and in fungi. Cychramus luteus seems to be expanding slowly in the Netherlands, but records are still lacking from the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Friesland, <b>Flevoland</b> and Zeeland. Cychramus variegatus has been mentioned only from the southern <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> the Netherlands. In the northern part of the Netherlands Pocadius ferrugineus is nearly absent. This could be caused by the fact that the fungus Lycoperdon pyriforme is very rare in that region. Only a few number of records of Pocadius adustus are known. For Thalycra fervida no records have been mentioned from the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Groningen, <b>Flevoland</b> and Zeeland. The reason is possibly the absence of pine woods in these regions. A further study of the status and the biotope of P. adustus and C. variegatus could reveal the cause of their rareness...|$|R
50|$|One <b>province</b> <b>of</b> the Netherlands, <b>Flevoland</b> (pop. 370,000 (2006)), was {{reclaimed}} {{from the}} Zuiderzee (Southern Sea). After a flood in 1916, {{it was decided}} that the Zuiderzee, an inland sea within the Netherlands, would be closed and reclaimed. In 1932, a causeway (the Afsluitdijk) was completed, which closed off the sea completely. The Zuiderzee was subsequently called IJsselmeer (IJssel-lake) and its previously salty water became fresh.|$|R

40|$|In 1998, the {{combined}} Provincial Road Safety Boards in the Netherlands decided {{to develop a}} policy path for permanent traffic education for driving licence holders. In this, they distinguish between the various age groups. The <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Flevoland</b> and Groningen commissioned SWOV to make {{a study of the}} feasibility of traffic education for the target group of 25 - 60 years old. The study consists of two parts. In the first part a study was made of where the road safety problems of the target group lie, and of which points of application there are for traffic education. This part used the literature and analysis of databases. In the second part, the design of this traffic education, especially the learning goals, was examined. It was determined which behaviour and which of its influence factors need attention for educating the target group. For the learning goals, the same structure was used as for that of the car driving licence, as formulated by the Ministry of Transport. The specific learning goals were discussed in interviews with key figures of the permanent traffic education in the Netherlands. The interviews determined the primary items for permanent traffic education of the target group. Furthermore, the interviews, together with the literature, indicated points of application for the design of a programme for permanent traffic education and the roles that the various organisations could play. Based on this, it is suggested how Provincial Road Safety Boards can stimulate and strengthen education programmes for driving licence holders...|$|R
40|$|On the {{occurrence}} of Otiorhynchus dieckmanni in the Netherlands (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) In 1994 Otiorhynchus dieckmanni was collected {{for the first time}} in the Netherlands in a garden in Helvoirt (Noord-Brabant). Since then the species was recorded from several other localities far apart from each other, in the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Noord-Brabant, Limburg, <b>Flevoland</b> and Noord-Holland. On one locality at Weert (Limburg), the species was collected in two consecutive years; on another locality, Heemstede (Noord-Holland), one teneral specimen was found. These data strongly suggest that O. dieckmanni is now well established in the Netherlands...|$|R

Hunter-bagged hares which had the typical lesions of the disease were serologically examined using the hemagglutination assay and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, and tissue samples were stained with the Bosma-Steiner modified silver stain. Nine out of 12 suspected hares from five different provinces from the Netherlands showed serological and histological evidence of syphilis.

50|$|In February 2011, North Holland, {{together}} with the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Utrecht and <b>Flevoland,</b> showed a desire to investigate the feasibility of a merger between the three provinces. This has been positively received by the Dutch cabinet, for the desire to create one Randstad province has already been mentioned in the coalition agreement. The <b>province</b> <b>of</b> South Holland, part of the Randstad urban area, visioned to be part <b>of</b> the Randstad <b>province,</b> and very much supportive {{of the idea of}} a merger into one province, is not named.
