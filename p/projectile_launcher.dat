50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the CAR68, Gun f/x was approached by the Monterey Bay Corporation to provide concept and development for a less-lethal <b>projectile</b> <b>launcher</b> for use by military and law enforcement. Working with Airgun Designs, this project produced the concept less-lethal weapon known as the UTPBS, which eventually became FN Herstal's FN 303. This design could be attached to an M16 rifle and was conceived as a less-lethal weapon coupled with a lethal weapon system, providing a wide range of response capabilities that were immediately available. A stand-alone version was also developed. The UTPBS also featured a rotating barrel magazine, allowing {{for a wide range of}} different projectiles to be available and selectable without the need to change magazines. The company is currently working on further development of the burst disc concept, as well as a variety of less-lethal weapons and simulators.|$|E

40|$|A {{remedy for}} the lack of a {{technique}} for testing the effects of orbital debris impacts has been sought along two paths at Boeing and elsewhere, firstly through the development of new launcher techniques capable of impact velocities between 8 and 16 km/s and secondly through the development of similitude techniques for modeling 8 to 16 km/s impacts using the present capabilities of <b>projectile</b> <b>launchers.</b> These two approaches are briefly discussed...|$|R
50|$|With any {{of these}} <b>projectile</b> <b>{{launcher}}s,</b> the launcher gives a high velocity at, or near, ground level. In order to achieve orbit, the projectile must be given enough extra velocity to punch through the atmosphere, unless it includes an additional propulsion system (such as a rocket). Also, the projectile needs either an internal or external means to perform orbital insertion. The designs below fall into three categories, electrically driven, chemically driven, and mechanically driven.|$|R

A superconducting layer is provided aft of the projectile, either {{directly on the}} projectile or on a platform upon which the projectile is carried, and a traveling magnetic field is caused to propagate along a magnetic field drive coil in which the projectile is disposed.

In one embodiment, a segmented drive coil is used to generate the traveling magnetic field...|$|E
40|$|The {{modelling}} {{and analysis}} of high energy impact on aircraft structures is highly complex. Traditional methods give only a limited understanding of what occurs and it {{is evident from the}} continuing problem of uncontained engine failure and other debris impact that a more accurate way of predicting the results of such impacts is needed. Finite element techniques can provide that solution. This work attempts to model accurately impacts to existing aircraft structures. Of particular interest is the behaviour at the ballistic velocity as this is where the problem is most difficult to predict. Initially the model consisted of a simple sheet subject to impact by a cylindrical projectile. This was used to develop the modelling techniques for the more complex model. Issues that arose included the mesh density, the material model and the penalty stiffness factor used. Experimental testing was carried out using a gas fired <b>projectile</b> <b>launcher</b> to validate the finite element model. The geometry of the second model was more complex, a right angled stringer was riveted to a plate using four rivets. Two different approaches were used in modelling here, that of modelling the rivets in 3 D and that o f modelling the rivets using 2 D approximations. Modelling the rivets in 3 D proved to be impractical and o f the 2 D approximations the model where the rivets were not allowed to fail proved the most accurate. Experimental testing was again used for validation. Finally a new gas powered <b>projectile</b> <b>launcher</b> was designed and built. Improvements over its predecessor included the ability to accommodate a half metre squared test plate, impact this plate anywhere on its surface and tilt the plate through 45 °. Also included were modifications to the barrel so that projectiles of any shape or size up to a maximum of 50 mm in diameter could be used...|$|E
40|$|Current {{training}} simulators for {{police officers and}} soldiers lack two critical qualities for establishing a compelling sense of immersion within a virtual environment: a strong disincentive to getting shot, and accurate feedback about the bodily location of a shot. This research addresses these issues with hardware architecture for a Tactical Tactile Training Vest (T 3 V). In this study, we have evaluated the design space of impact “tactors” and present a T 3 V prototype that can be viscerally felt. This research focuses on determining the optimal design parameters for creating maximum tactor hitting energy. The energy transferred to the projectile directly relates {{to the quality of}} the disincentive. The complete T 3 V design will include an array of these tactors on front and back of the body to offer accurate spatial feedback. The impact tactor created and tested for this research is an electromagnetic <b>projectile</b> <b>launcher,</b> similar to a solenoid, but lower profile and higher energy.

50|$|Small to {{moderate}} size high-acceleration electromagnetic <b>projectile</b> <b>launchers</b> are currently undergoing active {{research by the}} US Navy for use as ground-based or ship-based weapons (most often railguns but coilguns in some cases). On larger scale than weapons currently near deployment but sometimes suggested in long-range future projections, a sufficiently high velocity linear motor, a mass driver, could in theory be used as intercontinental artillery (or, if built on the Moon or in orbit, used to attack a location on Earth's surface). As the mass driver would be located further up the gravity well than the theoretical targets, it would enjoy a significant energy imbalance in terms of counter-attack.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} impact {{experiments}} are conducted, to characterize a first high-speed gas gun <b>projectile</b> <b>launcher.</b> Tests with carbon composite sandwich shell material demonstrators, for aircraft fuselages are performed with typical projectiles (steel and ice) at impact velocities {{of up to}} 250 m/s. The specimens are subjected to non-destructive testing following the impact events. First impact tests are conducted with a new gas gun system with three barrels, having calibers of 25, 60 and 200 mm, respectively. A novel device, the instrumented impact test rig, which records dynamic forces during an impact, is mounted on the largest caliber barrel. A finite element model of this device is generated and numerical simulations are conducted using steel and rubber projectiles. These projectiles have masses of up to 1. 5 kg and impact velocities reach 250 km/h. The simulations with the numerical model focus on the core element of dynamic force measurements, the Hopkinson bar.

40|$|The {{methodology}} for initiating stable combustion in a ram accelerator {{operating in the}} thermally choked mode is presented in this paper. The ram accelerator is a high velocity ramjet-in-tube <b>projectile</b> <b>launcher</b> whose principle of operation {{is similar to that}} of an airbreathing ramjet. The subcaliber projectile travels supersonically through a stationary tube filled with a premixed combustible gas mixture. In the thermally choked propulsion mode subsonic combustion takes place behind the base of the projectile and leads to thermal choking, which stabilizes a normal shock system on the projectile, thus producing forward thrust. Projectiles with masses in the 45 - 90 g range have been accelerated to velocities up to 2650 m/sec in a 38 mm bore, 16 m long accelerator tube. Operation of the ram accelerator is started by injecting the projectile into the accelerator tube at velocities in the 700 - 1300 m/sec range by means of a conventional gas gun. A specially designed obturator, which seals the bore of the gun during this initial acceleration, enters the ram accelerator together with the projectile. The interaction of the obturator with the propellant gas ignites the gas mixture and establishes stable combustion behind the projectile...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis, studies of flat or pancake type electromagnetic launcher systems are described. The studies involved the development of several numerical models, and are supported throughout by experimental investigation. The models {{were based on a}} coaxial filamentary division technique, and the results they provided were compared with those from a commercial electromagnetic finite element modelling package. They were used to investigate some of the many possible launcher structures and power supply arrangements, as part of a wide-ranging parametric study. The aim of this thesis was to gain an insight into the factors that affect the performance of the launchers. Several different techniques were implemented to reduce the computation time. Practical experimentation provided a clear demonstration of the launcher technology, and supplied valuable model validation data. To aid the experimental work new projectile speed and yaw measurement systems were developed, and these were supported by results from a high-speed camera. A novel dual <b>projectile</b> <b>launcher</b> was tested, and was shown to improve the launch efficiency and to operate at higher energies, due to the reduction in drive coil recoil. Projectile deformation was investigated in both solid discs and flat annular projectiles...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{uniaxial}} compression tests on some pharmaceutical powders subjected to strain rates of between 10 - 3 and 105 s- 1 are given. The tests fall into three main categories: low-strain-rate tests (10 - 3 - 10 s- 1) performed on a servohydraulic variable speed-compression machine at constant compression rate; medium-strain-rate tests (102 - 103 s- 1) {{carried out on}} a drop hammer; and high strain rate tests (103 - 105 s- 1) performed on a high-pressure air <b>projectile</b> <b>launcher</b> compaction apparatus. Axial and radial pressures, as well as displacement-time measurements, are made. Powders tested include: Dipac sugar; sodium chloride; potassium bromide; lactose; paracetamol d. c.; avicel; calcium phosphate; and copper sulphate. The influence of compression rate on {{the form of the}} characteristic pressure-density and radial-axial pressure relationships during uniaxial straining is presented. The investigation showed that the general tendency for all powders tested, except for paracetamol d. c., is to exhibit increased compaction pressure with strain rate up to 105 s- 1. Due to morphological and compositional effects, paracetamol d. c. softens with the rate of straining up to about 102 s- 1 and at higher rates it behaves like other powders. Also the mean radial pressure at the die wall (obtained by a pin-type transducer) shows that the friction conditions are variable during the process, and their effect tends to decrease as the speed of compaction increases, resulting in more uniform density compacts. Finally, by observing the decay of both axial and radial pressures with time under constant volume conditions, a reasonably linear behaviour is obtained for all materials tested, particularly the axial relaxation curves, over the period recorded.

40|$|The growing {{quantity}} of debris in Earth orbit poses {{a danger to}} users of the orbital environment, such as spacecraft. It also increases the risk that humans or manmade structures could be impacted when objects reenter Earth's atmosphere. During {{the design of a}} spacecraft, a requirement may be specified for the surviv-ability of the spacecraft against Meteoroid / Orbital Debris (M/OD) impacts throughout the mission; further-more, the structure of a spacecraft is designed to insure its integrity during the launch and, if it is reusable, during descent, re-entry and landing. In addition, the structure has to provide required stiffness in order to allow for exact positioning of experiments and antennas, and it has to protect the payload against the space environment. In order to decrease the probability of spacecraft failure caused by M/OD, space maneuver is needed to avoid M/OD if the M/OD has dimensions larger than 10 cm, but for M/OD with dimensions less than 1 cm M/OD shields are needed for spacecrafts. It is therefore necessary to determine the impact-related failure mechanisms and associated ballistic limit equations (BLEs) for typical spacecraft components and subsys-tems. The methods that are used to obtain the ballistic limit equations are numerical simulations and la-borato-ry experiments. In order to perform an high energy ballistic characterization of layered structures, a new ad-vanced electromagnetic accelerator, called railgun, has been assembled and tuned. A railgun is an electrically powered electromagnetic <b>projectile</b> <b>launcher.</b> Such device is made up of a pair of parallel conducting rails, which a sliding metallic armature is accelerated along by the electromagnetic effect (Lorentz force) of a cur-rent that flows down one rail, into the armature and then back along the other rail, thanks to a high power pulse given by a bank of capacitors. A tunable power supplier is used to set the capacitors charging voltage at the desired level: in this way the Rail Gun energy can be tuned {{as a function of the}} desired bullet velocity. This facility is able to analyze both low and high velocity impacts. A numerical simulation is also performed by using the Ansys Autodyn code in order to analyze the damage. The experimental results and numerical simulations show that the railgun-device is a good candidate to perform impact testing of materials in the space debris energy range...|$|E
