5|$|Despite these precautions, <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> {{the power}} {{stations}} {{was still a}} factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> nearby power stations. This was mainly {{because some of the}} houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed to as much as 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E
5|$|Some of Catawissa Creek's tributaries {{are known}} to contain trout, but the creek itself does not contain any fish due to <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> acidic mine drainage. In 1966, some woodcocks were {{observed}} to live along Catawissa Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary cause}} of COPD is tobacco smoke, with {{occupational}} exposure and <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> indoor fires being significant causes in some countries. Typically these exposures must occur over several decades before symptoms develop. A person's genetic makeup also affects the risk.|$|E

50|$|Nonpoint source (NPS) {{pollution}} {{is a term}} used to describe <b>pollution</b> resulting <b>from</b> many diffuse sources, in direct contrast to point source <b>pollution</b> which results <b>from</b> a single source. Nonpoint source <b>pollution</b> generally results <b>from</b> land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage, or hydrological modification (rainfall or snowmelt) where tracing the pollution back to a single source is difficult.|$|R
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{monitoring}} and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas; South of Malmesbury, Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban. In the rural area 22 water bodies are classified as good, 46 as moderated and 8 as poor. The main reasons for not achieving good scores are <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> waste water, agriculture and rural land management. In the urban area one water body is rated good, while 12 are rated moderate and one is poor. The <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> upstream is added to by the effects of industry, manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected by physical modifications to the water course. Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes; of these 22 percent of rivers are rated as good ecological status, 40 percent good for chemical status and 31 percent good for biological status.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the light <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 miles to the east in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{that affect}} water {{supply in the}} United States include {{droughts}} in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall {{as a result of}} climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> combined sewer overflows.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom trawl fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> coastal development.|$|E
50|$|The Spokane River {{contains}} {{some of the}} highest concentrations of heavy metals of any river in the state, resulting <b>from</b> <b>pollution</b> coming <b>from</b> Lake Coeur D'Alene and traveling from the Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex Superfund Site.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the river}} is used for {{domestic}} consumption, it does suffer <b>from</b> <b>pollution,</b> particularly <b>from</b> nitrates. These come {{from the use of}} fertilizers that are not fully used by the plants. Other than that, there were intensive mining activities along the river between 1950 and 1999, and factories also produced pollution. That being said, the river's water quality is not uniformly poor, and the upper areas of the river are relatively free <b>from</b> <b>pollution.</b>|$|R
5|$|Murray cod {{have died}} out {{in many of}} their upland habitats, {{particularly}} in the southern Murray-Darling basin, due {{to a combination of}} overfishing, siltation, dams and weirs blocking migration, <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> arsenic-based sheep-dips, mining, and in some cases, introduced trout stockings, which causes competition between juvenile Murray cod and introduced trout species.|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency is {{responsible}} for monitoring water quality on the river and its tributaries, which have been divided into seventeen separate water bodies. In 2013, seven water bodies were assessed as having good quality and ten as being moderate. The reasons for not achieving good status included <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> waste water, <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> agriculture and physical modifications. The physical modifications include dredging work on the lower reaches, near the junction with the Parrett to increase the channel flow to reduce flooding. The use and storage of the dredged material in bank restoration may also have an impact. In 1998 improvements were sought to treatment works and surface water outfalls to improve water quality. A vegetable washing plant on the Chelston stream at Wellington was also identified {{as a source of}} pollution. The waters of the Upper Tone have been classified as having good ecological status, whereas the section from Wellington to Taunton and downstrean of Taunton are rated as moderate.|$|E
5|$|The bay {{is noted}} for its superfund site, caused by mercury <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> the heavy {{industry}} in Point Comfort (specifically Alcoa), across the bay from the largest settlement of Port Lavaca.

Because of its inshore habits, {{it may also be}} negatively affected by water <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> coastal development. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient due to lack of specific data, while noting that its vulnerability to fishing and habitat degradation may merit concern.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{is a part}} of the Eastern Himalayan zoo-geographic zone. Flora around Darjeeling {{comprises}} sal, oak, semi-evergreen, temperate and alpine forests. Dense evergreen {{forests of}} sal and oak lie around the town, where a wide variety of rare orchids are found. The Lloyd's Botanical Garden preserves common and rare species of plants, while the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park specialises in conserving and breeding endangered Himalayan species. The town of Darjeeling and surrounding region face deforestation due to increasing demand for wood fuel and timber, as well as air <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> increasing vehicular traffic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a {{dredging}} project was proposed on Leggetts Creek {{to repair the}} damage caused by acid mine drainage and coal mining. In 1991, the Lackawanna River Corridor Association gathered data on the water chemistry and biological habitats of Leggetts Creek. In 2012, the South Abington Sewer Authority began upgrading its sewage treatment plant to prevent wastewater and nutrient <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> entering the creek. They also installed new sewer lines, including some that run parallel to or under the creek. PA Trout Unlimited's AMD Technical Assistance Program conducted a survey of the fish population in the creek on November 15, 2013. The Lackawanna Valley Conservancy once received a $190,000 Growing Greener grant for the Leggetts Creek Greenway.|$|E

It also gives an overview of the illegal operational <b>pollutions</b> <b>from</b> ships in that zone. On the basis of the annual surveillance data and a simple extrapolation method it is estimated that the total quantity annually released in illegal operational oil spills is most probably of the same order of magnitude or greater than the accidental releases...|$|R
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|Noise <b>pollution</b> <b>from</b> {{anthropogenic}} {{activities is}} another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
