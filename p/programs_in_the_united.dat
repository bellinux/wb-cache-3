5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their <b>programs.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of milk in returnable containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|E
