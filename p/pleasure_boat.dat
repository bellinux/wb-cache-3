25|$|The railway came to Christchurch in 1847 {{although}} the nearest station, Christchurch Road, was at Holmsley (now the tea rooms) and passengers were taken {{the rest of}} the way by omnibus. A station was built in the town, close to the existing one, in 1862 and was served by a branch line from Ringwood. Christchurch joined the mainline in 1883 and a new station was built. The branch line to Ringwood remained open until 1935. The arrival of the railways affected maritime trade. As the century passed, more and more imports came by rail and less by sea. By 1906 the trade had all but finished. In 1908 Christchurch Council rebuilt and refendered the Town Quay which then became the centre for the many <b>pleasure</b> <b>boat</b> companies that had grown to serve the tourist trade. The last trade vessel to leave the Town Quay was a 60-ton Thames barge called Gerald which came to collect gravel on 12 July 1938. Mudeford however remains a working quay to this day.|$|E

500|$|Divine became {{increasingly}} known for outlandish stunts onstage, each {{time trying to}} outdo {{what he had done}} before. At one performance in London's Hippodrome coinciding with American Independence Day, Divine rose up from the floor on a hydraulic lift, draped in the American flag, and declared: [...] "I'm here representing Freedom, Liberty, Family Values, and the fucking American Way of Life." [...] When he performed at the London Gay Pride parade, he sang on the roof of a hired <b>pleasure</b> <b>boat</b> that floated down the Thames past Jubilee Gardens. At a performance Divine gave at the Hippodrome {{in the last year of}} his life, he appeared onstage riding an infant elephant which had been hired for the occasion. Divine was nevertheless not happy with being known primarily for his drag act, and told an interviewer that [...] "my favorite part of drag is getting out of it. Drag is my work clothes. I only put it on when someone pays me to", a view he echoed to his friends.|$|E

A <b>pleasure</b> <b>boat</b> with three occupants and the two-man crew of a beached catamaran were all reported missing, but were later found. Three other people on board a fishing vessel were treated for exposure. Rescue ships were hampered by anchored Mexican boats and surfers in a channel near the Coast Guard station. According to the Coast Guard, all nine ships that had been reported missing in the storm were later accounted for. Along with the ships, an oil drilling rig in the Gulf was ripped from its location and ran aground near Matagorda Island by the storm. The 19crew members of the rig were rescued by helicopter. As the rig had not yet begun drilling, there was no threat from an oil spill.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, {{the newly}} formed Mersey and Irwell Packet Company {{launched}} regular tourist trips along the river from a landing stage opposite the Granada Studios Tour entrance in Quay Street, taking in the stretch from Castlefield to Salford Quays. [...] This was not universally welcomed as, by September of that year, a retired chemical engineer claimed that the <b>pleasure</b> <b>boat</b> was [...] "leaving clouds of methane in its wake as it disturbed sediment on the river bed". However, in 1991 a feature article appeared in the magazine Lancashire Life extolling {{the virtues of the}} cruise, and stating that the Irwell [...] "once thought a liability is in fact a major asset to urban regeneration... now the twin cities compete to befriend her, to dress her in finery and proudly introduce her back into society. And the public are cordially invited back onto her waters." [...] During 1994, construction work began on a new £1.3Mfootbridge to link Manchester and Salford, to be known as Trinity Bridge. [...] The box-girder and steel cable construction was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava to represent a ship in full sail as the centrepiece of the £50M Chapel Wharf Regeneration Scheme, which was expected to breathe new life into a run-down area of Salford and to create up to 8,000new jobs. [...] In May 1995 a new [...] long multimillion-pound arts trail, {{to be known as the}} Irwell Sculpture Trail, was reported in the Manchester Evening News and in June 1997 work began on the £10 million Lower Irwell Valley Flood Defence Scheme in Lower Kersal.|$|E
