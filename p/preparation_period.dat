5|$|As the {{construction}} was comparatively slow {{due to a}} lack of funding, a motorway concession for the A8 and A9 motorways was granted to BINA Istra for a period of 32 years. The build-operate-transfer concession agreement mandated construction, maintenance and management of the route and its upgrade to motorway standards; this requirement included the building of dual carriageways when the annual average daily traffic (AADT) reached 10,000 vehicles per day or when the average summer daily traffic (ASDT) reached 16,000 vehicles per day. The latter was achieved in 2005 and the motorway upgrade started in 2008, even though the AADT at the time was only 8,500 vehicles. The A8 expansion was commenced by the operator, BINA Istra, immediately following a similar expansion of the A9; on the latter, the entire route was widened except for the two largest bridges, for which the expansion was postponed. The expansion of the A8 was initially limited to the Kanfanar–Rogovići section because the remainder of the route required additional permits and consequently an extended <b>preparation</b> <b>period.</b> On 29 October 2011, the Kanfanar–Rogovići section was upgraded to motorway standards, including four traffic lanes, and the route's designation changed from B8 to A8 (as required by legislated standards).

It seems that testosterone and cortisol are playing {{a key role in}} anabolic and catabolic processes in resistance training. Eight elite Czech and Slovak weightlifters volunteered in present study. The testosterone and cortisol were measured in 4 testing sessions over 18 weeks during <b>preparation</b> and competition <b>period.</b> The training protocol consisted of three specific weightlifting exercises. The saliva samples were collected in 4 testing sessions, pre and 5 min, 15 min and 30 min after protocol, respectively. The basal level of salivary testosterone and cortisol remains unchanged during <b>preparation</b> and competition <b>period.</b> Also, acute testosterone response was not observed over the monitored period. However, acute decrease of cortisol were found between pre intervention and post 5 (p ≤ 0. 01), 15 (p ≤ 0. 01), and 30 min (p ≤ 0. 05) during <b>preparation</b> <b>periods.</b> While in competition period was found significant decrease (p ≤ 0. 05) only 5 min after testing protocol. The testosterone/cortisol ratio significantly increased during <b>preparation</b> <b>periods</b> (p ≤ 0. 01), but not in competition period. Results indicated that the routine assessment of testosterone and cortisol may provide an effective way to monitor acute and chronic adaptive response to weightlifting training.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{consensus}} {{holds that}} a single medullary network generates respiratory rhythm in mammals. Pre-Bötzinger Complex inspiratory (I) neurons, isolated in transverse slices, and preinspiratory (pre-I) neurons, found only in more intact en bloc preparations and in vivo, are each proposed as necessary for rhythm generation. Opioids slow I, but not pre-I, neuronal burst periods. In slices, opioids gradually lengthened respiratory periods, whereas in more intact <b>preparations,</b> <b>periods</b> jumped nondeterministically to integer multiples of the control period (quantal slowing). These findings suggest that opioid-induced quantal slowing results from transmission failure of rhythmic drive from pre-I neurons to preBötC I networks, depressed below threshold for spontaneous rhythmic activity. Thus, both I (in the slice), and pre-I neurons are sufficient for respiratory rhythmogenesis...|$|R

25|$|Thomas's {{forces were}} divided: half {{were with him}} in Nashville {{and the other half}} with John M. Schofield, moving in pursuit from Atlanta, with other troops due to arrive from the Red River Campaign. Hood hoped to defeat Schofield before he could join forces with Thomas and before the {{reinforcements}} from Louisiana arrived. He had the chance at the Battle of Spring Hill in Tennessee (November 29, 1864), but the Union troops were able to slip through the trap, due to the Confederate failure to cut the Columbia-to-Franklin turnpike in the Union rear. At the Battle of Franklin the following day, Hood launched repeated massive frontal assaults against strong entrenchments and suffered severe casualties. David J. Eicher wrote that Hood mortally wounded his army at Franklin but killed it at the Battle of Nashville (December 1516). At Nashville, facing the combined force of Schofield and Thomas, he dug in a few miles south of the city and waited, hoping that Thomas would wreck his army on the Confederate fortifications. After a two-week <b>preparation</b> <b>period</b> in winter weather, during which he received great pressure from Grant and the Union government to attack, Thomas unleashed an overwhelming assault that sent Hood and his survivors in retreat to Franklin and then to Mississippi, never to recover as a fighting force.

Subjects had to switch between tasks {{in which they}} were to respond to either the visual or the auditory component of the stimulus. 11 - 13 Hz occipital amplitude increased prior to auditory, relative to visual repetition trials.

Alternation trials were preceded by an increase in occipital theta-band activity, relative to repetition trials, for the visual task. This effect was also transient. The effects suggest tentative hypotheses for the function of transient bursts of alpha- and theta-band oscillations and indicate the possibility of a psychophysiological resolution of theoretical questions concerning the origin of switch costs.

40|$|A meta-analytic {{review of}} {{empirical}} {{studies that have}} investigated incubation effects on problem solving is reported. Although some researchers have reported increased solution rates after an incubation period (i. e., {{a period of time}} in which a problem is set aside prior to further attempts to solve), others have failed to find effects. The analysis examined the contributions of moderators such as problem type, presence of solution-relevant or misleading cues, and lengths of <b>preparation</b> and incubation <b>periods</b> to incubation effect sizes. The authors identified a positive incubation effect, with divergent thinking tasks benefiting more than linguistic and visual insight tasks from incubation. Longer <b>preparation</b> <b>periods</b> gave a greater incubation effect, whereas filling an incubation period with high cognitive demand tasks gave a smaller incubation effect. Surprisingly, low cognitive demand tasks yielded a stronger incubation effect than did rest during an incubation period when solving linguistic insight problems. The existence of multiple types of incubation effect provides evidence for differential invocation of knowledge-based vs. strategic solution processes across different classes of problem, and it suggests that the conditions under which incubation {{can be used as a}} practical technique for enhancing problem solving must be designed with care.

Speed abilities in all their demonstrations are one of the most important fitness skills in today’s soccer. In our research, we assumed that the higher the match load players achieve, the greater the impact of this load on the level of the selected speed abilities would be.

30|$|Although the {{complexity}} of washback has been acknowledged, it has been claimed that tests seem to have direct impacts {{on the content of}} teaching and learning, which has been supported by various empirical studies (e.g., Ferman, 2004; Hawkey, 2006; Qi, 2004; Wall, 1996, 2005; Wall & Alderson, 1993). For example, Wall and Alderson (1993) investigated the washback effect of a newly employed English examination in Sri Lanka, focusing on its impact on language teaching. A series of classroom observations were conducted to examine the nature of classes. As a result, they found washback effects of the test on the content of teaching, but not on the methodology employed by the teachers. The effects were confirmed during both the normal instruction periods and the examination <b>preparation</b> <b>periods</b> (Wall, 2005). Language teachers appear to select the content of teaching dealt with in the classroom based on the content of tests and tend to concentrate on the skills measured by tests. In a similar vein, the content of students’ learning appears to be strongly influenced by language tests, in particular by high-stakes examinations. Ferman (2004) found that a new national EFL oral matriculation test employed in Israel had a direct washback effect on students’ learning.
