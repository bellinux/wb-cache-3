5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.menziesii in series Banksia, <b>placing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> B.subser. Cratistylis along with nine other species.

5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements.

5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism; the rock has been pressure-cooked. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally sedimentary and igneous rocks with large quantities of quartz and feldspar mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted schist and gneiss, making their original parentage almost unrecognizable. Radiometric dating gives an age of 1700 million years for the metamorphism, <b>placing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the early part of the Proterozoic eon.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, an American botanist, Austin Mast, {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and somewhat different from Thiele and Ladiges'. With respect to B.violacea, Mast's results agree with its placement near B.laricina and B.incana, <b>placing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a clade with these two species and B.sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla (treated at species rank as B.dolichostyla).

5|$|The fossil has {{a number}} of {{features}} that suggest a relation to a group of oryzomyine rodents that includes the South American marsh rat Holochilus, its living relatives Lundomys and Pseudoryzomys, and the extinct Noronhomys and Holochilus primigenus. They share high-crowned (hypsodont) molars and several simplifications of molar morphology, as well as other features that cannot be assessed in Carletonomys, which indicate specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle. It shows the most similarity to Noronhomys and Holochilus, so much so that Pardiñas considered <b>placing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> either of these two genera, but its distinctive morphological features justify placement in a separate genus.|$|E

Multiple international university rankings place it amongst the best universities in the world, with QS <b>placing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Top 200 globally and ranking it the 11th best university under 50 years, and in 2015 it was rated as the best university in the country by Brazil's Ministry of Education.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces. One aspect that was highlighted by this study was the use of self propelled artillery; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal {{that could be used in}} such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track chassis, which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by <b>placing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment.

Two dealated paratype females were also collected with the holotype, looking very similar to each other except for the mandibles and colouration. The mandibular dentition varies among the three, {{and one of the}} paratypes is darker than the holotype. In 1991, a published journal reviewing the species groups assigned M. inquilina to the M. cephalotes species group.

5|$|Brown's 1810 {{monograph}} did {{not include}} an infrageneric classification of Dryandra, and neither did his Prodromus, published later that year. In 1830, however, he introduced the first taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra, placing D.floribunda in section Dryandra verae along with most other species, because its follicles contain a single seed separator. Dryandra verae was renamed Eudryandra by Carl Meissner in 1845. Eleven years later Meissner published a new arrangement, retaining D.floribunda in D.sect. Eudryandra, and further <b>placing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the unranked subgroup § Ilicinae, because of the similarity of its leaves to those of Ilex (holly). In 1870, George Bentham published a revised arrangement in his Flora Australiensis. Bentham retained section Eudryandra, but abandoned almost all of Meissner's unranked groups, including § Ilicinae. D.floribunda was instead placed in D.ser. Floribundae along with four other species with small, mostly terminal flowers, left exposed by their having unusually short floral leaves.|$|E
