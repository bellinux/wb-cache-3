40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{scheduling}} n-jobs {{on a single}} machine. The problem is to determine which machine will be used based on the job characteristics. Since each job has different characteristic according to the customer requirement, the floor shop facing difficulties in selecting the press machine as per requirement. Two steps solution are proposed, first step using fuzzy logic to determine which machine to be used, and the second step to make scheduling n-jobs on selected single press machine following the priority rules EDD (earliest due-date) or SPT (shortest processing time). The fuzzy variables to be considered are speed and <b>pressing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the press machine, while for the non-fuzzy variables are slide, bolster and dies height. The computational experiment is based on 91 jobs with 8 unit press machines supported by software Borland Delphi...|$|E
40|$|Dense 802. 11 {{wireless}} networks {{present a}} <b>pressing</b> <b>capacity</b> challenge: users in proximity contend for limited unlicensed spectrum. Directional antennas promise increased capacity by improving the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver, potentially allowing successful decoding of packets at higher bit-rates. Many uses of directional antennas {{to date have}} directed high gain between two peers, thus maximizing {{the strength of the}} sender's signal reaching the receiver. But in an interference-rich environment, as in dense 802. 11 deployments, directional antennas only truly come into their own when they explicitly null interference from competing concurrent senders. In this paper, we present Cone of Silence (CoS), a technique that leverages software-steerable directional antennas to improve the capacity of indoor 802. 11 wireless networks by adaptively nulling interference. Using in situ signal strength measurements that account for the complex propagation environment, CoS derives custom antenna radiation patterns that maximize the strength of the signal arriving at an access point from a sender while nulling interference from one or more concurrent interferers. CoS leverages multiple antennas, but requires only a single commodity 802. 11 radio, thus avoiding the significant processing requirements of decoding multiple concurrent packets. Experiments in an indoor 802. 11 deployment demonstrate tha...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{activities}} pose special {{demands on}} the type of survey results needed. In the early 1990 s a soil acidification monitoring methodology was adopted in the Netherlands that leaned heavily on methods developed in more fundamental research, most notably the use of proton budgets. Consequently, various controversies still not resolved in the scientific debate reflect on the current practice of soil acidity monitoring and complicate interpretation of the monitoring results. In a pilot study we address the most <b>pressing</b> issues: <b>capacity</b> versus intensity parameters, choice of monitoring objective, and natural variation in the compartment to be monitored. Focus is on the major source of buffering, the possible usefulness of the historic approach, and the regional patterns present in the sandy soils of the Netherlands. In a field campaign 92 locations in sandy regions all over the country were sampled at two depths. The solid phase, the displaced soil solution, and solid phase extractions with 0. 01 M CaCl 2 and 0. 43 M HNO 3, for the 184 samples were analyzed by a variety of methods. Aluminum release is the major source of buffering and is shown to contribute substantially to acid buffering already under natural conditions. The predominant Al bearing phases in Dutch sandy soils are feldspars and secondary Al minerals; feldspars are found to be the determinative phase in acid buffering. Application of the historic approach using the subsoil as a proxy for the initial composition of the topsoil proved feasible for this regional dataset. The average depletion of the ANC(s) of 230 mmolc kg¿ 1 in the topsoil matches well with estimates of the total proton load since the last ice age, with the anthropogenic contribution being between 20 % and 50 %. Fuzzy c-means cluster analyses of the solid phase and soil solution data show a distinct regionality that was also reflected in the parameters generally used to indicate the acidity status of soils, ¿ANC(s) and Al/BC ratios. A combined insight into both solid phase and soil solution, based on a comprehensive set of parameters, proves essential for interpreting soil acidity monitoring data...|$|R
40|$|It is {{required}} that the capital used for construction of road must be technical, economical and used in its location. For this reason, the projects must be prepared for forest roads and all operations belong to roads must be guided according to these projects. In this investigation, available forest road network plan and constructed forest roads were investigated {{at the point of}} view technical and forest transportation. After this, it were studied to reach the highest exploitation rate as can as possible. Available forest road density were found as 11. 9 m/ha in forest areas for Yesiltepe District. In this condition, exploitation rate was 78 %. After that, optimum forest road network were planned and road density were reached to 22 m/ha and exploitation rate to 86 %. Directed sample method were used from taking soil sample methods and samples were took in mixed system. According to results of the experiments, available forest roads were found in a good degree at the point of view endurance, <b>pressing</b> and transportation <b>capacity.</b> With these results, it is aimed to reach higher exploitation rate with given attention to landslide areas during planning of forest roads on the mountain areas such as Black Sea Region. For this reason, required importance must be given to planning of truck and logging roads. Ground analysis must be done and took care before during planning process of forest road network...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} considers progress towards {{establishment of}} a modern legislative framework for individual employment relations in China. A background of current labour market statistics and trends is provided, together with comment on perceived impacts for China of the global financial crisis since 2008. Recent enactments dealing with employment promotion, labour contracts, and labour dispute resolution are then considered. These {{are seen as a}} new phase in regulatory activity for the world of work since the foundation of the People's Republic in 1949. Particular challenges are identified in relation to effective delivery of employment rights, the administrative monitoring of enterprise compliance with labour regulations, and judicial efficiency in dealing with a rising volume of labour disputes throughout China. The influence of international standard-setting bodies upon the new enactments is noted, as are lessons drawn by the Chinese authorities from examination of experiences in other national systems. It is suggested that, without dramatic departure from the framework established by the 'umbrella' Labour Law of 1994, recent Chinese legislation reflects some sophisticated and innovative draughtsmanship, as well as sensitivity to the delicate balance between the economic interests of enterprises and the (generally protective) 'social dimension' of the world of work. Concern is expressed, however, as to whether China's available enforcement and sanctioning mechanisms will suffice to ensure that the new regulatory arrangements become effective in practice. Notably, there is a <b>pressing</b> need for <b>capacity</b> building in order to provide the administrative and judicial institutions necessary to ensure effective labour market regulation within a framework of rule of law. The need for a stable, well-regulated, yet flexible, labour market is seen as crucial to the continued success of the Chinese economy at a time of dramatic global flux. Cautious optimism is expressed as to the prospects of achieving those goals...|$|R
