40|$|Abstract: A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT), in theory, has an unlimited {{number of gear ratios}} between the highest and lowest settings. But most CVTs are complex, expensive, have poor efficiencies, and aren't scalable. A new type of CVT, CONTINUOSLY VARIABLE PLANETARY TRANSMISSION(CVPT),combines toroidaltraction CVT with the versatility of the planetary gear arrangement to create a low-cost, highly efficient drive for human-powered and motorized vehicles. While the CVPT uses rolling traction to distribute torque like toroidal CVTs, it distributes the transmitted torque over several spheres in an inherently stable configuration. The rotating balls between the input and output section of the CVT tilt to vary transmission speed. As the balls tilt, they change their contact diameters to vary the speed ratio. This lowers contact pressures and improves durability, stability, and torque density. And since it uses a <b>planetary</b> <b>arrangement,</b> torque can be summed or divided. In the present work, a CVPT has been mounted to a bicycle for conducting the experiments. Normally tilting of spheres for changing gear ratios is done manually, however in our case, this has been obtained automatically. For automated shifting, a shift actuator, a controller and a battery to power this circuit is used. Also, results have been obtained with speed variations of a bicycle with and without CVPT. Graphs are plotted using the obtained results and analysed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{historical}} {{evolution of the}} traditional correspondences of planets and metals and of knowledge of the <b>planetary</b> <b>arrangements</b> is reviewed. The traditional geocentric sequence of the planets generates not only the sequence of days of the week, whose names are taken from the deities traditionally associated with the planets, but also a ranking by atomic number of the metals traditionally associated with the planets. The probability {{that this could be}} coincidental is quite low, about 1 / 120. Yet this is not a contemporary artifact nor the result of ancient knowledge of unknown provenance. The concept of synchronicity is a possible working hypothesis. Corroboration or refutation of this approach would depend on further research work on other anomalous events, for which the existence of a hidden causal origin is also highly unlikely...|$|R
40|$|Two input {{members and}} two {{concentric}} rotatable output members are interconnected by a <b>planetary</b> gear <b>arrangement.</b> The first input drives directly the first output. The second input engages a carrier having the planetary gears affixed thereto. Rotation {{of the carriage}} causes rotation of the central sun gear of the planetary gear system. The sun gear is journaled to the carriage and is drivingly connected to the second output through a direction reversing set of bevel gears. The first input drive member includes a ring gear drivingly connected to the planetary gears for driving the second output member {{in the same direction}} and by the same amount as the first output member. Motion of the first input results in equal motion of the two outputs while input motion of the second input results in movement of the second output relative to the first output. This device is useful where non-interacting two-axis control of remote gimbaled systems is required...|$|R
40|$|Essa dissertação de mestrado pesquisa a presença, representação e importância da mulher, da heroína, nos quadrinhos. O foco é a Mulher-Maravilha, de sua criação em 1941 a 2002. Analisando e comparando a personagem com dois outros personagens masculinos do mesmo país de origem, época e editora, Super-Homem e Batman, tentando entender os diferentes níveis de poder entre eles e os caminhos pelos quais a heroína passou. As diferenças serão analisadas dentro e fora dos quadrinhos. Além disso, consideramos a evolução da mulher dentro do mesmo recorte {{temporal}} de análise da personagem, relacionando os dois mundos e suas múltiplas influências. A intenção é alimentar e ampliar os estudos historiográficos sobre uma história das mulheres e também de resgatar a presença da mulher na história. A análise tem um especial foco sobre o tratamento aplicado à Mulher-Maravilha pela indústria cultural no Brasil, especialmente na metade dos anos cinqüenta, quando a personagem foi lançada aqui. Igualmente importante é a discussão entre globalização e mundialização, mas, mais do que isso, os sinais, fatores e a estrutura de um novo arranjo planetário na economia, política e cultura. A globalização e o resgate da mulher na história são fatos quase contemporâneos. Este trabalho vai tentar mostrar questões para compreender ambos os fenômenos, com a análise da Mulher-Maravilha que pretendemos fazer aqui. This MA dissertation {{investigates the}} female presence, representation and significance in action comic books as heroes. The {{focus will be}} in Wonder Woman since 1941 to 2002. Analysing and comparing her character with two others big male characters from the same origin country, time and publishing company, Superman and Batman, we try to understand, the different levels of power {{between them and the}} ways that Wonder Woman to went through. These differences will be analysed inside and outside of the comics itself. Besides, this analysis is concerned on female evolution at the same period that Wonder Woman was created to the present. Our propose is to relate both worlds, the comic books and our world, and their mutual influences as well. These aspects are connected with the intention to provide and increase the historiography studies on a female history and also to rescue the female presence in history. The analysis has a special focus about the treatment applied to Wonder Woman by the cultural industry in Brazil. Equally important to this propose is the aspect about the last forty years (or near by) we have the process of global issues. A infinite discussion between global and worldwide matters but more than this, the signs, factors and structure from a new <b>planetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> in economy, politics and cultural aspects. The global process and the rescue of a female history are events almost contemporary. And in this work we will try to show questions to help us to understand both phenomenon because they are perfectly lynked with the analysis we will try to do here. Plus we could link with another significant part of this study which is the levels of the power...|$|E
40|$|Current commercially {{available}} prosthetic feet {{have succeeded in}} decreasing the metabolic cost and increasing the speed of walking compared to walking with conventional, mostly solid prosthetic feet. However, {{there is still a}} large discrepancy when compared with a non-disabled gait, and the walking pattern remains strongly disturbed. During the stance phase of the leg, these prostheses store and return energy using a spring element. This spring returns to its neutral position, which generates a push-off, but the foot extends much less than with a non-disabled gait. The walking pattern may improve with a more extended push-off. In this paper, we present a passive ankle-foot prosthesis that aims to deliver an extended ankle push-off using a specific <b>planetary</b> gearbox <b>arrangement</b> and locking mechanisms in order to release the energy in the spring over the full natural stretching of the ankle. In recent years, both powered and passive prosthetic devices have been developed. The prosthetic foot presented in this paper is a passive system, such that it has the possibility to be made lighter and more robust than, for example, one driven by an electric motor. Preliminary walking experiments were conducted with a transfemoral amputee...|$|R
40|$|Toyota Motor Corporation {{developed}} the Toyota Hybrid System with CVT (THS-C) for the Toyota Estimaminivan. The THS-C {{is based on}} Toyota’s Super CVT (K 110), where the conventional torque converter {{is replaced by a}} torsional damper and a newly developed motor/generator. For smooth switching between the different driving modes it makes use of wet multiple disc clutches and a <b>planetary</b> gearset <b>arrangement.</b> The Toyota Estima is also equipped with a motor/generator which directly drives or brakes the rear wheels for optimal vehicle dynamics and fuel economy. This feature will also be installed in the new hybrid Lexus RX 400 h, which is driven by an up-scaled version of the Prius powertrain. The powertrains in the mentioned vehicles are in fact an E-Four full hybrids with separate electric motors on front and rear axles. The first goal {{of this paper is to}} model the E-four of the Estima in ADVANCE; a coupled vehicle dynamics and powertrain simulation program developed by TNO Automotive. The second goal is to perform simulations with this software and evaluate the results. The results will be used to validate the THS-C as a technology carrier for ongoing and new research on integrated powertrain control and pulley CVTs for hybrids...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{axle shaft}} of fork lift failed at {{operation}} within 296 h of service. The shaft transmits torque from discrepancy to wheel through <b>planetary</b> gear <b>arrangement.</b> A section of fractured axle shaft made of induction-hardened steel was analyzed {{to determine the}} root cause of the failure. Optical microscopies as well as field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) along with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were carried out to characterize the microstructure. Hardness profile throughout the cross-section was evaluated by micro-hardness measurements. Chemical analysis indicated that the shaft was made of 42 CrMo 4 steel grade as per specification. Microstructural analysis and micro-hardness profile revealed that the shaft was improperly heat treated resulting in a brittle case, where crack was found to initiate from the case in a brittle mode in contrast to ductile mode within the core. This behaviour was related to differences in microstructure, which was observed to be martensitic within the case with a micro-hardness equivalent to 735 HV, and a mixture of non-homogeneous structure of pearlite and ferrite within the core with a hardness of 210 HV. The analysis suggests that the fracture initiated from the martensitic case as brittle mode due to improper heat treatment process (high hardness). Moreover the inclusions along the hot working direction i. e. in the longitudinal axis made the component more susceptible to failure...|$|R

These principal figures include a portrait of James V, the Devil, St Michael, and representations of Venus and several <b>planetary</b> deities.

25|$|The {{low rate}} of orbital {{encounters}} governs {{the rate at which}} planetesimals are lost from the disk, and the corresponding rate of migration. After several hundreds of millions of years of slow, gradual migration, Jupiter and Saturn, the two inmost giant planets, cross their mutual 1:2 mean-motion resonance. This resonance increases their orbital eccentricities, destabilizing the entire <b>planetary</b> system. The <b>arrangement</b> of the giant planets alters quickly and dramatically. Jupiter shifts Saturn out towards its present position, and this relocation causes mutual gravitational encounters between Saturn and the two ice giants, which propel Neptune and Uranus onto much more eccentric orbits. These ice giants then plough into the planetesimal disk, scattering tens of thousands of planetesimals from their formerly stable orbits in the outer Solar System. This disruption almost entirely scatters the primordial disk, removing 99% of its mass, a scenario which explains the modern-day absence of a dense trans-Neptunian population. Some of the planetesimals are thrown into the inner Solar System, producing a sudden influx of impacts on the terrestrial planets: the Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) of split-power design consists of a variator and an <b>arrangement</b> of <b>planetary</b> gears. A black box model describing such transmissions is presented. The model {{can be used for}} synthesis as well as loss-free analysis of split-power CVT concepts in general. The <b>planetary</b> gear <b>arrangement</b> may have an arbitrary number of shafts. It is described by a sufficient number of basic speed ratios. By using several modes, both a large overall speed ratio range and low variator power ratios can be obtained. This is necessary for optimal engine use and high transmission efficiency. In each mode, specific components are active in the transmission. The black box model includes two modes, but CVT concepts with an arbitrary number of modes can be described by combining matching two-mode CVTs. General conditions for performing mode shifts are presented. A general relationship between overall speed ratio and variator speed ratio has been derived, as well as a general relationship for variator power ratios of loss-free transmissions. Different variator types are categorized by their ratio coverage. Possible combinations of variator power ratio, overall ratio coverage and variator ratio coverage are mapped and presented graphically for different configurations. Suitable combinations of these quantities can be chosen. Design parameters included will then indicate how the CVT should be designed. On the basis of the black box model, two split-power CVT concepts for automotive use are proposed. Each of the transmissions, having a geared neutral, is an infinitely variable transmission (IVT). They do not need such devices as starting clutches or hydrodynamic torque converters. They are designed for use in front wheel drive cars with transversely mounted engines. The main components of the first IVT are a traction ball drive variator, a simple epicyclic gear train with three shafts and some gear stages. The transmission can be run in three modes, including a separate mode for reverse. The second IVT consists of a hydrostatic variator, two simple epicyclic gear trains with three shafts and a few gear stages. It can be run in two modes. Reverse drive is included in one of the modes. Losses in gear meshes and variators are estimated. Hereby, constant component efficiencies are used, as well as efficiencies calculated taking load and speed dependence of the losses into consideration...|$|R
