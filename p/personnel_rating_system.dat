40|$|Vitalization of {{internal}} organization {{of a firm}} varies {{in terms of its}} concept and method depending on the adaptation of the firm's main products to the industrial environment. In the case where a firm is enjoying a steady growth with its main products adapted well to changes in the industrial structure, the firm may be vitalized by enhancing the employees' challenging spirit. There are many ways to do this: flat organization; `philosophy of praise' by the top management; improvement of <b>personnel</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system,</b> etc. There are other cases where the growth is stagnant even though the main products are well adapted to changes in the environment, probably {{because of the lack of}} proper management activity. In such a case the president needs to take the lead in revolutionizing the awareness of the employees through infiltration of the sense of crisis, declaration of a lofty business goal, and president's visits at worksites. If a firm's growth is retarded due to the failure of its main products in adapting to changes in the industrial structure, restructuring of the firm is necessary. For that purpose, employees' knowledge must be deepened through various programs : specialist development program; mid-career recruitment; capability development; and appointment of talented people to new business sections...|$|E

Hence, succession of high-level manual skill is one of the problems to be solved for Japanese manufacturing industry. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the state of skill succession problems in a medium-sized machine shop and how it has coped with the problem. Some of the findings are as follows; 1. Seriousness of the problem differs among sections and trades according to the differential assignment of new employees. 2. Attempts to grasp the skills and their contents have been started by means of a questionnaires 'memorandum on skill succession' and round-table discussions on skill succession. These provide skill-holders with incentive to transfer their own skill to younger employees through recognition of importance of skill and its transfer. 3. Some measures to succeed the skill are gradually put into practice. Systematic assignment and OJT, very orthodox measure, are involved. 4. <b>Personnel</b> and <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> will be reformed in order to provide an incentive to get the skill to be succeeded...|$|R

Both countries maintained these dual exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems</b> through the early 1970s. The Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union has been using this system since the early 1990s. Around the same time, many Latin American countries also shifted from a single exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system</b> to a dual exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system</b> or a multiple exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system.</b> With the structural adjustment to international trade that has occurred since the mid-1980s, especially the deepening of trade reform, Latin American countries have begun gradually abandoning multiple exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems,</b> favoring instead the implementation of single exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

40|$|Since {{the effect}} of global warming and climate changes are {{becoming}} serious issues nowadays, most countries are trying {{to develop their own}} green highway <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> in order to implement the sustainable practices on their highway. Several studies have discussed the issues relating to the sustainable <b>rating</b> <b>system,</b> but no major study has been conducted to examine the green highway <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> in depth. Material and pavement technology are two most important parameters in the green highway <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> and need to be addressed more critically. This study presents an extensive review to identify and establish the material and pavement technology elements that are most appropriate to be considered in developing the green highway <b>rating</b> <b>systems.</b> The relevant literatures have been reviewed to assist in identifying the elements of material and pavement technology. These elements in existing green highway <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> are tabulated and ranked to show the importance level of each element. Understanding the comparison between these elements in existing green highway <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> would help in identifying and overcoming the scarcity of the elements. Subsequently, the complete highway <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> can be developed as a performance measure or baseline reference that suit different environment and weather.

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years there has been a {{proliferation}} of regional building <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> across the Middle East (ME). Most those emerging <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> and labels emulate the British and American <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> BREEAM and LEED that emerged in industrial countries context with an impact reduction paradigm. Thus they are neglecting the local historic, climatic, economic, technological, cultural and social context of the ME. This paper presents a case study of a recently constructed eco-lodge, AlBabenshal, in Siwa, Egypt, that performs beyond the existing <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> requirements. The paper illustrates the environmental and sustainability design strategies adapted to AlBabenshal Lodge buildings’ context. In this study, the usability of existing <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> in the ME is surveyed and their response to climate, occupants and society is evaluated.
