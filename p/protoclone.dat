40|$|To produce {{economically}} important indole alkaloids by cell culture, we {{have selected}} protoclones of Catharanthus roseus for high yields of catharanthine and ajmalicine. Protoplasts were enzymatically isolated from suspension-cultured cells. <b>Protoclone</b> VPC- 10 produced catharanthine at 5. 9 μg/g fresh wt of cells after 10 days of culture, although the original cell line {{did not produce}} it at a level detectable by HPLC. Under the same conditions, <b>protoclone</b> VPC- 15 produced ajmalicine at 133. 6 μg/g, which was about 3 times the productivity of the original cell line. In addition, the indole alkaloids were qualitatively confirmed by LC-MS. ope...|$|E
40|$|Among ten slow-growing protoclones of Agaricus bisporus (J. Lge) Imbach, all appressed colonies showed slower {{growth rate}} and spawn run, and {{inability}} to produce fruiting bodies in substrate. Seven of 40 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers amplified 78 reproducible fragments, 48. 93 % were polymorphic, each producing 7 to 16 bands ranging from 0. 10 to 2. 10 kbp, sufficient to differentiate the protoclones from each other. Appressed protoclones were homoallelic {{at a number of}} loci that were heteroallelic in the parent, suggesting that they represented rare homokaryons. Thus, using morphological characters along with ISSR, polymorphisms could be useful for quick, easy, and accurate in distinguishing homo- and heterokaryotic isolates. Agaricus bisporus (J. Lge) Imbach is a nutritious edible fungus cultivated industrially world-wide, which has a unique taste and medical properties (Robert et al. 2003). The recovery of self-sterile single-spore isolates is laborious and verification through fruiting trials is time consuming (Horgen and Anderson 1992). However, in this study, the techniques for obtaining protoplasts (<b>protoclone),</b> described by Sonnenberg et al. (1988) have been employed. In the last two decades, various molecular markers based on nucleic acid polymorphisms have been used in genetic studie...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{different}} primers {{were used}} to amplify DNA from selfed progenies of 117 diploid plants regenerated from haploid cell suspension protoplasts of rice (cv. Miara). This survey, which permitted to generate 69 different major fragments in control Miara plants {{as well as in}} <b>protoclone</b> DNA, did not reveal genetic change among protoclones compared to the donor variety except independent amplification of an additional fragment in nearly half of the lines by two 10 -mers. This polymorphism in the protoclonal population was attributed to natural intravarietal variation among the donor plants which have been collected to establish the microscope-callus suspension culture. However, polymorphism could not be detected in calluses grown from cell clumps collected in the 21 -month old cell suspension. This apparent lack of tissue culture-induced polymorphism at the molecular level contrasts with the results of a previous field evaluation of the progenies which exhibited both wide range and high frequency morphological changes. These observations highlight the absence of apparent relationship between morphological variation and molecular changes. The interest of RAPDs as a convenient method to test genetic integrity of the regenerants, that would preclude the need for further field evaluation, is discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Mycelium of Pleurotus ostreatus var. {{florida with}} a {{decreased}} growth rate contained seven double-stranded RNA segments and isometrical virus particles with diameters of 24 and 30 nm. Mycelium {{with a normal}} growth rate lacked dsRNA. <b>Protoclones</b> from virus-containing mycelium contained one to seven of these dsRNA segments in varying concentrations. The exact correlation between slow growth {{and the presence of}} dsRNA molecules could not be established. Infection of virus-free protoplasts with PEG-precipitated virus particles resulted in mycelium that stably maintained the 2. 4 kbp dsRNA...|$|R
40|$|The report, {{presented}} by 18 - 20. 09. 2012 in Gaylvaylerhofe / Germany at the European meeting of Ampelography ECPGR in international {{cooperation of the}} COST project, provides {{the information about the}} collection, the study and the storage of wild grape vines, as well as indigenous and selected varieties in the National ampelographic collections of Russia, nowadays containing 3, 220 specimens of 42 countries, 191 of which were oppressed with phylloxera. The modern zoned assortment of grapes in Russia (according to the State register of breeding achievements of the Russian Federation) with the most common areas of local and introduced varieties is examined. The summary {{of the impact of the}} clonal selection of the classic industrial engineering classes, conducted by the author’s original technique, as well as the achievements of combinative breeding of the actively breed resistant varieties is given. Moreover, their reproduction at the level of selected <b>protoclones</b> or elite breeding forms (candidate variety) was conducted with in vitro metho...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a Brassica campestris callus culture had undergone extensive rearrangements (i. e. large inversions and a duplication) relative to DNA of the control plant [54]. In this study we observed that after continued growth, the mtDNA of this culture continues to change, with rearranged forms amplifying and diminishing to varying proportions. Strikingly similar changes were detected in the mtDNA profiles {{of a variety of}} other long- and short-term callus and cell suspension lines. However, the proportions of parental (‘unrearranged’) and novel (‘rearranged’) forms varied in different cultured cell mtDNAs. To address the source of this heterogeneity, we compared the mtDNA organization of 28 individual plants from the parental seed stock. With the exception of one plant containing high levels of a novel plasmid-like mtDNA molecule, no significant variation was detected among individual plants and therefore source plant variation is unlikely to have contributed to the diversity of mitochondrial genomes observed in cultured cells. The source of this culture-induced heterogeneity was also investigated in 16 clones derived from single protoplasts. A mixed population of unrearranged and rearranged mtDNA molecules was apprent in each <b>protoclone,</b> suggesting that the observed heterogeneity in various cultures might reflect the genomic composition of each individual cell; however, the induction of an intercellular heterogeneity subsequent to the protoplast isolation was not tested and therefore cannot be ruled out. The results of this study support our earlier model that the rapid structural alteration of B. campestris mtDNA in vitro results from preferential amplification and reassortment of minor pre-existing forms of the genome rather than de novo rearrangement. Infrequent recombination between short dispersed repeated elements is proposed as the underlying mechanism for the formation of these minor mtDNA molecules...|$|E
