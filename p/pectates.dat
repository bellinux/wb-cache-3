This study compares the adaptation to DCB of two cell lines from dicots (tomato [Lycopersicon esculentum] and tobacco [Nicotiana tabacum]) and a Graminaceous monocot (barley [Hordeum bulbosum] endosperm). The difference in wall structures between the dicots and the monocot {{is reflected in the}} very different types of wall modifications induced by growth on DCB. The dicots, having reduced levels of cellulose and xyloglucan, possess walls the major integrity of which is provided by Ca 2 +-bridged <b>pectates</b> because protoplasts can be prepared from these cells simply by treatment with divalent cation chelator and a purified endopolygalacturonase. The tensile strength of these walls is considerably less than walls from nonadapted cells, but wall porosity is not altered.

Surprisingly, they have tensile strengths higher than their nonadapted counterpart, although cellulose levels are reduced by 70 %. Evidence is presented that these walls obtain their additional strength by an altered pattern of cross-linking of polymers involving phenolic components. Such cross-linking may also explain the observation that the porosity of these walls is also considerably reduced. Cells of adapted lines of both the dicots and barley are resistant to plasmolysis, suggesting that they possess very strong connections between the wall and the plasma membrane...|$|E

40|$|The bulk protein {{of green}} leaves {{has been shown}} to be {{dissociable}} and probably distinct from the acid phosphatase previously associated with it. This conclusion is based on the differential sedimentation rates in the analytical ultracentrifuge of the bulk protein and of phosphatase, on the relative amount of enzyme present in the bulk protein prepared by salt-precipitation or by differential centrifugation, and on the comparative stability of the two proteins toward heat and acid. Leaf phosphatase is further shown to be a mixture of isodynamic enzymes with different pH optima and Michaelis constants. A separation was accomplished by adsorption, dialysis, and by antigen-antibody reactions. The phosphatases are shown to lose enzymatic activity during dialysis, but to be capable of reactivation by certain metal ions. Copper ions are the most effective activators. Comparison of the spectrographic analysis of the ash of dialyzed phosphatase with enzymatic activity, however, disclosed a direct relation between activity and the amount of iron and manganese, as well as copper. Various comparative aspects of the enzymes were also studied. The influence of auxin on metabolic pathways is studied by a new method, in which the rate of incorporation of isotopically labeled intermediates into varied components of living tissue is studied as a function of the auxin supplied. It is found that auxin is without effect on the total protein amino nitrogen, or on the rate of incorporation of the C[superscript 14] label from glycine or leucine into tissue proteins of Avena and corn coleoptiles. Hence, auxin has no effect on protein metabolism during cell elongation. Similarly, auxin exerted only small effects on the rate of incorporation of C[superscript 14] from acetate into the lipid constituents of Avena coleoptiles. Added auxin induced no important changes in the incorporation of the C[superscript 14] of acetate or sucrose into the cell wall components of Avena. It was shown, however, that absence of auxin favors incorporation of the isotopic label of acetate or sucrose into the <b>pectates</b> and soluble polyuronide hemicelluloses, while the presence of auxin favors incorporation into the non-cellulosic polysaccharides. These effects are of small magnitude in relation to gross increase in cell length...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of ammonia and associated tissue alkalinization predispose avocado fruit to attack by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Secretion of ammonia by C. gloeosporioides {{in the presence}} of KNO 3 was induced by decreasing the pH from 7. 0 to 4. 0. When the fungus was grown at pH 4. 0 or 6. 0 {{in the absence of a}} nitrogen source, ammonia did not accumulate, and neither pelB (encoding <b>pectate</b> lyase) transcription nor <b>pectate</b> lyase secretion was detected. Under these nitrogen starvation conditions, only transcriptional activation of areA, which encodes the global nitrogen regulator, was detected. pelB transcription and <b>pectate</b> lyase secretion were both detected when C. gloeosporioides was grown at pH 6. 0 {{in the presence of}} ammonia accumulated from different nitrogen sources. The early {{accumulation of}} ammonia induced early pelB expression and <b>pectate</b> lyase secretion. As the external pH increased from 4. 0 to 6. 0, transcripts of pac 1, the C. gloeosporioides pacC homolog, also could be detected. Nit mutants of C. gloeosporioides, which cannot utilize KNO 3 as a nitrogen source, did not secrete ammonia, alkalinize the medium, or secrete <b>pectate</b> lyase. If Nit mutants were grown at pH 6. 0 in the presence of glutamate, then <b>pectate</b> lyase secretion was induced. Infiltration of 0. 1 M ammonium hydroxide at pH 10 into ripening avocado fruits enhanced the activation of quiescent infection and symptom development by C. gloeosporioides. These results suggest that ambient pH alkalinization resulting from ammonia accumulation and the availability of ammonia as a nitrogen source independently regulate pelB expression, <b>pectate</b> lyase secretion, and virulence of C. gloeosporioides. These data suggest that alkalinization during C. gloeosporioides infection is important for its transformation from the quiescent biotrophic stage to the necrotrophic stage of fungal colonization in the fruit host...|$|R
