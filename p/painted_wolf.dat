25|$|In Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, wolf {{flesh was}} a main {{ingredient}} in unguents used {{to ward off}} evil. When applied {{in the form of}} a powder, the wolf unguent would be used to cure epilepsy, plague and gout. Powdered wolf bones were used to cure chest and back pains, broken bones and strained tendons. Wolf teeth, particularly the canines, would be perforated and used as talismans against evil spirits. This practice is thought to fall back to the Paleolithic, as shown by some prehistoric grave sites showing numerous wolf tooth charms. It continues in some areas of rural France, where it is also thought that wearing a wolf tooth offers protection from wolf attacks. The tongue, when cooked with flour and honey, was traditionally used as a remedy for epilepsy and as a guarantee of good luck. The eyes of a wolf were traditionally thought to give courage to children and render the user partially invisible. The liver was particularly prized for medicinal and ritualistic purposes. When cooked or desiccated into a powder and mixed with certain ingredients (flour, wine, water, blood, urine etc.), wolf liver was said to cure epilepsy, edema, tachycardia, syphilis, gangrene, vertigo, migraines, verucas and dysentery. Wolf penis supposedly cured impotence. Wolf blood was used for gout, period pains and deafness. The paws and fat of a wolf were sometimes used to ward off evil, or facilitate the transformation of a werewolf. Wolf dung was used against colics. The milk of a she-wolf made the drinker invulnerable, while eating the heart of a wolf gave the consumer courage in battle. A wolf's tail, while used for warding off evil, was also used as a love charm. The head of a wolf, if hung outside a house, would deter wolves, robbers and evil spirits. When reduced to powder, a wolf's head could be used against toothache and joint pains. In the cultures of certain Native American tribes, wolf body parts were considered important additions to certain rituals. Pawnee warriors, known as Wolf People, dressed in wolf skin cloaks when scouting or hunting. Nez Perce warriors wore wolf teeth pushed through the septums of their noses. Cheyenne medicine men wrapped wolf fur on sacred arrows used to motion prey into traps. Arikara men wove wolf fur with bison fur in order to make small sacred blankets. Nuxálk mothers <b>painted</b> <b>wolf</b> gall bladders on their young male children's backs, so they could grow up to perform religious ceremonies without making mistakes as hunters. Hidatsan women experiencing difficult births would call upon the familial power of wolves by rubbing wolf-skin caps on their bellies. In Mongolian folk medicine, eating the intestines of a wolf is said to alleviate chronic indigestion, while sprinkling food with powdered wolf rectum is said to cure haemorroids. There are not many traditional uses for Ethiopian wolves, though their livers may be used for medicinal reasons in northern Ethiopia.|$|E

50|$|The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), {{also known}} as African hunting dog, African painted dog, painted hunting dog or <b>painted</b> <b>wolf,</b> is a canid native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is the largest of its family in Africa, and the only extant member of the genus Lycaon, which is {{distinguished}} from Canis by its fewer toes and its dentition, which is highly specialised for a hypercarnivorous diet. It is classified as endangered by the IUCN, as it has disappeared from much of its original range. The current population has been estimated at roughly 39 subpopulations containing 6,600 adults, only 1,400 of which are fully grown. The decline of these populations is ongoing, due to habitat fragmentation, human persecution, and disease outbreaks.|$|E

As he had stood in the office door ten minutes before, his ears had been filled with the clink-clank of the blacksmiths' hammers, the shouts of drivers, and the low laughter of young women {{on their way to}} the store. Crane's Voice was hitching up his team, while Lost Legs and Turkey Tail were climbing to the roof of the warehouse with pots of red <b>paint.</b> Peter <b>Wolf</b> was mending a mowing-machine, and his brother Robert was cutting wood behind the agency kitchen. All about he had observed groups of white-blanketed Indians smoking cigarettes in the shade of the buildings, while a crowd of nearly twenty others stood watching a game of duck-on-the-rock before the agency store.|$|R
5000|$|Alongside, and in {{addition}} to her <b>painting</b> career, <b>Wolf</b> has designed jewelry and fashion accessories. She launched a line of scarves in 1978 which she described as [...] "half scarf, half jewelry," [...] designed with practical pockets (sometimes shaped like hands) or whimsical appliqués of koalas and hearts. Her designs were sold through department stores such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. In 1994, whilst bringing up her family, Wolf designed a range of jewelry featuring interchangeable charms that was sold exclusively through Neiman Marcus. In 2006 Wolf launched a line of handbags sold through Bergdorf Goodman, Saks, and Bloomingdales. Following her daughter's death in 2009, the handbag line went on hiatus for two years. Since relaunching her handbag line in 2011, Wolf has dedicated a bag each season to her daughter's memory, donating all profits from its sale to Bereaved Parents of the USA.|$|R

60|$|Sunset {{brought him}} to a standstill, as much from its sudden glorious {{gathering}} of brilliant crimsons splashed with gold, as from its warning that the day was done. Hare made his camp beside a stone which {{would serve as a}} wind-break. He laid his saddle for a pillow and his blanket for a bed. He gave Silvermane a nose-bag full of water and then one of grain; he fed the dog, and afterward attended to his own needs. When his task was done the desert brightness had faded to gray; the warm air had blown away on a cool breeze, and night approached. He scooped out a little hollow in the sand for his hips, took a last look at Silvermane haltered to the rock, and calling Wolf to his side stretched himself to rest. He was used to lying on the ground, under the open sky, out where the wind blew and the sand seeped in, yet all these were different on this night. He was in the <b>Painted</b> Desert; <b>Wolf</b> crept close to him; Mescal lay somewhere under the blue-white stars.|$|R
60|$|Then England, {{that all}} these long hours had stood still, {{suddenly}} hurled herself upon the foe. Hugh, leaping over a heap of dead and dying, saw {{in front of him}} a knight who wore a helmet shaped like a wolf's head and had a <b>wolf</b> <b>painted</b> upon his shield. The wolf knight charged at him as though he sought him alone. An arrow from behind--it was Grey Dick's--sank up to the feathers in the horse's neck, and down it came. The rider shook himself clear and began to fight. Hugh was beaten to his knee beneath a heavy blow that his helm turned. He rose unhurt and rushed at the knight, who, in avoiding his onset, caught his spur on the body of a dead man and fell backward.|$|R
5000|$|Arrangements {{were made}} by Inkie for the {{repainting}} of the street in August 2012, {{as part of the}} 2012 Cultural Olympiad accompanying the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, [...] with support from Bristol City Council, the Arts Council and London 2012 Festival as part of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad and Bristol University. See No Evil 2012 began on 13 August when 45 selected (both local and international) artists, wielding 3,500 cans of spray paint and 700 litres of paint. Once again the event took place on Nelson Street, a one-way bus and taxi lane known for its depressingly grey concrete walls (including a 12 story office block and a police station) over the course of 7 days- with the permission of the owners. [...] Three works from the 2011 event's 72 pieces were saved by the public vote, via an internet poll allowing people to voice their opinions on preferred works, those being the suited man pouring a tin of red <b>paint,</b> the <b>wolf</b> boy, and the woman and child; painted by Nick Walker, Aryz and El Mac respectively. See No Evil at Nelson Street will remain Europe's largest open air street art gallery, bringing an inner city street to life with huge murals until next summer. Some of the artists (including ManOne and Vyal One, FLX One and Dones and Limited Press) in the same week also created work on hoardings around Bristol Temple Meads Enterprise Zone.|$|R
5000|$|Wolf [...] "muttations" [...] or [...] "mutts" [...] {{appeared}} {{at the end of}} the 74th Hunger Games to draw Katniss, Peeta, and Cato into a final fight. The wolf-like creatures mimicked the deceased tributes, particularly in fur and eye color, but also with collars which match the tributes' district numbers. One wolf Katniss identifies as Rue, and others as Glimmer, Foxface, the boy from District 9, and Thresh. They were created by the Gamemakers to draw the three remaining tributes together for the finale. Peeta later creates a <b>painting</b> of the <b>wolf</b> mutt supposed to be Glimmer. It took him three days to find the right shade for sunlight on white fur. He [...] "kept thinking it was just yellow, but it was so much more than that." [...] When he is shot in the hand with an arrow, Cato falls off the Cornucopia; Cato's fight for survival against the mutts goes on for several hours before Katniss shoots him in the skull with an arrow out of pity. He would not have survived for so long without his suit of body armor and a hidden sword or knife. In the film adaptation, the mutts resemble Rottweiler dogs.|$|R

The following year, the museum received a $375,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in support of its new exhibition, [...] "The Bison: American Icon, Heart of Plains Indian Culture." [...] The {{total cost of the}} exhibit was $1.5 million. NEA's Tom Phelps called the show [...] "a nationally significant exhibition". The following year, the NEA gave the museum another $50,000 stimulus funds to cover a severe shortfall in visitorship. In March 2011, the John [...] "Jack" [...] McDowell Hoover donated three works by Russell and one by Seltzer to the museum. The three Russell works were: [...] "The Lone Wolf" [...] (1900), a large oil <b>painting</b> depicting solitary <b>wolf</b> on the plains; [...] "The Last Laugh" [...] (1916), a bronze of a wolf standing on a human's skull; and [...] "When the Longest Blade Was Right" [...] (1922), a watercolor of knight on horseback threatening a court jester with a sword. The C.M. Russell Museum was re-accredited in 2011 by the American Alliance of Museums for another 10 years.|$|R
5000|$|The band started {{recording}} in Berlin after a hiatus during touring as Gira {{wanted to}} get it done while they were a live band. After a year of touring, they recorded in New York while Gira spent the next five months doing overdubs and fleshing out songs written on his acoustic guitar. While Gira sings on the majority of the songs, he enlisted Karen O to assist with singing [...] "Song for a Warrior" [...] because Gira believed that [...] "Since the song is like a country lullaby, I thought it would be appropriate for a female. Chris Swans' bass player pointed me to a few of Karen's solo works where she sings in this really gentle, compassionate, soulful way." [...] Former Swans member Jarboe also made an appearance on the album once Gira met her after an Atlanta tour as he needed [...] "some female vocals doing these kind of drone chords." [...] The name of the album and title track came from Swans performing the title track multiple times instrumentally until Gira soon sang, [...] "I see it all, I see it all," [...] which he thought fit the music. The artwork from the album was based on a tempera <b>wolf</b> <b>painting</b> by Simon Henwood and featured Gira's teeth on the wolf.|$|R
25|$|The Pontic vases {{are also}} closely related stylistically to Ionian pottery painting. Also {{in this case}} it is assumed that they were {{produced}} in Etruscan workshops by craftsmen who emigrated from Ionia. The vases got their misleading name from the depiction on a vase of archers thought to be Scythians, who lived at the Black Sea (Pontus). Most of the vases were found in graves in Vulci, a significant number also in Cerveteri. The index form was a neck amphora with a particularly slender shape, closely resembling Tyrrhenian amphoras. Other shapes were oenochoes with spiral handles, dinos, kyathos, plates, beakers with high bases, and, less often, kantharos and other forms. The adornment of Pontic vases is always similar. In general there is an ornamental decoration on the neck, then figures on the shoulder, followed by another band of ornaments, an animal frieze, and finally a ring of rays. Foot, neck and handles are black. The importance of ornaments is noticeable, although they are often rather carelessly formed; some vases are decorated only with ornaments. The clay of these vases is yellowish-red; the slip covering the vases is black or brownish-red, of high quality, and with a metallic sheen. Red and white opaque colors are generously used for figures and ornaments. Animals are usually decorated with a white stripe on their bellies. Scholars have identified six workshops to date. The earliest and best is considered to be that of the Paris Painter. He shows mythological figures, included a beardless Heracles, as was customary in eastern Greece. Occasionally there are scenes which are not a part of Greek mythology, such as Heracles fighting Juno Sospita ("the Savior") by the Paris <b>Painter,</b> or a <b>wolf</b> demon by the Tityos Painter. There are also scenes of daily life, komos scenes, and riders. The vases are dated to a time between 550 and 500 BC, and about 200 are known.|$|R
