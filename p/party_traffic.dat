5000|$|A growing add-on {{category}} {{for the series}} is AI (Artificial Intelligence) Traffic. AI Traffic is the simulation of other vehicles in the FS landscape. This traffic {{plays an important role}} in the simulator, as it is possible to crash into traffic (this can be disabled), thus ending your session, and to interact with the traffic via the radio and ATC. This feature is active even with 3rd <b>party</b> <b>traffic.</b> Microsoft introduced AI traffic in MSFS 2002 with several airliners and private aircraft. This has since been supplemented with many files created by third party developers. Typically, third party aircraft models have multiple levels of detail, which allow the AI traffic to be better on frame rates, while still being detailed during close looks. There are several prominent freeware developers. Some third party AI traffic can even be configured for [...] "real time" [...] departures.|$|E

The effects of 4 competing noises on sentence intelligibility were evaluated: speech noise, cocktail <b>party</b> noise, <b>traffic</b> noise and continuous discourse. A comparison was made between {{young and old}} normally hearing subjects and young and old hearing-impaired subjects with similar audiograms. The old people with normal hearing had slightly reduced discrimination compared to the young during competing speech noise and cocktail noise. Discrimination in the hearing-impaired elderly was also significantly worse than in the young people with normals hearing, during competing cocktail <b>party</b> noise, <b>traffic</b> noise and continuous discourse. The young hearing-impaired had results between young normal-hearing subjects and old hearing-impaired, except for continuous discourse. Thus the effects of age on speech discrimination in noise are subtle, becoming more pronounced {{in the presence of}} hearing loss. Age-related changes in primary speech discrimination were particularly evident during competing continuous discourse...|$|R

40|$|The Traffic Control System of {{a country}} is a main area that has the {{potential}} to affect the development {{of a country}} in a very extensive scale. The existing traffic control systems in Sri Lanka, UniRoadl and UniRoad 2 are highly dependent on the statistical traffic information gathered from time to time using manual methods(using people etc.) which are more difficult to rely on. The main drawback of all these systems is that they cannot adapt signal timing dynamically according to the situation. A system with the capability of altering signal timing as per real time situations will be more effective and productive. For that it needs a proper traffic parameter estimation system which should offer features like reliability and efficiency to a far beyond the manual methods. This will save time wasted at highway while reducing fuel consumption, noise and air pollution in urban areas. Various <b>parties</b> like <b>Traffic</b> Police, the Road Development Authority and ultimately the whole community will be benefited from such a system. The basis of such a system would be a method for reliably approximating the traffic flow in real time, at a low cost. This research paper discusses how to approximate the traffic flow from video streams and why some of the methods attempted are not suitable for such a system...|$|R

40|$|Mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6) {{allows a}} Mobile Node to talk {{directly}} to its peers while retaining {{the ability to}} move around and change the currently used IP address.

In Route Optimization, the peer node learns a binding between the Mobile Node’s permanent Home Address and its current temporary Care-ofAddress. Once such a binding is in place, the peer node will send all packets whose destination is the Home Address to the Care-ofAddress. This is potentially dangerous, since a malicious host might be able to establish false bindings, thereby preventing some packets from reaching their intended destination, diverting some traffic to the attacker, or flooding third <b>parties</b> with unwanted <b>traffic.</b> In this paper we discuss the design rationale behind the MIPv 6 Route Optimization Security Desig...|$|R

40|$|This study explores highway travellers’ {{willingness}} to pay (WTP) for external costs caused by traffic accidents. There {{are a number of}} further external costs, the paper focuses on two externalities: air pollution and time delays. Data collection was performed using the face-to-face survey method, and the surveys were carried out at highway rest areas. Air pollution and time delays were divided into three levels of severity (light, moderate and severe) to obtain the interviewees’ WTP according to each level of severity. The result of this study demonstrates that there are many samples with zero WTP because penalties for pollution caused by traffic accidents are not currently enforced in Taiwan. Thus, the spike model was adopted in this study to overcome any estimation error that might be caused by excessive NT$ 0 WTP samples. The results show that variables such as age, education, income and {{willingness to}} participate in activities of environmental protection {{have a positive effect on}} WTP for air pollution, whereas variables such as occupation, travel purpose, traveller identity, travel time and travel distance have a significantly positive effect on WTP for time delays. WTP for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) is NT$ 8862 – 11, 502 /metric ton (US$ 1 = NT$ 30) and WTP for carbon dioxide (CO 2) is NT$ 1070 – 2693 /metric ton. Moreover, WTP for time delays is NT$ 960 – 1320 /h. The findings of this study not only demonstrate WTP for air pollution and time delays in the minds of <b>parties</b> to <b>traffic</b> accidents but also help to provide agencies with a basis to formulate applicable penalties in the future...|$|R
