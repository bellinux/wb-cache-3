2500|$|In 1737, the Colony {{exchanged}} {{a great deal}} of its political goodwill with the native Lenape for more land.

[...] This purchase has become known as the Walking Purchase. Although the document was most likely a forgery, the Lenape did not realize that. Provincial Secretary James Logan set in motion a plan that would grab as much land as they could <b>possibly</b> <b>get</b> and hired the three fastest runners in the colony to run out the purchase on a trail which had been cleared by other members of the colony beforehand.

2500|$|Dom Sinacola of Slant Magazine said, [...] "More than that, it furthers {{the general}} {{message of the}} whole album, which is that for all his posturing and charm, Glover may not have it in him to {{participate}} in the kind of bacchanalia required of his position as a young, burgeoning, multi-talented rap star. Halfway between throwaway wordplay and trenchant comment about fame, the lyric says a lot about where Glover's head is at: As a former sketch comedian, writer on 30 Rock, and star of the sitcom Community, he leans on his wit as his most formidable weapon." [...] Philip Cosores of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "Yes, the dedication that Glover has seemingly displayed in the project is admirable. But he just doesn't seem to get music on this album. Maybe it's because of his taste, or because he is trying too hard to stand out, or because of his hubris, or because he has lost touch with reality, or maybe it is because of the internet." [...] Phillip Mlynar of Spin said, [...] "The only reaction that Because the Internet elicits is the uncontrollable urge to skip to the next song, in hopes that things couldn't <b>possibly</b> <b>get</b> any sloppier. But they do, beginning with the cod-wailing that blights [...] "Crawl" [...] and volleying with the psychedelic muzak of [...] "The Worst Guys" [...] (co-starring Chance the Rapper) and [...] "Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)," [...] which sounds like Glover has inadvertently locked himself in his practice space and is attempting to muster up a loud enough mess so that some kindly passerby will hear his cries for help. As the album collapses into itself with the closing cut, [...] "Life: The Biggest Troll (Andrew Auernheimer)," [...] we're resigned to existence as a gloopy mess of random thoughts. [...] "Where's the line between Donny G and Gambino?" [...] the rapper muses, but it's unclear whether this is meant as a genuine identity crisis or an all-knowing middle finger to critics. Maybe the entire album is a meme itself, a grand existential joke critiquing the all-conquering rise of Internet culture by parodying its overwhelming randomness. Whatever it is, though, it's a bad rap record." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't <b>possibly</b> <b>get</b> away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing.

30|$|During enzyme washing, {{cellulose}} is degraded and {{sulphur dye}} is released. The cellulase enzymes are temporarily {{bound to the}} cellulose {{by means of an}} anchor. The surface fibre <b>possibly</b> <b>gets</b> split in terms of 1, 4 -β glycoside composition (Kumar et al. 1997). After this process it is made available for further hydrolysis reaction. The cellulose is degraded hydrolytically by cellulases partially until it becomes glucose. The glucose to some extent is likely to reduce the sulphur dye, both on the fibre and in the treatment liquor (Akram 2010). This reduced form has limited affinity to cellulose fibre and thus soils the weft thread and the pocket lining. The acid cellulase enzymes have a strong effect on cellulose hydrolysis and create more glucose formation, resulting in increased back staining of the denim garment. Neutral cellulase as compared to acid cellulase, are less aggressive and hence there is less back staining.|$|R
