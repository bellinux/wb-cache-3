Moreover, recurrent vector equations are investigated for the synthesis of linkages, and used for the design of new mechanisms with linear-angular conditions in the subspace with general constraint one. These conditions are generalized for defining the structural groups of subspace [...] 5 and these structural groups are used both for the creation of new parallel manipulators and new serial-parallel platform manipulators. After investigating hand <b>woven</b> <b>carpets,</b> the knowledge gained during the structural design of mechanisms is applied to the robotization of hand <b>woven</b> <b>carpet</b> technology process.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is presented for the compressive behaviour of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composites under on-axis uniaxial loading. Analysis {{is based on}} curved beams on elastic foundation approach. The contributions of all the three structural elements within the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composite, namely longitudinal strand, transverse strand and pure matrix region have been considered. During compressive loading, the load sharing between structural elements is worked out and the stress state throughout the composite is determined. Effect of failed structural elements is taken into account for further calculations. Compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and failure strain data has been generated for different fabric geometries for both <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric E-glass/epoxy and T 300 carbon/epoxy composites. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on typical <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric E-glass/epoxy composites for validation.

Yarn continuity along both warp and fill directions {{and the actual}} yarn cross-sectional geometry and fabric geometry are considered in the analysis. Off-axis elastic properties are determined by coordinate transformation. Comparison is made between the off-axis elastic properties of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric laminates and cross-ply laminates.

The flame retardation properties, mechanical properties and wear behaviors of PANOF <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabrics were tested. The {{limiting oxygen index}} (LOI) of these PANOF <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric samples was 31 %, which meets the criterion of flame-retardant fabrics. These fabrics neither melt nor shrunk when left in flame {{for a short period}} of time and the fabric structures were well maintained. Compared with flammable polyacrylonitrile fabrics, the polyacrylonitrile pre-oxidation fabrics exhibited excellent flame retardation properties, with satisfactory mechanical properties and comfortable handle...|$|R

The materials investigated are 2 D <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> E-glass/epoxy, 2 D <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> T 300 carbon/epoxy and 2 D <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> E-glass fabric.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of weave structures and silica coatings obtained via sol-gel process on the thermal insulation properties of cotton samples. For this reason three main <b>weave</b> structures (<b>plain,</b> satin, and piqué) of cotton fabric were selected with different yarn count, threads per cm, and mass per square meter values. Thereafter, only for the <b>plain</b> <b>weave,</b> the samples were padded using silica sol formed by hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane under acidic conditions. The silanized <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> samples were characterized by TGA and FT-IR techniques. The thermal properties were measured with a home-made apparatus in order to calculate thermal conductivity, resistance, and absorption of all the treated fabric samples. The relationship between the thermal insulation properties of the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabrics and the concentration of sol solutions has been investigated. Fabrics weave and density were found to strongly influence the thermal properties: piqué always shows the lowest values and satin shows the highest values while <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> lies in between. The thermal properties of treated high-density cotton <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric were proved to be strongly influenced by finishing agent concentration...|$|R
