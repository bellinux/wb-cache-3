25|$|When he was <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Law</b> <b>and</b> Police at the College of William & Mary, Tucker used William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England as {{his primary}} text. While Tucker {{considered}} Blackstone the best treatise {{to use for}} learning the common law, he thought it had some important weaknesses as a teaching tool for American law. None of the editions of Blackstone published in the United States actually discussed new legal developments there; they just reprinted Blackstone's discussions of English law. Tucker also felt that Blackstone's sympathy {{with the power of}} the Crown over that of Parliament would be a poor influence for a student of American legal principles. Therefore, Tucker wrote marginalia in his copy of Blackstone and read them to his classes, and added lectures on Virginian and United States federal law and comparing the American political system with its British counterpart.|$|E
