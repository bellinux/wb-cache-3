5|$|Unlike in Ellendale and Georgetown, the Millsboro–South and Milford {{proposals}} faced strong opposition. In the Millsboro–South area, DelDOT's preferred alternative, the Blue Alternative, was {{an eastern}} bypass that would diverge from existing US 113 north of Selbyville; {{pass to the}} east of Frankford and Dagsboro, cross the Indian River, and parallel DE 24 west to rejoin US 113's present course north of Betts Pond north of Millsboro. US 113 would have had interchanges with DE 54 at its current junction, with DE 20 and DE 26 east of Dagsboro, with DE 24 east of Millsboro, with DE 30 north of Millsboro, and with DE 20 where the bypass rejoins the present course of US 113. However, DelDOT's preference faced opposition due to its cost, its land requirements, and a revelation that DelDOT was paying a pair of developers each month to not build on the path of the proposed bypass. In response to the <b>payment</b> <b>scheme,</b> Governor Jack Markell suspended further planning work on US113 in Sussex County in January 2011. Markell indicated the project could resume if Sussex County legislators and DelDOT come up with a revised plan for the MillsboroSouth area.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how the {{development}} of <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> for water-related environmental services can be understood and supported. Currently, {{the development}} of such <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> is perceived mainly through theoretical lenses offered by economists and hydrologists. Notwithstanding the usefulness and appropriateness of these theoretical lenses, they have difficulties to accommodate certain aspects of {{the development of}} <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> for water-related environmental services. Specifically, the discussion of negotiation aspects remains relatively isolated and superficial, even though it is generally acknowledged that the development of <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> is often significantly influenced by political negotiations. This paper addresses this limitation. It shows how the main elements of negotiation analysis can provide a theoretical underpinning for important drivers behind the development of specific <b>payment</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are beyond the scope of hydrological or economic rationality. Four cases of water-related <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> in the Netherlands are studied, employing one of the key insights offered by negotiation analysis: the importance of the underlying interests and values of the parties involved. The findings of these four cases show the potential of negotiation analysis as a useful complement for understanding and supporting the development of <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> for environmental services.

25|$|The {{policy has}} evolved {{significantly}} {{since it was}} created by the Treaty of Rome (1957). Substantial reforms over the years have moved the CAP away from a production-oriented policy.

In this study we compare the effects resulting from pure and mixed incentives for physicians under controlled laboratory conditions. Subjects {{in the role of}} physicians choose the quantity of medical services for different patient types. Real patients gain a monetary benefit from subjects' decisions. Our results reveal that overprovision observed in fee-for-service schemes and underprovision observed in capitation schemes can, in fact, be reduced by mixed incentives. Interestingly, even the presentation of pure incentives as mixed incentives already significantly affects physicians' behavior. Moreover, the mixed <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> generally provide a higher benefit-remuneration ratio than the respective pure <b>payment</b> <b>schemes.</b> Our findings provide some valuable insights for designing health care reforms...|$|R

25|$|A common view is {{that the}} CAP has {{traditionally}} promoted a large expansion in agricultural production. At the same time it has allowed farmers to employ unecological ways of increasing production, such as the indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides, with serious environmental consequences. However, a total re-focusing of the <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> in 2004 now puts the environment at the centre of farming policy. By linking the payments to farmers to a number of strict environmental standards (among others) in the so-called cross compliance scheme, farmers will have to face cuts in their subsidy levels if they don't meet the strict environmental requirements.|$|E

25|$|Bieber's {{final round}} of {{collective}} bargaining talks came in 1993, but once more his control of the union's bargaining apparatus was apparent. In August and September 1992, GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio, struck a critical GM parts plant with Yokich's permission, idling many other GM plants and throwing 40,000 other GM employees out of work. The Detroit Free Press later said that Bieber formally approve the strike, but Yokich was the quarterback who actually led the union through it. Despite the problems the Lordstown strike created, Bieber entered contract negotiations with the Big Three automakers seeking pledges against new layoffs. Bieber chose Ford as the strike target, and the company focused on reining in health care costs as its major goal. A new contract was reached on September 15, 1993, but the deal was considered a failure since Bieber was unable to win any major changes to the old agreement. Ford asked for a six-year rather than a three-year agreement, but gave this goal up and promised instead to increase pension payouts by 17 percent for certain veteran workers. The union agreed to a lower wage for new workers, and extend {{the time it took}} for new workers to reach the full wage. No changes were made to the wage or layoff income security provisions. However, Ford did agree to fully pay for health care costs for all workers, but the workers gave up a part of their pay raises to do so. A contract with GM followed the next month. GM sought to reduce its pension costs, but failed. GM, however, forced workers to agree to use vacation time rather than use layoff pay during the summer production shutdown, and gained the right to stop paying layoff pay to workers who refuse jobs at nearby plants.

40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the impact}} of prospective <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> on cost efficiency of acute care hospitals in Switzerland. We study a panel of 121 public hospitals subject to one of four <b>payment</b> <b>schemes.</b> While several hospitals are still reimbursed on a per diem basis {{for the treatment of}} patients, most face flat per-case rates—or mixed schemes, which combine both elements of reimbursement. Thus, unlike previous studies, we are able to simultaneously analyse and isolate the cost-efficiency effects of different <b>payment</b> <b>schemes.</b> By means of stochastic frontier analysis, we first estimate a hospital cost frontier. Using the two-stage approach proposed by Battese and Coelli (Empir Econ 20 : 325 – 332, 1995), we then analyse {{the impact of}} these <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> on the cost efficiency of hospitals. Controlling for hospital characteristics, local market conditions in the 26 Swiss states (cantons), and a time trend, we show that, compared to per diem, hospitals which are reimbursed by flat <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> perform better in terms of cost efficiency. Our results suggest that mixed schemes create incentives for cost containment as well, although to a lesser extent. In addition, our findings indicate that cost-efficient hospitals are primarily located in cantons with competitive markets, as measured by the Herfindahl–Hirschman index in inpatient care. Furthermore, our econometric model shows that we obtain biased estimates from frontier analysis if we do not account for heteroscedasticity in the inefficiency term...|$|R
