The local production of anode grade coke would serve to reduce imports and supply the aluminium smelters on the east coast of South Africa.

As complex mixture, it is difficult to separate and identify of composite of asphaltene (Zhang et al. 2002; Ying et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2013). In fact, asphaltene, which is rich in aromatic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and believed as the polar fraction, has the N, O, S atoms, some of which substitute the carbon in the aromatic chain normally (Gargiulo et al. 2016). Soxhlet extraction, a nondestructive separation technique, can well separate and enrich compounds with similar solubility and polarity from a mixture. Generally, the residues components are separated into several fractions based on the different solubility in n-hexane (n-heptane), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene. The composition that can be dissolved in benzene or toluene-soluble but undissolved in alkanes-insoluble fraction is defined as asphaltene (Mullins et al. 2012; Wu and Kessler 2015). While the complexity compounds cannot be represented by a single model or representative structure and required accurate perspectives distributions and structural features of these residues.

The selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons was maximum at 83. 1 wt% the selectivity towards aromatics and aliphatic hydrocarbons were highest for methanol-potassium hydroxide and methanol respectively.

In addition, the potential for producing high-value carbon products from residues is briefly discussed. © 2013...|$|R
