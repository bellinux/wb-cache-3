50|$|Continuous or quasi-continuous {{monitoring}} involves {{having an}} automated analytical facility {{close to the}} environment being monitored so that results can, if required, be viewed in real time. Such systems are often established to protect important water supplies {{such as in the}} River Dee regulation system but may also be part of an overall monitoring strategy on large strategic rivers where early warning of potential problems is essential. Such systems routinely provide data on parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity and colour but it is also possible to operate gas liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry technologies (GLC/MS) to examine a wide range of potential organic pollutants. In all examples of automated bank-side analysis there is a requirement for water to be pumped from the river into the monitoring station. Choosing a location for the pump inlet is equally as critical as deciding on the location for a river grab sample. The design of the pump and pipework also requires careful design to avoid artefacts being introduced through the action of pumping the water. Dissolved oxygen concentration is difficult to sustain through a <b>pumped</b> <b>system</b> and GLC/MS facilities can detect micro-organic contaminants from the pipework and glands.|$|E
50|$|Waste {{management}} is co-ordinated {{by the local}} authority. The Waste Recycling Group is a company which works {{in partnership with the}} Hull City and East Riding of Yorkshire councils to deal with the waste produced by residents. The company plans to build an energy from waste plant at Salt End to deal with 240,000 tonnes of rubbish and put waste to a productive use by providing power for the equivalent of 20,000 houses. Hull's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is CE Electric UK (YEDL); there are no power stations in the city. Yorkshire Water manages Hull's drinking and waste water. Drinking water is provided by boreholes and aquifers in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and it is abstracted from the River Hull at Tophill Low, near Hutton Cranswick. Should either supply experience difficulty meeting demand, water abstracted from the River Derwent at both Elvington and Loftsome Bridge can be moved to Hull via the Yorkshire water grid. There are many reservoirs in the area for storage of potable and non-potable water. Waste water and sewage has to be transported in a wholly <b>pumped</b> <b>system</b> because of the flat nature of the terrain to a sewage treatment works at Salt End. The treatment works is partly powered by both a wind turbine and a biogas CHP engine.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePolariton condensates are {{investigated}} in periodical potentials created by {{surface acoustic waves}} (SAWs) using both coherent and incoherent optical excitation. Under coherent resonant pumping, condensates are formed due to polariton-parametric scattering from the pump. In this case, the excitation spectrum of the condensate shows a strong reduction of the energy gap arising from the acoustic modulation, indicating efficient screening of the SAW potential by spatial modulation of the polariton density. The observed results are in good agreement with a model based on generalized Gross-Pitaveskii equations, with account taken of the spatial dependence of the exciton energy landscape. In the case of incoherent pumping, coexisting nonequilibrium condensates with s- and p-type wavefunctions are observed, which have different energies, symmetry, and spatial coherence.

30|$|In {{order to}} benefit from the {{additional}} accuracy afforded by considering time-dependent emissions factors and water demands, the time-of-use of pumps also needs to be considered. Pumps can be controlled to both reduce energy usage through unnecessary friction losses due to high pipe velocities and to use electricity during low emissions factor times to reduce operational GHG emissions. However, pumps also need to be controlled so that the ever-changing water demands placed on the WDS are met, without storage tanks running empty or below a minimum acceptable level. As such, the complex task of operating pumps to minimize costs and GHG emissions is ideally suited to formal optimization techniques.
