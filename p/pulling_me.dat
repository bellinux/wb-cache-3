500|$|After {{the second}} verse and chorus, the song {{features}} a break down influenced by house music. Gaga chants {{the lines in}} the same way she does in the middle of [...] "Born This Way". Then she sings, [...] "I wanna love you/ But something's <b>pulling</b> <b>me</b> away from you/ Jesus is my virtue, Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to." [...] In this section, Gaga's vocals drew comparison to that of Rihanna's by Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone. He also added that her voice sounded less dark and dramatic and was full of [...] "bubbly sweetness". Popjustice wrote that the breakdown sounded like tribal-techno, and the whole song was [...] "a turbo-charged electrogothic wrongness anthem". Dan Martin from NME wrote that the breakdown was in the dubstep genre with the chorus being [...] "pure-pop". There were some similarities and influences of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] in the song, which Gaga said was deliberate. She explained that while sometimes it is important for her to push herself in new directions, she did want her characteristic sound to be imbibed in her records. [...] "I wanted [...] to be an evolution from where I’ve been before {{but in terms of the}} formula I wanted there to be something about 'Judas' that reminded people of what I’ve done in the past," [...] she added. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of C minor with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of B3 to E5 and the song follows a basic sequence of A–Fm7–Cm–B–Cm as its chord progression.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{features}} {{samples of}} distinctive melodies from the musical recordings of other artists: [...] Elvis Presley's 1969 UK No. 2 single [...] "In the Ghetto", Fleetwood Mac's 1968 UK No. 1 single [...] "Albatross", {{as well as}} [...] "Oh Well Part II", and Acker Bilk's 1961 US No. 1 single [...] "Stranger on the Shore" [...] all feature prominently, in each case set to an accompaniment of original music. The composers of these hits receive co-writing credit for [...] "Elvis on the Radio Steel Guitar in My Soul", [...] "3am Somewhere out of Beaumont", and [...] "A Melody from a Past Life Keeps <b>Pulling</b> <b>Me</b> Back" [...] respectively, and the performers are thanked in the Chill Out sleevenotes. Boy George's band Jesus Loves You is also thanked for a sample from the single [...] "After the Love", which features on [...] "3am Somewhere out of Beaumont". Short samples from the Van Halen instrumental [...] "Eruption" [...] emerge throughout the song [...] "A Melody from a Past Life Keeps <b>Pulling</b> <b>Me</b> Back". Shortly after the 2:00 mark of [...] "The Lights of Baton Rouge Pass By", a sample from the theme music of The Big Country can be heard as well as Pacific State by 808 State.|$|E
2500|$|Other reviews {{were also}} {{critical}} of the episode's lack of scientific accuracy, mainly around Earth's moon. Writing for Slate, Phil Plait remarked, [...] "The science mistakes were so egregious and so obvious that they kept <b>pulling</b> <b>me</b> {{right out of the}} story. A lot of the mistakes were fixable with a simple Google search." [...] In his review for Doctor Who TV, Clint Hassell had a similar objection. While he praised both the actors' performances and the story's ability to [...] "examine aspects of the human condition", he said the episode was [...] "also terrible, presenting a version of science so incorrect that it almost creates a new genre – 'not-so-science fiction'". Though part of the fun of the show is [...] "obviously make-believe, sciencey-wiencey facts and jargon", he believed that, [...] "When [...] states blatantly wrong science 'facts' because the writer couldn’t be bothered to think rationally, or consult a scientist, that makes the Doctor look like an idiot, and...ruins part of the believability of the show." ...|$|E
