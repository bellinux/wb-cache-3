5|$|It is {{sometimes}} forgotten that the plants described in herbals were grown in special herb gardens (<b>physic</b> gardens). Such herb gardens were, for example, {{part of the}} medieval monastery garden that supplied the simples or officinals used to treat the sick being cared for within the monastery. Early <b>physic</b> gardens were also associated with institutes of learning, whether a monastery, university or herbarium. It was this medieval garden of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, attended by apothecaries and physicians, that established a tradition leading to the systems gardens {{of the eighteenth century}} (gardens that demonstrated the classification system of plants) and the modern botanical garden. The advent of printing, woodcuts and metal engraving improved the means of communication. Herbals prepared the ground for modern botanical science by pioneering plant description, classification and illustration. From the time of the ancients like Dioscorides through to Parkinson in 1629, the scope of the herbal remained essentially the same.|$|E

It is the most southerly residential assessment and rehabilitation centre run by the Trust in the United Kingdom, and provides rehabilitation for up to 23 adults with acquired brain injury.|$|E
5|$|The Linacre Readership in Medicine at the University of Cambridge {{was founded}} in 1524, and the Regius Professor of <b>Physic</b> was {{established}} in 1540. Teaching was reformed in 1829, but the current medical school was established in 1976. Teaching of apprentices was first recorded in 1561 at St Thomas's Hospital, London, and formalised between 1693 and 1709.|$|E
5|$|With about 750 species, Ficus (Moraceae) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{angiosperm}} genera (David Frodin of Chelsea <b>Physic</b> Garden ranked it as the 31st largest genus). Ficus aurea is classified in the subgenus Urostigma (the strangler figs) and the section Americana. Recent molecular phylogenies have shown that subgenus Urostigma is polyphyletic, but have strongly supported the validity of section Americana as a discrete group (although its exact relationship to section Galoglychia is unclear).|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} in prehistory as herbalism with {{the efforts of}} early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, {{making it one of}} the oldest branches of science. Medieval <b>physic</b> gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.|$|E
5|$|Early medieval {{gardens in}} Islamic Spain resembled botanic gardens of the future, an example being the 11th-century Huerta del Ray garden of {{physician}} and author Ibn Wafid (999–1075 CE) in Toledo. This was later {{taken over by}} garden chronicler Ibn Bassal (fl. 1085 CE) until the Christian conquest in 1085 CE. Ibn Bassal then founded a garden in Seville, most of its plants being collected on a botanical expedition that included Morocco, Persia, Sicily, and Egypt. The medical school of Montpelier was also founded by Spanish Arab physicians, and by 1250 CE, it included a <b>physic</b> garden, but the site was not given botanic garden status until 1593.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{descriptions of}} the tree of heaven were made shortly after it was introduced to Europe by the French Jesuit Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville. D'Incarville had sent seeds from Peking via Siberia to his botanist friend Bernard de Jussieu in the 1740s. The seeds sent by d'Incarville {{were thought to be}} from the economically important and similar looking Chinese varnish tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum), which he had observed in the lower Yangtze region, rather than the tree of heaven. D'Incarville attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in France and sent others on to Philip Miller, the superintendent at the Chelsea <b>Physic</b> Garden, and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in Busbridge, England.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dawn of Mana {{is called the}} Mono system, based around the Havok <b>physic</b> engine. Almost all objects in the game, {{including}} enemies, are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. When something is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up {{to a maximum of}} four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible.|$|E

In the same year, the English monarch established the Regius Professorship of <b>Physic</b> at the University of Cambridge. Newer universities would probably describe such an academic {{as a professor of}} internal medicine. Hence, in the 16th century, <b>physic</b> meant roughly what internal medicine does now.|$|E

25|$|In medieval Europe, {{medicinal}} herbs and plants were cultivated in monastery and nunnery gardens beginning about the 8th century. Charlemagne gave {{orders for the}} collection of medicinal plants to be grown systematically in his royal garden. This royal garden was an important precedent for botanical gardens and <b>physic</b> gardens that were established in the 16th century. It was also {{the beginning of the}} study of botany as a separate discipline. In about the 12th century, medicine and pharmacy began to be taught in universities.|$|E
25|$|As to Squire Western, he {{was seldom}} {{out of the}} sick-room, unless when he was engaged either in the field or over his bottle.

25|$|Not long {{content with}} life in London, Fraser {{soon began to}} quit the mercantile counter {{as often as he}} could to watch the gardeners at work.

25|$|In 1770, {{five years}} before the American War of Independence and {{coincident}} with Captain James Cook's discovery of the eastern Australian coast, Fraser arrived in London {{as a young man}} to make his way in the city, at first following the trade of a hosier (a draper working with linen). He soon came to know the Chelsea <b>Physic</b> Garden, and it was through his visits there that he became inspired with a desire to advance horticulture in England. He married Frances Shaw on 21 June 1778 and settled down in a small shop in Paradise Bow, Chelsea.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from some}} small sums to various charities, Gresham bequeathed {{the bulk of}} his {{property}} (consisting of estates in London and around England giving an income of more than 2,300 pounds a year) to his widow and her heirs, with the stipulation that after her death his own house in Bishopsgate Street and the rents from the Royal Exchange should be vested in the Corporation of London and the Mercers Company, for the purpose of instituting a college in which seven professors should read lectures, one each day of the week, in astronomy, geometry, <b>physic,</b> law, divinity, rhetoric and music. Thus, Gresham College, the first institution of higher learning in London, came to be established in 1597.|$|E
25|$|Paget {{was born}} in Great Yarmouth, England, on 11 January 1814, {{the son of a}} brewer and shipowner.

He attended a day-school in Yarmouth, and afterwards was destined for the navy; but this plan was given up, and at the age of 16 he was apprenticed to a general practitioner, for whom he served for four and a half years, during which time he gave his leisure hours to botanising, and made a great collection of the flora of East Norfolk. At the end of his apprenticeship, he published with one of his brothers a very careful Sketch of the Natural History of Yarmouth and its Neighbourhood.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{medicine}} of the Middle Ages ostensibly {{dealt with}} the use of herbal remedies for ailments. The practice of keeping <b>physic</b> gardens teeming with various herbs with medicinal properties was a traditional practice influenced in medieval Europe by the gardens of Roman antiquity. Many early medieval manuscripts have been noted for containing practical descriptions for the use of herbal remedies. These texts, such as the Pseudo-Apuleius, included illustrations of various plants that would have been easily identifiable and familiar to Europeans at the time. Monasteries later became centers of medical practice in the Middle Ages, and carried on the tradition of maintaining medicinal gardens. These gardens became specialized and capable of maintaining plants from Southern Hemispheres as well as maintaining plants during winter. The practice of gardening for the purpose of supplying the ingredients necessary in medieval herbal medicinals was influenced by a rural folk tradition.|$|E
25|$|Essex {{continued}} his march to Drumcondra, while O'Neill returned to camp. At the planned conference on September 8 O'Neill was present, but not Essex. A cessation of arms was agreed {{for six weeks}} to six weeks, until May Day, either side being at liberty to break it on giving fourteen days warning; the English had liberty to attack O'Neill's confederates if they refused to be bound. The terms also provided for restitution of all spoils within 20 days after the warning, and the rebels were to hold all they then possessed, with no garrisons {{to be placed in}} new stations, free passages to be assured, all English garrisons to be apprised of the cessation, and commissioners for the borders between the English and Irish zones to be appointed. O'Neill was to ratify this on oath, Essex on his word. The terms were committed to writing and signed by O'Neill. The next day Essex dispersed his army and went to take <b>physic</b> at Drogheda, while O'Neill retired with all his forces into the heart of his country.|$|E
25|$|Much of Chelsea (SW3) and Knightsbridge (SW1X) {{is still}} owned by Earl Cadogan, through the Cadogan Estates. Most of the {{property}} owned is in and around Cadogan Square. This has {{a major influence on}} the markets as the Earl is the freeholder and generally has no desire to sell; although changes in legislation now mean the freeholder is obliged to sell lease extensions to a leaseholder at prices which are determined by the Leasehold valuation tribunal. Lord Cadogan is generally regarded as an effective and successful property developer/landlord being responsible, together with his management team, for bringing all of the fashion labels to Sloane Street, and also forward thinking developments on his own account at Duke of York Square on Kings Road, at Peter Jones and on Sloane Street. The Cadogan Estate has a considerable portfolio of retail property throughout Chelsea but notably on Fulham Road, Kings Road, and Sloane Street including Peter Jones, Harvey Nichols, and 12 hotels including the Cadogan Hotel. The Estate maintains many of the garden squares, (to which local residents can gain access by subscribing for an annual fee – and optionally the tennis courts where applicable). The area is home to several open spaces including Albert Bridge Gardens, Battersea Bridge Gardens, Chelsea Embankment Gardens, Royal Hospital Chelsea: the grounds of which are used by the annual Chelsea Flower Show and Chelsea <b>Physic</b> Garden.|$|E
500|$|Though {{these ancient}} gardens shared {{some of the}} {{characteristics}} of present-day botanical gardens, the forerunners of modern botanical gardens are generally regarded as being the medieval monastic <b>physic</b> gardens that originated after the decline of the Roman Empire at the time of Emperor Charlemagne (742–789 CE). These contained a , a garden used mostly for vegetables, and another section set aside for specially labelled medicinal plants and this was called the [...] or [...] more generally known as a <b>physic</b> garden, and a [...] or orchard. These gardens were probably given impetus when Charlemagne issued a capitulary, the Capitulary de Villis, which listed 73 herbs {{to be used in the}} <b>physic</b> gardens of his dominions. Many of these were found in British gardens even though they only occurred naturally in continental Europe, demonstrating earlier plant introduction. Pope Nicholas V set aside part of the Vatican grounds in 1447, for a garden of medicinal plants that were used to promote the teaching of botany, and this was a forerunner to the University gardens at Padua and Pisa established in the 1540s. Certainly the founding of many early botanic gardens was instigated by members of the medical profession.|$|E
500|$|Botanical gardens, in {{the modern}} sense, {{developed}} from <b>physic</b> gardens, whose main purpose was to cultivate herbs for medical use as well as research and experimentation. Such gardens have a long history. In Europe, for example, Aristotle (384BCE – 322BCE) {{is said to have}} had a <b>physic</b> garden in the Lyceum at Athens, which was used for educational purposes and for the study of botany, and this was inherited, or possibly set up, by his pupil Theophrastus, the [...] "Father of Botany". There is some debate among science historians whether this garden was ordered and scientific enough to be considered [...] "botanical", and suggest it more appropriate to attribute the earliest known botanical garden in Europe to the botanist and pharmacologist Antonius Castor, mentioned by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century.|$|E
500|$|By the 18th {{century the}} <b>physic</b> gardens had been {{transformed}} into [...] "order beds" [...] that demonstrated the classification systems that were being devised by botanists of the day — but they also had to accommodate the influx of curious, beautiful and new plants pouring in from voyages of exploration that were associated with European colonial expansion.|$|E
500|$|Early {{botanical gardens}} were <b>physic</b> gardens, {{repositories}} for the medicinal plants {{described in the}} herbals. As they were generally associated with universities or other academic institutions the plants were also used for study. The directors of these gardens were eminent physicians with an educational role as [...] "scientific gardeners" [...] and it was staff of these institutions that produced many of the published herbals.|$|E
500|$|Medical {{teaching}} {{has taken}} place erratically at the University of Oxford since the early 16th century, and its first Regius Professor of <b>Physic</b> was appointed in 1546. Teaching was reformed in 1833 and again in 1856, but the current medical school was not founded until 1936. The [...] University of St Andrews established a Chair of Medicine in 1772, but {{did not have a}} medical school (at Dundee) until 1897.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Gardens at Kew {{were founded}} in 1759, {{initially}} {{as part of}} the Royal Garden set aside as a <b>physic</b> garden. William Aiton (1741–1793), the first curator, was taught by garden chronicler Philip Miller of the Chelsea <b>Physic</b> Garden whose son Charles became first curator of the original Cambridge Botanic Garden (1762). In 1759, the [...] "Physick Garden" [...] was planted, and by 1767, it was claimed that [...] "the Exotick Garden is by far the richest in Europe". Gardens such as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (1759) and [...] , Tenerife (1788) and the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid (1755) were set up to cultivate new species returned from expeditions to the tropics; they also helped found new tropical botanical gardens. From the 1770s, following the example of the French and Spanish, amateur collectors were supplemented by official horticultural and botanical plant hunters. This was the great era of European, and especially British, imperialism which was [...] "the means by which ideas, knowledge, styles of economy, politics and goods were given international reach" [...] and justified as the spreading of [...] "civilisation" [...] through [...] "development" [...] and [...] "improvement".|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid to}} late 17th century, the Paris Jardin des Plantes was a {{centre of}} {{interest}} with the greatest number of new introductions to attract the public. In England, the Chelsea <b>Physic</b> Garden was founded in 1673 as the [...] "Garden of the Society of Apothecaries". The Chelsea garden had heated greenhouses, and in 1723 appointed Philip Miller (1691–1771) as head gardener. He had a wide influence on both botany and horticulture, as plants poured into it from around the world. The garden's golden age came in the 18th century, when it became the world's most richly stocked botanical garden. Its seed-exchange programme was established in 1682 and still continues today.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's first periodicals, Gospel Magazine (1766–?), The Universal Museum and Complete Magazine (1765–1770), and The Monthly Record of Literature (1767), {{like many}} 18th-century journals, {{lasted only a}} short while, but his later {{attempts}} were much more successful. In 1783, he financed the first quarterly medical periodical in London, the London Medical Journal, founded by Samuel Foart Simmons, a prominent physician. Explaining the journal's goals, Simmons wrote that it would provide [...] "an account of new medical books and useful discoveries in <b>physic,</b> {{and at the same}} time be a repository for original essays". The journal lasted until 1790 when it was replaced by another Johnson-Simmons venture, Medical Facts and Observations, which ran until 1797.|$|E
500|$|The {{tradition}} of these Italian gardens passed into Spain ( [...] , 1567) and Northern Europe, where similar gardens {{were established in}} the Netherlands (Hortus Botanicus Leiden, 1587; Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam), 1638), Germany (Alter Botanischer Garten Tübingen, 1535; Leipzig Botanical Garden, 1580; Botanischer Garten Jena, 1586; Botanischer Garten Heidelberg, 1593; Herrenhäuser Gärten, Hanover, 1666; Botanischer Garten der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, 1669; Botanical Garden in Berlin, 1672), Switzerland (Old Botanical Garden, Zürich, 1560; Basel, 1589); England (University of Oxford Botanic Garden, 1621; Chelsea <b>Physic</b> Garden, 1673); Scotland (Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, 1670); and in France (Jardin des plantes de Montpellier, 1593; Faculty of Medicine Garden, Paris, 1597; Jardin des Plantes, Paris, 1635), Denmark (University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden, 1600); Sweden (Uppsala University, 1655).|$|E

Strong drink, taken often enough and in sufficient quantity, will have that effect, of course, but Battie, distinguishing between 'original' and 'consequential' madness [...] would allow only that excessive drinking could 'become a very common, tho' remoter cause of Madness.' Others differed: John Ball in his Modern Practice of <b>Physic,</b> 1760, lists 'anxiety of mind' and too much 'strong vinous or spirituous liquors' as 'antecedent causes' of madness. Smart's mania, however it manifested itself, and it usually manifested itself in loud public prayer, did not stem from drunkenness; it was aggravated, however, by frequent recourse to the bottle. Ironically enough, as Mrs. Piozzi recognised, if Smart had prayed in the privacy of his home, all might have been well for him.|$|E

500|$|In July 1736, Linnaeus {{travelled}} to England, at Clifford's expense. He went to London {{to visit}} Sir Hans Sloane, a collector of natural history, {{and to see}} his cabinet, {{as well as to}} visit the Chelsea <b>Physic</b> Garden and its keeper, Philip Miller. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in [...] Miller was in fact reluctant to use the new binomial nomenclature, preferring the classifications of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and John Ray at first. Linnaeus, nevertheless, applauded Miller's Gardeners Dictionary, The conservative Scot actually retained in his dictionary a number of pre-Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists. He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of The Gardeners Dictionary of 1768.
