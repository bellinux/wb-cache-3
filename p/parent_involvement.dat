To determine the level of parental involvement of selfefficacy, parent- focused invitation, empowerment-focused invitation, child focusedinvitation, school-focused invitation, parent responsibilities-focused, and communication-focused, questionnaire administered to 120 parents. Based on Hoover-Dempsey & Sandler model (2005) the findings revealed that parental involvement has great influenced on child succeed in the UPSR. The highest level of <b>parent’s</b> <b>involvement</b> on <b>Parent’s</b> Self-Efficacy is their efforts to help my child learn are successfuT’ (M= 4. 70; SD= 0. 806); {{the highest level of}} <b>parent’s</b> <b>involvement</b> on School-Focused Invitation is '’“'When my child first enrolled in this school, we were much welcomed' (M= 4. 97; SD= 0. 733).

2500|$|As well as {{behavioral}} {{interventions and}} supports, {{school psychologists are}} often responsible for selecting and implementing academic interventions. In the 1990s, school psychology service delivery shifted towards a problem-solving focus, which is an approach aimed at developing interventions and ensuring outcomes. This was {{in contrast to the}} previous wait-to-fail model. This problem-solving approach is commonly referred to as the Response to Intervention (RTI) framework and is steadily becoming adopted by more and more schools. It is made up of a multi-tiered system of support that provides interventions and services to students with an increasing intensity based on severity of needs. [...] RTI necessitates that school psychologists be involved in the early identification of learning and behavioral difficulties and needs. School psychologists work collaboratively with teachers and other special education staff to determine what services and supports need to be implemented to best serve struggling students. RTI includes specific components to effectively ensure that all students are making adequate progress. Included is: 1) High quality instruction and behavioral support, 2) Well-researched, evidence-based interventions that are implemented with fidelity, 3) Continuous progress monitoring and data collection, 4) Continuous collaboration of an educational team, and 5) <b>Parent</b> <b>involvement</b> and participation. [...] These interventions can be conceptualized as a set of procedures and strategies designed to improve student performance with the intent of closing the gap between how a student is currently performing and the expectations of how they should be performing. [...] Short term and long term interventions used within a problem-solving model must be evidence-based. This means the intervention strategies must have been evaluated by experimental or quasi-experimental research that utilized rigorous data analysis and peer review procedures to determine the effectiveness. [...] Implementing evidence-based interventions for behavior and academic concerns requires significant training, skill development, and supervised practice. Linking assessment and intervention is critical for determining that the correct intervention has been chosen. [...] School psychologists have been specifically trained to ensure that interventions are implemented with integrity to maximize positive outcomes for children in a school setting.|$|E

Its aim was to examine if these contributions may help to explain the unclear relationships between <b>parenting</b> <b>involvement</b> and children’s school achievement. A total of 621 mothers and their children from first, second, and third grade participated in the study. In the sample of children, 322 were females and 299 were males.

The findings of the study revealed that interaction and communication, parenting practices, leisure, openness and acceptance were the predictive factors and had a positive relationship with parental involvement in education of secondary school children. Multiple regression analysis showed that the component of family context contributed 44. 5 percent to the <b>involvement</b> of <b>parents</b> at home as compared to only 16. 0 percent for <b>involvement</b> of <b>parents</b> in school. Overall, it was found that family context contributed 41. 1 percent to the involvement (home and school). Of greater interest is that this study found that <b>involvement</b> of <b>parents</b> in education of their secondary school children was not the main factor for their children’s achievement in learning. The children obtained high academic achievement even without the <b>parents</b> <b>involvement.</b> A conducive and harmonious family context was able to motivate the children to succeed in their studies. Hence it can be concluded that although family involvement is important in raising the academic achievement of children, the family context is the main factor in influencing the children’s academic achievement.

This paper outlines the protocol for a study aimed at exploring <b>parent’s</b> <b>involvement</b> during professional–parent interactions and decisions about their child’s care {{in the context of}} suspected shunt malfunction. Background. Hydrocephalus is a long-term condition treated primarily by the insertion of a shunt that diverts fluid from the brain to another body compartment. Shunts frequently malfunction, and parents of children with shunted hydrocephalus are responsible for recognizing and responding to shunt complications. Parents feel that interactions with professionals when they seek healthcare advice for their child do always not encourage active participation in care decisions. Methods. The study design is based on qualitative methodologies: a combination of conversation analysis applied to consultation recordings of professional–parent interactions when a child is admitted to hospital with suspected shunt malfunction,and semi-structured follow-up interviews with the same participants within 2 weeks of the consultation. Participants. This is a prospective study and participants will be purposefully selected. Parents of children who have been admitted to hospital with suspected shunt malfunction and healthcare professionals responsible for the initial assessment of the child will be invited to participate. Discussion. The study will identify how decisions about a child’s care are negotiated between parents and healthcare professionals at key stages of the care pathway. In addition, examining interactions between healthcare professionals and parents may identify approaches that support or hinder parents in contributing to the decisionmaking processes when they seek advice from healthcare professionals...|$|R
