50|$|Another type of ND filter {{configuration}} is the ND-filter wheel. It {{consists of}} two <b>perforated</b> <b>glass</b> disks that have progressively denser coating applied around the perforation {{on the face of}} each disk. When the two disks are counter-rotated in front of each other, they gradually and evenly go from 100% transmission to 0% transmission. These are used on catadioptric telescopes mentioned above and in any system that is required to work at 100% of its aperture (usually because the system is required to work at its maximal angular resolution).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} aging on the flexural stiffness and bending loading capacity of a <b>perforated</b> <b>glass</b> fiber-reinforced epoxy composite subjected to combined moisture and elevated temperature. Specimens, in the configuration of one-quarter of a perforated GFRP tube, were aged in 60 % humidity and temperatures of 40, 60, and 80 °C, respectively. Moisture absorptions of the specimens were measured during the aging process, and bending tests were conducted on the specimens after aging. The SEM images were also captured to further {{examine the effects of}} the moisture absorption on the aged specimens. The results indicated that the increase in the aging temperature reduced the diffusion coefficient, thus inducing more moisture absorption by the composite and in turn causing more reduction in composite’s flexural stiffness and bending capacity. Moreover, the ability of Fick’s equation for predicting the moisture absorption rate in such perforated thin-walled composite configuration at various moisture contents and temperatures was also assessed. A semiempirical equation was developed and proposed by which the reduction of the stiffness in the perforated aged GFRP structures could be predicted...|$|E

40|$|Ingestion {{of foreign}} bodies {{is common in}} {{clinical}} practice. Most ingested foreign bodies will pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract without any problems. While GI tract injury due to the ingested foreign body such as a toothpick, a fishbone, a date pit, or a chicken bone, is common, duodenal perforation is rare. In this report, our experience with this rare entity is shared. We present a 38 -year-old male patient with GI tract perforation in the bulbus of the duodenum due to a leg of glasses. The patient was admitted to our hospital with severe abdominal pain. Right upper quadrant tenderness was detected at physical examination, and leukocytosis on the laboratory test results. Plain X-ray and computerized tomography showed an ingested foreign body in the bulbus of the duodenum. A leg of <b>glasses</b> <b>perforating</b> the duodenum was removed with endoscopy. The patient was managed nonoperatively, and discharged without any complications on the eighth day after endoscopy. Endoscopic removal and nonoperative management may be feasible in carefully selected patients with duodenal-perforating foreign bodies...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube reinforced concrete (FTRC) columns under different loading conditions {{was investigated in}} this study. Four groups of 16 specimens were cast and tested. Specimens in the first group (the reference group) were re- inforced with longitudinal steel bars and steel helices (Group REF). Specimens in the second group were reinforced with intact glass FRP tubes (Group IT). Specimens in the third group were also reinforced with intact glass FRP tubes. In addition, polymer grid was embedded into the concrete cover to reduce the cover spalling (Group ITG). Specimens in the fourth group were reinforced with <b>perforated</b> <b>glass</b> FRP tubes (Group PT). One specimen from each group was tested under concentric loading, one under 25 -mm eccentric loading, one under 50 -mm eccentric loading, and one under four-point loading. Results from the experimental study show that FRP tubes significantly increase the load-carrying capacity and ductility of FTRC specimens. Group ITG specimens performed {{better than the other}} groups of specimens. Experimental and analytical interaction (P−M) diagrams also show the enhanced performance of FTRC specimens...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influences}} of various parameters on the behaviour of <b>perforated</b> <b>Glass</b> Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) tubes under axial compression. A total of 15 GFRP tubes with and without perforations were tested under axial compression. All the GFRP tubes {{were divided into two}} groups: 12 tubes with 89 mm outer diameter and 6 mm wall thickness and 3 tubes with 183 mm outer diameter and 8 mm wall thickness. The influences of hole diameter, vertical hole spacing, tube diameter, perforation pattern, transverse hole spacing, and hole reinforcement on the axial compressive behaviour of perforated GFRP tubes were experimentally investigated. Considerable decreases in the axial stiffness, axial critical load, and axial deformation capacity of perforated GFRP tubes have been observed. The hole diameter, tube diameter, perforation pattern, and transverse hole spacing significantly influence the axial compressive behaviour of perforated GFRP tubes. However, {{the influences of}} vertical hole spacing and hole reinforcement have been observed not significant. Design-oriented equations for the prediction of the axial stiffness, axial critical load and axial deformation capacity of perforated GFRP tubes under axial compression have been proposed. The proposed equations {{have been found to be}} in good agreement with experimental results and can be used for the reliable design of perforated GFRP tubes...|$|E
40|$|The {{trends of}} room and {{building}} environment designs valuing acoustical solutions for space and energy saving, {{as well as}} health and environmental friendly sound absorbers are increasing. Transparent/translucent absorbers, such as <b>perforated</b> <b>glass,</b> plastic panel, foil, and honeycomb-structures are merely some suitable choices for these demands. The absorption performance of the micro-perforated (slotted) transparent/translucent material/structure is limited, due to their special characteristics. The vibration of the foil will for example counteract the friction of the air drop with the internal surface of the hole and deteriorates the low frequency absorption performance of the structure. Astutely designed thicker and rigid perforated (slotted) panels will have lower or middle frequency absorptions, but reflects more sound waves at higher frequencies, causing the degrade of absorption coefficient in the high frequency ranges. The affects to the absorption of the parameters of micro perforation (slot) on the "rigid" panel (foil) absorber, like thickness, hole radius, hole distance, air gap depth, has been extensively considered. In this paper the discussion will {{be focused on the}} effects of other phenomenon like the vibration of the panels, the existence {{and the size of the}} grids in the air gap behind the front panel and multi-layered structures. The performance of absorber structures will be optimized. Some applications of transparent/translucent will also be introduced...|$|E
40|$|Publicado em "Rheology and {{processing}} of construction materials", ISBN 978 - 2 - 35158 - 137 - 7 Insulated sandwich panels are often composed of external concrete layers, mechanically connected through metallic elements, such as trusses. Due to their high thermal conductivity, metallic connectors tend to cause thermal bridges {{on the building}} envelope. In view of this problem, an innovative solution for sandwich slabs is proposed {{within the framework of}} a pre-fabricated modular housing system. The referred slabs are based on a sandwich solution composed by two thin layers of Steel Fibre Reinforced Self-Compacting Concrete (SFRSCC) that are connected by thin <b>perforated</b> plates of <b>Glass</b> Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP), used together with a thermal insulation core-layer. The bottom concrete layer is reinforced with conventional steel rebars and steel fibres, whereas the upper one does not have conventional reinforcement. This paper presents a preliminary experimental program aiming to assess the flexural and shear behaviour of this type of sandwich panel solution. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of the proposed sandwich slab system, revealing its capacity in terms of load carrying capacity and ductility performance. In addition, the flexural behaviour of the tested specimens was numerically analysed for the serviceability limit states using the finite element method with consideration of the material non-linearity.

40|$|Particle flow {{features}} and wall-to-bed contact heat transfer characteristics of beds of granular solids stirred by flat blades (paddle-type) in horizontal cylindrical troughs are presented and discussed. Variables examined include: bed-to-blade height ratio (2 - 10), agitator speed (0 - 60 rev/min), wall-to-blade clearance (2. 3 - 80 mm), vessel diameter (250 and 500 mm), solids flowability (0. 07 - 0. 25), {{air flow rate}} (0 - 0. 5 m/s), particle moisture content (0 - 0. 85 kg water/kg dry particles), particle surface stickiness (0 - 1. 3 $ times$ 10 $ sp{- 3 }$ kg glycerine/kg dry particles) and blade configuration (<b>perforated</b> and non-perforated). <b>Glass</b> beads, rice, millet and linseed were used as model particles. Overall mixing maps showing regimes of good and poor solids mixing are presented. Granular solids flowability was found to influence particle flow characteristics substantially within the bulk {{as well as the}} wall-to-blade clearance region of the bed. Bulk solids flowability in stirred vessels was characterized by a novel procedure which incorporated the combined effects of particle shape, surface roughness, moisture/stickiness and deformability. The torque required to stir the particulate bed is influenced strongly by the solids flowability and blade configuration. A physical model for the wall-to-bed contact heat transfer coefficient based on particle renewal rates at the heated surface is proposed. The particle renewal rates and particle-surface contact times are evaluated exclusively from the particle flow information in the clearance region with no empirical parameters. The effects of particle shape and bed porosity at the contacting surface on the surface-to-particle thermal contact resistance were evaluated. Experimental results showing the effects of agitator speed, wall-to-blade clearance, solids flowability and air flow rate on the wall-to-bed average heat transfer rate are presented and discussed. The contact heat transfer model was found to predict the experimentally measured results reasonably well...|$|R
40|$|The PERFOFRP {{connector}} consists on a <b>perforated</b> <b>glass</b> fibre reinforce polymer (GFRP) rib that is {{specially designed}} {{to perform the}} connection between thin concrete layers, which can be also useful {{in the context of}} structural rehabilitation. It stays embedded in the concrete layers, avoiding the use of complementary connecting techniques, like special gluing or bolting. This type of connection is similar to the Perfobond steel connectors proposed for steel and concrete composites structures. Perfobond shear connector failure depends on the concrete dowels load capacity, since the steel connector failure does not occur in ribs with adequate thickness. However, {{in the case of the}} PERFOFRP connectors, the load capacity can be limited by the failure of the connector itself. To achieve a better understanding on the behaviour of the GFRP connector, an experimental study, based on tests with perforated GFRP laminates submitted to pin-bearing tests, is carried out. The tests are performed with four different rectangular GFRP plates containing a circular hole of 30 mm diameter, and differing from each other in terms of stacking and amount of fibre plies. Two different geometries of specimens are studied to enhance the evaluation of two expected failure modes. Finally, the failure modes, the peak loads and the evolution of strain in the vicinity of the holes are presented and discussed. QREN-ADI, Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} behaviour of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube reinforced concrete (FTRC) specimens under different loading conditions. Four groups of 16 specimens with diameter of 200 mm and height of 800 mm were cast and tested. Specimens in the first group (Group REF) which is reference group were reinforced with longitudinal steel bars and steel helixes. Specimens in the second group (Group ST) were reinforced with intact glass FRP tubes. Specimens in the third group (Group ST-G) were also reinforced with intact glass FRP tubes. In addition, polymer grid was embedded into the concrete cover to reduce the cover spalling. Specimens in the fourth group (Group PT) were reinforced with <b>perforated</b> <b>glass</b> FRP tubes to integrate concrete cover with concrete core. From each group, one specimen was tested under concentric loading, one specimen under 25 mm eccentric loading, one specimen under 50 mm eccentric loading, and one specimen under four-point loading. Results from the experimental study show that FRP tubes significantly increase the load carrying capacity of FTRC specimens. Group ST-G specimens performed {{better than the other}} groups of specimens. Axial load-bending moment (P-M) Interaction diagrams constructed based on the experimental results also show the enhanced performance of FTRC specimens. In addition, the P-M behaviour of steel reinforced concrete specimens SRCs and concrete filled FRP tube specimens CFFTs is analysed theoretically. An equivalent rectangular stress block method is used for SRCs and layer by layer method is used for CFFTs. A comparison between the theoretical P-M behaviour and experimental P-M behaviour is carried out for Group REF, Group ST, and Group ST-G separately. In general, the experimental and theoretical P-M interaction diagrams exhibit the same patterns except for Group REF...|$|E
40|$|Intension In this {{graduation}} project I {{will make}} a redevelopment of the Q-Port building to a Hotel and Congress Centre: On the one hand, my project focuses on the refurbishment of an office façade into an energy producing façade. This renew has an ecological, social and economic importance. These three aspects reflect my sustainable approach. On the other hand, {{the establishment of a}} new use strategy for the Q-Port building in form of a Hotel and Congress Centre plays a key role. The Q-Port building is a bad example of urban planning when an important aspect of life – work – leads to mono-functional urban sectors. Instead of thinking in certain functional categories, I want to create spaces in the urban context in which we simply enjoy living – spaces with leeway for individuality – regardless of how large the building is. KEY Feature - “Grüne Lunge” Key feature of my design is the “Grüne Lunge”, an open public way and an energy generating technology as design element of the façade to unite the urban concept and the energy concept within the façade design. The redesign of the Q-Port building is linked to the historic urban planning strategy to be a green recreational area. Urban porosity is the key intention of the new hybrid Q-Port building with the aim of pedestrian oriented urban places. The transformed Q-Port building becomes localized a `social condenser´ for new communities: The “Grüne Lunge”, an open public space spirals upwards from the street and guides the people through the building. ReDesign The redesign is not only use related but also energy efficient with the design of an energy generating façade, which makes the building to an energy production. In the focus there is an active intelligent façade, the “Grüne Lunge”, in relation to the climate of a building and the possibility for the urban context: The façade is my fascination because it shows most dominant the architectural value of a building. It is the visible statement to the world and it gives a face to the building. Façades connect the inside space and the outside city rooms and have a high potential as multifunctional construction elements. The new task of the façade in my design is, that the “Grüne Lunge”, which is an open public way, is linked to the energy concept of the whole building and is main part of the ventilation concept. The “Grüne Lunge” is an open public way, which spirals upwards, and guaranties natural ventilation in the rooms. In the summer time it transports cold air from {{the north side of the}} building into the south part. The night cooling out of the building in the summer is done by the “Grüne Lunge”. In the winter time the air is transported from the south side of the building and is preheated in the buffer zone of the “Grüne Lunge” and flows over an air guide system in the suspended floors into the rooms. Moreover, the “Grüne Lunge” acts as an interspace and a connection point for the public and private activities within the building. Benchmark The <b>perforated</b> <b>glass</b> in the building envelope is only broken by the transparent envelope of the “Grüne Lunge”. The “Grüne Lunge” in the building`s envelope can be seen from the highway or the streets and by this people get interested in the new use strategy of the Q Port building. The new Q Port building should become a highlight building in the Brettenzone like a Benchmark for the city part Brettenzone. Therefore the installation of a media façade which offers surface for commercial activities is done in addition to the BIPV modules at the closed façade parts. This is the next step into a more sustainable future: The energy concept for the Q-Port building is able to generate energy within the façade and so unifies the energy demands of the future.
