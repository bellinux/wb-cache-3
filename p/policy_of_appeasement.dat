5|$|Non-intervention, {{and with}} it the Non-Intervention Agreement, had been {{proposed}} in a joint diplomatic initiative by the governments of France and the United Kingdom. It was part of a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement,</b> aimed at preventing a proxy war – with Italy and Nazi Germany supporting Franco's Nationalist Coalition right {{at the onset of the}} conflict and the Soviet Union supporting the Republican faction four months later – from escalating into a major pan-European conflict.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the Little Entente), Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement</b> evident in those countries' signing of the Locarno Treaties. Piłsudski therefore aimed also to maintain {{good relations with the}} Soviet Union and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors.|$|E

The drunken debauched lord which Holliday sees in a night club is contrasted with the high ideals of Chivalry and the poetry of Chaucer(...) Where the British have been found wanting, a single plucky and quixotic American attempts to step into the breach".|$|R
5000|$|All those {{aggressive}} moves met only feeble and ineffectual <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement</b> {{from the}} League of Nations and the Entente Cordiale, in retrospect symbolized by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's [...] "peace for our time" [...] speech following the Munich Conference (1938), that had allowed the annexation of the Sudeten from interwar Czechoslovakia. When in March 1939 the German Führer broke the promise {{he had made}} at that conference to respect that Czechoslovalia's future territorial integrity, sending troops into Prague, its capital, breaking off Slovakia as a German client-state, and absorbing {{the rest of the}} Czech lands as the [...] "Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia", Britain and France tried to switch to a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> deterrence.|$|R
5|$|Domitian {{appears to}} have met with several conspiracies during his reign, one of which led to his {{eventual}} assassination in 96. The first significant revolt arose on 1 January 89, when the governor of Germania Superior, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, and his two legions at Mainz, Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax, rebelled against the Roman Empire {{with the aid of}} the Chatti. The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain, although it {{appears to have}} been planned well in advance. The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement</b> towards Decebalus. At any rate, the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces. The governor of Germania Inferior, Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia, Titus Flavius Norbanus. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, whilst Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard. By a stroke of luck, a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus' aid. Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, Wavell {{ordered a}} plan covertly to {{encourage}} a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, which the Italians {{had never been able}} entirely to repress {{after the end of the}} Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel D. A. Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement,</b> intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance, known as the Arbegnoch. In June 1940, Haile Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.|$|E

Historian Andrew Gordon wrote <b>of</b> <b>Appeasement</b> and Rearmament that:Given Britain’s strategic, political, and economic situation, diplomacy make both pragmatic and ethical sense in the late 1930s. James P.

Peden was not impressed, while David French represented Appeasement and Rearmament as primarily a stimulating work for undergraduates.In addition, Levy has published articles in The Mariner’s Mirror, The Naval War College Review, Journal of Strategic Studies, War in History, and Global War Studies (see bibliography below).|$|R
50|$|In the {{majority}} of cases, the Nazis and the Empire of Japan have conquered {{most or all of}} the world, and no major powers remain to confront them in any significant sense due to the core strength of the Allies faltering. The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom upon losing the war are often largely or totally conquered. Domestic political developments within those countries typically have become focused on isolationism and/or <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement,</b> with this either leading to an Axis victory, resulting from it, or both. Impeded economic development and problems with rearmament, often matched with the rising prominence of domestic fascist movements, also function as justification for waning anti-Axis resolve. Numerous examples exist of these ideas being developed in dramas.|$|R
5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> Latin <b>appeasement</b> to the Church in Rome, heavy {{taxation}} and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|R

25|$|However, {{with the}} rising threat from Nazi Germany, and the {{ineffectiveness}} of the League of Nations, this policy eventually lost credibility. By 1937, Labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose Neville Chamberlain's <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the threat}} from Nazi Germany increased, in the late 1930s the Labour Party {{gradually}} abandoned its pacifist stance and came to support re-armament, {{largely due to the}} efforts of Ernest Bevin and Hugh Dalton who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose Neville Chamberlain's <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the newly}} founded Weimar Republic in 1920, 68 year-old lawyer, centre {{delegate}} and parliamentary president Constantin Fehrenbach resigned {{after the collapse}} of the Weimar coalition of a minority government from the Centre, German Democratic Party and the German People's Party as early as May 1921. This was due to the disunity of the coalition fulfilment of the Treaty of Versailles. His successor was the former Minister of Finance of Baden, the left-wing Centre delegate and Freiburg-born Joseph Wirth, with a cabinet of Social Democrats, the Democratic Party and the Cetnre, which had to begin with unpopular <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement.</b> Whilst searching for allies against the victorious powers, Wirth, together with his foreign minister Walther Rathenau with Russia, affiliated the Treaty of Rapallo (1922) and led Germany out of isolation concerning foreign affairs. In November 1922, Wirth resigned because of quarrels within the coalition. In 1923, in accordance to the initiative set out by French parliamentary deputy and pacifist Marc Sangnier, about 7,000 people from 23 nations gathered at the 3rd International Peace Congress in Freiburg to discuss ways of reducing hatred between nations, understanding the international situation and overcoming the war. One of the German representatives was Ludwig Quidde, a later recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|R
50|$|The name of '{{revision}}ist' {{stems from}} the demands by these Zionists for a revision of the Zionist Organization's policies and its leadership under Chaim Weizmann, {{as well as the}} elected Jewish leadership in Palestine.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{following}} diploma thesis is the German minority in Czechoslovakia between the two world wars. The Czech Germans at this time played the specific role of a non-state actor of international relations; they became an instrument to dismantle the first Czechoslovak Republic. The Sudeten German question served in the diplomatic game {{as a test of}} the international power constellation in Central Europe at that time. Therefore my thesis is a case study dealing with situations where a non-state actor, in this case a national minority, can destabilize the international system, here Versailles, in certain international contexts and under certain conditions. The Czechs and Germans have been living together and managing one territory for centuries. Unfortunately, the combination of indecisive Czechoslovak politicians, the laws disadvantaging minorities, the harsh impact of the economic crisis in the Sudetenland and the geopolitical demands of neighboring Germany resulted in the separatist efforts of the Sudeten Germans. The aim of the thesis is to clarify the circumstances that led to the international interest in the Sudeten German question, in the presence of Nazi Germany, which controlled and supported these efforts. In this story, victorious powers have also played their part, which, by their <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement,</b> have {{come to terms with the}} German rules of the game and helped the outbreak of the Second World War...|$|R

25|$|Smith {{has argued}} that the mutinies were akin to labour strikes and could be considered, at least partly, {{political}} in nature. The soldiers demanded more leave and better food and objected to the use of colonial workers on the home front. They were also deeply concerned about the welfare of their families. The rather subdued repression, according to Smith, was part of the Pétain <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement.</b> Concurrently, that policy saved the appearance of absolute authority exercised by the French high command.|$|E

50|$|Beena Kak {{was thus}} {{elected to the}} Rajasthan Legislative Assembly from the Sumerpur {{constituency}} and served as an MLA from 1985 to 1990. As expected, she lost the election of 1990; the Congress party lost badly everywhere, and the BJP formed the government in Rajasthan state. However, in 1993, that BJP ministry was dismissed by the Congress-ruled government of India after the Babri Masjid demolition took place. Fresh elections were held and the Congress party benefitted from the consolidation of minority votes and blatant <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> minority <b>appeasement,</b> <b>of</b> which the wanton dismissal of the democratically elected government was but one example. Beena Kak was re-elected, to serve again during 1993-98 as an MLA. She managed to get re-elected in 1998, lost the election of 2003, but won again in 2008, all from the same Sumerpur constituency. In 2013, she lost her seat to the BJP by a huge margin of 42,643 votes.|$|R
25|$|Compared to {{the short}} {{appointments}} of his predecessors, Hu Zongxian remained in power until 1563.

5000|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Spanish, the valley was visited and may have been {{occupied}} by Chiricahua Apache. Beginning in about 1775, the Mexican government promoted a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> Indian <b>appeasement</b> that reduced hostilities. By the early 1800s {{there were a number of}} Mexican rancheros in the area that managed thousands of cattle on the open range. [...] As a result of the Mexican Revolution, the settlers in the northern regions lost the government's protection. Apaches stole or killed most of the cattle, and the settlers who didn't returned to the interior of Mexico were killed. By about 1840 the only evidence of their former presence were some ruins and a few herds of wild cattle. The California Gold Rush that began in 1849 drew a large number of people through the area, but by this time only the Apache occupied the area.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his books}} A Devil's Chaplain (2003) and The God Delusion (2006), {{ethologist}} Richard Dawkins used the teapot as an analogy {{of an argument}} against what he termed [...] "agnostic conciliation", a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> intellectual <b>appeasement</b> that allows for philosophical domains that concern exclusively religious matters. Science has no way of establishing the existence or non-existence of a god. Therefore, according to the agnostic conciliator, {{because it is a}} matter of individual taste, belief and disbelief in a supreme being are deserving of equal respect and attention. Dawkins presents the teapot as a reductio ad absurdum of this position: if agnosticism demands giving equal respect to the belief and disbelief in a supreme being, then it must also give equal respect to belief in an orbiting teapot, since the existence of an orbiting teapot is just as plausible scientifically as the existence of a supreme being.|$|R
5000|$|On March 9, 1969, a {{group of}} Chilean police {{attempted}} to remove {{a group of}} squatters at Puerto Montt, killing ten of them, in {{what has come to}} be called the [...] "Massacre of Puerto Montt." [...] As Minister of the Interior, Pérez had been consulted about what to do with the squatter camp. While no one knows if he ordered police to shoot, he did approve the removal of settlers from the illegal settlement, reversing his government's previous <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> squatter <b>appeasement.</b> It appears that he took this action because an opposition politician from the region, a leader of multiple squatter land-grabs, had recently been elected, thereby politicizing settlements in that area. Police had two encounters with settlers on that day. In the first one the police tear-gassed and stormed the camp, apparently without warning, after having given assurances to the contrary the previous day. The settlers subsequently returned in larger numbers and overwhelmed the police using crude weapons. The police then fired on the group.|$|R
25|$|Chamberlain's <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement</b> {{emerged from}} {{the failure of the}} League of Nations and the failure of {{collective}} security. The League of Nations was set up in the aftermath of World War I in the hope that international cooperation and collective resistance to aggression might prevent another war. Members of the League were entitled to the assistance of other members if they came under attack. The policy of collective security ran in parallel with measures to achieve international disarmament and where possible was to be based on economic sanctions against an aggressor. It appeared to be ineffectual when confronted by the aggression of dictators, notably Germany's Remilitarization of the Rhineland, and Italian leader Benito Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his lifelong}} fame and upper-class origins, Churchill always {{struggled}} to keep his income at a level which would fund his extravagant lifestyle. MPs before 1946 received only a nominal salary (and in fact did not receive anything at all until the Parliament Act 1911) so many had secondary professions from which to earn a living. From his first book in 1898 until his second stint as Prime Minister, Churchill's income while out of office was almost entirely made from writing books and opinion pieces for newspapers and magazines, among them the forthnightly columns {{that appeared in the}} Evening Standard from 1936 warning of the rise of Hitler and the danger of the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeasement.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{authorities}} who {{have examined the}} decisions made in Britain on the <b>appeasement</b> <b>of</b> Europe hardly consider the influence of United States and dominion opinion. Even in the 1960 s the general works thought the dominions worth, at most, one or two lines. D. C. Watt implied dominion responsibility for the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appeasement</b> <b>of</b> Europe, but as Nicholas Mansergh has pointed out this is still an open question. Consideration {{of the influence of}} United States opinion on British policy has seemingly also been stunted by the European orientation of scholars. Several monographs do touch upon the subject. The usual verdict is that Chamberlain ignored United States opinion, cold shouldered any overture that Roosevelt made, and failed to assist in drawing the United States from isolationism. The purpose of this thesis is to reexamine the question {{in the light of the}} new evidence available in the papers of the committee of imperial defence, the cabinet, the cabinet committee on foreign policy, the dominions office, the foreign office, the papers for the prime minister, and the private collections of various participants such as Templewood, Inskip, Vansittart, Zetland, Samuel, Halifax, Simon, Colonel Arthur Murray and Lothian. Some account is attempted of the development of opinion in the United States, In the case of the dominions it was thought necessary to offer a fuller analysis of internal political developments which have not before been considered in relation to the influence of the doninions on British foreign policy. Newspaper reports, political speeches, and parliamentary debates which affected opinion and decisions at the time have been reexamined. [Please see pdf. for full abstract...|$|R
