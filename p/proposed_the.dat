5|$|In the 1970s Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge <b>proposed</b> <b>the</b> {{theory of}} punctuated {{equilibrium}} {{which holds that}} stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time. In 1980 Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez <b>proposed</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis that an impact event {{was responsible for the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup led to a better appreciation of the importance of mass extinction events to the history of life on earth.|$|E
