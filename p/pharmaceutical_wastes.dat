This work looks at <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> as a source of valuable active compounds proposing the use of novel aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) composed of quaternary ammonium compounds and different salts to the extraction of active substances from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes.</b> The phase diagrams of ABS of six quaternary ammonium halides ([N- 2,N- 2,N- 2,N- 2]Br, [N- 2,N- 2,N- 2,N- 2]Cl, [N- 3,N- 3,N- 3,N- 3]Cl, [N- 4,N- 4,N- 4,N- 4]Br and [N- 4,N- 4,N- 4,N- 4]Cl) and three different salts (potassium citrate buffer, potassium carbonate and potassium phosphate buffer) were established at 298 (+/- 1) K. These systems allow the investigation of the influence of the ammonium structure, the salting-out agent, and the pH of the aqueous medium. They were then applied to the extraction of paracetamol that displays an extensive partition towards the ammonium-rich phase. All the studied systems, employing both the model compound and real matrix reveal a great aptitude to recover paracetamol from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes,</b> presenting extraction efficiencies ranging from around 80 % up to 100 %.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{developing}} a sustainable process for the recovery of valuable drugs from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> using ionic liquid (IL) -based aqueous biphasic systems (ABS). Because in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes,</b> excipients represent the major contaminants, the search for selective routes for their elimination is of primordial relevance and for that purpose IL-based ABS were evaluated. The effects of different process parameters, namely the IL nature, pH and mixture composition used in the extraction system, were studied and the process was optimized to maximize the extraction of the antidepressant from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes.</b> Moreover, {{the maximum amount of}} amitriptyline able to be processed using such systems was assessed. The set of ABS investigated herein revealed a high extraction performance, as indicated by the outstanding logarithmic functions of the amitriptilyne partition coefficients ranging from 2. 41 +/- 0. 05 to > 2. 5 and extraction efficiencies between 66 % +/- 1 % and 100 %. The best ABS and conditions were considered in the development of an integrated multi-step purification process. The process here proposed comprises three main stages as follows: the solid-liquid extraction of the antidepressant from ADT 25 pills, its purification using the optimal IL-based ABS and the antidepressant isolation by precipitation with anti-solvent. After the removal of most water insoluble excipients in the first step, with the selected IL-based ABS, it was possible to further eliminate water soluble contaminants. A high capability of extraction and purification, leading to the selective separation of amitriptyline hydrochloride from the main contaminants contained in solid <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> was achieved. Finally, the isolation of the amitriptilyne in a pure state was successfully accomplished through precipitation with the anti-solvent...|$|E

The ibuprofen extraction and isolation from solid <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> is used here {{as a case study}} and an integrated approach comprising the ibuprofen solid-liquid extraction, the removal of the insoluble excipients present in the pills, the target drug recovery and the recycling of the aqueous solutions is proposed. The present work is centred on the optimization of the first (solid-liquid extraction) and third (drug recovery) steps mentioned above. For the solid-liquid extraction step, various ionic liquid aqueous solutions were tested, tetrabutylammonium chloride ([N- 4444]Cl) being adopted to further optimize the process. A solution composed of 45 wt% of [N- 4444]Cl + 5 wt% of citrate buffer + 50 wt% of H 2 O led to the highest ibuprofen extraction efficiency (EEIBU = 97. 92 +/- 2. 65 %) while in the absence of citrate the extraction efficiency was somewhat lower (EEIBU = 93. 53 +/- 0. 62 %). The polishing task was affected by the type of aqueous solution utilized during the solid-liquid extraction step: in the presence of citrate buffer water was not prone to induce significant ibuprofen precipitation (maximum REIBU of 34. 71 +/- 4. 00 %) the aqueous KCl solution being the best option (maximum REIBU of 87. 97 +/- 1. 00 %); when no citrate buffer is used water can be used as an anti-solvent with a maximum REIBU of 91. 60 +/- 0. 19 % while aqueous KCl solutions lead to an REIBU up to 97. 07 +/- 0. 14 %.

The catabolic property of microorganisms to utilize the contaminant as carbon and energy source is conveyed by the genes present in the potential microorganism, which encode for specific enzymes in catabolic pathways. In the present research study, P. aeruginosa was found efficient in assimilating naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy. Hence, the further aim of this research study was to identify the gene responsible for naphthalene biodegradation by PCR-amplification technique.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> are {{in group}} of {{emerging}} contaminants. These materials cannot be removed completely with conventional treatment methods {{of water and}} wastewater. Drug and its metabolites, due to the potential risks toxic and toxicity potential to humans and environment should {{be removed from the}} water resources. In this study, Acetaminophen photo catalytic removal from aqueous solutions was investigated by X zeolite modified with TiO 2 (TiO 2 / X zeolite). Methods: This study was experimental and carried out on a laboratory scale. To remove acetaminophen from aqueous solution, TiO 2 /X zeolite photo-catalyst under UV-C radiation (UV/TiO 2 -X process) was used. Acetaminophen concentration of soluble was measured using by spectrophotometer UV/Vis in λmax ~ 243 nm. The optimal conditions of pH, catalyst dosage, acetaminophen initial concentration and reaction time were determined and also acetaminophen disintegration reaction kinetics was studied by TiO 2 -X catalyst. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Results: The results indicated that maximum removal of acetaminophen(95. 45 %) was related to 1 mg/L of initial concentration in the neutral pH and a catalyst concentration of 500 mg/L after 75 min of start of photo-catalytic reaction. By decreasing concentration of acetaminophen its removal rates will increase. The Acetaminophen degradation kinetic with UV/TiO 2 -X process followed a pseudo-first order reaction with rate constants of   0. 01446 min- 1. Conclusion: The Photocatalytic method of UV/TiO 2 -X to remove acetaminophen from aqueous solutions has a high efficiency and is recommende...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{interest}} {{over the}} levels of pharmaceuticals detected in the environment {{has led to the}} need for new approaches to manage their emissions. Inappropriate disposal of unused and waste medicines and release from manufacturing plants are believed to be important pathways for pharmaceuticals entering the environment. In situ treatment technologies, which can be used on-site in pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, and at manufacturing plants, might provide a solution. In this study we explored the use of Pyropure, a microscale combined pyrolysis and gasification in situ treatment system for destroying <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes.</b> This involved selecting 17 pharmaceuticals, including 14 of the most thermally stable compounds currently in use and three of high environmental concern to determine the technology’s success in waste destruction. Treatment simulation studies were done on three different waste types and liquid, solid, and gaseous emissions from the process were analyzed for parent pharmaceutical and known active transformation products. Gaseous emissions were also analyzed for NOx, particulates, dioxins, furans, and metals. Results suggest that Pyropure is an effective treatment process for pharmaceutical wastes: over 99 % of each study pharmaceutical was destroyed by the system without known active transformation products being formed during the treatment process. Emissions of the other gaseous air pollutants were within acceptable levels. Future uptake of the system, or similar in situ treatment approaches, by clinics, pharmacists, and manufacturers could help to reduce {{the levels of}} pharmaceuticals in the environment and reduce the economic and environmental costs of current waste management practices...|$|E

Further, {{to look at the}} bi-directional relationship between antibiotic use and environment. Methods: The study was a qualitative explorative interview study, analysed using conventional content analysis. It was conducted in Orissa, India. Data were collected by face to face semi structured interview. The interviews were tape recorded and transcribed into Oriya, then translated in to English. Each paragraph or sentence was coded. Similar codes were clustered together and collapsed into sub categories and categories. The main themes were allowed to emerge, based on the relationship between categories. Findings: The main finding of the study was mishandling and abuse of antibiotics in patients as well as at professional level due to weak implementation of legislation, which appears to be the major cause of antibacterial agent resistance. Incomplete course or dose due to poverty in rural area and self medication in urban area are more common. The study also showed that climatic factors, pollution and population density are the major ecological factors which influence antibiotic prescriptions. Another major finding of this study was that, due to improper disposal system of pharmaceuticals; antibiotics are contaminating air, water and terrains which can cause major risk to aquatic and grazing animals. Conclusion: This study emphasises the need for comprehensive actions including information, training, legislation and education at all levels of drug delivery system to rationalize antibiotic use by improving prescribing pattern and creating awareness among consumers. Proper disposal of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> is required to prevent the contamination of environment from pharmaceutical pollutants.

However, there seems to exist incongruence between the attitude and actual behaviour. Women and elderly people show more sustainable behaviour regarding <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste.</b> Being informed about the possibility to bring medication back to the pharmacy was a significant predictor for sustainable behaviour regarding <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste.</b> The awareness of the harmful effects is also a significant predictor for sustainable behaviour.

30|$|Dyes {{are used}} as {{coloring}} agents in many industries like textile, plastic, cosmetic, food and paper [1, 2]. They generate effluents containing various types of dyes and pigments. Such effluents are frequently discharged into natural water bodies with and without proper treatment. Dye effluents are characterized by fluctuating pH with high suspended solids and oxygen demand [3]. It also retains the color even after conventional treatments such as biological, adsorption, coagulation, floatation and membrane filtration [4]. Dyes are usually difficult to biodegrade. A large degree of aromaticity present in modern dye molecules increases stability, and conventional biological treatments are ineffective for decolorization and degradation [5, 6]. Furthermore, a large fraction of dyes is adsorbed on the sludge and is not degraded. Ozonation and chlorination are also used {{for the removal of}} certain dyes, but at slower rates [7, 8]. They often have high operating costs and limited effect on carbon content [7]. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are potential to overcome many of these limitations. Among different AOPs, Fenton process {{is one of the most}} powerful oxidative treatments operated at room temperature and pressure. Fenton’s reagent is a mixture of Fe 2 + and H 2 O 2 generating •OH radicals. Fe 2 + initiate and catalyze H 2 O 2 decomposition resulting in the generation of •OH through a complex reaction sequence in an aqueous solution. •OH radicals formed thus cause unselective oxidation of various types of pollutants such as textile dyes, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> and other complex organic pollutants in a short reaction time [8]. Hydroxylated and carboxylic derivatives are transformed into H 2 O and CO 2 [9]. Moreover, •OH is converted to OH− forming Fe 3 + in Fenton reaction. The rate constant of this reaction is a few orders higher in magnitude than the Fenton reaction. Fe 2 + is regenerated in small quantity yielding hydroperoxyl radical (•OOH). •OH scavenging by H 2 O 2 at pH <  3 could form •OOH of low oxidation potential (1.7  V vs. SHE) [10].|$|E

While these concentrations are seemingly low in comparison to most of the effective doses for pharmaceuticals, very little is known about chronic low level exposure to these drugs in humans or other animals. Humans will be exposed through their drinking water or bioaccumulation in the food chain. For animals, fish are the main concern for pollutants in an aqueous environment. Millions of people rely on fish heavy diets and could be exposed low levels of a variety of pharmaceuticals by eating. Therefore, it is important to develop materials for sequestering these pollutants. One of the most common methods for pollutant trapping is via anion exchange. Most anion exchange mediums are designed for cationic exchange. However, a large amount of these <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> exist in an anionic form. A variety of materials exhibit anion exchange properties, such as, organically modified resins, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), or metal organic frameworks (MOFs). We are investigating a new class of cationic materials called layered metal hydroxides (LMHs). They consist of cationic inorganic layers balanced by a variety of organic and inorganic anions. The inorganic layers are exceptionally thermally and chemically stable making them ideal candidates for coupling to raw industrial waste waters.

Shape evolution and phase transformation of FeNi NPs obtained by changing their composition is demonstrated. It has been shown that the shape evolution of NPs from concave cube to truncated sphere occurs concurrently with the phase transformation from bcc to fcc. In-situ formation of a very thin Ni-doped FeOOH outer layer and NiFe 2 O 4 intermediate layer on the skin of the NPs is observed, the latter of which passivates the surface and dramatically enhances the air stability. Furthermore, bimetallic FeNi concave nanocubes with high Miller index planes have been obtained through controlled triggering of the different growth modes of Fe and Ni. Taking advantage of the higher activity of the high-index planes, mono-dispersed concave nanocages have been fabricated by introducing a material-independent electroleaching process. With the high-index facets exposed, these concave nanocubes and nanocages are found to be 10 and 100 -fold, respectively, more active toward electrochemical detection of 4 -aminophenol than cuboctahedrons which provides a label-free sensing approach to monitoring toxins in water and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes.</b> In addition, the shape-dependent magnetic properties of a bimetallic system have been studied for FeNi NPs with well-defined concave cubic and octahedron shapes. The alloy composition was chosen to be close to that of Invar FeNi alloys (35 % Ni content) but with concurrent presence of both bcc and fcc phases, in order to investigate the role of phase combination in controlling the magnetic properties. The role of the two phases in governing the magnetic properties has also been studied for both bulk and nanoalloys by large-scale density function theory (DFT) calculations using Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP, Version 5. 2), which provides a new complementary approach to understanding the magnetic properties of alloy materials. To extend the aforementioned method to other hybrid and bimetallic systems, FePt NPs with different compositions (Fe 25 Pt 75, Fe 30 Pt 70, Fe 35 Pt 65) have been synthesized and their chemical sensing investigated for the electro-oxidation of vitamin C. The FePt alloy NPs are found to be superior catalysts for vitamin C electro-oxidation than Pt NPs and are significantly more selective for the detection of vitamin C against other common interference species, including dopamine, citric acid, uric acid, glucose, and NaCl. Enhancement in sensor performance {{can be attributed to the}} increase in specific surface area due to reduction of nanocrystallite size and to modification in the Pt electronic structure as a result of nanoalloying. We also synthesize bimetallic FeAu, FePd, and AuPt NPs and investigate their electrochemical properties for As(III) detection. The synergistic effect of alloying with Fe leads to better performance for Fe-noble metal NPs (Au, Pt, Pd) than pristine noble metal NPs (without Fe alloying), with the best performance found for FePt NPs. The selectivity of the sensor has also been tested in the presence of a large amount of Cu(II), acting as the most detrimental interfering ion for As detection. The versatility of the method for hybridization of different components is demonstrated by synthesizing size-specific hybrid NPs based on Fe-biomolecules. We have chosen an anticancer peptide (p 53 p, MW 1. 8 kDa) and an common enzyme (glucose oxidase, MW 160 kDa) as model molecules to illustrate the versatility of the method towards different types of molecules over a large size range. We show that the electrostatic interaction for complex formation of metal hydroxide ion with the partially charged side of the biomolecule in the solution is the key to hybridization of metal-biomolecule materials to form complexes as the building blocks. These hybrid NPs with controllable sizes ranging from 30 nm to 3. 5 μm are found to exhibit superparamagnetic behavior, which is a big challenge for particles in this size regime. As an example of greatly improved properties and functionality of the new hybrid material, in-vitro toxicity assessment of Fe-glucose oxidase hybrid NPs shows no adverse effect, while the Fe-p 53 p hybrid NPs are found to selectively bind to cancer cells. The present work therefore definitely demonstrates the general applicability of the hybridization method for synthesis of metallic hybrid NPs with magnetic properties for different applications, including chemical sensing, magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents, and targeted drug delivery carriers...|$|E

Introduction: There {{has been a significant}} rise in the use of medical pharmaceuticals to combat disease and ill‑health across the WHO European Region. However, global estimates suggest that over half of all medicines are prescribed, dispensed or sold inappropriately, and that half of all patients fail to take them as directed. As well as impacting negatively on individual health, and resulting in extensive resource <b>waste,</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> use – and “misuse” – can have significant adverse repercussions on wildlife and ecosystems, particularly when unused medicines are disposed of inappropriately. Methods: This paper examines the rise in medicine (mis) use, and considers what is known about <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> in the environment. While technological responses to alleviate the impacts of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> exist, they are costly and complex, and do not address the root causes of the problem. Results: This paper demonstrates how incorporating a cultural perspective can help us to understand not just how medicines can be more thoughtfully disposed of, but why particular medicines are administered to, and consumed or disposed of by, particular population groups in the first place. Conclusion: Understanding the ways that people’s perceptions, beliefs, and social norms and values interrelate with medicine prescribing, consumption and disposal practice is key to alleviating medicine misuse...|$|R
40|$|The {{formulation}} {{and implementation}} of regulatory standards for the ultimate disposal and reuse of transformed products of antibiotic drugs and solvents have been a pending issue in the <b>waste</b> management of <b>pharmaceutical</b> industries especially in the developing countries like India. A case study has been identified and the current issues {{in one of the}} major pharmaceutical industry (manufacturing cephalosporin drugs) located in Chennai, India, has been discussed for the possible implementation of anaerobically transformed intermediates of anti-biotic <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> sludge. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of bioaugmentation on the convertibility of anaerobically transformed intermediates of anti-biotic <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> sludge into residuals and biocompost. Cephalosporin is a common name refers to cephradine (C 16 H 19 N 3 O 4 S) and cephalexin (C 16 H 17 N 3 O 4 S. H 2 O) (British Pharmacopoeia, 1980). Based on the critical examination of results the industry is looking for the alternatives of either direct disposal of 7 -amino- 3 -deacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7 -ADCA) and Phenyl acetic acid or for further degradation and disposal, which will essentially require additional cost and maintenance. The present regulatory standard implemented in India does no...|$|R
