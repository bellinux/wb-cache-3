500|$|... "It’s {{about me}} and my ex-boyfriend, and our tumultuous, {{psychotic}} relationship. We’d act weird, like drug addicts with each other, calling {{and seeing each other}} all the time. I was in love at the time, and (the song) sounds <b>pretty</b> <b>happy,</b> but it’s {{a little bit of a}} dark song. You’re so obsessed with somebody you start acting like a weirdo. … I write about falling in love, being in love, breaking up because he’s a loser, being heartbroken. I not only sing about getting rowdy, but love." ...|$|E

We all hopped upon that cloud, and the cloud took us away , and we made this album, and we landed when it was done." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim, Jr.: [...] "I was really <b>pretty</b> <b>happy</b> with the album.

500|$|Wayne Scholes, {{owner of}} the Telford Tigers (currently in the English Premier League) has stated that his {{organisation}} doesn't have any immediate plans to make the step up, but has not ruled {{out the possibility of}} joining the EIHL in the future, saying that “We have had conversations with the Elite League before but they have to invite you. You can’t approach them. It {{is one of those things}} where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right now we are <b>pretty</b> <b>happy</b> where we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, my love, if {{she likes}} to go. You had better ask her--Ah, dear! dear! I forgot--I mean, write on her slate. It's so hard to {{remember}} she's deaf and dumb, when one sees her sitting there looking so <b>pretty</b> and <b>happy.</b> She seems to like the cake. Remind me, Emmy, to tie some up for her in paper before she goes away." ...|$|R
5000|$|This roughly {{translates}} to English as [...] "A Greek philosopher once wrote ... The best fate is to {{never have been}} born, second is to be born but die young, and the most unfortunate of all is to reach old age. This feels <b>pretty</b> right: <b>Happy</b> are those who die young." [...] Soe attributed the statement, which echoes similar comments from Friedrich Nietzsche, to an anonymous Greek philosopher.|$|R

500|$|Chellas [...] "had {{this great}} idea, this {{elliptical}} thing, which we really loaded up with cues {{so that you}} would know at the end that Don was too late. Seeing Joan in there, taking the necklace off, and Joan's mother taking Don's hat into the room where Joan was, and then Joan putting on the green robe and coming out, seeing that behind-the-scenes moment the second time really cemented it." [...] Weiner said this allowed them to [...] "show Joan going through with it 24 hours beforehand, and then show Don giving this pitch that the audience is convinced is a great pitch. Then you slowly dissolve back {{to the reality of}} Don coming in [...] <b>pretty</b> <b>happy,</b> Joan asking how it went, and Roger having this dead response—'it was one of his good ones'—and Don wondering why Joan's not more excited." ...|$|E
500|$|Israel entered one triathlete {{to compete}} at the Games, {{signifying}} the nation's Olympic debut in the sport.

On the topic {{of being the first}} Israeli triathlete at the Olympics, he said [...] "Records can be broken but being the first one, that can never be taken away. I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>happy</b> about that." [...] He also said that he did not expect to qualify for Rio, and that he expected his first Olympic qualification to be for Tokyo.

60|$|In {{the kitchen}} of Conrad Marais's {{homestead}} Gertie stood that day, busily employed {{in the construction of}} a plum-pudding, with which she meant to regale Hans and Charlie on their return.

2500|$|Dave Rat, the band's sound {{engineer}} since February 1991, announced that following the band's show of January 22, 2017 {{he would no}} longer be working with the band. [...] "I truly love Flea, Anthony, Chad, Josh and all my dear and close friends I consider family both on the road now and those that have moved on to other adventures over the years.

2500|$|A fast bowler will {{typically}} use the leg cutter as {{a variation}} ball {{as it is}} most effective when it surprises the batsman. The leg cutter action can also produce a significantly slower ball with little obvious change in the bowler's arm speed, making the delivery doubly deceptive. On the other hand, the lack of pace of the delivery may be disadvantageous. Former Australian captain Ian Chappell described Jeff Thomson's leg cutter thus: [...] "He had this leg cutter, and you were usually <b>pretty</b> <b>happy</b> to see it, because it meant that the ball wasn't coming at your head at 95 miles an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fancy. It's {{always been}} one of my dreams to live near a brook. I never {{expected}} I would, though. Dreams don't often come true, do they? Wouldn't it be nice if they did?

6000|$|Emmy, quite at ease, as {{this was}} her husband's only cause of disquiet, took his hand, and with a radiant face and smile began to warble that stanza from the {{favourite}} song of [...] "Wapping Old Stairs," [...] in which the heroine, after rebuking her Tom for inattention, promises [...] "his trousers to mend, and his grog too to make," [...] if he will be constant and kind, and not forsake her. [...] "Besides," [...] she said, after a pause, during which she looked as <b>pretty</b> and <b>happy</b> as any young woman need, [...] "isn't two thousand pounds an immense deal of money, George?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Dzierzon's {{questioning}} of papal infallibility {{caused him to}} be retired him from the priesthood in 1869. This disagreement, along with his public engagement in local politics, led to his 1873 excommunication. In 1884 he moved back to Lowkowitz, settling in the hamlet An der Grenze, (Granice Łowkowskie). Of his new home, he wrote:In every direction, one has a broad and pleasant view, and I am <b>pretty</b> <b>happy</b> here, despite the isolation, as I am always close to my beloved bees — which, if one's soul be receptive to {{the works of the}} Almighty and the wonders of nature, can transform even a desert into a paradise. From 1873 to 1902 Dzierzon was in contact with the Old Catholic Church, [...] but in April 1905 he was reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
2500|$|Rodney Hogg was {{interested}} in touring South Africa. He met with Ali Bacher in London during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. [...] "I was pretty much in from day one," [...] said Hogg. I was in my mid-30s, and {{the idea was that}} the tour wouldn't happen for another year or two. Had it been on in 1983, I'd have been less interested as I was still in the Test side and doing well at the time.... I was <b>pretty</b> <b>happy</b> with the money on offer. My career was pretty much over by then. Fast bowlers don't last forever. Prime minister [...] Hawke called us traitors. I thought that if it was okay for Hawke to trade with South Africa, it was okay for me to go and play cricket there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On a {{publicity}} tour for Past Mortem in 2004, Elton mused {{on the high}} school reunion theme and his own drama college reunion: We'd had a very happy time all together, so there were no old scores to be settled really, we'd been a <b>pretty</b> <b>happy</b> bunch. And yet one person, who'd been a bit of a golden boy – he certainly went out with a girl I was besotted and unrequitedly in love with – he came up and he said, 'Why did you come? Was it to show off?' That really surprised me, that anyone would think that ... he came kind of carrying my agenda. It was weird. I hasten to add I didn't think my life to be more successful than anybody else's. If you're happy and honest and fulfilled in what you do, then you're having a successful life.|$|E
40|$|I {{am the one}} {{my friends}} call the creepy one. My art is not <b>pretty</b> or <b>happy.</b> It is an {{expression}} of my inner feelings and thoughts. I don 2 ̆ 7 t make pretty pictures because I find them void of true emotional substance. I developed my point of view when I photographed my eyes, which have become a consistent theme in my work. Eyes are the window to the soul and the key to my inner emotions. I have since expanded my work to include other images. I continue to seek ways to help my viewers experience my work both emotionally and visually. I want them to see the world through my eyes...|$|R

In a twitter video posted by Rodman, his agent Chris Volo said, [...] "He's the only person on the planet that has the uniqueness, the unbelievable privilege of being friends with President Trump and Marshal Kim Jong Un." [...] Rodman went on to say in the video that he wanted to bring peace and [...] "open doors between both countries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not Betty--it is I! Good morning, dear aunt! I {{hope you}} slept well?" [...] cries a voice which made old Bernstein start on her pillow. It {{was the voice}} of Lady Maria, who drew the {{curtains}} aside, and dropped her aunt a low curtsey. Lady Maria looked very <b>pretty,</b> rosy, and <b>happy.</b> And with the little surprise incident at her appearance through Madame Bernstein's curtains, I think we may bring this chapter to a close.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR FRIEND,--I am {{back again}} here, as brown as a berry with sun, {{and in good}} form. I have been and gone and lost my portmanteau, with Walt Whitman in it {{and a lot of}} notes.

She is getting along very well indeed.|$|E

In theory he didn't much care; let the dead bury their dead. But here, at the graveside, he had found himself actually sobbing. Poor Emily, they had been <b>pretty</b> <b>happy</b> once. Now she was lying at the bottom of a seven-foot hole. And here was Grego complaining that he couldn't go to the Eton and Harrow match.|$|E
60|$|Of the {{youngest}} girl, Katie, {{it is not}} necessary at present to say much. At this time she was but thirteen years of age, and was a <b>happy,</b> <b>pretty,</b> romping child. She gave fair promise to be at any rate equal to her sisters in beauty, and in mind was quick and intelligent. Her great taste was for boating, and the romance of her life consisted in laying out ideal pleasure-grounds, and building ideal castles in a little reedy island or ait which lay out in the Thames, a few perches from the drawing-room windows.|$|R
