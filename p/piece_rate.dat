This paper uses cross-country European data to provide among the first broad survey evidence of a strong link between <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and workplace injury. Despite unusually good controls for workplace hazards, job characteristics and worker effort, workers on <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> suffer a large 5 percentage point greater likelihood of injury. As injury rates are typically not controlled for when estimating the premium to <b>piece</b> <b>rates,</b> this raises the specter that {{a portion of the}} return to <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> reflects a compensating wage differential for risk of injury. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{relative}} {{performance evaluation}} via tournaments to absolute performance evaluation via <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> when agents are heterogeneous ex post, {{to make the}} point that agent heterogeneity compromises the insurance function of tournaments. In particular, we show that the more heterogeneous agents are the less insurance can be offered through tournaments and the less dominant tournaments are over <b>piece</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, absolute performance <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> should be preferred when agents are highly heterogeneous. However, even with heterogeneous agents, tournaments become more desirable when the number of agents or the uncertainty about the common shock increases sufficiently. <b>piece</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{literature on the}} comparison of tournaments and <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> as alternative incentive schemes {{has focused on the}} case of unlimited liability. However, in practice real workers' wealth is typically restricted. Therefore, this paper compares both schemes under the assumption of limited liability. The results show that if the cost function is suffciently convex, first-best effort will be more likely implemented under <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> than under tournaments. Moreover, if first-best implementation is not achieved and workers earn positive rents, efforts and profits will be larger for <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> than for tournaments given suffciently convex costs. While tournaments offer a partial insurance due to their fixed prizes, <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> may not work any longer if potential losses become prohibitively high. Finally, if risk is suffciently high, <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> will dominate tournaments despite the partial insurance effect of tournament compensation. Since effort costs and risk may depend on an individual worker's characteristics, on the characteristics of his job and on his hierarchical position, these findings have important implications for the choice of incentive schemes and the allocation of workers in firmsincentives, limited liability, <b>piece</b> <b>rates,</b> rank-order tournaments...|$|R

5000|$|Frederick Winslow Taylor {{was one of}} {{the main}} champions of the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> system in the late 19th century. Although there were many <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> systems in use, they were largely resented and manipulative. One of the most {{influential}} tenets of Scientific Management was Taylor's popularization of the [...] "differential <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> system", which relied on accurate measurements of productivity rates to create a [...] "standard" [...] production output target. Those who were not able to meet the target suffered a penalty and were likely fired. Taylor spread this in published papers in 1895, and the timed <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> system gave birth to creating modern cost control, and as a result, modern corporate organization.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} aging on productivity using piece-rate earnings {{as a proxy for}} worker output. Our data contain the population of Finnish blue collar workers in 61 different industries during 1990 - 2002. A unique feature of the data is that we can observe the exact hours worked on <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and on fixed time rates as well as earnings under both performance schemes. We account for the selection into <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> by using firm-level changes in pay systems as instruments for the probability of working on <b>piece</b> <b>rates.</b> A subset of workers also receive both <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and time rates within the same quarter. For these workers, we can directly compare the age profile of hourly earnings under <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and fixed rates. The results indicate that productivity increases with age until age 40 after which it stays roughly constant. Wage growth is faster than productivity growth for young workers but after age 40 both wages and productivity grow approximately at the same rate...|$|R
40|$|We compare welfare {{effects of}} tournaments and <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> in {{contracts}} with heterogeneous ability agents and demonstrate that tournaments that mix players of unequal abilities create a league composition effect. When leagues are fixed {{and the time}} horizon sufficiently long, <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> improve welfare over tournaments. Using contract production data for broiler chickens, we estimate the variances of growers' abilities, common production shock, and grower's idiosyncratic shock. Growers' abilities are heterogeneous, and common production shocks are significant. Leagues in broiler tournaments disintegrate rapidly over time, suggesting that tournament contracts offer more welfare than <b>piece</b> <b>rates.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Why {{are women}} disproportionately on <b>piece</b> <b>rates?</b> We {{investigate}} three possible explanations: (1) Women {{are more likely}} to be on <b>piece</b> <b>rates,</b> because they have a shorter expected tenure than men. (2) A greater demand for flexibility between work and home attracts women to work place technologies suitable for variable pay based on individual performance. (3) Women prefer <b>piece</b> <b>rates,</b> because they are subject to less wage discrimination when objective performance measures are available. The weight of our empirical evidence supports the third hypothesis. The unexplained gender wage gap is substantially smaller in the piece-rate regime than in the time-wage regime.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{research on}} method of pay and wages compares those paid <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> with those {{paid by the}} hour, and finds (as predicted by the theory) that those paid <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> earn more.

An extension of the standard theory predicts that those paid <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> would have the highest earnings, and those paid standard rates the lowest, with merit pay an "in between" status. The evidence, however, from the Industry Wage Surveys is that those under merit pay receive lower wages {{than those in the}} other two groups. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{occupational}} injury surveillance study (record study {{of five years}} duration) was conducted involving the workers of a fertilizer producing industry in eastern India to assess whether the risk of occupational accidents in temporary <b>piece</b> <b>rated</b> workers was higher {{in comparison to the}} permanent time rated workers. At the same time, to collect the personal details of the workers who have worked in the industry in the study period, an interview was also conducted. Mean age of temporary <b>piece</b> <b>rated</b> workers and permanent time rated workers were (35. 9 Â± 12. 5) and (35. 3 Â± 11. 4) respectively. Distribution of other variables like nature of work, level of education, experience, habits were also very similar between the two worker groups. Accident incidence rate, accident frequency rate and accident severity rate were found to be significantly higher in temporary <b>piece</b> <b>rated</b> workers. This difference was more prominent in case of time-loss accidents than in no timeloss accidents. Relative risk has varied from 2. 3 to 18. 0 in case of time-loss accidents. In case of no time-loss accidents, it has varied from 1. 1 to 2. 6. When relative risk is considered after taking both types of accidents together, it has ranged from 1. 2 to 3. 5.
