50|$|The new Lockheed {{cargo plane}} design possessed {{a range of}} , takeoff {{capability}} from short and unprepared strips, {{and the ability to}} fly with one engine shut down. Fairchild, North American, Martin, and Northrop declined to participate. The remaining five companies tendered a total of ten designs: Lockheed two, Boeing one, Chase three, Douglas three, and Airlifts Inc. one. The contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two Lockheed (<b>preliminary</b> project <b>designation</b> L-206) proposals and a four-turboprop Douglas design.|$|R
50|$|The {{second and}} {{confirmed}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>designation</b> was in 1999, when NCDOT submitted {{a request to}} AASHTO to designate 32.36 mi of US 1 from I-40, in Raleigh, heading westerly to the future US 421 (Sanford Bypass) interchange, in Sanford. On April 17, 1999, the request was disapproved by the committee and has since been dropped.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2012, NASA {{announced}} that astronomers at the University of Central Florida, using the Spitzer Space Telescope, strongly {{believe they have}} observed a second planet. This strong candidate planet was given the <b>preliminary</b> <b>designation</b> UCF-1.01, after the University of Central Florida. It was measured to have a radius of around two thirds that of Earth and, assuming an Earth-like density of 5.5 g/cm3, was estimated to have a mass of 0.3 times that of Earth and a surface gravity of around two thirds that of Earth. It orbits at 0.0185 AU from the star, every 1.3659 days. The astronomers also believe they have found some evidence for an additional planet candidate, UCF-1.02, which is of a similar size, though with only one detected transit its orbital period is unknown. If these planets are confirmed in the future, they may be given the designations [...] "Gliese 436 c" [...] and [...] "Gliese 436 d".|$|E

40|$|Many {{communities}} in Canada and the U. S. {{are feeling the}} effect of too many cars travelling at too high speeds. Such traffic has a profound negative effect on street life. To reduce this effect municipalities are turning to traffic calming. Traffic calming {{is a combination of}} policies and physical measures that reduce the negative effects of motorized vehicle use in a community. The key to successful traffic calming lies in changing the design and role of the street in such a fashion that drivers will want to slow down. Depending on the problem on the street, a wide range of traffic calming measures can be applied. The selection of these measures is best done by public consensus. Traffic calming is community-based planning and public participation is essential to its success. The process begins with the establishment of a community-based working group, followed by a thorough analysis of issues and concerns. This may be done by surveys or walk-abouts in the community. With participation of the working group, the problem is then defined, planning principles developed, and a <b>preliminary</b> “traffic calming <b>designation</b> ” is applied to the streets, akin to the traditional street classifications. This information is then presented at a public meetin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} Portable Examination Attendance System (PEAS) based on RFlD technology. With these devices, we hope we can reduce the risks of attendance losses due to traditional procedures that required each of students to write the personal and subject information {{on a sheet of}} paper. Unfortunately, the problem might occurred during the examination officers collect the attendance paper especially when there are more than one section and different subject attended to take the final examination at the respective time. The purpose of Portable Examination Attendance System is to assist the examination officer to perform and validate the student attendance status when required at anytime and everywhere. The main aim of this project is track record the student attendance using the contactless student card ID through RFID readers that operates at 13. 56 Mhz. This paper also describe on previous research and the developing process which involves 5 main phase including <b>preliminary</b> investigation, analysis, <b>designation,</b> implementation, maintenance and testing. The database system is designed using the Microsoft Access containing the student information and installed in the Portable Digital Assistant (PDA) that directly connected from the card reader. The system is also providing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) as the interface between user and database system...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of the first new ultra-cool brown dwarf (BDs) found with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The object’s <b>preliminary</b> <b>designation</b> is WISEPC J 045853. 90 + 643451. 9. Follow-up spectroscopy with the LUCIFER instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope indicates that it is a very late-type T dwarf with a spectral type approximately equal to T 9. Fits to an IRTF/SpeX 0. 8 – 2. 5 μm spectrum to the model atmospheres of Marley and Saumon indicate an effective temperature of approximately 600 K as well as the presence of vertical mixing in its atmosphere. The new BD is easily detected by WISE, with a signal-to-noise ratio of ∼ 36 at 4. 6 μm. Current estimates place it at a distance of 6 – 10 pc. This object represents the first in what will likely be hundreds of nearby BDs found by WISE that will be suitable for follow-up observations, including those with the James Web...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe propose in {{this article}} a color image {{segmentation}} technique based on an optimization of the Mean Shift method. It consists in classifying clusters of data points of a digital image, {{it does not require}} any <b>preliminary</b> <b>designation</b> of the number of classes and of their centers. The Mean Shift method applied to a digital color image creates a new image made up of aggregates of points belonging to a finished number of color classes. The complexity of this method based on a global approach of the image is in O(NxN), N being the number of pixels of the image. Our idea consists in applying a change of scale to the image to be segmented, to reduce the quantity of information and, in using a median filter to decrease the number of colors to minimize the complexity of the latter. The comparative study which we present shows that the optimization which we proposed gives better, reliable results than the classic use of the Mean Shift method...|$|E
40|$|During {{remediation}} {{activities at}} a Hanford Site burial ground, a large cache of drummed waste was unexpectedly encountered. Most of the drums contained depleted uranium metal chips submerged in oil. A combination of attributes including multiple phases, pyrophoriticy, toxicity, and radioactivity presented complex and costly treatment/disposal {{issues that were}} not addressed through any established Hanford Site processes. A safe, environmentally responsible, and cost-effective path forward for treatment of the drums that had been, and would be, excavated from the 618 - 4 Burial Ground was needed. To establish the framework for investigation of potential treatment and disposal options, a preliminary waste designation was prepared. Because there was a potential for separation of the phases prior to treatment, the <b>preliminary</b> <b>designation</b> considered the individual liquid and solid phases {{as well as the}} combined phases of the whole drum. An analysis of applicable regulatory issues was then performed to help determine the performance criteria for treatment/disposal methods. A technology alternatives baseline was prepared {{as a starting point for}} identification of potentia...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{in vitro}} {{gastrointestinal}} extraction {{to assess the}} oral bioaccessibility of 7 potentially toxic elements (PTEs) from soil derived from an urban recreational site, has been assessed. The pseudo-total concentration of the 7 PTEs was determined using microwave digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The bioaccessible fraction was determined and the data compared to the pseudo-total concentrations to determine % bioaccessibility. A generic quantitative risk assessment (GQRA) was undertaken on the pseudo-total PTE concentration of the site by comparing the values with soil guideline (SGV) or generic assessment criteria (GAC) using the residential land use scenario. Based on the GQRA, concentrations of 3 of the PTEs investigated within the soils could present a potential risk to site users. Consideration of receptor exposure and bioaccessibility data allowed a more considered approach to human-health risk assessment at this site. Although the bioaccessibility data did not significantly alter the sites <b>preliminary</b> <b>designation</b> as contaminated (As and Pb concentrations exceeded the GAC even in the in vitro extracts) bioaccessibility data are clearly an additional tool towards furthering our understanding of human-health risk at contaminated sites and {{have the potential to}} act as a pragmatic decision-support tool...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} {{mosaic of}} Ida shows a highly irregular body (roughly 56 km long), heavily covered with craters, with many interesting geological features, including grooves, blocks, chutes, dark-floored craters, and crater chains. A satellite of Ida, with a <b>preliminary</b> <b>designation</b> of 1993 (243) 1, {{was discovered in}} orbit around Ida. It is approximately 1. 5 km in diameter, has an albedo and spectral reflectance not grossly different from Ida, and orbits Ida in a prograde direction with a period of roughly 20 hr. No other comparable-sized satellites have been found near Ida. New pictures of {{the opposite side of}} Ida reveal an irregular, dog-bone shape, with a prominent gouge that seems to separate Ida into two chief components. A V-shaped valley, well shown in the highest-resolution view of Ida returned in April, may mark a modest expression on the September face of the more dramatic feature on the back side. Ida's dense population of craters shows a wide diversity of morphologies, consistent with the surface having been subjected to saturated bombardment by smaller projectiles. Assuming the same projectile flux applies to Ida was used in deriving Gaspra's cratering age of about 200 m. y., and assuming that Gaspra and Ida both have the same impact strength, then the age of Ida's surface is calculated to be 1 - 2 b. y. This is considerably older than expected from other evidence concerning the Koronis family. Our favored explanation of Ida's satellite is that it (or a precursor satellite from which the present satellite was derived) formed during the catastrophic disruption event that formed Ida itself and formed the Koronis family of asteroids. Perhaps, instead, the satellite is a block ejected from a cratering impact. In any case, smaller blocks visible on some parts of Ida are more certain to be crater ejecta, {{whether or not they were}} ever temporary satellites...|$|E
