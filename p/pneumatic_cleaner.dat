40|$|Theoretical {{studies of}} the effects of angle of {{injection}} and air velocity on displacements of cowpea and impurities particles in a vertical <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cleaner</b> were carried out. Experimental study of the effect of angle of injection and air velocity on cleaning efficiencies of two varieties of cowpea namely IT 90 K- 277 - 2 and Ife brown was also undertaken. The predicted horizontal displacements of IT 90 K- 277 - 2 and Ife brown from point of injection at 0. 5 s ranged from 0. 14 - 0. 25 m and 0. 56 - 0. 99 m respectively and at 1. 0 s it ranged from - 0. 06 - 0. 10 m and 0. 22 - 0. 40 m respectively. The predicted vertical displacements from point of injection at 0. 5 s ranged from - 0. 98 to - 1. 16. m and - 3. 93 to - 4. 64 m and at 1. 0 s it ranged from - 1. 13 to - 1. 20 m and - 4. 52 to - 4. 80 m respectively. The predicted horizontal displacements of the impurities from the point of injection at 0. 5 sand 1. 0 s for angles of injection of 15 to 60 r̈anged from 1. 11 - 19. 50 m and 4. 45 - 78. 02 m for IT 90 K- 277 - 2 and 1. 35 - 8. 52 m and 5. 40 - 34. 09 m for Ife Brown respectively. The predicted vertical displacements of the impurities from the point of injection at 0. 5 sand 1. 0 s for angles of injection of IS to 60 r̈anged from - 0. 77 to 18. 03 m and - 3. 08 to 72. 12 and middot;m for IT 90 K - 277 - 2 and - 0. 57 to 6. 87 m and 2. 27 to 27. 49 m for Ife Brown respectively. The predicted horizontal and vertical displacements of the cowpea varieties decreased with increase in angle of injection. For the impurities, as the angle of injection increased, the horizontal displacements decreased but the vertical displacements increased. This showed that impurities are farther displaced from the grains as the angle of injection increased. Experimental cleaning efficiency showed that cleaning efficiencies increased as the angle of injection increased which confirms the trend predicted by the displacements...|$|E

50|$|Pneumatic or <b>pneumatic</b> wet/dry vacuum <b>cleaners</b> are a {{specialized}} form of wet/dry models that hook up to compressed air. They commonly can accommodate both {{wet and dry}} soilage, a useful feature in industrial plants and manufacturing facilities.|$|R
50|$|Radial blowers, as in Figure 3(c), have wheels whose blades extend {{straight}} {{out from the}} centre of the hub. Radial bladed wheels are often used on particulate-laden gas streams because they are the least sensitive to solid build-up on the blades, but they are often characterized by greater noise output. High speeds, low volumes, and high pressures are common with radial blowers, and are often used in vacuum <b>cleaners,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> material conveying systems, and similar processes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a number of electric charge sensors. The sensors have been developed specifically to investigate triboelectric charge transfer which takes place between particles and the pipeline wall, when powdered materials are conveyed through a pipeline using air. A number of industrial applications exist for such gas-solids pipelines, including <b>pneumatic</b> conveyors, vacuum <b>cleaners</b> and dust extraction systems. The build-up of electric charge on pipelines and powdered materials can lead to electrostatic discharge and so is of interest from a safety viewpoint. The charging of powders can also adversely affect their mechanical handling characteristics and so is of interest to handling equipment engineers. The paper presents the design of the sensors, the design of the electric charge test rig and electric charge measurement test results...|$|R
