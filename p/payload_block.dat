In this paper we propose Wavelet based Secure Steganography with Scrambled Payload (WSSSP). The Daubechies Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT) is applied on cover image. The XD band is decomposed into upper and lower bands for payload embedding. The payload is segmented into four equal blocks. The Harr LWT is applied on alternate <b>blocks</b> of <b>payload</b> to generate F 1 and F 2 wavelet transform bands. The remaining <b>blocks</b> of <b>payload</b> are retained in spatial domain say S 1 and S 2. The bit reversal is applied on each coefficient of <b>payload</b> <b>blocks</b> to scramble <b>payload.</b> The cube root is applied on scrambled values to scale down the number of coefficient bits.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{transmission}} system, {{referred to as}} Dual Stream JPEG (DSJ), that improves the resiliency of JPEG video streams by unifying layered encoding with image scrambling techniques. Whereas layered encoding techniques naturally provide resiliency to isolated loss of low priority image data, scrambling techniques {{make it possible to}} distribute burst losses throughout the image. In DSJ, this unification is instantiated by employing the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to convert each 8 x 8 pixel block of an image into frequency domain, partitioning the resultant blocks into high-priority DC coefficients and low-priority AC coefficients, and then scrambling the transmission of encoded blocks of AC coefficients. Furthermore, DSJ defines an adaptation layer that implements efficient error detection and recovery by including the sequence number and offset (relative {{to the beginning of the}} cell <b>payload)</b> of <b>blocks</b> carried in each cell.

Thus, two redundant but different sub-blocks of parity bits are sent with the <b>payload.</b> The complete <b>block</b> has m + n bits of data with a code rate of m/(m + n).

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{performance}} measures of any packet based communication system is the success rate of the packets. A packet is successfully received if {{the arrival of the}} packet is detected correctly, header is received successfully, and payload is decoded without errors. At the moment, the probability of failure to decode the <b>payload,</b> i. e., <b>block</b> error rate (BLER), is often obtained by numerical methods, such as Monte-Carlo simulations due to shortage of analytical expressions for BLER. In this work, an approximation method for estimating the BLER in Nakagami-m block-fading channels is proposed. Furthermore, an analytical expression with a single parameter is derived for Nakagami- m channels. This parameter can be obtained by single simulation at a single signal to noise ratio (SNR) in Rayleigh fading channel. Our simulation results demonstrates that the proposed methods is highly accurate is estimating the BLER of many important wireless technologies. </p...|$|R

It was the third consecutive, and last, failure of a Titan IV rocket. The remaining three satellites (DFS-4, -5, and -6) were launched on 27 February 2001, 15 January 2002, and 8 April 2003.|$|R
40|$|Digital video {{has become}} {{increasingly}} susceptible to spario-temporal manipulations {{as a result of}} recent advances in video editing tools. In this paper, we propose a secure and flexible fragile digital video authentication watermark which also enables the self-recovery of video content after malicious manipulations. In the proposed block-based method, the watermark <b>payload</b> of a <b>block</b> is composed of two parts: authentication and recovery packets. The authentication packet is a digital signature with a special structure and carries the spario-temporal position of the block. The digital signature guarantees the authenticity and integrity of the block as well as the recovery packet, whereas the localization information prevents possible cut&; paste attacks. On the other hand, the recovery packet contains a highly compressed version of a spario-temporally distant block. This information enables the recovery of the distant block, upon detection of tampering by its authentication packet. A spariotemporal interleaving scheme and a simple multiple description coding mechanism increase the probability of self recovery by diffusing recovery information throughout the sequence. Finally, watermark payload is embedded by least significant bit modulation...|$|R

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyIssues around Quality of Service (QoS) and security for Voice over IP (VoIP) have been extensively investigated separately, due to the great attention this technology currently attracts. The specific problem this work addresses centres upon the selection of optimal parameters for QoS and security for VoIP streams integrating both network impairments and user perception metrics into a novel empirically-driven approach. Specifically, the simulation model seeks the optimal parameters in terms of variable VoIP <b>payloads,</b> iterative <b>block</b> ciphers, codecs and authentication mechanisms to be used, so that optimum tradeoff between a set of conflicting factors is achieved. The model employs the widely used Transmission Rating Factor, R, as the methodology to predict and measure the perceived QoS based on current transmission and network impairments. The R factor is then used to map perceived QoS to the corresponding Mean Opinion Score value, which gives the average estimation of perceived voice quality (Quality of Experience). Furthermore, a genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed that uses the output from the simulation model as an input into an offline optimisation routine that simultaneously maximises the VoIP call volumes and the Level of Encryption (LoE) per call basis, without degrading the perceived quality of service under a specific threshold as dictated by the R factor. The solutions reflect the optimum combination of parameters for each codec used and due to {{the small size of}} the search space the actual speed of GA has been validated against an exhaustive search algorithm. The results extracted from this study demonstrate that under strict and pre-defined parameters the default payload size supported by the codecs is not the optimal selection in terms of call volume maximisation and perceived QoS when encryption is applied...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{adaptive}} lossless {{data hiding}} scheme is presented that {{is capable of}} offering greater embedding capacity than the existing schemes. Unlike the fixed hiding capacity each block provides in most of the currently available lossless data hiding approaches, the proposed method utilizes a block-based lossless data embedding algorithm where the quantity of the hidden information each block bears is variable. To both reduce the image distortion and increase the hiding capacity, the <b>payload</b> of each <b>block</b> depends on its cover image complexity. Due to the fact that schemes with difference expansion tend to damage the image quality seriously in the edge areas, in the proposed scheme, smoother areas are chosen to conceal more secret bits. This way, a better balance can be reached between the embedding ratio and the stego-image quality. In addition, when recovered the cover image can came back. to its old self to the last bit without any distortion at all. Experimental results, as this paper will show, have demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of hiding more secret data while maintaining imperceptible stego-image quality degradation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a novel data hiding {{technique}} which is based on pixel-value differencing and modulus function and is capable of reducing the distortion of stego image for graylevel image. In the proposed scheme, we take two close pixels as a block to hide secret data where the <b>payload</b> of each <b>block</b> is determined by pixel-value. differencing. In order to obtain a better stego-image quality, we hide more data into the blocks with the higher difference value than that the blocks with the smaller difference value. In data embedding procedure, we propose a novel technique which is capable of reducing the distortion of stego image with the minimal. In our new scheme, we adopt the non-decimal number system to represent the secret data, and utilize the modulus function to minimize the possible distortion after hiding data. Since there are six degrees of payload are used in our method, we present the revision method to ensure the consistency of degree for each block. Therefore, the proposed scheme is blind because the original image is unnecessary in the data extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is greatly reducing distortion and its performance is better than that of those existing schemes...|$|R
40|$|With {{completion}} of its Critical Design Review (CDR) in 2015, NASA is {{deep into the}} manufacturing and testing phases of its new Space Launch System (SLS) for beyond-Earth exploration. This CDR {{was the first in}} almost 40 years for a NASA human launch vehicle and marked another successful milestone {{on the road to the}} launch of a new era of deep space exploration. The review marked the 90 -percent design-complete, a final look at the design and development plan of the integrated vehicle before full-scale fabrications begins and the prelude to the next milestone, design certification. Specifically, the review looked at the first of three increasingly capable configurations planned for SLS. This "Block I" design will stand 98. 2 meters (m) (322 feet) tall and provide 39. 1 million Newtons (8. 8 million pounds) of thrust at liftoff to lift a payload of approximately 70 metric tons (154, 000 pounds). This payload is more than double that of the retired space shuttle program or other current launch vehicles. It dramatically increases the mass and volume of human and robotic exploration. Additionally, it will decrease overall mission risk, increase safety, and simplify ground and mission operations - all significant considerations for crewed missions and unique, high-value national <b>payloads.</b> The <b>Block</b> 1 SLS will launch NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) on an uncrewed flight beyond the moon and back and the first crewed flight around the moon. The current design has a direct evolutionary path to a vehicle with a 130 t lift capability that offers even more flexibility to reduce planetary trip times, simplify payload design cycles, and provide new capabilities such as planetary sample returns. Every major element of SLS has hardware in production or testing, including flight hardware for the Exploration 1 (EM- 1) test flight. In fact, the SLS MPCV-to-Stage-Adapter (MSA) flew successfully on the Exploration Flight Test (EFT) 1 launch of a Delta IV and Orion spacecraft in December 2014. This paper will discuss these and other technical and programmatic successes and challenges over the past year and provide a preview of work ahead before the first flight of this new capability...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time in almost 40 years, a NASA human-rated launch vehicle has {{completed}} its Critical Design Review (CDR). By reaching this milestone, NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft are on the path to launch a new era of deep space exploration. NASA is making investments to expand science and exploration capability of the SLS by developing the capability to deploy small satellites during the trans-lunar phase of the mission trajectory. Exploration Mission 1 (EM- 1), currently planned for launch no earlier than July 2018, will be the first mission to carry such payloads on the SLS. The EM- 1 launch will include thirteen 6 U Cubesat small satellites that will be deployed beyond low earth orbit. By providing an earth-escape trajectory, opportunities are created for advancement of small satellite subsystems, including deep space communications and in-space propulsion. This SLS capability also creates low-cost options for addressing existing Agency strategic knowledge gaps and affordable science missions. A new approach to payload integration and mission assurance is needed to ensure safety of the vehicle, while also maintaining reasonable costs for the small payload developer teams. SLS EM- 1 will provide the framework and serve as a test flight, not only for vehicle systems, but also payload accommodations, ground processing, and on-orbit operations. Through developing the requirements and integration processes for EM- 1, NASA is outlining the framework for the evolved configuration of secondary <b>payloads</b> on SLS <b>Block</b> upgrades. The lessons learned from the EM- 1 mission will be applied to processes and products developed for future block upgrades. In the heavy-lift configuration of SLS, payload accommodations will increase for secondary opportunities including small satellites larger than the traditional Cubesat class payload. The payload mission concept of operations, proposed payload capacity of SLS, and the payload requirements for launch and deployment will be described to provide potential payload users an understanding of this unique exploration capability...|$|R
40|$|Designed {{for human}} {{exploration}} missions into deep space, NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) represents a new spaceflight infrastructure asset, enabling {{a wide variety}} of unique utilization opportunities. Together with the Orion crew vehicle and ground operations at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, SLS is a foundational capability for NASA's Journey to Mars. From the beginning of the SLS flight program, utilization of the vehicle will also include launching secondary payloads, including CubeSats, to deep-space destinations. Currently, SLS is making rapid progress toward readiness for its first launch in 2018, using the initial configuration of the vehicle, which is capable of delivering 70 metric tons (t) to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). On its first flight, Exploration Mission- 1, SLS will launch an uncrewed test flight of the Orion spacecraft into distant retrograde orbit around the moon. Accompanying Orion on SLS will be 13 CubeSats, which will deploy in cislunar space. These CubeSats will include not only NASA research, but also spacecraft from industry and international partners and potentially academia. Following its first flight and potentially as early as its second, which will launch a crewed Orion spacecraft into cislunar space, SLS will evolve into a more powerful configuration with a larger upper stage. This configuration will initially be able to deliver 105 t to LEO {{and will continue to be}} upgraded to a performance of greater than 130 t to LEO. While the addition of the more powerful upper stage will mean a change to the secondary <b>payload</b> accommodations from <b>Block</b> 1, the SLS Program is already evaluating options for future secondary payload opportunities. Early discussions are also already underway for the use of SLS to launch spacecraft on interplanetary trajectories, which could open additional opportunities for CubeSats. This presentation will include an overview of the SLS vehicle and its capabilities, including the current status of progress toward first launch. It will also explain the opportunities the vehicle offers for CubeSats and secondary payloads, including an overview of the CubeSat manifest for Exploration Mission- 1 in 2018...|$|R
