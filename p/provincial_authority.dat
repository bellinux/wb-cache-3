5|$|The Palmyrene council {{consisted}} {{of about six}} hundred {{members of the local}} elite (such as the elders or heads of wealthy families or clans), representing the city's four-quarters. The council, headed by a president, managed civic responsibilities; it supervised public works (including the construction of public buildings), approved expenditures, collected taxes, and appointed two archons (lords) each year. Palmyra's military was led by strategoi (generals) appointed by the council. Roman <b>provincial</b> <b>authority</b> set and approved Palmyra's tariff structure, but the provincial interference in local government was kept minimal as the empire sought to ensure the continuous success of Palmyrene trade most beneficial to Rome. An imposition of direct provincial administration would have jeopardized Palmyra's ability to conduct its trading activities in the East, especially in Parthia.|$|E

The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled a federal and provincial Act ultra vires, voiding both as {{an attempt by the}} province to vest powers in parliament unauthorized by the BNA Act.|$|E

The MGA also recognizes improvement districts and special areas as municipal authorities while Metis settlements {{are recognized as}} municipalities by the Government of Alberta's Ministry of Municipal Affairs.

500|$|In September, {{the most}} serious problem {{turned out to be}} a 30-day transit strike. By the end of July, {{estimates}} predicted that Expo would exceed 60 million visitors, but the strike cut deeply into attendance and revenue figures, just as the fair was cruising to its conclusion. Another major problem, beyond the control of Expo's management, was guest accommodation and lodging. Logexpo was created to direct visitors to accommodations in the Montreal area, which usually meant that visitors would stay at the homes of people they were unfamiliar with, rather than traditional hotels or motels. The Montreal populace opened their homes to thousands of guests. Unfortunately for some visitors, they were sometimes sent to less than respectable establishments where operators took full advantage of the tourist trade. Management of Logexpo was refused to Expo and was managed by a Quebec <b>provincial</b> <b>authority.</b> Still, Expo would get most of the blame for directing visitors to these establishments. [...] But overall, a visit to Expo from outside Montreal was still seen as a bargain.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, a major {{confrontation}} {{took place}} at the Saddle Lake Reserve in Alberta. After several years of deteriorating conditions and administrative changes, parents protested the lack of transparency at the Blue Quills Indian School in 1969. In response, the government decided to close the school, convert the building into a residence, and enrol students in a public school [...] away in St. Paul, Alberta. The TRC report pertaining to this period states:Fearing their children would face racial discrimination in St. Paul, parents wished to see the school transferred to a private society that would operate it both as a school and a residence. The federal government had been open to such a transfer if the First Nations organization was structured as a provincial school division. The First Nations rejected this, saying that a transfer of First Nations education to the <b>provincial</b> <b>authority</b> was a violation of Treaty rights. In the summer of 1970, members of the Saddle Lake community occupied the building and demanded the right to run it themselves. More than 1,000 people are believed to have participated {{over the course of the}} 17 day sit-in, which lasted from July 14 to July 31. Their efforts resulted in Blue Quills becoming the first Indigenous-administered school in the country. It continues to operate today as University nuhelot’įne thaiyots’į nistameyimâkanak Blue Quills, the first Indigenous-governed university in Canada. Following the success of the Blue Quills effort the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) released the 1972 paper Indian Control of Indian Education that responded, in part, to the Canadian Government's 1969 White Paper calling for the abolishment of the land treaties and the Indian Act. The NIB paper underscored the right of Indigenous communities to locally direct how their children are educated and served as the integral reference for education policy moving forward.|$|E
2500|$|In Canada, [...] "peace, {{order and}} good government" [...] (in French, [...] "paix, ordre et bon gouvernement"), often {{abbreviated}} POGG, {{is often used}} to describe the principles upon which that country's Confederation took place. A similar phrase, [...] "peace, welfare, and good government", had been used the Act of Union 1840 that created the Province of Canada. The now familiar phrase [...] "peace, order and good government" [...] was originally used in The British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867) enacted by the Imperial Parliament, and it defines the principles under which the Canadian Parliament should legislate. Specifically, the phrase appears in section 91 of the Act, {{which is part of the}} block of sections that divide legislative powers between the federal and provincial levels of government. POGG is a head of power arising from opening words of section 91 and is distinct from the enumerated powers under that section. The broad language suggests that there is a comprehensive grant of residual legislative authority to the federal government. Although the residual nature of the clause remains, the scope of the clause has been limited by the jurisprudence of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC). The JCPC narrowed the scope of the clause to the three distinct branches which remain while also broadly interpreting the scope of <b>provincial</b> <b>authority</b> over property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The jurisprudence has been defined into three branches: Emergency Branch, Gap or Purely Residual Branch, and National Concern Branch.|$|E
