Plain milling cutters are widely used in roughing and finishing of parts. The milling cutter geometry and distribution of inserts on the cutter body vary significantly in industry depending on the application. This paper presents a generalized mathematical model of <b>plain</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> for the purpose of predicting cutting forces, dimensional surface finish, stress, and strain. A sample of <b>plain</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> modeling and analysis examples are obtained by using the design and analysis is carried out using the software’s like CATIA V 5 and ANSYS. Milling like any metal cutting operation is used with an objective of optimizing surface roughness at micro level and economic performance at macro level. In addition to surface finish, modern manufacturers do not want any compromise on the achievement of high quality, dimensional accuracy, high production rate, minimum wear on the cutting tools, cost saving and increase of the performance of the product with minimum environmental hazards. In this Paper the design aspects of <b>plain</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is analyzed.

40|$|Abstract:- Milling {{machine is}} one of the {{important}} machining operations. In this operation the work piece is fed against a rotating cylindrical tool. The rotating tool consists of multiple cutting edges (multipoint cutting tool). Normally axis of rotation of feed given to the work piece. Milling operation is distinguished from other machining operations on the basis of orientation between the tool axis and the feed direction; however, in other operations like drilling, turning, etc. the tool is fed in the direction parallel to axis of rotation. The cutting tool used in milling operation is called milling cutter, which consists of multiple edges called teeth. The machine tool that performs the milling operations by producing required relative motion between work piece and tool is called milling machine. It provides the required relative motion under very controlled conditions. These conditions will be discussed later in this unit as milling speed, feed rate and depth of cut. Normally, the milling operation creates plane surfaces. Other geometries can also be created by milling machine. Milling operation is considered an interrupted cutting operation teeth of milling cutter enter and exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material and cutter geometry must be designed to bear the above stated conditions. In this project work the design aspects of <b>plain</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is analyzed.

Thus, thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutters,</b> made of high speed steels, essentially, are not produced. In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> shaving with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter,</b> made of cemented carbide and high speed steel. The paper presents a method for constructing models and key assumptions adopted for its development.

40|$|Milling is {{a process}} of {{producing}} flat and complex shapes with the use of multi-tooth cutting tool, which is called a <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> and the cutting edges are called teeth.

In modern industry, thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> with helical flutes. Since the standard presents thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes. The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy. The data obtained can be used to correct tooth profile thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> to improve the accuracy of the obtained thread. </p...|$|R
