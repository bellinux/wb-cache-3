5|$|Official {{efforts to}} protect this area started in 1960, when Senator Augusto Guzmán Robles {{presented}} a bill to the Peruvian Congress {{for the creation of}} Huascarán National Park. In 1963, the Forestry and Hunting Service (Servicio Forestal y de Caza) presented a <b>preliminary</b> <b>project</b> for the delimitation of the Cordillera Blanca National Park, covering an area of 321,000 hectares. On February 18, 1966 a government resolution prohibiting the logging and hunting of native species {{in the area of the}} Cordillera Blanca was issued. Later that year, the Patronage of Huascarán National Park was formed in Yungay. In 1967, Curry Slaymaker and Joel Albrecht, Peace Corps volunteers, formulated delimitation proposal on an area of 85,000 hectares; and simultaneously, the Forest Regional Service of Huaraz established the vicuña and queen-of the-Andes surveillance zone for an area of approximately 10,000 hectares. Finally, on July 1, 1975 Huascarán National Park was created by decree No. 0622-75-AG, with an extension of 340 000 hectares.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{features}} of a comprehensive plan for passenger transportation between communities in the nine northern counties of New Jersey {{and the city of}} New York are outlined in a report submitted on Jan. 15 to the Legislature of the state by the North Jersey Transit Commission. A preliminary report presented about a year ago was abstracted in Electric Railway Journal for Feb. 7, 1925... The ultimate object of the program recommended is {{the creation of a new}} electric railway system comprising [...] of route, and the electrification of [...] of railroad now operated by steam. As the first step it is proposed to construct an interstate loop line [...] in length connecting with all of the north Jersey commuters' railroads and passing under the Hudson River into New York City by two tunnels, one uptown and one downtown. A new low-level subway through Manhattan would complete the loop. Construction costs of this <b>preliminary</b> <b>project</b> are estimated at $154,000,000, with $40,000,000 additional for equipment.

40|$|In {{order to}} speed up the design of turbomachines, the Turbine Department of the DLR Institute of Propulsion Technology is {{developing}} a turbine pre-design chain that should organize and accelerate all design steps prior to initial 3 D-CFD calculations. Thus, DLR is developing generic tools for <b>preliminary</b> design <b>projects</b> of turbine design. This paper reports the activities led by DLR for turbine pre-design, focusing on advanced 2 D-calculations and optimization. The <b>preliminary</b> <b>projects</b> for the aero-thermodynamic design of turbines are supposed to provide reliable results in a short time. Nowadays the 3 D-CFD is recognized for the precise results it can provide, but the significant computation times are yet a limitation for its use in <b>preliminary</b> <b>projects.</b> For the turbine pre-design, methods of fluid computation are chosen according to their computation rapidity more than the precision of the provided results. Hence 0 - 2 D computation methods are used for the pre-design. The advantage of advanced 2 D-computations for turbine pre-design is quickly introduced, before presenting the turbine pre-design chain developed by DLR. The main tools are then described separately. The integration of S 2 -computations (i. e. SLC 4 T program code) in the turbine pre-design process should contribute to accelerate significantly the switch from one step to the next. With this work, some routines were implemented, so that 1 D pre-design can be followed automatically by SLC 4 T computations for providing turbine map data files. Second big task for this work was to implement a preconfigured and general optimization process using AutoOpti for annulus geometry of turbines that could be quickly set up coming from PrEDiCT 1 D predesign. Many optimization criteria, such as the regions of interest of parameter values, are strongly problem-oriented. As regards S 1 -stream surfaces, human know-how is deeply involved when designing blade profiles. The complete automation of blade design itself is therefore not foreseen. However, it would be of interest to implement an automatic update of S 2 -flow computations input files, once the blades have been designed precisely. By this way the optimization process of the annulus contour could be performed on the turbine with updated blade parameters. Furthermore as HPT and LPT are optimized together, it could be of interest to optimize the inter turbine duct shape as well...|$|R
