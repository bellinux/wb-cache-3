Up to now, organotitanate compounds are used as catalysts on an industrial scale only for the synthesis of <b>poly(butylenes</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> (PBT), poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT), and related copolyesters; for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), synthesis antimony-based catalysts are preferred. In fact, in this case, titanium is known to cause undesirable discoloration. In this article, a study of PET synthesis using different concentrations of a new titanium dioxide based catalyst (C- 94), commercially available from Acordis Industrial Fibers GmbH, is carried out and compared with the results obtained with titanium tetrabutoxide (TBT) catalyst in the same experimental conditions. The solid-state properties and composition of C- 94 was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectroscopy and by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).

Compatibilization via transreactions in blends of <b>poly(butylene</b> succinate-co-butylene <b>terephthalate)</b> [P(BS-co-BT) ] with poly(hydroxy ether of bisphenol-A) (phenoxy) were investigated. Analyses {{were based}} on {{characterization}} using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). They revealed that the P(BS-co-BT) /phenoxy blend had a phase morphology that could be homogenized only following annealing at high temperatures. As-blended P(BS-co-BT) /phenoxy (50 / 50 composition) exhibited immiscible phases with two distinct Tgs, but the initially phase-separated blends finally merged to form a homogeneous phase with a single Tg upon heating and annealing for 60 min at 280 oC. Chemical exchange reactions upon heat-annealing were likely to have caused the phase homogenization in the P(BS-co-BT) /phenoxy blend. NMR was performed on blend samples before and after they were heated to 280 oC, but the similarity of bonds made obtaining straight results difficult.

40|$|Recently, {{a variety}} of {{biodegradable}} polymers have been developed as alternatives to recalcitrant materials. Although many studies on polyester biodegradability have focused on aerobic environments, there is much less known on biodegradation of polyesters in natural and artificial anaerobic habitats. Consequently, the potential of anaerobic biogas sludge to hydrolyze the synthetic compostable polyester PBAT (<b>poly(butylene</b> adipate-co-butylene <b>terephthalate)</b> was evaluated in this study. On the basis of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis, accumulation of terephthalic acid (Ta) was observed in all anaerobic batches within the first 14 days. Thereafter, a decline of Ta was observed, which occurred presumably due to consumption by the microbial population. The esterase Chath_Est 1 from the anaerobic risk 1 strain Clostridium hathewayi DSM- 13479 was found to hydrolyze PBAT.

40|$|We have {{developed}} environment-adaptable degradable polymers into which useful compounds, such as repellents and antibacterial agents can be incorporated. As reported previously, {{the incorporation of}} such reagents differed greatly in the experiment using the same polymer. In order to investigate such different incorporation for different reagents, the impregnation experiments were conducted using the fundamental organic compounds under scCO 2 (40 ºC, 20 MPa) for 3 h.

The melting behaviour of P(BA-co-BT) copolyesters were studied with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray analysis. The increase of the aromatic moiety as well as reinforcement with WF improved stiffness of copolyesters. The ambient testing environment with the increased temperature negatively impacted the stiffness and strain properties of P(BA-co-BT) s as well as P(BA-co-BT) -WF composites. The loss of mechanical properties was accelerated in humid atmosphere due to hydrolytic degradation of the ester linkage in copolymers.

40|$|Chitin is {{a natural}} polymer found abundantly in {{structural}} components of crustaceans and insects. Commercial interest has been generated in this polymer because of its widespread availability, high degree of biodegradability; biocompatibility and nontoxicity. Chitin and microcrystalline cellulose were combined with different commercially available polymers to form biocomposites with varying properties. The biodegradation of these composites was investigated under composting conditions {{with a view to}} develop composites that could be considered as completely biodegradable in accordance with Australian Standard AS 14855 requirements. A preliminary investigation into biodegradability of chitin/low density polyethylene (LDPE) composites by the soil burial method indicated faster degradation of the composites compared to native LDPE. To enhance the biodegradation rate of the chitin/LDPE composites, an inexpensive, readily-available and partly biodegradable polymer (Flex 262) was used to partially replace LDPE. Extruded films were tested for their biodegradability in compost using the respirometric method outlined in AS 14855. The addition of Flex 262 was shown to increase the rate of biodegradation; however the degradation was still slow and the extent of degradation limited due to the presence of non-biodegradable LDPE in the composites. In order to further explore the potential of chitin fillers, chitin was combined with polybutylene succinate adipate (PBSA) and <b>polybutylene</b> adipate <b>terephthalate</b> (PBAT) which are commercially available and fully biodegradable synthetic polyesters. Chitin and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) or chitin by itself was combined with the polyesters in different ratios to form biocomposites. It was found that composites containing chitin and MCC filler in a PBAT/PBSA matrix degraded at the fastest rate and was 100 % biodegradable (in accordance with Australian Standard AS 14855). To understand the biological process in greater detail, an assessment of the microbial community of the resultant composts was undertaken with the help of molecular biology techniques. In the ';Day zero'; compost, the dominant microbial community was found to include members of Phylum Proteobacteria and Day 100 compost was dominated by members of the group Chloroflexi irrespective of the fact whether compost contained test composites or not. It can therefore be inferred that the presence of the composites have not triggered the proliferation of any specialized bacterial microbiota. Chitin/PBAT/PBSA composites were also subjected to mechanical testing. It was found that the tensile strength of chitin filled biocomposites decreased along with increasing filler content while the reinforcement effect could be observed as an increase in stiffness (modulus) of the composites with increasing filler loading...|$|R

Through trial and error, appropriate commercial compositions have been chosen which could not be otherwise explained by a suitable interpretation of the mechanisms determining their solidifica- tion behavior. The solidification behavior of a 60 / 40 w/w PBT/PET blend was studied in a wide range of cooling conditions, according to a continuous cooling transforma- tion (CCT) procedure developed previously, aiming at emulating the typical condi- tions encountered in polymer processing. Several samples characterized by a homoge- neous structure were solidified from the melt at various cooling rates and the result- ing structure and properties were subsequently evaluated by analyzing the density, microhardness (MH), and wide angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD). The resulting solidifi- cation behavior was then compared to that exhibited by the individual constituents of the blend (i. e., PBT and PET). The blend displayed a unique solidification behav- ior, conversely to those of the pure components which showed characteristics not rec- ognized in the blend except at certain restricted cooling rates ranges. The cooling rate dependence observed in the blend does not bring similarities to the crystalliza- tion behavior of individual constituents since the fall down of density with cooling rate should be related to the rate controlling demixing stage of the two moieties just before crystallization occurs. The kinetics observed is thus a measure of the kinetics of demixing...|$|R

40|$|Polymeric nanocomposites are novel {{materials}} of huge interest owing to their favourable cost/performance ratio with low amount of nanofillers, improved thermal resistance, flame retardancy and mechanical properties {{in relation to}} their matrices. In this work, composites based on post-industrial waste or primary recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> and 5 [*]wt. % of organic modified montmorillonite clays were melt compounded using a twin-screw extruder. A 2 (2) factorial experimental design was used to study the compounding and processing variables: Organic modified montmorillonite with one or two hydrogenated tallow (initial basal spacing) and screw speed of the extruder. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy suggest that a partial exfoliation of the organoclay in the recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> matrix was achieved for organic modified montmorillonite with lower initial basal spacing. On the other hand, formulations containing organic modified montmorillonite with higher initial basal spacing showed only intercalated structure. The recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> -organic modified montmorillonite nanocomposites did not drip flaming material during burning tests. Storage of dynamic-mechanical, tensile and flexural moduli of the recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> -organic modified montmorillonite were improved when compared with both virgin and recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> s, mainly for nanocomposites formulated at a lower initial basal spacing organoclay. This could be related to a better diffusion of polymer into organic modified montmorillonite layers compared with the higher initial basal spacing organoclay. The improvements on the physical properties of recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> showed the feasibility to add value to primary recycled engineering thermoplastics with a very small amount of organic modified montmorillonite...|$|E
40|$|The {{toughening}} of an aromatic amine-cured {{diglycidyl ether}} of bisphenoI-A epoxy with particles of crystalline polymers was studied. The crystalline polymers were <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate),</b> nylon 6, and poly(vinylidene fluoride). Nylon 6 and poly(vinylidene fluoride) {{were found to}} toughen the epoxy {{about as well as}} did an equivalent amount of CTBN rubber. <b>Poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> was found to toughen the epoxy about twice as well as did the rubber. The toughness of <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> -epoxy blends was independent of par-ticle size for sizes in the range of tens of micrometres, but the toughness of the nylon 6 -epoxy blends decreased with increasing particle size for sizes smaller than about 40 #m. There was no loss of either Young's modulus or yield strength of the epoxy with the inclusion of either nylon 6 or <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> and less loss of these with the inclusion of poly(vinylidene fluoride) than with the inclusion of rubber. Toughness seems to have arisen from a combination of mechanisms. The <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> -epoxy blends alone seem to have gained toughness from phase-transformation toughening. Crack path alteration and the formation of steps and welts and secondary crack bridging seem to have accounted for an especially large part of the fracture energy of the poly(vinylidene fluoride) -epoxy blends. Secondary crack nucleation contributed to the toughness of the nylon 6 -epoxy blends. 1...|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{propagation}} {{and temperature}} development are simulated for laser-transmission welding of polycarbonate and <b>polybutylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> parts. The simulations {{are carried out}} for a Gaussian- and an M-shape laser beam. For polycarbonate {{the shape of the}} laser beam is preserved, while for <b>polybutylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> it is altered due to scattering processes. The resulting intensity and integrated intensity distribution in the joining zone are calculated for both polymers. They give rise to different temperature fields. The dimensions of the model seam are approximated by the dimensions of the melt isotherm. For polycarbonate the seam generated by a Gaussian beam has a non-homogeneous thickness and a width that is smaller than the beam diameter. For an M-shape beam it has a homogeneous thickness and its width scales with the width of the integrated intensity. For <b>polybutylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> volumetric scattering destroys the original beam shape in the joining zone. The distributions of the integrated intensities and the dimensions of the seam are similar for both types of beams...|$|E
