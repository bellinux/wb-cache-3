50|$|In Unterjugel, a {{timber mill}} (Brettmühle) and a <b>paint</b> <b>mill,</b> {{belonging}} to Johann Gabriel Lobel a grandson of Preißler, were operated using the hydropower of the Pechhöfer Bach stream for {{the manufacture of}} cobalt blue paint. Löbel's mill, the Unterjugel Blue Colour Works (Blaufarbenwerk Unterjugel), to which six houses for the paint workers belonged, passed in 1668 into the possession of the Elector of Saxony and, in 1677, merged with the Oberschlema Blue Colour Works (Blaufarbenwerk Oberschlema). Today, a pub, Gasthof Farbmühle ("The Paintmill"), stands on what {{is believed to be}} the site of the former <b>paint</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|E

50|$|Between 1815 and 1817, the School of Naval Architecture at Portsmouth was {{designed}} and built according to Holl's designs. The school closed in 1932. Also in 1817, the Navy Board authorised a lead and <b>paint</b> <b>mill</b> at Chatham. Holl designed a fireproof structure with cast-iron pillars, iron beams, yorkstone paving for the floors, and a brick exterior.|$|E
5000|$|In 1960 the eight-sided <b>paint</b> <b>mill</b> 'De Duinjager' {{was removed}} from its former {{position}} owing to urban development and placed {{on top of the}} old storehouse of 'De Kat'.

50|$|When Pennsylvania first legislated {{routes in}} 1911, {{what would become}} PA 68 was {{designated}} as Legislative Route 243 between the Ohio border and Rochester, Legislative Route 78 between Rochester and Butler, Legislative Route 214 between Butler and Clarion, and Legislative Route 98 in a portion of Forest County. PA 68 was designated in 1927 to run from the Ohio border in Beaver County northeast to US 6/US 119/US 120/PA 6/PA 7 in Kane, running along its current routing to Clarion before continuing to Kane. At this time, the entire route was paved between the Ohio border and Clarion except for a portion between Rimersburg and Sligo. Between Clarion and Kane, the entire route was unpaved except for a portion near Marienville and to the southwest of Kane. A year later, the route between Rimersburg and Sligo was paved. By 1930, PA 68 paved between US 322 northwest of Clarion and <b>Paint</b> <b>Mills,</b> Arthurs and Snydersburg, and around Leeper while the state highway was under construction between <b>Paint</b> <b>Mills</b> and Arthurs, Snydersburg and southwest of Leeper, and the Clarion/Forest county line and Roses.|$|R

50|$|In 2007, it was {{proposed}} that the line would be split into two routes, numbered 56 and 59, that {{would be similar to}} the pre-1997 routes M-9 and M-16, but with higher frequencies. This change, which went into effect on February 17, 2008, was planned in order to improve schedule adherence on both routes. At the same time, trips via Dolfield Road were discontinued, and all trips on Route 56 operate via <b>Painter</b> <b>Mill</b> Road to Reisterstown Road.|$|R

50|$|The Rock House {{was built}} as a {{residence}} for the National Park Service custodian of Arches National Monument, now Arches National Park, in 1941. Constructed using Civilian Conservation Corps labor, the residence served its purpose until it was replaced by newer housing under the Park Service's Mission 66 program. The house is built of local stone in a coursed rubble pattern, with <b>painted</b> <b>milled</b> wood trim. The house was designed by Verland Norgard, in a style that combines rustic elements with Greek Revival and Federal style details. Two small, non-contributing additions have been constructed {{to the rear of}} the house, and the interior, which has been extensively modified, does not retain its historic integrity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{river was}} {{polluted}} with human and industrial effluent during the Industrial Revolution, and this contamination continued {{until the early}} 1970s. The river often changed colour dramatically {{as a result of}} paper and <b>paint</b> <b>mills</b> routinely using the river water to flush out dye and paint tanks. This process has now ceased, and as a result the river water is now relatively clear which has resulted in the return of trout and small fish. In 2012 a section of the river which had remained in a culvert for 100 years was uncovered at an area of Darwen known as Shorey Bank [...] Throughout the course of the river many improvements have resulted in improved water quality.|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} no more iconic, stalwart, and eloquent defender of liberty and {{representative}} democracy than J. S. Mill, he sometimes endorses non-democratic forms of governance. This article explains the reasons behind this seeming aberration and shows that Mill actually has complex and nuanced views of the transition from non-democratic to democratic government, including the comprehensive and parallel material, cultural, institutional, and character reforms that must occur, and the mechanism by which they will be enacted. Namely, an enlightened despot must cultivate democratic virtues such as obedience, industriousness, spirit of nationality, and resistance to tyranny in the population and simultaneously prepare the way for his own demise and secure his own legitimacy by transitioning to the rule of law. This challenges recent scholarship that <b>paints</b> <b>Mill’s</b> non-democratic views as crudely and uncritically imperialist, because it fails to recognize and engage seriously with his sophisticated (if ultimately problematic) theory of individual and institutional development under enlightened colonialism...|$|R
