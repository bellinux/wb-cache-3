5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species are adapted to {{spending}} a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time feeding on the ground, and a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground. The ground woodpecker is one such species, inhabiting the rocky and grassy hills of South Africa, and the Andean flicker is another.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} landowner's land tax paid in a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> crop yield, the poll tax and {{property}} taxes were paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult {{men and women}} was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay {{a higher rate of}} 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.|$|E

5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe and {{his crew}} sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya. After Malaya, the next <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> expedition took them to Burma, where they arrived in Rangoon and traveled by rail to Myitkyina. In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before {{he was able to}} resume working or continue the expedition. He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly for the next few days.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the Allied powers {{established}} the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The principal {{purposes of the}} BIS were to manage the scheduled payment of Germany's reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, and {{to function as a}} bank for central banks around the world. Nations may hold a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> reserves as deposits with the institution. It also serves as a forum for central bank cooperation and research on international monetary and financial matters. The BIS also operates as a general trustee and facilitator of financial settlements between nations.|$|E
5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, thick hair {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children. In keeping with this general theme, women who were too young for marriage would shave a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads to signal so. This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E

50|$|Cover {{near the}} ground is an {{important}} criterion for white-throated woodrat shelter sites. In northern <b>portions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range, white-throated woodrats tend to construct houses at the bases of trees; in southern <b>portions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range, white-throated woodrats tend to construct houses at the bases of shrub-trees, shrubs, or cacti. When available, rocks are preferred by white-throated woodrats for shelter because they provide more protection from variations in ambient temperature than the base of plants.|$|R
5|$|Many rivers {{originating}} in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding {{during the spring}} months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of Iran and Afghanistan, very low flow {{for the rest of}} the year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.|$|E
5|$|Merchants and peasant farmers paid {{property}} and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> crop yield. Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade wares at urban markets. The Han government {{may have found}} collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} generalist predators, eating microalgae, sponges, bivalves, snails {{and other small}} animals. The crown-of-thorns starfish consumes coral polyps, while other species are detritivores, feeding on decomposing organic {{material}} and faecal matter. A few are suspension feeders, gathering in phytoplankton; Henricia and Echinaster often occur in association with sponges, benefiting from the water current they produce. Various species {{have been shown to}} be able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this may form a significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> diet.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the history}} of The Realms {{detailed}} in novels and source books concerns the actions of various deities and The Chosen (mortal representatives with a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> deities' power) such as Elminster, Fzoul Chembryl, Midnight (who later became the new embodiment of the goddess of magic, Mystra), and the Seven Sisters. Above all other deities is Ao, the Overlord. Ao does not sanction worshipers and distances himself from mortals. He is single-handedly responsible for the Time of Troubles, or Godswar, as seen in The Avatar Trilogy.|$|E
5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into {{more and more}} threads, those threads spend an {{ever-increasing}} <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time communicating with each other. Eventually, the overhead from communication dominates the time spent solving the problem, and further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases {{the amount of time}} required to finish. This is known as parallel slowdown.|$|E
5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} sperm whales. Sperm whales consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend a large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require any degree of light at all, in fact, blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E

5|$|Swing clarinetists such as Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman led {{successful}} big {{bands and}} smaller groups from the 1930s onward. Duke Ellington, active from the 1920s to the 1970s, used the clarinet as lead instrument in his works, with several {{players of the}} instrument (Barney Bigard, Jimmy Hamilton, and Russell Procope) spending a significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> careers in his orchestra. Harry Carney, primarily Ellington's baritone saxophonist, occasionally doubled on bass clarinet. Meanwhile, Pee Wee Russell had a long and successful career in small groups.|$|E
5|$|The Pawnees did {{not live}} in their villages year-round. In the spring, they planted and hoed crops near their villages. In mid-June, they left on their summer buffalo hunt. In September, they {{returned}} to harvest the crops and to hold their harvest festival; they then cached a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> food in their villages and left on the winter buffalo hunt, from which they did not return until planting time in the spring. Thus the villages were deserted for at least eight months of the year.|$|E

Specific residence halls and communities exist for graduate students, athletes, and various specific interests and academic disciplines. Every resident on campus {{is a member of the}} Texas Tech Residence Hall Association which provides various on campus programming and leadership opportunities. RHA is led by an Executive Board and Senate with student representatives from each residence hall. The organization is also a member of the South West Affiliate of College and Universities Residence Halls.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{are usually}} {{much larger than}} their substrates. Sizes range from just 62 amino acid {{residues}}, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase. Only a small <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site. This catalytic site is located next {{to one or more}} binding sites where residues orient the substrates. The catalytic site and binding site together comprise the enzyme's active site. The remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{voted to}} extend {{unemployment}} insurance in 2002, 2008, and 2009, but has since voted against further extensions. In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose {{the privatization of}} Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a private account which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E
