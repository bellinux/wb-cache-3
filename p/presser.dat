5|$|Grant {{was born}} Archibald Alec Leach on January 18, 1904 at 15 Hughenden Road in the {{northern}} Bristol suburb of Horfield. He was the second child of Elias James Leach (1873–1935) and Elsie Maria Leach (née Kingdon; 1877–1973). Elias worked as a tailor's <b>presser</b> at a clothes factory while Elsie worked as a seamstress. Grant's elder brother, John William Elias Leach (1899–1900), died of tuberculous meningitis. Grant considered himself to have been partly Jewish. He had an unhappy upbringing; his father was an alcoholic, and his mother suffered from clinical depression.|$|E
5|$|Rau {{was born}} in Feuerbach, now a part of Stuttgart, in the German Kingdom of Württemberg, {{the son of a}} peasant who later became a factory worker. He grew up in the {{adjacent}} city of Zuffenhausen, now also a part of Stuttgart. After finishing school in spring 1913, he started work as a press operator in a shoe factory. In November 1913 he changed his employer and moved to the Bosch factory works in Feuerbach. There he completed his training as metal <b>presser</b> and remained until autumn 1920, with interruptions due to war service during 1917-1918 and the subsequent German Revolution of 1918-1919.|$|E
25|$|Although turncoat mob {{leaders and}} others had long accused Jackie <b>Presser</b> of being a {{government}} informant, the first official confirmation came on August 22, 1981. In its August 31 issue, Time magazine reported that <b>Presser</b> and other Teamsters had served as government informants since the early 1970s to avoid possible prosecution. <b>Presser</b> confirmed that he, his father and Fitzsimmons had met with federal agents, but declared {{that there had been}} only one meeting in 1972. Days later, at least one newspaper retracted the story. Mafia figures had long doubted claims that <b>Presser</b> was an informant, and the retraction helped renew mob confidence in <b>Presser.</b> The mob's confidence in <b>Presser</b> was reaffirmed a year later when the Justice Department publicly ended its investigation into an alleged kickback scheme.|$|E
25|$|As {{the trial}} continued, <b>Presser's</b> health worsened. In late July 1987, Judge White granted an {{indefinite}} delay after <b>Presser's</b> lawyers turned over evidence that <b>Presser's</b> cancer had returned. The trial resumed in September.|$|R
25|$|<b>Presser's</b> {{attorneys}} {{claimed that}} the FBI had given him permission to initiate and maintain the payroll-padding scheme {{as a means of}} shielding him from mob suspicions. Such permission, which is permitted under FBI and DOJ rules and federal law, should bar prosecution, <b>Presser's</b> lawyers argued.|$|R

25|$|Although DOL {{had begun}} {{investigating}} <b>Presser</b> in 1981, DOJ's failed 1981 prosecution {{as well as}} retractions of newspaper stories led many to believe that allegations of criminal wrongdoing by <b>Presser</b> were unfounded. Presser's close political ties to the Reagan administration convinced some that the Republicans were protecting <b>Presser</b> and the Teamsters from prosecution.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Jackie <b>Presser</b> {{became an}} {{organizer}} for the Teamsters. His father, William <b>Presser,</b> was {{a vice president}} of the international union and a known associate of Mafia figures in Cleveland, Ohio. <b>Presser</b> quickly rose within the Teamster hierarchy, becoming president of Local 507, a regional elected official, and a pension trustee.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Jackie <b>Presser</b> {{was elected}} an {{international}} {{vice president of}} the Teamsters. William <b>Presser</b> had resigned his vice presidency after being convicted of extortion and obstruction of justice. Allegedly, William <b>Presser</b> met with Roy Lee Williams, then president of the Central Conference of Teamsters, a regional council which controlled union locals in 14 Midwestern states (including Ohio). Williams, who was working with the Kansas City crime family, agreed to help <b>Presser</b> convince Teamster President Fitzsimmons to make Jackie a vice president. Jackie Presser's election was unanimous.|$|E

25|$|On May 4, 1988, <b>Presser</b> {{was hospitalized}} again. Doctors {{reported}} that <b>Presser</b> had brain cancer, that four tumors had been found, and that <b>Presser</b> had been flown from the Cleveland Clinic to Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix for treatment. Presser's diagnosis {{touched off a}} power struggle within the Teamsters over who would succeed him. Government attorneys conceded that it was now unlikely that Presser's trial would ever resume. <b>Presser</b> underwent a successful operation to remove one tumor on May 17. He later had a tumor removed from his pituitary gland.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{grand juries}} in Cleveland and Washington, D.C., soon opened {{investigations}} into the FBI's handling of the <b>Presser</b> case as well as whether the promises made by FBI agents had been authorized. Justice Department leaders eventually undertook a prosecution {{of one of the}} FBI field agents who handled <b>Presser,</b> claiming that he had not been authorized to give <b>Presser</b> permission to engage in the payroll-padding scheme.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, <b>Presser</b> {{received}} more than $530,000 in pay. <b>Presser</b> was paid $224,000 in salary by Local 507, $59,500 by Teamsters Joint Council 41, $18,100 by the Ohio Conference of Teamsters, and $229,000 by the international union.|$|E

25|$|But {{that same}} year <b>Presser,</b> along with Fitzsimmons and 17 other Teamster leaders, {{was forced to resign}} as a trustee of the Central States Pension Fund. The Department of Justice had charged <b>Presser</b> and others with making {{improper}} loans to mob-controlled Las Vegas casinos, racetracks and real estate investments. In 1978, <b>Presser</b> was named a defendant in a civil suit brought by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), which sought damages and reimbursement on behalf of union retirees.|$|E
25|$|At the {{regularly}} scheduled Teamsters convention in May 1986, <b>Presser</b> {{was elected to}} a full five-year term as Teamsters president. <b>Presser</b> arrived in the ballroom accompanied by composer Aaron Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man. Four muscular men dressed as Roman centurions bearing him on a golden sedan chair. Despite being indicted days before on embezzlement and racketeering charges, <b>Presser</b> received 1,729 votes to Theodus' 24 votes. Theodus conceded after the first hour of balloting, but <b>Presser</b> ordered the roll call to continue to the end (it lasted another three-and-a-half hours) to humiliate Theodus. After the balloting, delegates defeated proposals to cut the president's salary by $100,000 and to prohibit national leaders from collecting multiple union salaries.|$|E
25|$|Just a month later, however, <b>Presser</b> was so ill it {{was rumored}} he would step down as {{president}} of the Teamsters. <b>Presser,</b> who had gone to Phoenix, Arizona, for cancer treatment, was forced to issue a press release denying the rumors.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1985, the Commission heard {{testimony}} from former Teamsters president Roy Williams about <b>Presser's</b> connections to organized crime. Under a grant of immunity, Williams testified extensively about <b>Presser's</b> offer to fix a 1974 criminal case for $10,000 and his desire to obtain kickbacks for helping to arrange a 1975 Teamsters pension fund loan to organized crime figures so they could purchase a Las Vegas casino.|$|R
25|$|<b>Presser</b> and {{his first}} wife Pat had two children, a {{daughter}} Bari (born 1953) and a son, Gary. <b>Presser</b> divorced his second wife, Carmen, in 1983. The couple had two children. Presser's son, Gary, was elected vice president of Local 507.|$|E

25|$|In early 1985, the President's Commission on Organized Crime {{issued a}} sealed {{subpoena}} ordering <b>Presser</b> {{to testify about}} mafia influence in the Teamsters union. <b>Presser</b> filed suit to have the subpoena thrown out.

25|$|The Jackie <b>Presser</b> {{indictment}} scandal was a {{legal and}} political scandal which began on June 1, 1984. The scandal erupted after attorneys with the United States Department of Justice initiated a prosecution of Teamsters President Jackie <b>Presser</b> on various charges, including fraud and labor racketeering, only to cease prosecution once {{it was revealed that}} <b>Presser</b> had been a criminal informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) since the early 1970s. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials came under intense political pressure to resume prosecution, while Presser's attorneys claimed that <b>Presser</b> had permission from DOJ to engage in the alleged crimes in order to mislead organized crime figures. It was later revealed that FBI and DOJ officials may not have kept investigators in other federal agencies and Congress fully informed of Presser's role, and that FBI agents may have overstepped their authority in giving <b>Presser</b> permission to commit crimes. The scandal largely ended after Presser's death on July 9, 1988.|$|E
25|$|In April 1985, the President's Commission on Organized Crime held {{hearings}} in Chicago on organized crime involvement in labor unions. During the hearings, Commission members {{charged that the}} Mafia controlled the Teamsters, the Laborers, HERE and the International Longshoremen's Association. Former mobsters described numerous syndicate cash bribes and other payments to <b>Presser.</b> Other witnesses testified that <b>Presser</b> had used violence and other illegal methods to intimidate political opponents within the Teamsters. During his own testimony, <b>Presser</b> invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 15 times.|$|E
25|$|A second {{federal grand}} jury {{investigation}} opened in Washington, D.C., in April 1986. The second investigation built on the information uncovered by the Cleveland grand jury, and probed whether the three FBI agents handling <b>Presser</b> made false statements to supervisors about their relationship with <b>Presser.</b>|$|E
