40|$|There {{are four}} large {{limestone}} quarries, located nearby Cairo metropolitan. Drilling and blasting operations {{are used to}} extract limestone for the cement industries. In these quarries, the blast vibration should be kept below a certain limit. One of these quarries is Tourah Portland Cement Company (TPCC) limestone quarry which, lies near important and historical large caves, within Tourah Mountain. Therefore, control of blast vibration level becomes very critical. A series of multi-holes blasts have been performed to answer several questions about the optimum scaled distance {{that can be used}} safely to avoid caves damage, what constitutes true timing and initiation system?, and their relation to the blast vibration level?. Four Tri-axial geophones located in a linear array, over a distance of 1. 0 km (0. 621 miles) from the quarry faces, they have synchronized by means of a GPS timing reference. The data retrieved from the geophones and subjected to different steps of processing and analysis. The field tests showed that {{there was a significant difference}} in the blast vibration level between top and bottom initiation systems, containing the same explosive charge per delay intervals. In the upper bench, the results showed that the blast optimization of vibration level requires small delay intervals at distance more than 800. 0 m (875 yards), between shot point and caves. This study helped TPCC limestone quarry to remain operating since the government permitted the continuation of blasting operations. In addition, the advantages of using Nonel system in comparison with VA electrical detonators, could lead to convince the government to raise the <b>permitted</b> <b>explosive</b> charge per day...|$|E
50|$|The inquests started {{three days}} after the explosion, but were adjourned as more bodies were {{recovered}} and were not completed until 8 July the following year. Accidental death verdicts were recorded on all 76 victims. The colliery owners argued that there had been no gas in the pit despite gas having been reported on the day before the explosion. The coroner concluded that the cause of death had been an explosion of firedamp and coal dust ignited by <b>permitted</b> <b>explosives.</b>|$|R
40|$|Membership in a {{currency}} union is not irreversible. Exit expectations may emerge during sovereign debt crises, because exit allows countries {{to reduce their}} liabilities through {{a currency}} redenomination. As market participants anticipate this possibility, sovereign debt crises intensify. We establish this formally within a small open economy model of changing policy regimes. The model <b>permits</b> <b>explosive</b> dynamics of debt and sovereign yields inside currency unions and allows us to distinguish between exit expectations and those of an outright default. By estimating the model on Greek data, we quantify the contribution of exit expectations to the crisis dynamics during 2009 – 2012...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{procedure}} for the determination of drilling and blasting patterns in general and that for Meiduk copper mine in particular, has first been described. Geological and the geotechnical data for the mine, together with all other relevant information such as working conditions in the region, particulars of the available equipment and characteristics of <b>permitted</b> <b>explosives</b> have all been discussed. Using the available data {{and the results of}} experiments carried out on site, an optimized pattern has been found with the help of conventional hand methods. A computer program is then introduced that also uses additional parameters such as particle size distributions after blasting. This program has also produced an optimized pattern. The two patterns have been applied to Meiduk copper mine and their results have been compared. The procedure can be applied in all similar mining situations where drilling and blasting constitutes an important element in the total mining costs...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of stress-concentrating flaws such as microfractures, {{vesicular}} glassy materials can withstand gas pressures within vesicles in excess of 100 MPa; however, vesicles within such materials are known to decrepitate explosively at much lower internal gas pressures, both in natural systems and in the laboratory. Here we present a model that quantitatively predicts the generation of microfractures in vesicle walls during cooling. Cooling of gas-bearing vesicles in glassy rock has little effect on water solubility in the glass, but leads to a rapid decrease in gas pressure in the vesicles. The drop in pressure causes disequilibrium between {{the water in the}} glass and in the vesicle. Dehydration of the glass in a diffusive boundary layer around the vesicle leads to elastic shrinkage. The resulting strain generates large tensile tangential stresses which can exceed the strength of the glass, causing microfracturing. Such microfractures present a possible means by which glassy rock surrounding vesicles could be weakened enough to <b>permit</b> <b>explosive</b> decrepitation at low pore vapor pressures. The results have implications wherever hydrous vesicular glasses are formed. For example rocks formed in shallow subvolcanic intrusions or vent plugs may spontaneously disintegrate with explosive emission of vapor; glassy submarine lavas spontaneously decrepitate upon dredging from the ocean floor (''popping rock''); vesicular glasses produced in laboratory experiments investigating vapor-melt phase equilibria have been observed to contain abundant fractures surrounding vesicles and to dehydrate at anomalously high rates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Distribution and {{abundance}} of macrozooplankton off Wilkes Land, Antarctica in austral summer were studied {{in relation to}} environmental features associated with the Antarctic Divergence (AD). A single species of salp, Salpa thompsoni, dominated others both numerically and by biomass, occupying 44 % of mean total abundance with the maximum density of 29873 inds. / 1000 m 3 (44 mg C/m 3). Abundance of Antarctic krill, Euphuusia superba, was low through the sampling area (max. 41 inds. / 1000 m 3 : 2. 9 mg C/m 3). Total length frequency and stage of maturity of E. superba suggested relatively late spawning and low recruitment ratio, respectively. Salps and major copepod species showed a spatially partitioned pattern across the AD, in which the former dominated in areas {{north and south of}} the AD while the latter was predominant near the AD. Active reproduction of salps seemed to be ongoing in the areas where mean chl a concentration within the euphotic zone was around 0. 4 - 0. 6 p. g/ 1, but suppressed where that was higher than 0. 6 pg//. Clogging of mucous nets of salps was considered {{to be one of the}} causes of their low abundance at high chl a concentration as observed near the AD. The results suggest that the relatively limited phytoplankton growth, particularly in the eastern side of this research area, may have provided the food condition which was optimal for salp reproduction but unfavorable for other phytoplankton consumers, <b>permitting</b> an <b>explosive</b> population growth of salps...|$|R
40|$|The Great Lakes {{region of}} East Africa, {{including}} Lake Victoria, {{is the center}} of diversity of the mega-diverse cichlid fishes (Perciformes: Teleostei). Paleolimnological evidence indicates dramatic desiccation of this lake ca. 18, 000 - 15, 000 years ago. Consequently, the hundreds of extant endemic haplochromine species in the lake must have either evolved since then or refugia must have existed, within that lake basin or elsewhere, from which Lake Victoria was recolonized. We studied the population history of the Lake Victoria region superflock (LVRS) of haplochromine cichlids based on nuclear genetic analysis (12 microsatellite loci from 400 haplochomines) of populations from Lake Kivu, Lake Victoria, and the connected and surrounding rivers and lakes. Population genetic analyses confirmed that Lake Kivu haplochromines colonized Lake Victoria. Coalescent analyses show a 30 - to 50 -fold decline in the haplochromine populations of Lake Victoria, Lake Kivu, and the region ca. 18, 000 - 15, 000 years ago. We suggest that this coincides with drastic climatic and geological changes in the late Pleistocene. The most recent common ancestor of the Lake Victoria region haplochromines was estimated to have existed about 4. 5 million years ago, which corresponds to the first radiation of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika and the origin of the tribe Haplochrominii. This relatively old evolutionary origin may explain the high levels of polymorphism still found in modern haplochromines. This degree of polymorphism might have acted as a "genetic reservoir" that <b>permitted</b> the <b>explosive</b> radiation of hundreds of haplochromines and their array of contemporary adaptive morphologies...|$|R
40|$|The modern army is {{currently}} striving {{to make their}} weapon systems smaller, lighter, and cheaper {{and at the same}} time more powerful. One of the enabling technologies that <b>permit</b> this is <b>Explosive</b> Pulsed Power (EPP). Explosive Pulsed Power consists of those devices that convert the chemical energy in explosives into electrical energy. In 2004, a series of Army Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Programs were initiated to develop several types of very compact EPP Generators. Based on these recent efforts, we now have a better understanding of the weaknesses and strengths of these small generators. As a result, we can now build reliable generators that provide consistent output currents and voltages. In this paper, a brief introduction to these generators will be given along some of the most recent advances in our understanding of them. This paper will only report on advances made by Army and Navy researchers and that of their contractors. A description of an explosive driven high power microwave test bed built at Texas Tech will be presented. A brief description of some applications of EPP will also be presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|The July-August 2001 {{eruption}} of Mt. Etna stimulated widespread public and media interest, caused significant damage to tourist facilities, {{and for several}} days threatened the town of Nicolosi on the S flank of the volcano. Seven eruptive fissures were active, five on the S flank between 3050 and 2100 m altitude, and two on the NE flank between 3080 and 2600 m elevation. All produced lava flows over various periods during the eruption, the most voluminous of which reached a length of 6. 9 km. Mineralogically the 2001 lavas fall into two distinct groups, indicating that magma was supplied through two different and largely independent pathways, one extending laterally from the central conduit system through radial fissures, the other being a vertically ascending eccentric dike. Furthermore one of the eccentric vents, at 2570 m elevation, {{was the site of}} vigorous phreatomagmatic activity as the dike cut through a shallow aquifer, both during the intial and closing stages of the eruption. For six days the magma column feeding this vent was more or less effectively sealed from the aquifer, <b>permitting</b> powerful <b>explosive</b> and effusive magmatic activity. While the eruption was characterized by a highly dynamic evolution, complex interactions between some of the eruptive fissures, and changing eruptive styles, its total volume (~ 25 x 106 m 3 of lava and 5 - 10 x 106 m 3 of pyroclastics) was relatively small in comparison with other recent eruptions of Etna. Effusion rates were calculated on a daily basis and reached peaks of 14 - 16 m 3 s- 1 while the average effusion rate at all fissures was about 11 m 3 s- 1, which is not exceptionally high. The eruption showed a number of peculiar features, but none of these (except the contemporaneous lateral and eccentric activity) represented a significant deviation from Etna's eruptive behavior in the long term. However, the 2001 eruption could be but {{the first in a series}} of flank eruptions, some of which might be more voluminous and hazardous. Placed in a long-term context, the eruption confirms a distinct trend, initiated during the past 50 years, toward higher production rates and more frequent eruptions, which might bring Etna back to similar levels of activity as during the early to mid 17 th century...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{explosives}} {{operations have}} been and may continue {{to be an important}} component of the DOE mission at the NTS. This mission has been to conduct the nation`s nuclear testing program in a safe, secure, and efficient manner while assuring full compliance with state and federal regulations, and DOE order`s and directives. These operations have generally included assembly, disassembly or modification, staging, transportation, and tesbng of nuclear explosive devices. They may also include maintenance, repair, retrofit, and surveillance. The Device Assembly Facility (DAF) was constructed to provide a dedicated facility in which to prepare nuclear explosives assemblies for their intended disposition. This facility will provide for combined operations (replacing two separate facilities) and incorporates state-of-the-art safety and security features while minimizing the risks of environmental impacts. The facility has been completed but not yet operated, so the impacts to be considered will b e based on normal operations and not on the impacts of construction activities. The impacts will arise from nuclear explosives operations that require the handling of high explosives in combination with special nuclear materials. Wastes from operation of the earlier device assembly facilities have included grams of epoxies, pints of solvents, and small quantities of waste explosives. These are hazardous (includes radioactive) wastes and are disposed of in accordance with state and federal regulations. Assuming similar operations at the DAF, non-hazardous (includes non-radioactive) solid waste would be transported to a <b>permitted</b> landfill. Waste <b>explosives</b> would be sent to the Area 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit. Other hazardous waste would be sent to the Area 5 Radioactive Waste.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} {{with the use of a}} Beckman & Whitley Model 189 framing camera to observe the initiation of detonation in cylindrical explosive charges by the detonation of a concentric outside layer of sheet explosive initiated at one end. Experiments were con-ducted with nitromethane, which is a transparent liquid explosive, and aluminum-potassium perchlorate, which is a binary mixture of fuel and oxidizer powders. The use of the trans-parent <b>explosive</b> <b>permitted</b> viewing along the entire length of the charge axis, so that the time of the nitromethane initiation as a function of the position of the concentric sheet explosive detonation could be observed. In the case of the binary charge, the experiment involved the simultaneous viewing of both the side and the end of the charge by a judicious positioning of two front- surface mirrors. One of these was oriented at the end of the charge at an angle of 45 ° with respect to the charge axis. The second mirror, larger in size, viewed the entire system, and was destructed at 656 psec by an explosive bac 1 Jng charge to preclude the possibility of film rewrite. Framing rates for both experiments were approximately 250, 000 frames /sec. The induction time to initiation of detonation in the nitromethane was measured to be about 20 psec. However, the induction time for the aluminum-potassium perchlorate charge was too long to be recorded by the Beckman and Whitley camera. For this and other pyro-technic charges, it was necessary to use a slower writing Fastax camera recording at a rate of 2000 frames /sec; the induction times for the pyrotechnic systems were in the neighborhood of 1 to 3 msec, which is two orders of magnitude longer than for the nitromethane...|$|R
