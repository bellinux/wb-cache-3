40|$|Ethernet {{is a key}} {{component}} of the standards used for digital process buses in transmission substations, namely IEC 61850 and IEEE Std 1588 - 2008 (PTPv 2). These standards use multicast Ethernet frames that can be processed by more than one device. This presents some significant engineering challenges when implementing a sampled value process bus due to the large amount of network traffic. A system of network traffic segregation using a combination of Virtual LAN (VLAN) and multicast address filtering using managed Ethernet switches is presented. This includes VLAN <b>prioritisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> classes such as the IEC 61850 protocols GOOSE, MMS and sampled values (SV), and other protocols like PTPv 2. Multicast address filtering is used to limit SV/GOOSE traffic to defined subsets of subscribers. A method to map substation plant reference designations to multicast address ranges is proposed that enables engineers to determine the type of traffic and location of the source by inspecting the destination address. This method and the proposed filtering strategy simplifies future changes to the prioritisation of network traffic, and is applicable to both process bus and station bus applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} a simulation scenario for performance evaluation of switched Ethernet as communication media in controller networks. Ethernet {{is the most}} accepted Local Area Network technology, characterized with low price and deployment robustness. Using Ethernet instead of custom industrial communication protocol can ease the development of applications. The introduction of Fast Ethernet and micro-segmentation eliminates {{some of the biggest}} problems of using Ethernet in controller networks. This also enables integration of controller networks with the enterprise and global networks. The use of queue management discipline shows a lot of possibilities for achieving requirements for different type of services. The evaluation is by means of simulation analysis, using network simulator – NS 2 as a tool. The results are used for studying the interactions in multi-tier model for distributed automation and for improving its communication performance. Some particular classes are proposed for <b>prioritisation</b> <b>of</b> different CNDEP <b>traffic</b> used in the multi-tier model...|$|R

Agglobus is the transit network serving the communes of the , nearly 60,000 people, where a multiple purchase ticket shall not exceed €0.20. It allows service to the centre of Rodez from outside communes (and vice versa) before 8am with a time range for operation of the service between 7am (5am for some lines) and 8pm. These lines have scheduled timing. This network is complemented by an evening service that operates Monday to Saturday, from 8pm to 11:30pm, by a transport service scheduled running Monday to Saturday with two round trips per day, and for persons with reduced mobility which works at the same times as the bus network. The Rodez topography {{makes it difficult to}} create special lanes for buses. As such, the Agglobus network is equipped with a system <b>of</b> <b>prioritisation</b> at <b>traffic</b> lights and also a geolocation for buses.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} in this paper is inspired by a vision of intelligent vehicles that autonomously move along motorways: they join and leave trains of vehicles (platoons), overtake other vehicles, etc. We propose a multi-objective algorithm based on NEAT and SPEA 2 that evolves controllers for such intelligent vehicles. The algorithm yields a set of solutions that embody their own <b>prioritisation</b> <b>of</b> various user requirements such as speed, comfort or fuel economy. This contrasts with most current {{research in}}to such controllers, where the user preferences are summarised in a single number that the controller development process should optimise. Having multiple <b>prioritisations</b> <b>of</b> preferences would, however, allow the user to select desired vehicle behaviour in real time, for instance fast driving if she's in a hurry or economical driving in more relaxed circumstances. Preliminary results of our experiments show that evolved controllers substantially outperform the human behavioural model. We show {{that it is possible}} to evolve a set of vehicle controllers that correspond to different <b>prioritisations</b> <b>of</b> user preferences, giving the driver, on the road, the power to decide which preferences to emphasise. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{increasing}} invasions and limited resources, appropriate management of invasive species requires <b>prioritisation</b> <b>of</b> species for management action. This process often relies on knowledge of species specific impacts. However, as studies explicitly measuring impact of marine alien species are rare, <b>prioritisation</b> <b>of</b> management actions is often based on studies from outside the geographic area of interest. Further, few impact studies account for context dependency (e. g. seasonal variability or distinct environmental regimes), raising {{the question of how}} transferrable knowledge about the impact of a species is between invaded ranges. This study addressed this question by using the widespread invasive solitary ascidian Ciona robusta as a case study for assessing impacts across two invaded regions: South Africa and California, USA. We replicated a previously conducted experiment from California that showed that C. robusta depresses local species richness in San Francisco Bay. Our South African experiment showed no effect of C. robusta on species richness, the Shannon-Weiner diversity index or community composition, despite experiments being carried out over two years and at two depths. While these results may reflect strong density dependency in the impact of C. robusta, they serve to highlight context dependency in invasive species impacts. This suggests that until studies of impact in marine systems become common place, context dependency should be explicitly addressed as a source of uncertainty during the <b>prioritisation</b> <b>of</b> species for management action...|$|R

This paper presents the first attempt at a fully automatic extraction of news values from headline text. The news values extraction methods are applied on a large headlines corpus collected from The Guardian, and evaluated by comparing it with a manually annotated gold standard.
