This dissertation studies the design of audio standards: MPEG- 1 / 2 and AC- 3. The perceptual audio coder like MPEG- 1 / 2 and AC- 3 can be analyzed through filterbank, psychoacoustic model, stereo matrix, bit allocation/ quantization, and <b>packing</b> <b>block.</b> This dissertation considers the design for the filterbank, psychoacoustic model, stereo matrix, and bit allocation / quantization. This dissertation summarizes the filterbanks adopted in coding standards and presents a unified fast algorithm for these filter banks. On the psychoacoustic models, the hybrid filterbank is proposed to replace to original frequency analyzer for MPEG audio standards to have efficient computing. On the bit allocation, we analyze the issues in bit allocation and present the efficient method. This dissertation also studies the stereo irrelevancy and presents th...|$|E

The study of such a function {{is the subject of}} theorems of supersaturated graphs and closely related to the Sidorenko-Erdős-Simonovits conjecture as well. In the present paper we investigate the case when F= K_ 2,t and in particular the quadrilateral graph case. For F=C_ 4, we obtain exact results if m and the corresponding Zarankiewicz number differ by at most n, by a finite geometric construction of almost difference sets. F= K_ 2,t if m and the corresponding Zarankiewicz number differs by Cn√(n) we prove asymptotically sharp results. We also study stability questions and point out the connections to covering and <b>packing</b> <b>block</b> designs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Unlike {{classical}} floorplanning {{that usually}} handles only <b>block</b> <b>packing</b> to minimize silicon area, modern very large scale integration (VLSI) floorplanning typically needs to <b>pack</b> <b>blocks</b> within a fixed die (outline), and additionally considers the <b>packing</b> with <b>block</b> positions and interconnect constraints. Floorplanning with bus planning {{is one of}} the most challenging modern floorplanning problems because it needs to consider the constraints with interconnect and block positions simultaneously. In this paper, the authors study two types of modern floorplanning problems: 1) fixed-outline floorplanning and 2) bus-driven floorplanning (BDF). This floorplanner uses B ∗-tree floorplan representation based on fast three-stage simulated annealing (SA) scheme called Fast-SA. For fixed-outline floorplanning, the authors present an adaptive Fast-SA that can dynamically change the weights in the cost function to optimize the wirelength under the outline constraint. Experimental results show that this floorplanner can achieve 100 % success rates efficiently for fixed-outline floorplanning with various aspect ratios. For the BDF, the authors explore the feasibility conditions of the B ∗-tree with the bus constraints, and develop a BDF algorithm based on the conditions and Fast-SA. Experimental results show that this floorplanner obtains much smaller dead space for the floorplanning with hard/soft macro blocks, compared with the most recent work. In particular, this floorplanner is more efficient than the previous works. Index Terms—Floorplanning, physical design. I...|$|R

40|$|At {{the heart}} of a frontal or multifrontal solver for the {{solution}} of sparse symmetric sets of linear equations, there is the need to partially factorize dense matrices (the frontal matrices) {{and to be able to}} use their factorizations in subsequent forward and backward substitutions. For a large problem, packing (holding only the lower or upper triangular part) is important to save memory. It has long been recognized that blocking is the key to efficiency and this has become particularly relevant on modern hardware. For stability in the indefinite case, the use of interchanges and 2 × 2 pivots as well as 1 × 1 pivots is equally well established. In this article, the challenge of using these three ideas (<b>packing,</b> <b>blocking,</b> and pivoting) together is addressed to achieve stable factorizations of large real-world symmetric indefinite problems with good execution speed. The ideas are not restricted to frontal and multifrontal solvers and are applicable whenever partial or complete factorizations of dense symmetric indefinite matrices are needed...|$|R
