2500|$|Impoverished {{workers are}} more likely to hold {{part-time}} jobs, move in and out of work, be migrant workers, or experience stress associated with being unemployed and searching unsuccessfully for unemployment, which all in turn affects health outcomes. According to the WHO, employment and working conditions greatly affect health equity (Kivimaki et al., 2003). [...] This occurs because poor employment conditions exposes individuals to health hazards, which {{are more likely}} for low-status jobs. Evidence confirms that high job demand, low control, and low rewards for effort in these low status jobs are risk factors for mental and physical health problems, such as a 50% excess risk of heart disease (Stansfeld & Candy, 2006). [...] The growing power of massive, conglomerate global corporations and institutions to set labor policy and standards agendas has disempowered workers, unions, and the job-seeking by subjecting these individuals to health-damaging working conditions. (EMCONET, 2007). [...] In high- income countries, there has been a growth in job insecurity and <b>precarious</b> <b>employment</b> arrangements (such as informal work, temporary work, part-time work, and piecework), job losses, and a weakening of regulatory protections. Informal work can threaten health through its precarious job instability, lack of regulation to protect working conditions and occupational health and safety. Evidence from the WHO suggests mortality is greater among temporary workers than permanent workers. (Kivimaki et al., 2003). [...] Since most of the global workforce operates under the informal economy, particularly low- and middle-income countries, impoverished populations are greatly affected by these factors.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} and analyze the relationship between attitudes to work, wellbeing, and labor market status among young adults in Europe and to discuss the extent to which the relationship can be understood in terms of passion or exploitation. This aim is made concrete in the following research questions: To what extent do young adults in Europe have a passionate attitude to work? Are there differences between groups with various labor market status and nationalities? Are there differences in levels of well-being between the groups of young adults with different labor market status, and differences between the countries? The results are based on an individual survey conducted with three categories of young people (18 – 34 years old) : long-term unemployed, those in <b>precarious</b> <b>employments,</b> and those regularly employed.

His recent book, Good Jobs, Bad Jobs: The Rise of Polarized and <b>Precarious</b> <b>Employment</b> Systems in the United States, 1970s to 2000s (Russell Sage Foundation, 2011), discusses the rise of <b>precarious</b> <b>employment</b> in the United States as well as the growing polarization of jobs with regard to earnings as well as non-economic rewards such as the control people have over their work activities and schedules, especially in balancing work and family.

40|$|Discussions {{about the}} {{reconciliation}} {{of work and}} family are often considered to be focussing on women and middle class people with safe employments. By identifying the differences among men in their capacities to engage in involved fatherhood that stem from their positions in the labour market, this article introduces {{the perspective of a}} deprivileged marginalised group in the labour market and critically reflects on the impact of labour flexibilisation on caring masculinity and gender equality. Men as employees have heterogeneous positions in the labour market, which impacts their access to social – including parental – rights and possibilities for balancing work and care. Given that the precarisation of the labour market is a salient problem in Slovenia, this qualitative study based on explorative in-depth semi-structured interviews with fathers in diverse forms of <b>precarious</b> <b>employments</b> analysed how insecure and flexible work arrangements shape fatherhood practices, impact the chances for involved fatherhood and structure gender relations. The fathers’ experiences showed that precarious working conditions enable fathers to be intensely involved in children’s care mainly when their employment approaches standard employment in terms of stability and predictability of working hours and guaranteed workload. When work is entirely flexible and unpredictable and the employee is faced with either taking such a job or losing it, the reconciliation of work and fatherhood is aggravated as the organisation of everyday life is fully subordinated to paid work. In conclusion, precarious working relations were indicated to foster the strengthening of the breadwinner model and retraditionalisation of gender relations...|$|R

When all these factors are taken into account, it is not the state of lone-parenthood that is negatively associated with child wellbeing, nor transitions in family formations, but the low levels of income and high levels of material deprivation they experience. In order to improve child wellbeing, policy needs to begin by securing the financial circumstances of lone-parent...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this article}} is to explore the {{influence}} of <b>precarious</b> (temporary) <b>employment</b> on employability and career development. Design/methodology/approach: The article draws together primary and secondary research material. Findings: Findings indicate that there are both positive and negative perspectives with regard to temporary employment and career development for both the workers themselves and the user firms. Research limitations/implications: Implications arising are that policy development/research is required to investigate potential interventions that could be introduced. Practical implications: These are in line with the article’s suggestion of adopting transitional labour market strategies. These major transitions are between education and employment; (unpaid) caring and employment; unemployment and employment; retirement and employment; “precarious” and permanent employment. Originality/value: The article outlines two facets of precariousness associated with temporary work in relation to the worker and the user firm. It also presents a newly devised three-stage typology of skill and skill acquisition that is relevant to the topic...|$|R

Using a combination of critical theory and discursive analysis, this thesis analyses discourses relating to poverty, unemployment and social welfare. It tracks the contradictions of this value dualism through selected forms of policy and media discourse literature and will challenge the negative moral valence associated with dependency, offering possible alternatives in the areas of moral anthropology, welfare discourse and social provision in order to reverse the stigmatisation of unemployed citizens...|$|R
