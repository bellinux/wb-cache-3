5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from a <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{woman in}} Yogoto ni Au Koi ( [...] , [...] "love that meets each night") raises {{her eyes in}} delight as she holds a letter out from the breast <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> kimono. [...] The title {{suggests}} it is from a lover, perhaps calling her to another of their nightly trysts. [...] Utamaro gives his subject a noble air and features pays close attention to realistic details of her face, such as {{the shape of her}} eyebrows and loose hairs straggling about.|$|E
2500|$|Marian, her maid, {{and her son}} Jack Thayer {{survived the}} sinking of the Titanic, but her husband John Borland Thayer went down with the ship. When the [...] docked, Marian’s brother was there to meet them and took them back to their home in Haverford, in a special train that had been {{arranged}} for survivors [...] Unknowingly Marian still had in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> overcoat the White Star brochure about the Titanic which contained information about the ship and included a list of First Class Passengers. The cover of the brochure and the first page of the passenger list are shown on the right. It still bears the mark of being folded.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{ran to her}} {{saddle and}} got the {{biscuits}} out <b>of</b> the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> coat, and she {{ran back to the}} rider.|$|R
60|$|They {{were silent}} for some minutes. Norah shivered, and thrust her hands {{deep into the}} <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> jacket. Lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation.|$|R
60|$|She {{stuck her}} hands {{deeply into the}} <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dust-coat, and a china-blue eye {{regarded}} Melville from under the brim of the boldly trimmed bonnet.|$|R
2500|$|Laura's cake is {{complete}} {{but she is}} not happy. It is less than she had hoped it would be. She had invested great and desperate hopes in the cake, like an artist working on a great piece of art, and in her mind, she failed. Laura catalogues what she will do to keep busy {{for the rest of the}} day: prepare for Dan's party. She knows Dan will be happy with whatever she prepares. This slightly annoys her. She realises her husband's happiness [...] "depends only on the fact of her, here in the house, living her life, thinking of him". She tries to tell herself this is a good thing and that she is being difficult but is suddenly hit by the image of Virginia Woolf putting a stone into the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> coat and walking into a river. This psychic connection to another ‘desperate housewife’ is interrupted by a tap on the back door.|$|E
60|$|She {{folded it}} {{and put it in the}} <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress. Then turned to go--and stopped at the door.|$|E
60|$|As {{she spoke}} she {{unlocked}} the manacles and dropped {{them with a}} slight click into a concealed <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dark skirt.|$|E
6000|$|She laid {{aside the}} gun, {{put her hands}} deep in the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pea-jacket, and, {{slightly}} squaring her shoulders, said curtly, [...] "What do you want?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{took from}} one of the neat little <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> apron a morsel of note-paper, {{carefully}} folded into the smallest possible compass, and respectfully placed it in Noel Vanstone's hands.|$|R
5000|$|After his wife's death, Cassini later wrote, [...] "We {{discovered}} the apartment, particularly her closets, littered {{with all kinds}} of pills, hidden in vases, under linens, stuffed in her shoes and the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> clothes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She {{showed him}} a small pearl-handled {{revolver}} which she carried in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> jacket. [...] "I can shoot, Wampus." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{advanced}} to the table behind which the general stood and, taking a folded paper from an inside <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> coat, handed it to him.|$|E
60|$|Jeff {{dropped it}} instantly. Miss Mayfield {{put it in}} the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sacque for security. Besides, it had been so bekissed that it seemed unpleasantly conscious.|$|E
60|$|That is to say, not one farthing of {{the twenty}} {{thousand}} pounds {{was to go}} to Miss Halcombe, or to any other relative or friend of Lady Glyde's. The whole sum, if she left no children, was to slip into the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband.|$|R
60|$|She tripped {{out into}} the passage, {{returning}} with the tray, which she {{put on the table}} beside Clarence, and then standing back a little and with her hands tucked soubrette fashion in the tiny <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> apron, gazed at him with a mischievous smile.|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{stepped out}} with an honest British tread, hands buried in the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{serviceable}} ulster, head bent against the sudden gusts of wind. She did not mind {{the darkness of the}} ill-lighted, wide boulevard, and had every intention of covering the two miles in a little more than half an hour.|$|R
60|$|Musing {{on these}} things the girl put {{the key in the}} <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress and then slowly drew on her shoes and stockings, which the sun had fully dried.|$|E
60|$|She nodded quickly her shamefaced head, and he waited, {{looking away}} from her, while, {{trembling}} all over and bowing her neck, she tried to find the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress.|$|E
60|$|He {{brought her}} back to the chair. She took Agatha's letter from the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fur cloak, and handed it to him with a faint attempt to be tragic.|$|E
6000|$|... "The rooms will suit me," [...] he said, [...] "and I have {{no doubt}} the price you ask for them is a just one;" [...] and he bowed with high-bred {{courtesy}} to Sylvia, who was now in attendance on him, and who stood with her pretty hands in the pretty <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pretty apron.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look, Father Rocco, see if I can't carry them!" [...] cried La Biondella, cramming her bread {{into one}} <b>of</b> the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little apron, holding <b>her</b> bunch <b>of</b> grapes by the stalk in her mouth, and {{hoisting}} the packet <b>of</b> dinner-mats on <b>her</b> {{head in a}} moment. [...] "See, I am strong enough to carry double," [...] said the child, looking up proudly into the priest's face.|$|R
60|$|When he {{had gotten}} all in {{readiness}} he ordered Lucy to follow closely in his tracks. He entered a narrow cleft in the low cliffs which wound in and out, and was thick with sage and cedars. Lucy, riding close to the cedars, conceived the idea of plucking the little green berries and dropping them on parts of the trail where their tracks would not show. Warily she filled the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> jacket.|$|R
6000|$|... "An insult!" [...] she answered, {{crushing}} {{the paper in}} her hand and then stuffing it into the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress. [...] "Light your pipe, daddy, dear. Here--I'll strike the match." ...|$|E
60|$|Anne {{took the}} Glasgow {{newspaper}} from the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> traveling cloak, {{and placed it}} before him, open at the paragraph which described the act of extortion attempted on Mrs. Glenarm.|$|E
60|$|She {{closed the}} door, locked it, {{and put the}} key {{carefully}} in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she started on her journey.|$|E
60|$|With strange, numb hands Stanton {{searched the}} <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dressing-gown, to find, at length, a little {{account-book}} with pencil attached. Then, with stiffened fingers, but acute mind, {{she began to}} write to Neale. As she wrote into each word went something of the pang, the remorse, the sorrow, the love she felt; and when that letter was ended she laid the little book on her breast and knew {{for the first time}} in many years--peace.|$|R
6000|$|If {{the steward}} had known {{anything}} of women (at Isabel's age) {{he would never}} have appealed to her mercy in those plain terms, and at the unpropitious moment. [...] "Pity you?" [...] she repeated contemptuously. [...] "Is that all you have to say to me after hurting my arm? What a bear you are!" [...] She shrugged her shoulders and put her hands coquettishly into the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> apron. That was how she pitied him! His face turned paler and paler--he writhed under it.|$|R
60|$|After her mother's burial Rose {{turned to}} her father more hungrily than before. She rode into the fields {{with him in the}} spring, when he went out to sow, sitting on the seeder box with the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little pink apron filled with wheat, and her sweet, piping little voice calling to the horses or {{laughing}} in glee at the swarms of sparrows. When he was plowing corn she rode on the horses, clinging like a blue-jay to the rings in the back-pad, her yellow-brown hair blowing.|$|R
6000|$|Bessie (Who at {{the word}} [...] "beggar" [...] had begun fumbling in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress, speaks wildly). Here it is. Take it. Don't look at me. Don't speak to me! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went past}} Clara without speaking. She felt the three {{chocolate}} creams would burn {{her if she}} touched them. It needed all her courage to slip them into the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> apron.|$|E
6000|$|Imogene {{lifted her}} head at last, and softly dried her eyes. Then, as she pushed her {{handkerchief}} back into the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> robe, [...] "What sort of looking girl was that other one?" ...|$|E
50|$|After visiting several nightclubs, Fina {{admits that}} she took the {{counterfeit}} money from the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> Carlos Rubi, <b>her</b> sister's boyfriend.|$|R
5000|$|Expressing {{her ideas}} about peace, she {{referred}} to herself only as [...] "Peace Pilgrim".Peace Pilgrim's only possessions were the clothes {{on her back and}} the few items she carried in the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blue tunic which read [...] "Peace Pilgrim" [...] on the front and [...] "25,000 Miles on foot for peace" [...] on the back. She had no organizational backing, carried no money, and would not even ask for food or shelter. When she began her pilgrimage she had taken a vow to [...] "remain a wanderer until mankind has learned the way of peace, walking until given shelter and fasting until given food".|$|R
60|$|There was a {{profound}} silence. Bob laid his sword tenderly aside and nursed his leg thoughtfully. Flora, after coquettishly adjusting the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little apron, {{put her arm}} upon the doctor's shoulder, and permitted herself to be drawn beside him. Fung Tang, the little heathen page, who was permitted, on this rare occasion, to share the Christmas revels in the drawing-room, surveyed the group {{with a smile that}} was at once sweet and philosophical. The light ticking of a French clock on the mantel, supported by a young shepherdess of bronze complexion and great symmetry of limb, was the only sound that disturbed the Christmas-like peace of the apartment,--a peace which held the odors of evergreens, new toys, cedar boxes, glue, and varnish in a harmonious combination that passed all understanding.|$|R
