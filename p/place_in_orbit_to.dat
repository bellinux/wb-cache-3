5000|$|At {{the height}} of the Cold War, all {{international}} communications were either sent through undersea cables or bounced off the natural ionosphere. The United States Military was concerned that the Soviets might cut those cables, forcing the unpredictable ionosphere to be the only means of communication with overseas forces. [...] So, a ring of 480,000,000copper dipole antennas (1.78 cm long needles, 25.4μm 1961 / 17.8μm 1963 <b>in</b> diameter) was <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> facilitate global radio communication. The length was chosen because it was half the wavelength of the 8 GHz signal used in the study. The dipoles collectively provided passive support to Project Westford's parabolic dish (located in the town of Westford) to communicate with distant sites. In 1958, at MIT’s Lincoln Lab, Walter E.

40|$|The {{results of}} this report {{indicate}} how niche product developments for Space Based Solar Power (SBSP) can be easily achieved using present day technology, which markets need to be addressed, which niche configurations to pursue, and which organizations have the needed competencies to proceed.  Classical SBSP concepts generally call for large rigid systems <b>to</b> be <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> collect and transmit several GW of energy down to Earth’s commercial electricity grid, and are still faced with many problems including system complexity, development, and costs. Smaller more specific niche applications of these concepts focus on different markets with lower complexity and barriers to entry while developing technologies and infrastructure needed for the classical SBSP. Technical research was performed {{in order to identify}} potential system configurations as well as crucial competencies and technologies needed by the SBSP effort. A pair of unique technical configurations was proposed in an attempt to mitigate standard SBSP challenges such as construction, rigidity, and launch costs. A strategic evaluation tool was created to evaluate all potential system configurations in terms of risk and complexity; ideal configurations were chosen based on anticipated markets and the results from the strategic analysis. Market research was performed in order to understand and valuate the utility of different niche configurations; these included the scientific, remote, green, space to space, and military markets. Very high value segments were observed in each of these market areas with a range of $ 0. 37 to $ 1. 88 USD per kwh for Terrestrial applications, and a range of $ 380. 00 to $ 1200. 00 per kwh for space applications. Exploration of the European Carbon Trading Exchange as a source of revenue is explored due to CO 2 offsets. A unique satellite product is proposed and valuated which receives energy directly from an external on orbit source. The value of restoring functionality to damaged satellites is estimated in the millions of dollars.

40|$|As more {{assets are}} <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>orbit,</b> {{opportunities}} emerge <b>to</b> combine various sets of satellites in temporary constellations to perform collaborative image collections. Often, new operations concepts for a satellite {{or set of}} satellites emerge after launch. To the degree with which new space assets can be inexpensively and rapidly integrated into temporary or "ad hoc" constellations, will determine whether these new ideas will be implemented or not. On the Earth Observing 1 (EO- 1) satellite, a New Millennium Program mission, a number of experiments were conducted and are being conducted to demonstrate various aspects of an architecture that, when taken as a whole, will enable progressive mission autonomy. In particular, the target architecture will use adaptive ground antenna arrays to form, as close as possible, the equivalent of wireless access points for low earth orbiting satellites. Coupled with various ground and flight software and the Internet. the architecture enables progressive mission autonomy. Thus, new collaborative sensing techniques can be implemented post-launch.

40|$|Abstract. The time {{of flight}} mass {{spectrometer}} of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) instrument aboard the Cassini spacecraft, is expected <b>to</b> be <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> about Saturn <b>to</b> sample the ring material and satellite impact ejecta. Upon impact of an incident dust particle against the target plate at velocities of 5 - 100 km/s, some 10 - 8 to 10 - 5 times the particle mass of positive valence, single-charged ions is induced. These are analyzed via a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Initial experiments employing a pulsed N 2 laser (> 300 µJ/pulse, 4 ns, 337 nm) acting on a suite of samples are described. The laser beam is focussed to deliver the light pulses onto a laser power density (1011 W/cm 2) to simulate the impact of particles. Laser ionization produced a charge of 4. 6 pC per pulse for aluminum alloy. Estimating that each Al+ 1 ion require energy of 5. 98 eV ionization energy/ion implies that 10 - 5 % of the laser energy produced ions and the present system has a 5 % efficiency of collecting the laser-irradiation induced ions. Employing a multi-channel plate detector in this mass spectrometer yields for Al-Mg-Cu alloy and kamacite (Fe-Ni mineral) targets well defined peaks at 24 (Mg+ 1), 27 (Al+ 1) and 64 (Cu+ 1), and 56 (Fe+ 1), 58 (Ni+ 1) and 60 (Ni+ 1) dalton, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{time-of-flight}} (TOF) {{mass spectrometer}} (MS) of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) instrument aboard the Cassini spacecraft is expected <b>to</b> be <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> about Saturn <b>to</b> sample submicrometer-diameter ring particles and impact ejecta from Saturn's satellites. The CDA measures a mass spectrum of each particle that impacts the chemical analyzer {{sector of the}} instrument. Particles impact a Rh target plate at velocities of 1 - 100 km/s and produce some 10 ^(− 8) to 10 ^(− 5) times the particle mass of positive valence, single-charged ions. These are analyzed via a TOF MS. Initial tests employed a pulsed N 2 laser acting on samples of kamacite, pyrrhotite, serpentine, olivine, and Murchison meteorite induced bursts of ions which were detected with a microchannel plate and a charge sensitive amplifier (CSA). Pulses from the N_ 2 laser (10 ^(11) W/cm^ 2) are assumed to simulate particle impact. Using aluminum alloy as a test sample, each pulse produces a charge of ∼ 4. 6 pC (mostly Al^(+ 1)), whereas irradiation of a stainless steel target produces a ∼ 2. 8 pC (Fe^(+ 1)) charge. Thus the present system yields ∼ 10 ^(− 5) % of the laser energy in resulting ions. A CSA signal indicates that at {{the position of the}} microchannel plate, the ion detector geometry is such that some 5 % of the laser-induced ions are collected in the CDA geometry. Employing a multichannel plate detector in this MS yields for Al-Mg-Cu alloy and kamacite targets well-defined peaks at 24 (Mg^(+ 1)), 27 (Al^(+ 1)), and 64 (Cu^(+ 1)) and 56 (Fe^(+ 1)), 58 (Ni^(+ 1)), and 60 (Ni^(+ 1)) dalton, respectively...|$|R
