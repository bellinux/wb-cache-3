5|$|Following a {{decision}} by John, the war with Russia ended in 1583 when the Tsar concluded the Truce of Plussa (Plyussa, Pljussa, Plusa) with Sweden. Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590. During the negotiations, Sweden made vast demands for Russian territory, including Novgorod. Whilst these conditions were <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> {{for the purposes of}} negotiation, they may have reflected Swedish aspirations of territory in the region.|$|E
5|$|It remains likely, however, {{that it was}} {{constructed}} by Gundulf, based primarily {{on the history of}} the land holdings during the period. After the founding of the abbey, which Gundulf granted some of his lands around West Malling, St Leonard's became the administrative centre of Gundulf's remaining estates, before also being given to the nuns a few years later, shortly after his death in 1108. In practice, <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> Gundulf would therefore have had the time or motivation to build such a keep during this period.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.|$|E

Reitz' ('By order of the State Secretary of the S.A.R., F.W. Reitz'). J.C. Smuts is {{indicated}} as author, but <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> edited the introduction {{and the end of the}} book, in co-operation with E. J. P. Jorissen. The rest of the text was probably prepared by J. de Villiers Roos.|$|E
5|$|The castle was not greatly used; the Marquess rarely visited {{after its}} completion. The {{property}} had <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> been intended for limited, informal use, for example as a retreat following picnics. Although it had reception rooms suitable for large gatherings, {{it had only}} three bedrooms and was too far from Cardiff for casual visits. The restored castle initially received little interest from the architectural community, possibly because the total rebuilding of the castle ran counter to the increasingly popular late-Victorian philosophy of conserving older buildings and monuments.|$|E
5|$|The earldom of Suffolk, says {{historian}} Michael Hicks, was 'not particularly well-endowed,' <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> just {{scraping the}} £666 qualifying income for that rank. His mother, though, held substantial estates {{in her own}} right, from her father, Sir Thomas Chaucer. Furthermore, because this was Alice's third marriage, she held large dowers from both previous husbands, the second {{of whom had been}} Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury.|$|E

5|$|Careful to {{maintain}} the initiative against the Byzantines, by 570 Alboin had taken their last defences in northern Italy except for the coastal areas of Liguria and Venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as Augusta Praetoria (Aosta), Segusio (Susa), and the island of Amacina in the Larius Lucus (Lake Como). During Alboin's kingship the Lombards crossed the Apennines and plundered Tuscia, but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding. According to Herwig Wolfram, it was <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> in 578–579 that Tuscany was conquered, but Jörg Jarnut and others believe this began in some form under Alboin, {{although it was not}} completed by the time of his death.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a {{week after}} the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on {{suspicion}} of being in a stolen car. It was a suspicion {{that turned out to be}} groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> had months to live.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{is passing}} through an ice age {{known as the}} {{quaternary}} glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene interglacial period. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay {{the onset of the}} next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use will cease by the year 2200) will <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.|$|E

5|$|The {{refusal of}} the United States {{government}} to take promised military action {{in the face of}} North Vietnamese violations of the cease-fire is also examined as a key to the defeat. Adherents to this claim believed that South Vietnam could have been saved by another U.S. bombing campaign. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches of the American government, already severe before the onset of the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more exasperating during 1975, when a new campaign would <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle is a 14th-century {{fortification}} on {{the coast}} of Northumberland in northern England, between the villages of Craster and Embleton. The castle was built by Earl Thomas of Lancaster between 1313 and 1322, taking advantage of the site's natural defences and the existing earthworks of an Iron Age fort. Thomas was a leader of a baronial faction opposed to King Edward II, and probably intended Dunstanburgh to act as a secure refuge, should the political situation in southern England deteriorate. The castle also served as a statement of the earl's wealth and influence, and would have invited comparisons with the neighbouring royal castle of Bamburgh. Thomas <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> visited his new castle once, before being captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge as he attempted to flee royal forces for the safety of Dunstanburgh. Thomas was executed, and the castle became the property of the Crown before passing into the Duchy of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Walpole {{moved into}} a house near Keswick in the Lake District. His large income enabled him to {{maintain}} his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, {{on the slopes of}} Catbells overlooking Derwentwater, was his main home {{for the rest of his}} life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into his fiction. The critic James Agate commented that one might think from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart-Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, with a wife and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole's service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted him completely, and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistical}} haul discovered, removed, {{or destroyed}} in eastern Cambodia during the operations was indeed prodigious: 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 to 8,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of ammunition (including 143,000 mortar shells, rockets, and recoilless rifle rounds); 29 tons of communications equipment; 431 vehicles; and 55 tons of medical supplies. MACV intelligence estimated that PAVN/NLF forces in southern Vietnam required 1,222 tons of all supplies each month {{to keep up}} a normal pace of operations. Due {{to the loss of}} its Cambodian supply system and continued aerial interdiction in Laos, MACV estimated that for every 2.5 tons of materiel sent south down the Ho Chi Minh trail, only one ton reached its destination. However, the true loss rate was <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> around ten percent. General Abrams claimed 11,000 enemy soldiers killed and 2,500 captured, but his figures were disputed by CIA, who insisted that civilians death were figured into Abrams's total.|$|E
5|$|The road {{followed}} by Alboin to reach Italy {{has been the}} subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the Poetovio – Celeia – Emona – Forum Iulii route, while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting Venetia, but it was <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> in 569 that the Julian Alps were crossed at the Vipava Valley; the eyewitness Secundus of Non gives the date as May 20 or 21. The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not void of difficulties however, and Jörg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.|$|E

5|$|Themistocles {{first went}} to live in exile in Argos. However, perceiving that they now had a prime {{opportunity}} to bring Themistocles down for good, the Spartans again levelled accusations of Themistocles's complicity in Pausanias's treason. They demanded that he be tried by the 'Congress of Greeks', rather than in Athens, although it seems {{that in the end}} he was actually summoned to Athens to stand trial. Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial, Themistocles fled, first to Kerkyra, and thence to Admetus, king of Molossia. Themistocles's flight <b>probably</b> <b>only</b> served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in Athens, his property to be confiscated. It should be noted that both Diodorus and Plutarch considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying Themistocles. The Spartans sent ambassadors to Admetus, threatening that the whole of Greece would go to war with the Molossians unless they surrendered Themistocles. Admetus, however, allowed Themistocles to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way. Themistocles then fled from Greece, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.|$|E
