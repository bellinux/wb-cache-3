5|$|The corn crake is a {{difficult}} bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for <b>poultry</b> <b>feed</b> once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so {{than that of the}} African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the open, this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may feign death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.|$|E

25|$|Aflatoxins are {{poisonous}} carcinogens {{that are}} produced by certain molds (Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus) which grow in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains. They are regularly found in improperly stored staple commodities such as cassava, chili peppers, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sesame seeds, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, {{and a variety of}} spices. When contaminated food is processed, aflatoxins enter the general food supply where they have been found in both pet and human foods, as well as in feedstocks for agricultural animals. Animals fed contaminated food can pass aflatoxin transformation products into eggs, milk products, and meat.

40|$|Five {{different}} commercial <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds</b> namely, broiler finisher, broiler starter, broiler super starter, grower mash and layer top mash {{obtained from}} their trade outlets in Akure, Nigeria were examined for their microbiological and physicochemical qualities using standard microbiological and analytical methods. The bacterial count was highest in broiler starter with 2. 50 H 10 4 cfu mLG 1, while the least count of 6. 60 H 10 2 cfu mLG 1 {{was recorded in}} layer top mash. Fungal count was highest in layer top mash (7. 40 H 10 2 sfu mLG 1) and least in grower mash (1. 50 H 10 2 sfu mLG 1). A total of seventeen microorganisms were isolated which include Aerobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Erwinia amylovora, Mirococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, Acaulopa macrospore, Cladosporium fulvum, Dotchiza populae, Fusarium sp., Geotrichium candidum, Pleurophrgmium sp., Rhizopus stolonifer, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Transmission of Cr from feed to egg and various parts of chicken were investigated with chicken samples of different ages grown by feeding “Adorsho feed”. An average of 4. 3 ppm of Cr was found in Yolk and 2. 7 ppm was found in the egg-white. Highest concentration of Cr was found to be 5. 9 ppm in the brain of 29 -days old chicken. The concentration of Cr was different in various parts of chicken depending on its age.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{incidence}} of Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) organisms in <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds</b> sold in Calabar metropolis, Nigeria. Twenty samples of <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds</b> were purchased from different locations and analyzed microbiologically using standard methods. Significant enough to note is the microbial loads of these <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds,</b> which were quite high 1. 232 x 109 cfu/g (Top feeds) and 1. 03 x 108 cfu/g (Vitals feeds). Eight bacteria isolates were obtained and identified as Bacillus sp. [3 (15. 0 %) ], Escherichia coli [2 (10. 0 %) ], Nocardia sp. [2 (10. 0 %) ], Salmonella sp. [3 (15. 0 %) ], Proteus mirabilis [2 (10. 0 %) ], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [4 (20. 0 %) ], Staphylococcus aureus [2 (10. 0 %) ], and Streptococcus pyogenes [2 (10. 0 %) ]. The antibiotics susceptibility profile showed that S. aureus and S. pyogenes were more susceptible (75 %) to the test antibiotics, followed by E. coli (72. 7 %), Nocardia sp. (58. 3 %) and Proteus mirabilis (54. 5 %). All gram-positive isolates were resistant to ampiclox (100 %) and sensitive to streptomycin and ciprocin (100 %) while all gram negative isolates were resistant to tetracycline and ampicillin (100 %). However, all isolates satisfied the most common multidrug resistance patterns (> 3 antibiotics resistant). Generally, significantly higher number of multidrugresistant Pseudomonas [10 (90. 1 %) ], Bacillus sp. [9 (83. 3 %) ], Salmonella sp. [8 (72. 7 %) ], P. mirabilis [5 (45. 5 %) ], and Nocardia sp. [5 (41. 7 %) ] were noted in this study. Low resistance rates was observed for E. coli [3 (27. 3 %) ], S. aureus and S. pyogenes [3 (25 %) ] {{was found in the}} <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds.</b> The MIC values of tetracycline of the isolates ranged from 0. 13 - 8. 00 mcg/ml. Among all the test organisms only S. aureus (25 %) was susceptible to tetracycline at an MIC value of 0. 13 mcg/ml. This showed that 75 % of the bacterial species exhibited an MIC value of 0. 25 - 8. 00 mcg/ml. To reduce the effect of these MDR organisms in poultry feeds; antibiotics incorporated into feeds should be in synergistic combinations, as this will prevent the possibility of resistance development. The findings of this study confirm the presence of multi-drug resistant organisms in animal feeds sold in N igeria. It significantly points to the great need to evaluate and monitor the incidence rate of multi-drugs (antibiotics) resistant organisms in <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds...</b>|$|R
