25|$|Larvae are {{not easily}} {{distinguished}} from the larvae of other tortricid leafrollers; only DNA testing is a certain identification method. The first larval instar has a dark brown head; all other instars have a light fawn head and <b>prothoracic</b> <b>plate.</b> Overwintering larvae are darker. First instar larvae are approximately 1.6mm long, and final instar larvae range from 10â€“18mm in length. The body of a mature larva is medium green with a darker green central stripe and two side stripes.|$|E

50|$|Head and <b>pro{{thoracic}}</b> <b>plate</b> black, anal plate greyish brown, thoracic legs pale brown, body greyish white.|$|E
50|$|The larva have a pale, {{yellowish}} green body, {{a slightly}} orange-brown {{head and a}} <b>prothoracic</b> shield (the <b>plate</b> of the first thoracic segment just behind the head). The prothoracic shield has light gray margins on the sides. There are many small, dark green spots conspicuously displayed along the body. The larva grow up to 7 mm long.|$|R

50|$|The larvae feed on Salix, Quercus, Tilia, Ulmus, Betula, Acer rubrum, and Hamamelis virginiana. They have {{a yellow}} head, <b>prothoracic,</b> <b>plate</b> and dorsal glands. The body {{is covered in}} whitish hairs and the verrucae (wart-like {{structures}} on the body) are pale yellow.|$|E

40|$|Larvae of Phyllocnistis unipunctella (Stephens) mining the upperside and {{underside}} of leaves of Populus spp. were compared {{in terms of}} gross morphology and the COI DNA barcoding section of mitochondrial DNA. It was discovered that larvae feeding on the underside did not show the dark pigmentation of the <b>prothoracic</b> <b>plate</b> {{as described in the}} literature. Larvae were found feeding two months earlier than normal and at least one extra generation was observed. More work isrequired to determine the possibility ofspeciation...|$|E
