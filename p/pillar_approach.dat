40|$|BACKGROUND: Anaemia is {{a common}} health problem among {{pregnant}} women and a contributing factor with {{a major influence on}} maternal mortality in Indonesia. The Four <b>Pillars</b> <b>Approach</b> is a new approach to anaemia in pregnancy, combining four strategies to improve antenatal and delivery care. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} measure the effectiveness of the Four <b>Pillars</b> <b>Approach.</b> The barriers, the facilitators, and the patients' as well as the midwives' satisfaction with the Four <b>Pillars</b> <b>Approach</b> will also be measured. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will use a cluster randomised controlled trial. This intervention study will be conducted in the Public Health Centres with basic emergency obstetric care in Yogyakarta Special Province and in Central Java Province. We will involve all the Public Health Centres (24) with emergency obstetric care in Yogyakarta Special Province. Another 24 Public Health Centres with emergency obstetric care in Central Java Province which have similarities in their demographic, population characteristics, and facilities will also be involved. Each Public Health Centre will be asked to choose two or three nurse-midwives to participate in this study. For the intervention group, the Public Health Centres in Yogyakarta Special Province, training on the Four <b>Pillars</b> <b>Approach</b> will be held prior to the model's implementation. Consecutively, we will recruit 360 pregnant women with anaemia to take part in part in the study to measure the effectiveness of the intervention. The outcome measurements are the differences in haemoglobin levels between the intervention and control groups in the third trimester of pregnancy, the frequency of antenatal care attendance, and the presence of a nurse-midwife during labour. Qualitative data will be used to investigate the barriers and facilitating factors, as to nurse-midwives' satisfaction with the implementation of the Four <b>Pillars</b> <b>Approach.</b> DISCUSSION: If the Four <b>Pillars</b> <b>Approach</b> is effective in improving the outcome for pregnant women with anaemia, this approach could be implemented nationwide and be taken into consideration to improve the outcome for other conditions in pregnancy, after further research.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{delineate}} alternative e-health futures for public health policymaking in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used in the paper is the Six <b>Pillars</b> <b>approach</b> to explore alternative and preferred futures for the establishment of a health information system and e-health provision in Bangladesh. Findings: There is a great deal of potential for encouraging participatory engagement between various stakeholders in Bangladesh's public health policymaking. The Six <b>Pillars</b> <b>approach</b> is used not only to enhance this participatory approach but also to examine various discourses and different stakeholder voices to create four alternative futures for e-health delivery in Bangladesh: first, leap-frog 2025; second, e-health car 2025; third, health cloud 2025; and fourth, e-health political party aimed at optimizing the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on one hand and ensuring widened access and participation on the other. Practical implications: The alternative scenarios identify four possible ways of bringing together society, government and business to achieve positive public health outcomes by creating an open, trust-based and efficient e-health system, not only in Bangladesh but also in other developing countries. The scenarios challenge health business as usual and used futures. Social implications: The paper aims to communicate a humane public approach to the issue of health which envisages using modern ICTs to maximize democratic access to the public health system and reduce health marginalization in Bangladesh. Originality/value: The paper is a pioneering attempt to use Six Pillars for public health policymaking in Bangladesh. It is based on the first e-health workshop in Bangladesh. 13 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|Between 1982 and 1984, Carl Baundenbacher was a Legal Secretary at Bulach District Court, Switzerland. He {{served as}} a member of the Supreme Court of the Principality of Liechtenstein between 1994 and 1995. In 1995 he was {{appointed}} Judge of the Court of Justice of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) upon a proposal of the Principality of Liechtenstein. Since 2003 Baudenbacher has served as the Court's President. The EFTA Court hears cases originating from the EFTA States which are Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement (currently Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The EEA Agreement has extended the EU single market to those EFTA States. It is based in a two <b>pillar</b> <b>approach.</b> Both pillars, the EU pillar and the EFTA pillar, have their own surveillance authority and their own court. EEA law which has been implemented into the legal orders of the EEA/EFTA States is capable of having direct effect and eventually takes precedence over conflicting national law. The EFTA Court has also recognized EEA State liability. Moreover, EEA law must be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights. The EFTA Court is bound by homogeneity rules to follow or to take into account relevant ECJ case law. In the majority of its cases, it is, however, faced with novel legal questions and consequently has to ‘go first.’ There are countless references by the ECJ, its Advocates General, the General Court and high courts in Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Switzerland. In practice, the one-sided written homogeneity rules have largely been superseded by a [...] "unique judicial dialogue" [...] (ECJ Advocate General Verica Trstenjak). President Baudenbacher participated in roughly 250 cases stemming from the whole range of EEA law, from fundamental freedoms (goods, persons, services, self-employed and companies, capital) to competition law and State aid law to harmonized economic law). Frequently described as a very influential member of the EFTA Court, Baudenbacher acted as the Reporting Judge in a number of landmark cases including E-29/15 Sorpa; E-14/15 Holship Norge AS v Norsk Transportarbeiderforbund; E-4/15 Icelandic Financial Services Association v ESA; E-27/13 Gunnarsson; E-25/13; Engilbertsson; E-15/12 Wahl; E-16/11 Icesave; E-14/11 DB Schenker; E-15/10 Posten Norge; E-9/11 Regulated Markets I; E-18/11 Irish Bank; E-14/10 Konkurrenten; E-1/10 Periscopus; E-1/06 Gaming Machines; E-3/06 Ladbrokes; E-4/04 Pedicel; E-1/04 Fokus Bank; E-2/03 Ásgeirsson; E-3/02Paranova v Merck; E-3/00 Kelloggs; E-1/99 Finanger; E-1/98 Astra Norge; E-3/97 Opel Norge; E-2/97 Maglite.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the notion of {{sustainability}} has become an interdisciplinary buzz word. Sustainability has been an integrative concept that includes three constructs or pillars: a) social; b) economic; and c) ecological. Until recently, theoretical approaches based on the three <b>pillars</b> <b>approach</b> have operated in silos rather than exploring the interconnectedness of the constructs. Few models have moved beyond the idea that logical relations exist among the constructs (social, economic, and ecological) to consider factors external to communities, nor have they examined the internal socio-economic factors that influence positive outcomes. While this conceptualization has raised awareness about the distribution of scarce resources, {{it has not been}} useful in creating resilient and sustainable development. The model proposed in this paper is theoretically driven and considers the multifaceted concepts of ecological perspectives and risk and resilience. In addition, unlike previous conceptual representations, the model suggested in this paper offers opportunities for intervention to decrease risk, promote community cohesion, and encourage social change through empirical investigation...|$|R
40|$|Through a {{historical}} {{case study of}} the internationalization of large English law firms in Italy, this paper uses Scott’s three <b>pillars</b> <b>approach</b> (2005) {{to look at how}} local institutions constrain and mediate the strategies and practices of professional services firms (PSFs). In doing so, it corrects the economic bias in the growing body of literature on the internationalization of PSFs by stressing how local regulations, norms and cultural frameworks affect the reproduction of home country practices, such as the one firm model pursued by large English law firms, in host-country jurisdictions. The paper also extends existing work on institutional duality (Kostova, 1999, Kostova and Roth, 2002) by developing a fine grained, micro level analysis which emphasizes the connections between institutions and practices. This is crucial, we contend, since the difficulties encountered by PSFs (and multinationals more generally) in their internationalization do not result from collisions between home- and host-country institutional structures per se, but between the diverse practices generated by distant institutional environments...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, Mexico {{passed a}} {{national}} drug policy reform decriminalizing {{the possession of}} small amounts of certain drugs for personal use {{with the aim of}} diverting drug-dependent individuals from prison and towards addiction treatment. However, the public health approach codified by the reform has not yet led to a meaningful change in local police practices nor contributed to the meaningful scale-up of harm reduction and addiction treatment services in many Mexican cities. Specifically, in Tijuana, Baja California, there continues to be a variety of local level barriers – including arbitrary police behaviours – that hinder the ability of people who inject drugs (PWID) from accessing vital harm reduction services. This has implications for the growing HIV epidemic in Mexico’s northern border region, given that access to harm reduction interventions has been shown to effectively reduce the risk of HIV infection among PWID. In contrast to the largely enforcement-based local response seen in Tijuana, the municipal Four <b>Pillars</b> <b>approach</b> implemented in Vancouver, Canada in 2001 was passed as a public-health oriented response to the rising prevalence of HIV/AIDS among PWID in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. Centered on the balancing of four approaches – harm reduction, treatment, prevention and enforcement – the Four <b>Pillars</b> <b>approach</b> in Vancouver has led to a well-resourced local harm reduction and addiction treatment system. This local emphasis on harm reduction contrasts with the Canadian Conservative federal government’s opposition to harm reduction approaches. However, police-public health partnerships along with strong political support have led to the substantial scale up of harm reduction services as well as the reduction of HIV/AIDS among PWID in Vancouver, unlike what has been observed in Tijuana. This commentary therefore aims to assess the discrepancies between federal policy and local responses to drug-related harms in order to fully understand the impact and implications of national drug policies in shaping local response to drug related harms among populations of PWID. Through a comparison of the drug policy landscape in two cities linked by a large North American drug trafficking route - Tijuana, Mexico and Vancouver, Canada, - this commentary suggests that drug policy reform in and of itself will have little impact at the local level unless it is appropriately resourced and meaningfully supported by key stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|AIFIRM {{believes}} that the a <b>Pillar</b> 2 <b>approach,</b> where banks are allowed, subject to supervisory approval, to use internal measurement systems (IMS) for assessing their ability to cover potential losses from IRRBB, is the best suited option. In fact, the standardization associated with a <b>Pillar</b> 1 <b>approach</b> {{would lead to a}} lower precision of the risk exposure estimate and a poorer comprehension of the factors that determine it. By adopting a <b>Pillar</b> 1 <b>approach,</b> there is a higher probability that banks set aside an amount of internal capital that either underestimates or overestimates its appropriate amount, entailing a potential threat to the overall banking stability and an unnecessary reduction in lending capacity, respectively. AIFIRM welcomes the consideration of multiple scenarios because it is a step forward in the comprehension of risk determinants. The new mathematical framework allows to obtain a measure of risk exposure that is more consistent with the level of interest rates observed on the evaluation date and, therefore, represents an important improvement, if compared with the current one, which is based on unrealistic duration coefficients. The new framework can also be easily integrated within banks’ IMS for the implementation of more sophisticated methodologies. The Association {{believes that}} option n. 4 is the best-suited among those proposed by the Committee to calculate minimum capital requirements because it allows the net interest profit (NIP) to reduce minimum capital requirements associated with the change to economic value of equity (EVE) and earnings. This approach is based on the presence of many positions characterized by locked-in margins, which will generate a positive interest income even when EVE is at its highest. Following this method, minimum capital requirements are more consistent with banks’ actual riskiness and banks’ credit supply is calibrated in a more appropriate way. Within a <b>Pillar</b> 2 <b>approach,</b> minimum capital requirements may be based on both: i) stressed scenarios of changes in the key-rates that are consistent with the six proposed scenarios, in terms of both shock magnitude and structure, and ii) scenarios obtained through banks’ internal measurement systems. However, AIFIRM believes that further discussions and analyses on the NIP calibration are necessary. As concerns the treatment of the items characterized by behavioral options, AIFIRM recognizes the utility of introducing some constraints in modelling non-maturity deposits (NMDs), even in cases of banks’ own internal representations, since they could contribute to the reduction of the model risk. However, they seem to be too conservative giving rise, even in the discretionary approach, to a unique representation of NMDs. According to AIFIRM, based on the analysis of historical data of the Italian banking market: i) the allocation of the repricing component of NMDs may be led by the interest rate pass-through that follows a change in the reference market rate; ii) the core component of NMDs should include not only the fraction of non-maturity deposits that are stable, but also the portion that reprice, with a certain sluggishness, when the reference market rate changes. Finally, as regards positions other than NMDs, the Association agrees with the choice to model their optionalities using a two step approach. Within the supported solution of an enhanced Pillar 2 capital framework, AIFIRM believes that public disclosure on a regular basis of a bank’s IRRBB risk profile, key measurement assumptions, qualitative and quantitative assessment of IRRBB levels and quantitative disclosure of IRRBB metrics, is crucial. Banks should describe in detail the qualitative information required in BCBS (2015) for disclosure purposes since these are issues of particular relevance in estimating banks' risk exposure. As for the quantitative information, if appropriate public disclosure is important, disclosure of standardized calculation could be misleading. By using the standardized calculation, the proposed <b>Pillar</b> 2 <b>approach</b> is no different from the proposed Pillar 1. Supporting a “true” <b>Pillar</b> II <b>approach,</b> AIFIRM believes that banks' internal measurement and management of IRRBB are those which ought to be disclosed. This document is organized as follows: paragraph 1 comments on the choice between a Pillar 1 and a Pillar 2 solutions; in section 2, we discuss some of the main issues associated with the interest rate scenario design; section 3 deals with the specification of minimum capital requirements; in section 4 we analyze the treatment of the positions with behavioral options; section 5 provides some comments on the disclosure requirements...|$|R

Special attention is given to the Environmental Consequences Analysis of Major Defense Acquisition Programs Act. The study finds that environmental finding increased moderately in the 1980 s, then rose significantly in the early 1990 s. By fiscal year 1994, the cumulative decline in total defense spending and congressional dissatisfaction with DoD environmental restoration policy ended the growth in environmental security budgets. Congress encouraged DoD to reduce environmental costs by improving, or "greening" the acquisition process. Defense environmental programs are vulnerable to reduction because they are seen as marginal to security during a period of budget austerity. U. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|E

Importantly, it introduced operational risk as a standalone {{area of the}} bank which {{for the first time}} was required to be measured, managed and capital allocated to calculated operational risks. Concurrently, Solvency II regulation in the insurance industry was also re-imagining regulations within the insurance industry and also developing operational risk measures. Given that Basel II was first published in 2004 and Solvency II was set to go live in January 2014. This paper analyses the strategic challenges of Basel II in the UK banking sector and then uses the results to inform a survey of a major UK insurance provider. We report that the effectiveness of Basel II was based around: the reliance upon people for effective decision making; the importance of good training for empowerment of staff; the importance of Board level engagement; and an individual's own world view and perceptions influenced the adoption of an organizational risk culture. We then take the findings to inform a survey utilizing structural equation modelling to analyze risk reporting and escalation in a large UK insurance company. The results indicate that attitude and uncertainty significantly affect individual's intention to escalate operational risk and that if not recognized by insurance companies and regulators will hinder the effectiveness of Solvency II implementation...|$|E
40|$|The ASSESS {{study is}} about the “Assessment of the {{contribution}} of the TEN and other transport policy measures to the mid-term implementation of the White Paper on the European Transport Policy for 2010 ”. The European Commission’s White Paper of 12. 9. 2001 “European transport policy for 2010 : time to decide” aims to promote a sustainable transport policy. The White Paper proposes to achieve sustainability by gradually breaking the link between transport growth and economic growth, principally in three ways: changing the modal split in the long term, clearing infrastructure bottlenecks and placing safety and quality {{at the heart of the}} transport policy. As foreseen, the White Paper on Transport undergoes in 2005 an overall assessment concerning the implementation of the measures it advocates and to check whether its targets - for example, on modal split or road safety - and objectives are being attained or whether adjustments are needed. ASSESS provides technical support to the Commission services for the above mid-term assessment of the White Paper. The analysis accounts for the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed measures and their contribution to sustainable development objectives. It provides also a detailed analysis of those effects of enlargement likely to affect the structure and performance of the EU transport system.

High rates of poor maternal mental health, with maternal depression the most prevalent condition, {{have been reported in}} the low and middle income countries, including Pakistan. Though evidence based interventions exist to address maternal depression, these have not been translated into policy because of various implementation barriers. Integration of these interventions into existing maternal and child health (MCH) programmes has been suggested as a strategy to provide accessible care to mothers. In the current study we developed and integrated a cognitive behavioural therapy–based MPW intervention (the 5 <b>pillars</b> <b>approach)</b> into a child nutrition and development program. Following qualitative research with community health workers (CHWs) and families, CHWs were trained in (1) empathic listening, (2) family engagement, (3) guided discovery using pictures, (4) behavioural activation, and (5) problem solving. A qualitative feasibility study in one area demonstrated that CHWs were able to apply these skills effectively to their work, and the approach was found to be useful by CHWs and mothers. This work provides vital information on the lessons learnt in the implementation of a maternal psychosocial wellbeing intervention for universal use. The facilitating factors included mothers being the central focus of the intervention, utilizing existing local CHWs whom the mothers trust, simple training and regular supervision, and an approach that facilitates, and does not add, to the CHWs’ work...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of III-V nanowires and pillar-structures on silicon is a promising approach for realizing low cost, large scale III-V photovoltaics. However, performances of III-V nanowire solar cells {{have not yet}} been as good as their bulk counterparts, as nanostructured light absorbers are fundamentally challenged by enhanced minority carriers surface recombination rates. The resulting nonradiative losses lead to significant reductions in the quantum yield for external spontaneous emission, which, in turn, manifest as penalties in the open-circuit voltage. In this work, calibrated photoluminescence measurements are utilized to construct equivalent voltage/current characteristics relating illumination intensities to Fermi-level splitting &# 916;F inside InP microillars. Fermi-level splitting is a good indicator of what voltage can be achieved in a given material. Under 1 -sun, we show that splitting can be close to &# 916;F~ 0. 89 eV in undoped pillars. Several strategies to increase the external quantum yield are tested. By cleaning pillar surfaces in acidic etchants the splitting can be increased to &# 916;F~ 0. 96 eV. Pillars with nano-textured surfaces can yield splitting of &# 916;F~ 0. 92 eV. Finally, by introducing n-dopants, &# 916;F greater than 1 eV can be achieved, which is due to larger a wider bandgap energy in n-doped Wurzite InP, the increaesed brightness of doped materials, as well as the extraordinarily low surface recombination velocity of InP. These results provide further evidence that InP micropillars on silicon could be a promising material for low-cost, large scale solar cells with high efficiency. Furthermore, strategies for mitigating shunt-path formation in pillar devices have been studied; during the growth of pn-junctions care has to be taken that the core-shell growth mode of the micropillars will not result in a pn-junction where both sides of the junction will be in direct contact with the substrate. It was found that regrowth can be used to prevent such shunt paths between the substrate and the shell of the pillars. Under monochromatic illumination equivalent to 1 sun, open-circuit voltages of larger than 0. 604 V could be achieved, which is compares well to other state-of the art results for III-V nanowire solar cells. The discrepancy between the achieved open-circuit voltage and the results from the contactless I-V measurements is explained with unoptimized device design. For further improvement it could be necessary to bury the pn-junction inside higher bandgap materials, and to use n-doped InP material as the light absorber. Akin to Moore's law in the IC industry, it is believed that next-generation optical components will become more and more integrated onto chips, and perhaps even become integrated with silicon CMOS-electronics. The core-shell growth mode allows for the {{synthesis of}} single-crystalline III-V pillar-structures on silicon substrates, offering a pathway for monolithic, CMOS-compatible on-chip integration of active optical components. The viability of the <b>pillar</b> <b>approach</b> has been previously underlined by demonstration of lasers, light emitting diodes, and avalanche-photo-detectors. In this work, the modes of nanopillar lasers are studied in detail; it was found that modes with high azimuthal quantum numbers can exhibit quality factors of the order of 102, which is sufficiently high to achieve lasing at room temperature under pulsed optical pumping. Continuous-wave operation of optically pumped lasers could be demonstrated at 4 K temperature as well. The radiation pattern of lasing modes are observed in experiments, and in combination with polarization measurements and Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations all quantum numbers of the modes could be identified. Strategies to enhance the quality factor for modes with low azimuthal quantum numbers are discussed as well. The atomically sharp tips makes nanoneedles attractive for applications requiring electric field enhancements such as Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). The possibility of using the nanoneedle structure for Superfocusing was studied in simulations. In FDTD simulations {{it was found that the}} needles could allow for electric intensity enhancements of the order of 106, showing that nanoneedles could be a promising structure for delivering optical power to nanoscale dimensions. Due to the Wurtzite crystal structure nanoneedles exhibit selection rules for nonlinear light generation that are different from selection rules of bulk III-V materials, which exhibit the more common Zincblende phase. Polarization measurements were performed to confirm the Wurtzite selection rules in the pillar material. Potential applications for nonlinear light generation using nanoneedles could be in imaging. Another nanophotonic structure attractive for nonlinear optics are high-contrast gratings. In this work, second harmonic generation from AlGaAs near-wavelength high-contrast gratings was studied in polarization-dependent reflection measurements. The grating design was found to be critical in determining the strength and polarization dependence of the second harmonic signal. The second harmonic response was enhanced by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to flat AlGaAs surfaces without gratings. These enhancements are due to the diffractive nature of the gratings, specifically their ability to change the direction of light waves...|$|E
50|$|Zu Mao {{was born}} in Wu Commandery in Yang Province {{and was one of}} the first generals to join Sun Jian. When Sun Jian's army {{attacked}} Liangdong (梁東), Xu Rong was sent by Dong Zhuo to defend the area. Xu Rong led a quick surprise attack and Sun Jian was forced to flee. However, Sun Jian was unable to shake off pursuit, and Zu Mao exchanged headgear with Sun Jian. The soldiers under Xu Rong chased Zu Mao, allowing Sun Jian to escape. Zu Mao later hung Sun Jian's headgear onto a half-burnt pillar, and hid himself in tall grass nearby. The enemies surrounded the <b>pillar</b> and <b>approached</b> cautiously till they realized they had been fooled, whereupon they retreated. Zu Mao's fate was not documented.|$|R
40|$|Many {{things in}} current {{interstellar}} dust studies are taken as well understood givens by {{much of the}} community. For example, it is widely held that interstellar dust {{is made up of}} only three components, i. e., astronomical silicates, graphite and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and that our understanding of these is now complete and sufficient enough to interpret astronomical observations of dust in galaxies. To zeroth order this is a reasonable approximation. However, while these three pillars of dust modelling have been useful in advancing our understanding over the last few decades, it is now apparent that they are insufficient to explain the observed evolution of the dust properties from one region to another. Thus, it is time to abandon the three <b>pillars</b> <b>approach</b> and to seek more physically-realistic interstellar dust analogues. The analy- sis of the pre-solar grains extracted from meteorites, interplanetary dust particles and from the Stardust mission, and the interpretation of x-ray scattering and absorption observations, supports the view that our current view of the interstellar dust composition(s) is indeed too naive. The aim of this review is to point out where our current views are rather secure and, perhaps more importantly, where they are far from secure and we must re-think our ideas. To this aim ten as- pects of interstellar dust will be scrutinised and re-evaluated in terms of their validity within the current observational, experimental, modelling and theoretical constraints. It is concluded from this analysis that we really do need to re-assess many of the fundamental assumptions relating to what we think we really do know about interstellar dust. In particular, it is clear that unravelling the nature dust evolution in the interstellar medium is perhaps the key to significantly advancing our current understanding of interstellar dust. [...] .

40|$|In the {{ten years}} since the University of NSW {{proposed}} a pillar design methodology for bord and pillar operations, the Australian coal mining industry has changed substantially. What was primarily a bord and <b>pillar</b> design <b>approach</b> is now being applied to chain pillar design in longwall mines where the requirements are substantially different. The dimensions of chain pillars can impact on tailgate conditions (roof, rib and floor), seal performance, and surface subsidence. The status of chain pillar design practice in Australia is reviewed, {{with a focus on}} defining pillar strength, chain pillar loading, and assessing the performance of the roof/pillar/system. A new pillar strength equation is proposed for Australian coal that applies for all width/height ratios. An alternative analysis of probability of failure of chain pillars is presented...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Many, indeed {{probably}} most, {{decisions made}} in societies have intended and unintended health outcomes; this alone provides sufficient reasoning {{to ensure that}} health professionals are engaged in these decisions rather than deal with the consequences at a later date. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) provides one approach to ensuring that health outcomes of decisions {{are taken into account}} (Harris- Roxas et al., 2012). Harris- Roxas et al. (2012) show that historically HIA has emerged from three strands: environmental health concerns (where the environment has an effect on human health); the social determinants of health (where the concern is the ‘upstream’ causes of ‘downstream’ health conditions); and a focus on health equity (where interventions can address or promote health equity through planning). When any of these strands are performed effectively, or even more, when the three might be combined, the capacity to produce a powerful analysis of health consequences can be envisaged. HIA has considerable value as a proactive and systematic approach to identifying the health impacts of projects, programmes, plans and policies, including those associated with resource development (Utzinger et al., 2005; Winkler et al., 2012; Parkes, 2016). An overarching theme in the development of HIA has been the engagement by the public health sector in non- health sector activities (Harris- Roxas et al., 2012; Harris- Roxas and Harris, 2013; Lee et al., 2013), and this intrinsically demands interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches capable of seeking both to minimize negative health effects and to enhance positive health effects (Winkler et al., 2010). In their work on sustainability assessment, Bond et al. (2012) expand on this latter point, outlining a series of reasons why more integrative, deliberative and positive approaches to ‘impacts’ are desirable. They cite the shortfalls of focusing on mitigation and minimizing impacts (as compared to a systems approach), and emphasize the value of going beyond the <b>pillars</b> <b>approach</b> of sustainability (which encourages trade- offs), and working to deliver net sustainability gains (through greater system health and resilience over the long term) ...|$|R
