25|$|In 1794, Gallatin {{was hearing}} rumors of mass exodus of Europeans fleeing the French Revolution. An idea struck his fancy: <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> develop a {{settlement}} for these emigrants. Throughout {{the spring and}} summer of 1795 Gallatin pondered, planned and finally selected Wilson's Port, a small river town located one mile (1.6km) north of his Friendship Hill. Collecting four other investors, three of them also Swiss, Gallatin had the partnership incorporated as Albert Gallatin & Company. Together they purchased Wilson's Port, Georgetown and vacant lots across the river in Greensboro. The partners named their new settlement New Geneva. With a company store, glassworks, gun factory, sawmill, gristmill, winery, distillery, and a boat yard along Georges Creek, the partners awaited the rush of settlers. The only successful industry of Gallatin's was the glassworks.|$|E
25|$|At Stellenbosch Du Plessis was {{initially}} {{more interested in}} cricket than rugby; he had chosen to go there because of his desire {{to play in the}} university cricket team. In 1971 his prowess at cricket earned him selection to the South African Universities cricket side, and then to the Western Province team during that same year. Playing five first-class cricket matches as a right-arm medium pace bowler, he took 16 wickets at an average of 25.62 runs per wicket, and turned in a best performance of 4 wickets for 71 runs. But when Barry Richards, opening batsman of the South African and of the Natal cricket sides, hit Du Plessis for two sixes in the final over before lunch during a Castle Cup match between Western Province and Natal, he decided that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> rather concentrate on rugby.|$|E
25|$|In The Book of J (1990), he and David Rosenberg (who {{translated}} the Biblical texts) portrayed {{one of the}} posited ancient documents that {{formed the basis of}} the first five books of the bible (see documentary hypothesis) as the work of a great literary artist who had no intention of composing a dogmatically religious work (see Jahwist). They further envisaged this anonymous writer as a woman attached to the court of the successors of the Israelite kings David and Solomon—a piece of speculation which drew much attention. Later, Bloom said that the speculations didn't go far enough, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have identified J with the Biblical Bathsheba. In Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine (2004), he revisits some of the territory he covered in The Book of J in discussing the significance of Yahweh and Jesus of Nazareth as literary characters, while casting a critical eye on historical approaches and asserting the fundamental incompatibility of Christianity and Judaism.|$|E

50|$|Nathanael Richards (fl. 1630-1654) was an English dramatist and poet, <b>perhaps</b> from Kent. <b>He</b> <b>should</b> not be {{confused}} with Nathaniel Richards (1611-1660), a cleric.|$|R
25|$|As {{the rain}} {{continued}} on March 30, Grant sent {{a note to}} Sheridan {{in which he said}} that cavalry operations seemed to be impossible and <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> leave enough men to hold his position and return to Humphreys' Station for forage. He even suggested going by way of Stony Creek Station to destroy or capture Confederate supplies there. Sheridan responded by going to Grant's headquarters which had been moved forward to near the Vaughan Road crossing of Gravelly Run on the night of March 30 to urge him to press ahead regardless of the weather and road conditions. In fact, when Devin's men had been driven back from Five Forks, they had encamped about a mile away at the John Boisseau house. During their discussions, Grant told Sheridan he would send him the V Corps for infantry support and that his new orders were not to extend the line further but to turn the Confederate flank and to break Lee's army. Sheridan wanted the VI Corps which had fought with him in the Shenandoah Valley. Grant told him that the VI Corps was too far from his position to make the move.|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiography, Hand {{concedes that}} this was perhaps a mistake and that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have re-negotiated the offer. In the foreword, Sather {{expressed}} his disappointment that [...] "he didn't accept my deal because he could have advanced in North America. His progress would have been celebrated." [...] Indeed, Sather also says [...] "At the training camp I {{could see that he}} had a great ability to read the ice and he was the smartest player there other than Wayne Gretzky. He skated well: his intelligence on the ice stood out. He was a real prospect." ...|$|E

"His {{parents took}} the name Legg {{from the street}} they used to live in... the tough time came in the mid-thirties when the extreme right and Mosley on one hand, and the {{persecution}} of the Jews in Europe on the other, forced him as a bright teenager to become positively aware of racism, freedom and persecution. He didn't become a communist, he didn't start hating all Germans — but he did stop going to the Synagogue... he decided as he approached seventeen to become a doctor... <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been a musician? Like his uncle Leon... He saw the air raid casualties... it reinforced his passion for the underdog... he met {{and fell in love}} with a young (non-Jewish) nurse - they were married when he was twenty-one... She was in the garden when a dog-fight took place overhead, and the German pilot dropped his bomb in order to get away. The corner of the Square went — so did she." [...] (page 53) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, {{shortly before}} leaving office, de Gaulle refused to devalue the Franc {{on grounds of}} {{national}} prestige, but upon taking over Pompidou reversed the decision almost straight away. It was ironic, that during the financial crisis of 1968, France {{had to rely on}} American (and West German) financial aid to help shore up the economy. Perry has written [...] "The events of 1968 illustrated the brittleness of de Gaulle's rule. That he was taken by surprise is an indictment of his rule; he was too remote from real life and had no interest in the conditions under which ordinary French people lived. Problems like inadequate housing and social services had been ignored. The French greeted the news of his departure with some relief as the feeling had grown that he had outlived his usefulness. Perhaps he clung onto power too long, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have retired in 1965 when he was still popular." ...|$|E

60|$|It is as well, <b>perhaps,</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{have died}} {{on his return}} to Rome in January of 1474--worn out by his excesses and debaucheries, say some; of poison {{administered}} by the Venetians, say others--leaving a mass of debts, contracted in his transactions with the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, to be cleared up by the Vicar of Christ.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{messenger}} sat {{quiet for}} a little, and I could see the glint of {{his eyes as he}} stared at me through the gloom. He was partly stunned, I think, by the force with which I had hurled him into his seat. And also <b>he</b> was pondering, <b>perhaps,</b> what <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do next. Presently he got his mouth partly free from the cravat.|$|R
60|$|Though it {{was horrible}} to part, yet it was best, <b>perhaps,</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{go back to his}} lodgings now, in case Heron sent his spies back to her door, and since he meant to consult with his chief. She had a vague hope that if the mysterious hero was indeed the noble-hearted man whom Armand {{represented}} him to be, surely he would take compassion on the anxiety of a sorrowing woman, and release the man she loved from bondage.|$|R
60|$|Prometesky {{preferred}} {{staying at}} home.

6000|$|They {{had come}} somehow to Pall Mall by now. And scared {{to find himself}} so deep in the hunting-ground of the Dromores, Lennan turned hastily towards St. James's Park, that they might cross it in the dark, round to Piccadilly. To be thus slinking out of the world's sight with the {{daughter}} of his old room-mate--of all {{men in the world}} the last <b>perhaps</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do this to!

60|$|Under this superb canopy we rode for {{a couple}} of hours to our journey's end. The {{mountains}} round about us dark, lonely, and sad; the landscape as we saw it at night (it is not more cheerful in the daytime), the most solemn and forlorn I have ever seen. The feelings of almost terror with which, riding through the night, we approached this awful place, the centre of the world's past and future history, have no need to be noted down here. The recollection of those sensations must remain with a man as long as his memory lasts; and <b>he</b> <b>should</b> think of them as often, <b>perhaps,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>should</b> talk of them little.|$|R
60|$|Now, he bethought {{himself of}} setting forward, {{and they were}} willing he should, But first, said they, let us go again into the armoury.

60|$|Weston {{looked at}} her more {{steadily}} than <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have done. There was something in her face that suggested that the last few moments had almost unnerved her. This, as he could realize, was not altogether unnatural; and then a sudden thrill that set his nerves tingling ran through him, as their eyes met. The {{events of the past}} minute had shown them, in part, at least, how they stood toward each other, and for the moment they could not hide it. Then Weston recovered the self-command that was rapidly deserting him.|$|E
60|$|When she {{had gone}} Charnock smiled.

5000|$|The {{above is}} from the Providence Journal, the editor {{of which is a}} little too quick on the trigger, on this occasion.

The [...] "Chairman of the Committee on Charity Lecture Bells," [...] is one of the deputation, and <b>perhaps</b> if <b>he</b> <b>should</b> return to Boston, via Providence, he of the Journal, and his train-band, would have his [...] "contribution box," [...] et ceteras, o.k.—all correct—and cause the corks to fly, like sparks, upward.|$|R
6000|$|The general {{practitioner}} {{thinks this is}} very hard upon him {{and ought to be}} stopped.

But the question is really not worth discussion, as it is obvious that it would be utterly impracticable to stop the practice [...] "over the counter" [...] even it it were desirable.|$|R

60|$|At length, when {{he became}} finally settled, and began to think at last that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{be able to go}} to sleep, he thought that he heard {{something}} rolling about in Jennie's state room, and also, at intervals, a mewing sound. He listened. The door between the two state rooms was always put open a little way every night, and secured so by the chambermaid, so that either of the children might call to the other if any thing were wanted. It was thus that Rollo heard the sound that came from Jennie's room. After listening a moment, he heard Jennie's voice calling to him.|$|E
60|$|Just at {{this moment}} his uncle opened the door which led into the little study, and asked Forester if he would step into the office. Forester did so; and then, after a few minutes, he returned, put up his books, {{and said that he}} had got to go away, and that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be back till noon. Marco had often been left alone at his studies for a time, but never for a whole morning before. He knew that he was to go on with his work just as if Forester had remained. So Forester bade him good morning, and then went away.|$|E
5000|$|How does {{a person}} make a decision? Søren Kierkegaard {{had to make}} some decision. He had to decide {{if he wanted to}} get married after having already made the [...] "sacred pledge".

6000|$|Peter {{was not so}} {{grateful}} <b>perhaps</b> as <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been at this good news,--or rather perhaps at {{the manner in which}} the result seemed to have been achieved. Of course he knew nothing of those terribly earnest petitions which Madame Staubach had preferred to the throne of heaven on behalf of his marriage, but he did not like being told at all of any interposition from above in such a matter. He would have preferred to be assured, even though he himself might not quite have believed the assurance, that Linda had yielded to a sense of his own merits.

But my master is noble in his disposition, and made incapable, even by the very strength of his passions, of any underhand practices. Whatever he does, will be done in the face of day, and of the two nations. And I can but add, that it will be the wish of every counsellor around him--excepting <b>perhaps</b> one--that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> behave in this matter with mildness and generosity, as well as justice." ...|$|R
