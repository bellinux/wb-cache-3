In the present study 17 workers at two peat bogs in northern Sweden were examined. Personal sampling of total dust and the respirable fraction was performed during several workshifts. Dynamic spirometry was carried out before {{and at the end}} of shifts. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in six subjects at the end of the working season and the results were compared with unexposed reference subjects. Peat workers using modern machines with ventilated cabins containing air filters were found to be exposed to low concentrations of <b>peat</b> <b>dust.</b> The recorded dust concentrations were below the threshold limit value for organic dust (5 mg/m 3 air) in all but one worker. The respirable fraction of <b>peat</b> <b>dust</b> recorded in the breathing zone of the workers correlated significantly with a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). The effect on lung function in non-asthmatic peat workers was, however, small.

40|$|Die Vegetationsentwicklung in zwei unterschiedlich abgetorften Mooren wird mit Hilfe der Transektmethode in Abhängigkeit von Abbauweise, Zusammensetzung und Mächtigkeit des Resttorfkörpers bzw. der Bunkerde dargestellt. Zusätzlich wurden in den verschiedenen Vegetationsstadien einige weitere Standortsparameter erhoben: Mittlerer Moorwasserstand und pH, Kalium- und Calciumgehalt des Moorwassers. Die Richtung der Vegetationsentwicklung auf Frästorfflächen ist eng korreliert mit der Zusammensetzung des Resttorfkörpers, mittlerem Moorwasserstand und Qualität (pH, Calciumgehalt) des Moorwassers, auf Handtorfstichflächen mit der Zusammensetzung der Bunkerde, mittlerem Moorwasserstand und Qualität des Moorwassers. Eine Moorregeneration i. S. v. beginnendem Torfmooswachstum konnte nur auf Teilflächen in Handtorfstichen beobachtet werden, für den gesamten Moorkomplex gilt diese Aussage nicht. Voraussetzung für ein Entstehen dieser Stadien auf Teilflächen war das Einbringen von Bunkerde und ein relativ hoher Wasserstand nach dem Abbau. Vegetation {{development}} in two differently mined peat areas is presented. Peat scratching in the wendlinger Filz {{was used to}} win <b>peat</b> <b>dust</b> as a litter for cattle or for horticultural purposes. After drainage of the mire lots, the upper rooted layer ("Bunkerde") was removed. If frozen during the next winter, {{it could be used}} for litter. After removing the "Bunkerde", peat was extracted by hand or by machines. Vegetation development after peat mining began on bare soil with the invasion of generative and vegetative propagules from outside. Peat cutting in the Wieninger Filz was used to win peat for fuel. After drainage of the mire lots, the "Bunkerde" was removed and filled in formerly mined areas. Then peat was cut by hand or by machines. Vegetation development started mainly from the potential of whole plants or generative and vegetative propagules in the "Bunkerde". Vegetation stages on formerly scratched areas are mostly dominated by "one species" stages. These species are successful either in generative (Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna vulgaris, Drosera ssp.) or vegetative dispersal (Rhynchospora alba, Carex rostrata, Eriophorum angustifolium, Phragmites communis) or in both (Juncus effusus). The direction of vegetation development depended on the composition of the remaining peat, mean water level and minerotrophy of the water. Regeneration in the sense of beginning peat moss growth could be observed only on these lots, where water level was above ground throughout the year (here Sphagnum cuspidatum), because former drainage got out of function. Vegetation stages on formerly cut areas show a higher diversity than on scratched areas. The direction of vegetation development depended mainly on the composition of the "Bunkerde", but on mean water level and minerotrophy of the water too. Regeneration could be observed on all lots with a relatively high water level, where peat was cut "under water" or drainage ditches were dammed up or got out of function. Requirement was that the "Bunkerde" contained whole plants or generative or vegetative propagules of the corresponding species, above all peat mosses...|$|E
40|$|Ombrotrophic peatlands {{are unique}} {{environmental}} archives {{of natural and}} anthropogenic atmospheric dust deposition because their surface layers are exclusively fed by atmospheric inputs. Lead (Pb) isotopes have been often used to evidence any anthropogenic influence in peat, but they only record trace metal pollution. Another radiogenic isotope, the Neodymium (Nd), could be also use to discriminate the sources of <b>dust</b> in <b>peat</b> bogs. <b>Dust</b> fluxes were investigated over the last 2500 years in the Misten peat bog in Eastern Belgium. Our aims were to use Nd isotope signature to decipher between local and distal dust supplies, the Pb isotopes to trace the antropogenic influences. To address these aims we analyzed REE and lithogenic element analyses, {{as well as the}} Nd and Pb isotopes, using HR-ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS, respectively in peat layers dated by 210 Pb and 14 C. Changes in REE concentration variations in peat samples are correlated with Ti, Al, and Zr that are lithogenic conservative elements, suggesting that REE are immobile in the studied peat bogs and can be used as tracers of dust deposition. Dust ﬂuxes show pronounced increase at BC 300, AD 600, 1000 AD, 1200 AD and from 1700 AD, recording either inﬂuence of human activities (regional erosion due to forest clearing and soil cultivation activities) or local and regional climate changes. Lead enrichments reveal strong human impact over the last 300 years. Lead isotope signatures are consistent with local and regional contamination by coal combustion and smelting activities. Neodymium isotopes allow to identify three periods characterised by dominant-distal sources (at 320 AD, 1000 AD and 1700 AD). Those periods are consistent with local wetter intervals as indicated by lower humification degree. Local erosion prevails durier drier (higher humiﬁcation) intervals (- 100 AD, 600 AD). On a global scale more distal supplies are driven during colder periods, in particular Oort and Maunder minima, confirming the hypothesis that cold climate conditions favor distal supplies. Combining geochemical elementary content and isotope data in ombrotrophic peat allows to decipher between dust flux changes related to human and climate forcing. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Soil-dwelling predatory mites {{can be very}} {{effective}} as biological control agents against larvae of the lepidopteral pest Duponchelia fovealis. Some growing media {{were reported to have}} natural high level and stable populations of predatory mite. The objective of this experiment was to define conditions to establish stable predatory mite populations in the rooting medium and to assess the direct effect of the rooting media on pest development. Eight rooting media were prepared, including a range of degradabilities as measured with the Oxygen Uptake Rate method (OUR). The OUR range was created by mixing <b>peat</b> products, coir <b>dust,</b> bark, perlite, compost and wood fiber. Each treatment was split: half with and half without a commercially used mulch to create a drier top layer. Kalanchoës were grown on these rooting media. After one week soil-dwelling predatory mites (Hypoaspis miles) were added. Adults of the pest Duponchelia fovealis were released during a number of weeks. Both populations were counted. Results show that the OUR range was successfully achieved. The commercial mulch, a cork based fine granulate, reduced the numbers of Duponchelia by 32 %. The number of predatory mites was related to the oxygen uptake of the rooting media (R 2 = 0. 87). The predatory mite reduced the numbers of Duponchelia larvae on average by 58 %. Thus, biological control by soil-dwelling predatory mites can be improved by offering rooting media with an increased degradability as measured by the oxygen uptake rate. The combined effects of using predatory mite and mulch layers are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{international}} {{interlaboratory trials}} {{for the analysis}} of growing media and soil improvers were performed. Samples of white sphagnum <b>peat,</b> coir <b>dust,</b> composted green material, uncomposted bark, peat mixture and a peat and clay mixture were tested. Of the materials the pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter content and ash, dry matter content, moisture content, laboratory compacted bulk density, dry bulk density, air volume, water volume, shrinkage value and total pore space were determined using European Standards. The results give an idea about the excitability and reliability of the methods. Results were variable. As a reference a test performed for European standardization was used. Results less good as obtained in the former trial were found for the pH of bark. This appeared to be a difficult material for the pH determination. Also the repeatability and reproducibility results of the organic matter determination of the peat and clay mixture were bad. This can either be caused by the fact that laboratories do not exactly follow the procedure, or the method is more reliable for high organic matter contents and should perhaps be adapted for materials with a low organic matter content. The laboratory compacted bulk density results of the performed test are in most cases satisfactory. The determination of physical parameters were not always good. The repeatability and reproducibility of dry bulk density of composted green material were extremely high. Probably due to the constitution of this compost, dry bulk density is difficult to determine. The method is not suitable for this type of material. Results for bark and peat and clay mixture are also rather poor. For particle density it appeared that some laboratories used another formula as prescribed. Next trial and an amendment will have to be made about how total pore space has to be calculated from particle density. For water and air volume the repeatability and reproducibility results of one of the interlaboratory trials were not good when compared to the former trial. There is not a clear reason but perhaps laboratories need to gain more experience for these determinations. The results show that it is essential to have interlaboratory trials for the physical and chemical characterization of growing media and soil improvers. The procedures still need further improvement. The only way to find out for a laboratory if it is producing the right data, is to participate in these trials. If the standards are to be submitted for national or international regulations this is even more important...|$|R
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the complex role that mineral dust and its feedbacks play in the Earth's climate system is limited by its highly variable nature {{in space and time}} and a lack of data reflecting this variability. Paleorecords of dust provide a means by which we can examine the response of dust over time under very different climatic conditions. These records also supply the data (dust deposition rates, grain size, mineralogy and provenance) necessary to validate models of the <b>dust</b> cycle. Ombrotrophic <b>peat</b> is hydrologically isolated and therefore, like ice, records atmospheric deposition alone. Peatlands have a wide distribution globally, particularly in formerly glaciated regions, and are established environmental archives which provide continuous, high-resolution, datable records of atmospheric deposition and climate change. The use of <b>peat</b> for reconstructing <b>dust</b> deposition has been demonstrated, but as yet, not systematically examined. Their use as an archive of dust deposition must be further tested before they can be used to improve on the relatively poor spatial coverage of current terrestrial dust records (e. g., loess, lake sediments, dune building records). We present here a first focussed effort to reconstruct past changes in dust deposition through loss on ignition (LOI), bulk density, humification and inorganic geochemistry data using a peat sequence from Store Mosse in southern Sweden. This deposit has been studied previously and reveals a record that extends back some 5000 years. LOI data, in combination with elemental chemistry of the samples, aids in identifying those depths where the observed signal is atmospheric in source only. Humification analyses and bulk density are used as a proxy for surface wetness and allows for the linking of broader climatic changes (precipitation, evaporation, temperature) with fluctuations in dust deposition rates and changes in grain character (grain size, surface roughness). The inorganic geochemistry provides a means to quantify dust deposition as well as make a first attempt at source tracing of the deposited materials; this is important in terms of reconstructing changes in paleo wind regimes. Past variations in aeolian activity in Scandinavia are relatively unknown. Dune building records from Denmark and elsewhere around Europe show several periods of inland sand invasion and dune building during the Holocene. These are linked to cooler and stormier climates caused by shifts in the North Atlantic Oscillation and/or movement of the polar front. We compare the dust deposition record from Store Mosse with available dune building records and records of storminess from the region {{in order to make a}} preliminary assessment of the use of peatlands as paleo records of dust deposition.
