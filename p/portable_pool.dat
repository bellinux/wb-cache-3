Six water safety experts were interviewed to gain insight into their perceptions and diverse roles. Using grounded theory, {{it was determined that}} stakeholders perceive they have a role in mobilizing pool safety knowledge. Three overarching themes emerged from the data which aligned with a proposed Drowning Prevention Spectrum: pool safety experts perceive their responsibility in mobilizing pool safety knowledge through their role in developing knowledge and skills as a safety educator; developing and promoting campaigns and products through their role as a marketer of behaviour change; and through their role in the development and enforcement of policies and legislation. Interviewees were also asked what they perceived as some of the major barriers to the uptake of pool safety information and initiatives. Interviewed stakeholders revealed that the main social ecological barriers included personal barriers (cost and time), social barriers (policy and awareness), and physical barriers (backyard aesthetics). The results of the first manuscript demonstrates that even though all interviewed stakeholders perceive they have a role in mobilizing pool safety knowledge, there are still barriers in the uptake of pool safety knowledge by citizens and pool owners. The second manuscript focused on using Weinreichâ€™s (2010) process model and semi structured interviews with six pool safety experts as well as marketing experts to create a social marketing campaign to emphasize the risks associated with portable pools. This article goes through the six steps outlined by Weinreich (2010) as well as using theories {{in the development of the}} campaign messages. Through interviews, experts gave their opinions and suggestions on most effective campaign messages, images, target audience, and promotional channels. The mock campaign ads were then presented to the marketing team in whom they gave their ideas and suggestions on how to hook the target audience in wanting to learn more about <b>portable</b> <b>pool</b> safety. A final campaign was crafted and will be implemented in a future City of Ottawa initiative...|$|E

The SwimSafe program consists of 21 lessons of instruction in survival swimming, rescue and resuscitation skills and water safety knowledge.

Other teams would interfere, squirting water cannon or throwing custard pies. Limited budgets meant games were often a variation on {{what could be done}} with a long piece of elastic, a lot of water, a <b>portable</b> swimming <b>pool</b> and a roundabout.|$|R

500|$|Hard {{suction hose}} (alternatively, suction hose) is a {{specific}} type of fire hose used in drafting operations, when a fire engine uses a vacuum to draw water from a <b>portable</b> water tank, <b>pool,</b> or other static water source. [...] It is built to withstand vacuum, rather than pressure, abrasion, and heat. [...] In the United States, it is standard equipment according to the National Fire Protection Association standards for fire engines. It is used in both structural and wildland firefighting throughout the world, and is made in various diameters and connection types.|$|R
40|$|A 2. 3 m {{diameter}} <b>portable</b> swimming <b>pool</b> {{was placed}} beneath a conventional Robinson light trap {{to compare the}} efficiency of catch during studies of the flight behaviour of black beetle, Heteronychus arator (Fabricius). Use of the pool increased the catchment area of the trap by 103 times, resulting in a 4. 6 times {{increase in the number}} of black beetle and a 58 times {{increase in the number of}} black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus (Walker), caught. There was increased sensitivity in detection of flight at the lower activity extremes, so that the total number of evenings on which flight activity was recorded during individual flight seasons was increased by a factor of 1. 4 for black beetle and 2. 7 for black field cricket. The modified trap could also be useful in insect surveys, and flight monitoring or recapture studies of a variety of other insect species. New Zealand Entomologist, 1979, Vol. 7, No. 1 9...|$|R

500|$|Hard suction hose, {{also known}} as a suction hose, is a {{specific}} type of rigid fire hose used in drafting operations. When using this technique, the fire engine draws water for fire fighting from an unpressurized supply, such as a <b>portable</b> water tank, <b>pool,</b> or other static water source, instead of drawing water from a pressurized water supply, such as a fire hydrant. Under complete vacuum conditions, a pump would lift water , however pumps on fire apparatus are not capable of producing a high vacuum. Due to this limitation and friction loss, fire services do not recommend attempting to lift water more than [...]|$|R
500|$|When {{being used}} in a {{drafting}} operation from a <b>pool,</b> <b>portable</b> water tank, or other uncovered water source, the length of hard suction hose farthest from the pump is usually attached to a strainer, to keep foreign objects in the water from being pulled into and damaging the pump. [...] If used in a pond, stream, or other body of water, an appropriate flotation device must be used to keep the strainer below the surface and above the bottom, so that neither mud nor air are sucked into the fire engine's pump. [...] When drafting from a solid-bottomed tank or pool, a strainer can safely rest on the bottom without suctioning mud into the fire engine's pump.|$|R
