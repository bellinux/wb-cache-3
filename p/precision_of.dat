5|$|To be able {{to choose}} the more {{appropriate}} algorithm for each specific problem, it is important to determine both the effectiveness and <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> all the available algorithms. The domain studying these matters is called numerical linear algebra. As with other numerical situations, two main aspects are the complexity of algorithms and their numerical stability.|$|E
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E

Results indicate that farmers with more within-field yield variability adopted a higher number <b>of</b> <b>precision</b> agriculture technologies.

5|$|In {{laboratory}} conditions, {{the interactions}} of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle properties. For example, in one instance a Penning trap was used to contain a single electron {{for a period of}} 10 months. The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the crew}} {{successfully}} completed all fifty-four {{of the planned}} mission test objectives. While the INSAT deployment was a success, the satellite had problems unfolding its solar array once in geostationary orbit, and was not fully operational {{until the middle of}} September. Once functional, however, it provided satisfactory service for seven years, returning 36,000 images of Earth and broadcasting television to thousands of remote Indian villages. The Payload Flight Test Article evaluation found that the Canadarm remote manipulator system was capable of moving bulky masses with some accuracy, to a <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> 5cm and one degree of alignment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} directly related to the relativity of direction. One is geodetic precession: the axis direction of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ("parallel transport"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> better than 0.3%.|$|E

40|$|Sentiment {{analysis}} on user reviews helps {{to keep track}} of user reactions towards products, and make advices to users about what to buy. State-of-the-art review-level sentiment classification techniques could give pretty good <b>precisions</b> <b>of</b> above 90 %. However, current phrase-level sentiment analysis approaches might only give sentiment polarity labelling <b>precisions</b> <b>of</b> around 70 %~ 80 %, which is far from satisfaction and restricts its application in many practical tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of phrase-level sentiment polarity labelling and attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} phrase-level and review-level sentiment analysis. We investigate the inconsistency between the numerical star ratings and the sentiment orientation of textual user reviews. Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a basic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not necessarily true. We further propose to leverage the results of review-level sentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity labelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. Besides, the framework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and heuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity. Experimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our framework achieves high labelling <b>precisions</b> <b>of</b> up to 89 %, which is a significant improvement from current approaches...|$|R

GameSpot's Erik Wolpaw also commended the mouse controls, but disapproved the replay system, particularly {{due to the lack}} of options with timing and camera controls. Extended Plays Andrew Bub appreciated the addition of a custom radio station, as well as the availability of custom skins. Daniel Morris of PC Gamer praised the gameplay tweaks provided by the port, but criticised the lack of major additional features, such as an overhead map of the in-game city.|$|E

It is based on the metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS) rather than any variant of the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> measurements improves. The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 2011 and 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram, linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact, thereby ensuring long-term stability.|$|E

Modern techniques, {{such as the use of}} radio telemetry from space probes, and of radar measurements of the distances to planets and asteroids in the Solar System, have allowed a reasonably accurate value for the astronomical unit (AU) to be calculated to a <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> about ±30 meters.
