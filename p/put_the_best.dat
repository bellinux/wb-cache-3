Hart had taken on Templeton, a century-goalkicker who was seen as a little bit brittle, as a {{personal}} project, getting him on a weight program and moving him to his old position at centre half forward. It seemed that Hart worked well with those who were similarly talented and motivated as himself, but struggled to relate to those who were not. This is a common refrain in Australian football: simply <b>put,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> players don't always make the best coaches.|$|E
500|$|Fieldy {{has said}} of the album [...] "Right now, I will tell you this... we've done {{something}} we've never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{of what we have}} on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's {{going to be a little}} extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E
500|$|On February 9, 1997, The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones {{with the}} episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] as the longest-running prime-time {{animated}} {{series in the}} United States. The producers took this milestone and made the episode {{deal with the issue}} of longevity and the problems that arise when the producers try to make a show [...] "fresh" [...] again; themes commonly known as [...] "jumping the shark". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, in a review printed two days after the episode originally aired, praised the writers for not airing a [...] "very special" [...] episode to celebrate the milestone of overtaking The Flintstones. He noted [...] " [...] so self-aware it <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in-jokes on St. Elsewhere to shame." ...|$|E

500|$|Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline opines {{that the}} work is [...] "a {{portrait}} of the artist at a turning point" [...] in his life. He believes that it [...] "stands alone" [...] in The Adventures of Tintin due to its lack of antagonist and few characters, describing it as [...] "a spiritual quest" [...] where the [...] "only conflict is between man and nature... <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of himself into Tintin in Tibet." [...] Referring to its [...] "stripped-bare story and archetypal clarity", Benoît Peeters believes Tintin in Tibet {{to be one of the}} two [...] "pivotal" [...] books in the series, alongside The Blue Lotus, and deems it poignant that Chang features in both. He also suggests that Hergé included the benevolent Yeti to [...] "make up for the interminable massacre" [...] of animals in the second Tintin adventure, Tintin in the Congo, and that the sadness the Yeti experienced at the story's end reflected Hergé's feelings about his separation from Germaine. Peeters concluded, [...] "Even more than Art Spiegelman's Maus, Tintin in Tibet is perhaps the most moving book in the history of the comic strip." ...|$|E
500|$|Les Bowie {{provided}} the special effects: {{he had made}} his name perfecting an improved technique for matte painting, called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in matte effects. Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the movie. Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen. For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey. Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted. Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, [...] "There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned… absolutely nothing at all". An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments. Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the final shot of the film.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} placed 23rd on Entertainment Weeklys top 25 The Simpsons episodes list. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", calling it [...] "a very neat episode which, like [...] "The Front", is a good parody of the cartooning business." [...] In 2007, Vanity Fair named it the sixth-best episode in the show's history, {{describing}} it as [...] "a classic satire of network influence, obsessed TV fans, and programs that survive long after the shark has been jumped, the episode is a meta-celebration, a tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to everyone who claimed that the quality of The Simpsons had declined over the years." [...] Todd Gilchrist called it a masterpiece, stating it [...] "could easily be packaged and sold by [...] ". Planet Simpson author Chris Turner describes the episode as [...] "the most contentious and direct counterattack The Simpsons ever unleashed on its fans" [...] and [...] " [...] satire of the working world of big-time TV production". Robert Canning of IGN said it was [...] "laugh-out-loud funny" [...] and describing the introduction of Roy as [...] "a hilarious parody of a classic, overused television device." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger, in a review printed two days after the episode originally aired, praised the writers for not airing a [...] "very special" [...] episode to celebrate the milestone of overtaking The Flintstones. He noted [...] " [...] so self-aware it <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in-jokes on St. Elsewhere to shame." [...] The BBC named it as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show, noting, [...] "the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show." [...] In 2014, The Simpsons writers picked [...] "The Beagle Has Landed" [...] as one of their nine favorite [...] "Itchy & Stratchy" [...] episodes of all time.|$|E

2500|$|In sharp contrast, the {{founding}} publisher {{and editor of}} Poetry, Harriet Monroe, emphasized the folksy New England persona and characters in Frost's work, writing that [...] "perhaps no other poet in our history has <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of the Yankee spirit into a book so completely." [...] She notes his frequent use of rural settings and farm life, and she likes that in these poems, Frost is most interested in [...] "showing the human reaction to nature's processes." [...] She also notes that while Frost's narrative, character-based poems are often satirical, Frost always has a [...] "sympathetic humor" [...] towards his subjects.|$|E
2500|$|The review {{concluded}} that the album was [...] "curiously uninvolving" [...] and that it [...] "lacks the insight and passion that <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> work {{by the likes of}} Boogie Down Productions, Ice-T and Public Enemy so far ahead of the field." [...] The Richmond Times-Dispatchs Mark Holmberg described the album as [...] "a preacher-provoking, mother-maddening, reality-stinks diatribe that wallows in gangs, doping, drive-by shootings, brutal sexism, cop slamming and racism". Newsweek noted that Straight Outta Compton [...] "introduced some of the most grotesquely exciting music ever made", and added that [...] "Hinting at gang roots, and selling themselves on those hints, they project a gangster mystique that pays no attention where criminality begins and marketing lets off".|$|E

He said that [...] "the original design of the building was a rough sketch by his daughter, with all the features he sought to include in the building. This was handed by him to Mr Palmer [...] [...] [...] who prepared the present design in all its manifold details." [...] He said to great applause that the Pavilion was [...] "built so strongly and solidly, and on such good foundations that it was likely to stand the fierce north-easterly breezes for generations yet to come," [...] and that [...] "while the East Cliff Pavilion remained, Mr Palmer's name would ever remain." [...] He said that Mr Ingleton's building work had done him great credit and that he [...] "must have <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> materials in it for the love of it." [...] On the subject of the popularity and health-giving properties of the town, he suggested to much laughter that because 1,000 and 1,400 persons were listed in the town directory in 1902 and 1904 respectively, Herne Bay could have 200,000 inhabitants in the year 2000.
