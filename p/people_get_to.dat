25|$|Matrix schemes use {{the same}} {{fraudulent}} non-sustainable system as a pyramid; here, the participants pay to join a waiting list for a desirable product, which {{only a fraction of}} them can ever receive. Since matrix schemes follow the same laws of geometric progression as pyramids, they are subsequently as doomed to collapse. Such schemes operate as a queue, where the person at head of the queue receives an item such as a television, games console, digital camcorder, etc. when a certain number of new people join the end of the queue. For example, ten joiners may be required for the person at the front to receive their item and leave the queue. Each joiner is required to buy an expensive but potentially worthless item, such as an e-book, for their position in the queue. The scheme organizer profits because the income from joiners far exceeds the cost of sending out the item to the person at the front. Organizers can further profit by starting a scheme with a queue with shill names that must be cleared out before genuine <b>people</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the front. The scheme collapses when no more people are willing to join the queue. Schemes may not reveal, or may attempt to exaggerate, a prospective joiner's queue position, a condition that essentially means the scheme is a lottery. Some countries have ruled that matrix schemes are illegal on that basis.|$|E

In his announcement, priorities that he cited included highway beautification, creating an additional Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone, and adding to the city's water rights. He was opposed by Roy McDowell, who criticized Harpole's plan to build a ballpark, saying [...] "We didn't get to vote on it, but I am going to make sure from here on out that <b>people</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> vote on all major issues". He also mentioned red light cameras, hand-held cell phones, animal control, and the drainage tax as additional issues he wished to put to a vote.

500|$|Yancey {{describes}} {{his friendship with}} Mel White, who was a married pastor and Fuller Theological Seminary lecturer with two children {{when he came out}} as homosexual. White had been a ghostwriter for Christian writers including Francis Schaeffer, Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, and Yancey was surprised by White's self-disclosure. According to the author, he and White had long discussions on the subject [...] "because he wanted so much for me to approve. I couldn't approve." [...] Yancey writes that, although he continued to cultivate his friendship with White, many other Christians shunned the pastor. One chapter, [...] "The Lovesick Father", retells the Parable of the Prodigal Son in a modern setting with the spendthrift child, a daughter. Yancey writes that the closest many <b>people</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> experiencing pure grace is a romantic relationship, when they believe that [...] "someone at last feels that I — I! — am the most desirable, attractive, companionable creature on the planet".|$|E

Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E

500|$|Long an {{advocate}} for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued {{that men and women}} can climb the same routes: [...] "I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men [...] "spectators want to see <b>people</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women". In answer to a question about whether or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that [...] "theoretically somebody as short as me could be {{the best in the world}} because it doesn't depend so much on height now... And it's a psychological thing more than a physical thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Jammal Simms {{was hired}} as the tour's {{director}} and main choreographer. Octavious Terry served as an assistant for directing, meanwhile Dondraico Johnson assisted choreography. They, along with twelve other members, composed the tour's creative team. In total, the Wonder World Tour included 124 traveling workers, 19 truckloads of equipment, and 15 buses. The stage was quite {{different from that of}} the Best of Both Worlds Tour. It consisted of a rectangular main stage, which featured staircases that elevated the center of the stage, and a narrow runway, which connected the main stage to a B-stage that ran the length of the main stage. Regarding the stage, Cyrus noted that it was [...] "something not many <b>people</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> have. I'm able to move around to each side so there's no one person who feels like they don't have the best seat. Every seat is the best seat." [...] Six LED multi-screen video units were located throughout the stage; the three largest were placed as the upstage wall, while the other three were hung by rigs above the stage. The center unit consisted of three screens that faced outward; two others were hung right and left to the center unit, both were double faced toward the center of the venue at a 45° angle, while the backside faced the upper-seat audience. The structure of the video panels was designed by Sims to ensure that all seats within the 270° angle at each venue received an equal view of the video screens. Video content and lighting were designed by Seán Burke; the latter was provided by Production Resource Group (PRG).|$|E

2500|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the season, Perry {{continued}} his torrid scoring pace. On March 9, Perry scored two more goals, his 32nd and 33rd goal of the season, surpassing his previous career-high, single-season goal tally. Perry scored another goal in a win against Colorado. In the next game, he scored the only two goals as the Ducks lost to the Phoenix Coyotes. From March 19 through April 6, Perry recorded a least a point in ten consecutive games, later taking the League scoring lead from Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning when he scored two goals against the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. He then recorded his third career hat-trick in a game against the San Jose Sharks on April 6, with his third of the game giving him 50 for the year. After reaching the mark, he became just the third Ducks player to record a 50-goal season, joining Teemu Selänne and Paul Kariya. [...] "Fifty is a huge number," [...] Perry said after being serenaded with [...] "M-V-P!" [...] chants from the Honda Center crowd in Anaheim. He added, [...] "Everybody talks about it, (but) {{not a whole lot of}} <b>people</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do it and be in that category. It hasn't really sunk in." ...|$|E
2500|$|The PNP {{mayor of}} Guaynabo, Héctor O'Neill, bought a few English-language stop signs in 1998, as {{to save some}} money (English signs were cheaper than Spanish ones because of economies of scale in the United States). At the {{suggestion}} of Rios Gracia 137, one of Guaynabo's Municipal Policemen who was in-charge of the Uniform Crime Reporting Office. Rios took a step further by creating the concept of Guaynabo City in all federal agencies in the United States (who had designed an English-language sign for his police unit), O'Neill had Ríos' sign design painted and {{placed in front of}} the police unit's office. He took the concept further and had a graphic artist redesign a new corporate identity for the city's police department. As he feared it would happen once he approved the proposed designs (O'Neill's candid reaction once he saw the proposed design for the police's patrol cars was reported in San Juan's El Vocero newspaper: [...] "This looks gorgeous! Yet, I fear this will be all fucked up once <b>people</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know about this!"), he was soon reprimanded by pro-independence citizens of town and Spanish language purists in Puerto Rico for his use of English but was publicly praised by Don Eleuterio, who is also a native. O'Neill then bought several police patrol cars with the English phrase [...] "Guaynabo City Police" [...] painted on them. As expected, Eleuterio gave his imprimatur to the move.|$|E
