50|$|Freud's {{seduction}} theory {{emphasizes the}} causative impact of nurture: {{the shaping of}} the mind by experience. This theory held that hysteria and obsessional neurosis are caused by repressed memories of infantile sexual abuse. Infantile sexual abuse, {{the root of all}} neurosis, is premature introduction of sexuality into the experience of the child. Trauma creates affects and thoughts that simply cannot be integrated. The adult who had a normal, non traumatic childhood is able to contain and assimilate sexual feelings into a continuous sense of self. Freud proposed that adults who experienced sexual abuse as a child suffer from unconscious memories and feelings incompatible with the central mass of thoughts and feelings that constitute his or her experience. <b>Psychic</b> <b>disorders</b> are a direct consequence of experiences that cannot be assimilated. Unconscious memories of infantile sexual abuse was a necessary condition for the development of certain disorders, hysteria in particular. But another condition had to be met: There had to be an unconscious memory of the abuse.|$|E

This “gender paradox” can be {{explained}} by various factors, such as more impulsive nature of men and their choice of more efficient (more lethal) methods to commit suicide. This study was aimed at finding the correlation between the gender and other suicidal factors. Material and Methods. The study sample consisted of persons who committed suicide on the territory of Kragujevac in the period from 1996 to 2001. This study was based on the records kept by the Ministry of the Interior {{as well as by the}} Psychiatric Clinic of the Clinical Centre ”Kragujevac”. Data for weather were obtained from the Serbian Meteorological Institute reports. Results. During the analyzed period 121 suicides were committed on the territory of Kragujevac. The gender structure showed that within persons who committed suicide there were 78. 5 % men and 21. 5 % women (p< 0. 01). As for diseases which had existed before suicide, women suffered from the underlying <b>psychic</b> <b>disorder</b> in 65. 3 %, while 50. 5 % of men had both a <b>psychic</b> <b>disorder</b> and addiction problem. Hanging was the most frequently used method by both men and women (57. 9 % and 65. 4 %, respectively); and home was chosen as the place to commit suicide by 49. 5 % men and 42. 3 % women. Both men and women had a behaviour disorder before suicide, in 75. 8 % and 88. 4 % of the cases, respectively, (p< 0. 01). The dominating motive was a disease in 17. 9 % of men, whereas family problems prevailed in 11. 5 % of women (p< 0. 01). Conclusion.

Patients with somatic and particularly dermatological diseases are at risk of psychological disorder. This study was performed to evaluate psychological health problems of patients with skin disorder attending the dermatological clinics in Sari in 2004. Materials and methods: This is a descriptive study performed on patients with dermatological diseases in Sari using GHQ- 28 and demographic questionares. The data were analysed by chi-square test using SPSS program. Results: 404 subjects (325, 80. 4 % female) were enrolled in this study. The mean age of the subjects was 28. 72 years (range 15 - 65). Incidence of psychoccognitive disorders was 52 / 6 % in patients aged 46 - 55 yr, 41. 2 % in womens, 40. 8 % in single patients, 46. 2 /% in rural subjects, 62. 5 % in illiterate or lessliterate people, 57. 8 % in jobless individual, 65 / 8 % in subjects with positive past history of psychological disorders and 63. 6 % in patients with diffuse skin lesions. The most common diagnosis in the sample population was acne (28. 2 %), pigmentation disorder (20 %), androgenetic alopecia (7. 4 %) and dermatitis (6. 7 %). The incidence of psychocongective disorders was 44. 4 % in patients with dermatitis, 43 % in acne and 42 % in pigmentation disorders. Statistically significant differences were observed between the <b>psychic</b> <b>disorder</b> and job & literacy level and positive past history of psychological diseases (p< 0. 05). However, there was no significant relation between <b>psychic</b> <b>disorder</b> and duration & type of skin diseases.

40|$|Introduction: Psychogenic non-epileptic {{seizures}} {{represent a}} paroxysmal event {{followed by a}} sudden change of behavior, cognition or consciousness, mostly of short duration, which resemble or {{can be understood as}} epileptic seizures. They occur in persons without epilepsy and in patients with epilepsy. They are not associated with abnormal EEG discharges because their cause is a <b>psychic</b> <b>disorder.</b> Case report: A 20 -year-old patient has been suffering of occasional 'morning short-lasting jerking hand movements, staring and fainting' since the age of 14 years. Beside a symptomatic anamnesis for epilepsy and non-specifically changed standard EEG, antiepileptic therapy (valproate and lamotrigine) was introduced. Because of non-response to antiepileptic therapy, the patient was forwarded for further clinical examination involving video EEG telemetry, which indicated that this was a case of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. A successive withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs was initiated, and also, a psychologist and psychiatrist were included into treatment, which resulted in the reduction of seizures and improvement of the patient's general condition. Conclusion: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures represent a frequent diagnostic problem requiring team's work, while the video EEG telemetry is the method of choice for diagnosis...|$|R

The objective of the present paper is to read Munro's "Runaway" in the mirror of Sigmund Freud to detect the psychological aspects of its fictional characters. The characters are driven by the Freudian mental agencies and undergo phases of <b>psychic</b> <b>disorder.</b>   In the present paper, Munro's short fiction has been discussed based on Sigmund Freud's theory of the Unconscious and its connection with the interpretation of dreams as well as the symbolization of three main characters based on tripartite agencies of the id, ego and superego. Clarifying the latent and manifest levels of characters and the world of dreams indicates the artistic creation of Alice Munro in handling complex characterization. The unconscious and its connection with the female character's dreams have been discussed. The unconscious of the female character is reflected in her dreams in result of repression and asocial drives and desires.

40|$|Abstract Background Maternal {{postpartum}} depression {{has an impact}} on mother-infant interaction. Mothers with depression display less positive affect and sensitivity in interaction with their infants compared to non-depressed mothers. Depressed women also show more signs of distress and difficulties adjusting to their role as mothers than non-depressed women. In addition, depressive mothers are reported to be affectively more negative with their sons than with daughters. Methods A non-clinical sample of 106 mother-infant dyads at psychosocial risk (poverty, alcohol or drug abuse, lack of social support, teenage mothers and maternal <b>psychic</b> <b>disorder)</b> was investigated with EPDS (maternal postpartum depressive symptoms), the CARE-Index (maternal sensitivity in a dyadic context) and PSI-SF (maternal distress). The baseline data were collected when the babies had reached 19 weeks of age. Results A hierarchical regression analysis yielded a highly significant relation between the PSI-SF subscale "parental distress" and the EPDS total score, accounting for 55 % {{of the variance in the}} EPDS. The other variables did not significantly predict the severity of depressive symptoms. A two-way ANOVA with "infant gender" and "maternal postpartum depressive symptoms" showed no interaction effect on maternal sensitivity. Conclusions Depressive symptoms and maternal sensitivity were not linked. It is likely that we could not find any relation between both variables due to different measuring methods (self-reporting and observation). Maternal distress was strongly related to maternal depressive symptoms, probably due to the generally increased burden in the sample, and contributed to 55 % of the variance of postpartum depressive symptoms. </p...|$|R

50|$|Serembe {{was born}} in San Cosmo Albanese, in the Calabrian Province of Cosenza, and studied {{at the college of}} Saint Adrian. At an early age, {{he fell in love with}} a girl from his native village who emigrated to Brazil with her family and {{subsequently}} died. Obsessed by this loss and by the thought of finding at least her grave, Serembe set sail for Brazil in 1874 in search of a new life.

On his arrival in the Old World in September 1875 his fortunes took yet another turn for the worse. Robbed of all his money, apparently in the port of Marseille, he was forced to return to Italy on foot, and is said to have lost many of his manuscripts on the way.

40|$|Increased Mn {{levels are}} known to damage the central nervous system, {{resulting}} in motoric abnormalities and <b>psychic</b> <b>disorder</b> and finally resulting even in symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. Monomethyl-Mn-pentadienyl-tricarbonyl is used as anti-knock agent and consequently Mn compounds are exhausted into air from automobiles. With additional inhalative Mn exposure, finally an Mn overflow of the liver is known, resulting in increased Mn transport to other organs, predominantly to the brain. Specific Mn-species then seem to be generated in liver, however, their speciation is still not investigated. This paper focuses on experiments {{to get more information}} on Mn species with respect to a size characterization of the Mn species in liver. Liver extracts were analyzed using a mass calibrated size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column being coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection. As an important prerequisite, the stability of Mn species in the liver extracts during storage was investigated as well. It turned out that short term storage of the extract (under Ar atmosphere) at 4 degrees C seems to be best suited. Storage for several days even at - 20 degrees C demonstrated already considerable changes in species pattern. Further investigations focused on improvements in detection during hyphenation using dynamic reaction cell (DRC) technology for Mn detection. The signal to noise (S/N) ratio was increased up to a factor of 15 when using DRC technology compared to conventional ICP-MS without DRC. The analysis of liver extracts with a mass calibrated SEC column coupled to inductively coupled plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS) showed Mn associated to ca. 36 % to a peak covering a mass range 100 - 260 kDa, approximately 9 % was found in a peak having the mass range 37 - 77 kDa, 46 % in a peak having the mass range 13 - 36 kDa and ca. 7 % in the low molecular mass (LMM) range.
