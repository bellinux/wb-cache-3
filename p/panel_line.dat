50|$|In December 1999, after Kvaerner {{announced}} a {{withdrawal from the}} shipbuilding industry, the Govan yard was purchased by Clydeport and then taken on a long-term 20-year lease by BAE Systems Marine, who also owned the former Yarrow Shipbuilders yard in Scotstoun on the Clyde. It {{is now part of}} BAE Systems Surface Ships. Continued investment in capital equipment such as Plasma cutting and <b>Panel</b> <b>Line</b> welding, has seen the Govan Shipyard emerge as BAE Systems' Steelwork Centre of Excellence. The 220 ton capacity Fairfield Titan Crane, built in 1911, was demolished in 2007 to make way for construction of modules for the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers at the yard.|$|E

50|$|Viz Communications also {{released}} all {{episodes in}} {{a comic book}} format from 1994 to 1995. However, instead of a manga, they used screenshots from each episode for the <b>panels.</b> <b>Line</b> art and descriptions of all units were inserted as well.|$|R

50|$|The {{shipyard}} is self-sufficient having {{facilities for}} building vessels up to 5,000 DWT {{and up to}} 140 m in length. It is equipped with side launching facility, CNC plasma steel cutting and preparation machines, automatic blasting and painting machines, <b>panel</b> <b>line</b> fabrication, profile bending machine, rollers for plate straightening, etc. It is now an exclusive shipbuilding establishment. The semi-finished ships are transported from Bharati Shipyard units at Ratnagiri and Ghodbunder to Goa, where the remaining construction activities are carried out and the ships are delivered to customers thereafter. Another adjacent yard, Anderson Marine Pvt LTD, has also been acquired on lease by Bharati Shipyard.|$|E
50|$|Spanboard Products Ltd at Coleraine in Northern Ireland began {{production}} in 1959 and {{was acquired by}} Sonae Industria, Portugal’s largest privately owned industrial group in 1989. The company was extensively refurbished in the early 1990s when a new {{state of the art}} <b>panel</b> <b>line</b> for edged panels was installed. Investment was also made in a computerized panel saw to provide a cut to size service for melamine faced panels and gives greater flexibility for customer service. The factory produces wood particle board to meet the criteria of both, BS EN 312, (physical requirements for Particleboard) and also the site Quality Management System, which operates to ISO 9001.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} and {{analysis in the}} structural optimization of <b>Panel</b> <b>Line</b> Modules detailed in this report has been undertaken by the Naval Postgraduate School {{in cooperation with the}} Northrop Grumman (Shipbuilding) Corporation. The focus of this research is to develop an optimization process for implementation and validation of engineering design choices in conjunction with the use of <b>panel</b> <b>line</b> module structures. The work contained herein will demonstrate the procedure, analysis and resulting design options using the design of experiments approach. Contract number: 11 -F 836...|$|E
50|$|Autoart {{is moving}} towards replicating cars in {{composite}} plastic and with diecast interior {{instead of a}} traditional diecast body and plastic chassis. The company claims that the move towards plastic should result in more accurate details, such as <b>panel</b> <b>lines,</b> {{as well as the}} models costing less than their diecast counterparts.|$|R
50|$|The Kazamai {{is number}} six {{in a series}} of concept cars with the Nagare flow design language.

40|$|So far {{the use of}} {{electrical}} energy loads can just be known through the power meter {{in each of the}} panel, this result has no records of electricity usage in a specified period as well as the quality of the electricity. The use {{of electrical}} energy effectively and efficiently will be able to produce energy quality, equipment life-time, equipment efficiency and budget organization. In this study, methods of measurement of electrical energy is used in real time, then the measurement data are entered into the database so that the electrical energy usage data can be recorded in a given period of time by using an expert system. Measurement of electrical energy in the panel on some line, if there is a high load on a particular panel, then the system can provide information to the transfer of low load. This electrical energy can be accessible to all areas including corporate managers or other institutions in appropriate to the needs of each area by using TOGAF method. The results of the research in this thesis isa set of electrical energy usage data which can be used to reset the electrical <b>panel</b> <b>line</b> when electrical energy peak performance happened...|$|E
40|$|The theme {{evolved into}} {{one aspect of}} a {{specific}} city. Portland, Oregon {{is famous for its}} bridges. In actuality, they are the hinges that make it a metropolis instead of two middle-sized urban cities. Thinking along these lines, most sketching was concentrated around these connecting links. Eventually the Broadway, Steel and Hawthorne proved to be the most interesting as to line, pattern, and shape as well as most important {{in the history of the}} city. These three were combined into a triptych with a different bridge occupying each panel. The most difficult problem was one of composition – how to present each bridge with equal importance in an individual way, yet unifying all so that the viewer would see the three single panels as one entity. I tried to solve the problem of variation and importance by placing each bridge at a different angle and on a different perspective plane, yet drawing each one on a large scale so that it became the dominant area in the <b>panel.</b> <b>Line</b> and color are the unifying factors. Black is the important color in each bridge and also in the beams in the foreground. These beams are not contained within each panel, as are the bridges, but go beyond and into all three so as to form one composition. Much knowledge has been gained personally through this thesis – most of it in the area of compositional planning. It has emphasized the need for detail in preliminary work (line, value, and color). It has shown that there is no substitute for the exhaustion of all approaches to the subject. The learning process here should apply to all works and to the teaching process as well, for these two general ideas of exploration and planning can change the mediocre into something worthwhile...|$|E
