40|$|This paper {{examines}} employees ‟ {{incentives to}} monitor and discipline management by analyzing the role of corporate pension plan funding status in the corporate control market. Using a large sample of Compustat firms, we find that firms with larger <b>pension</b> <b>deficits</b> {{are less likely to}} become acquirers, spend less on acquisitions, and make less diversifying acquisitions. Our empirical evidence for a subsample of completed deals reveals that acquiring firms with larger <b>pension</b> <b>deficits</b> experience higher announcement-period stock returns and produce higher synergy. Furthermore, acquirers ‟ <b>pension</b> <b>deficits</b> are negatively associated with premiums they pay but positively related to the percentage of cash payment. Taken together, our findings suggest that corporate <b>pension</b> <b>deficits</b> encourage employees to discipline managers and thus alleviate managerial entrenchment and enable managers to make value-enhancing investment decisions. “Employee engagement levels are linked to perceptions of a company’s leadership and, more specifically, the extent to which members of the workforce believe senior management is committed to their well-being.

50|$|As President, Hollande pursued {{reform to}} the vast and {{expensive}} pension system in France. The process proved to be very contentious, with members of Parliament, Labor Unions, and general public all opposed. Mass protests and demonstrations occurred throughout Paris. Despite the opposition, the French Parliament did pass a reform in December 2013 aimed at plugging a <b>pension</b> <b>deficit</b> expected to reach 20.7 billion euros ($28.4 billion) by 2020 if nothing were to be done. Rather than raising the mandatory retirement age, as many economists had advised, Hollande pursued increases in contributions, leaving the retirement age untouched. The reform had a rough ride in parliament, being rejected twice by the Senate, where Hollande's Socialist Party has a slim majority, before it won sufficient backing in a final vote before the lower house of parliament. French private sector workers will see the size and duration of their pension contributions increase only modestly under the reform while their retirement benefits are largely untouched. Several scholars and economists argue the reform did not go far enough.|$|E

Copps pointed out that Valeri lived in the Niagara West-Glanbrook riding that also included around 43% of his old constituents and an airport, the latter which complemented his Transport Ministry. In response, Valeri pointed out that Copps no longer lived in Hamilton, no Member of Parliament enjoyed any entitlement to any constituency without a nomination meeting and the majority of the constituents of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek in fact originated from his Stoney Creek riding. On March 6, 2004, Valeri won the nomination by 311 votes.

30|$|In fact, {{human capital}} and {{individual}} differences {{are related to}} retirement delay’s effect on reducing <b>pension</b> <b>deficit</b> and crowding out new employees. If the insured have more high-quality human capital, the retirement delay can reduce <b>pension</b> <b>deficit</b> more significantly and have less effect on new employees. Generally speaking, as for low-skilled workers, {{due to a lack}} of human capital which will depreciate as their working years grow (Skirbekk 2008), they will be significantly impacted by retirement delay. The source of pensions will become more limited along with the rise of unemployment rate and the decrease of wage rate, which will deeply compromise the effect of retirement delay on closing the gap of <b>pension</b> <b>deficit.</b> But as for high-skilled workers, since they have more high-quality human capital which can appreciate as their working years grow, retirement delay will insignificantly affect their real life.
