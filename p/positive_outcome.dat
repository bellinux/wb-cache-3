5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} the Labour Party usually won most Scottish {{parliamentary}} seats, losing this dominance briefly to the Unionists in the 1950s. Support in Scotland {{was critical to}} Labour's overall electoral fortunes as without Scottish MPs it would have gained only three UK electoral victories in the 20th century (1945, 1966 and 1997). The number of Scottish seats represented by Unionists (known as Conservatives from 1965 onwards) went into steady decline from 1959 onwards, until it fell to zero in 1997. The Scottish National Party gained its first seat at Westminster in 1945 and became a party of national prominence during the 1970s, achieving 11 MPs in 1974. However, a referendum on devolution in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the support of 40 per cent of the electorate (despite a small majority of those who voted supporting the proposal) and the SNP went into electoral decline during the 1980s. The introduction in 1989 by the Thatcher-led Conservative government of the Community Charge (widely known as the Poll Tax), one year {{before the rest of}} the United Kingdom, contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct Scottish control over domestic affairs. On 11 September 1997, the 700th anniversary of Battle of Stirling Bridge, the Blair-led Labour government again held a referendum on the issue of devolution. A <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> led to the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999. The new Scottish Parliament Building, adjacent to Holyrood House in Edinburgh, opened in 2004. Although not reaching its 1970s peak in Westminster elections, the SNP had more success in the Scottish Parliamentary elections with their system of mixed member proportional representation. It became the official opposition in 1999, a minority government in 2007, a majority government from 2011 and a second minority government in 2016.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} relations between stress and coping predictors and distress and <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes</b> in multiple sclerosis (MS). A total of 502 people with MS completed a questionnaire at Time 1 and, 3 months later, Time 2 (n= 404). Predictors included Time 1 illness (duration, number of symptoms, course), number of problems, appraisal and coping (acceptance, problem solving, emotional release, avoidance, personal health control, energy conservation). Dependent variables were Time 2 distress (anxiety, depression) and <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes</b> (life satisfaction, <b>positive</b> affect, benefits). Results indicated that as hypothesised, personal health control, emotional release and physical assistance {{were related to}} the <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes,</b> whereas avoidance was related to distress, and acceptance was associated with the <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes</b> and distress. Findings highlight the differential relations between coping strategies and <b>positive</b> and negative <b>outcomes</b> and the role of appraisal and coping in regulating distress and promoting positive psychological states while managing a chronic illness...|$|R

25|$|This {{was further}} amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were {{guaranteed}} by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.|$|E
40|$|Across 48 {{experimental}} groups, {{those that}} {{scored higher on}} group self-esteem attributed perceived <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes</b> to internal factors and negative outcomes to external factors. Groups provided more elaborate rationalizations about perceived negative outcomes and less elaborate rationalizations about perceived <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes.</b> They also espoused greater confidence in improved performance after negative outcomes and less confidence following <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Similar findings were observed among 252 intact work groups in an employment setting.

In contrast to the Skanderbegs' myths of Albanian Christians, the Myth of Skanderbeg of Albania's Muslim community had a <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> because the glory of the Illyrian era did not end with Skanderbeg, but continued into the Ottoman era.|$|E

40|$|Family members {{caring for}} aging parents {{experience}} both negative and posi-tive outcomes from providing care. Theoretical explanations for negative outcomes have been developed. There is need for models that explain and predict <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes.</b> This {{article describes the}} evolution of the Care-giver Empowerment Model (CEM) to explain and predict <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes</b> of family caregiving. Although empirical findings support <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes</b> of family caregiving, less attention has been given to theoretical rationale for positive effects. The CEM predicts that, in the presence of filial values and certain background variables, caregiving demands are appraised as challenges instead of stressors. Appraising caregiving demands as a challenge, finding meaning, and using certain types of coping strategies are posited to be asso-ciated with growth and well-being. The CEM extends our understanding of the complexity of the caregiving experience, and can serve as a framework to guide in developing and testing theory-based interventions to promote <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Medical {{societies}} issue {{guidelines for}} when physicians should use MRI on patients and recommend against overuse. MRI can detect health problems or confirm a diagnosis, but medical societies often recommend that MRI {{not be the}} first procedure for creating a plan to diagnose or manage a patient's complaint. A common case is to use MRI to seek a cause of low back pain; the American College of Physicians, for example, recommends against this procedure as unlikely to result in a <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Several test {{theories}} {{have been developed}} to assess a possible <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> in Lorentz violation experiments by adding certain parameters to the standard equations. These include the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl framework (RMS) and the Standard-Model Extension (SME). RMS has three testable parameters with respect to length contraction and time dilation. From that, any anisotropy of the speed of light can be assessed. On the other hand, SME includes many Lorentz violation parameters, not only for special relativity, but for the Standard model and General relativity as well; thus it has a much larger number of testable parameters.|$|E

Multiple theories predict, and empirical findings reveal, that violent video game exposure is causally related {{to a host of}} negative outcomes and a few <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Some non-violent video games have been causally related to some specific positive learning effects as well as certain types of visual cognition (e. g., spatial rotation abilities) and may be associated with some negative effects on execu-tive control and attention disorders...|$|R

25|$|Poul Anderson, {{in his own}} {{series of}} novels {{depicting}} a space empire modeled on Rome, used a similar setting in The Day of Their Return. Though very different in detail from Asimov's book, Anderson's version also has a setting of a rebellious planet similar to ancient Judea, from which a wave of religious fanaticism is about to burst out into the wider Empire – to be stopped by a decisive action of the protagonist. Also in Anderson's book, the preventing of rebellion and the planet acceptance of Imperial rule is clearly shown as a <b>positive</b> <b>outcome.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{geometry}} of the normal, open grid is evidently unsuitable for protecting or enhancing the social environment of a street from the negative influence of traffic. Similarly, a 1972 ground-breaking study by Oscar Newman on a Defensible Space Theory described {{ways to improve the}} social environment and security of neighbourhoods and streets. In a practical application of his theory at Five Oaks, the neighbourhood's grid pattern was modified to prevent through traffic and create identifiable smaller enclaves while maintaining complete pedestrian freedom of movement. The <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> of these changes reinforces Appleyard's findings and the need to reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, open grid.|$|E
25|$|Conduction aphasia {{is caused}} by damage to the arcuate {{fasciculus}}. The arcuate fasciculus is a white matter tract that connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Patients with conduction aphasia typically have good language comprehension, but poor speech repetition and mild difficulty with word retrieval and speech production. Patients with conduction aphasia are typically aware of their errors. The awareness of errors and the milder nature of conduction aphasia compared to other types contributes to a <b>positive</b> <b>outcome.</b> Additionally, a case study completed on a 54-year-old man with a large infarct in the arcuate fasciculus indicated that severe conduction aphasia can be successfully treated. Despite his global deficits, he made a full recovery after 30 months.|$|E
