5|$|The humeral {{plate is}} usually a small {{sclerite}} on the anterior margin of the wing base, movable and articulated with {{the base of the}} costal vein.

5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs heat from the mould (which has absorbed heat from the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|E
5|$|These were large, heavily built, herbivorous quadrupeds with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, {{and tails}} held {{high in the}} air. Due to their {{distinctive}} combination of broad, upright <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> tail tipped with spikes, Stegosaurus {{is one of the}} most recognizable kinds of dinosaur. The function of this array of <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally agreed that their spikes were most likely used for defense against predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display, and secondarily for thermoregulatory functions. Stegosaurus had a relatively low brain-to-body mass ratio. It had a short neck and a small head, meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs. One species, Stegosaurus ungulatus, is the largest known of all the stegosaurians (bigger than related dinosaurs such as Kentrosaurus and Huayangosaurus).|$|E

5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax <b>plates,</b> <b>and</b> a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the long-term effects of}} notochord ablation at chick stages 9 – 10 on formation of the floor <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> motor neurons.

Our results suggest that floor <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> motor neurons can form in a delayed fashion in vivo after notochord ablation and in vitro from isolated neural plates.
