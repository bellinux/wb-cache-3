5|$|Despite {{advances}} in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still {{expected to attend}} to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals. Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the silkworms, feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons. In the family pecking order, the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these men often stayed at home. If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants. There were also many professional courtesans (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs. It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home. Yet two could play at this game. Most concubines were found in the families of feudal lords and kings. The ideal of the chaste, modest, and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou, where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.|$|E
25|$|Though these architects {{are listed}} by country, {{during this period}} there was an intense {{cultural}} exchange among the Nordic countries (many architects worked in more than one), but also considerable development in the architect's sphere of activity, from consultant to the bourgeoisie to town planner concerned with infrastructure, dwelling and public services. As Swedish historian Henrik O. Anderson (1982: 23), has <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> was an architecture of democracy, not radical avant-gardism. Furthermore, {{with the exception of}} Finland, the other Nordic countries had avoided getting involved in the First World War, allowing for continued cultural development.|$|E
25|$|I might <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way. The {{story is}} cast {{in terms of}} a good side, and a bad side, beauty against {{ruthless}} ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. But if you have, as it were, taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the questions of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless...|$|E

But the truth is that... let's <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

He quotes Thompson's [...] "A snow-crystal is the same today as when the first snows fell": adding [...] "so, too, the basic forces acting upon organisms", and comments that we have forgotten other early twentieth century scientists who scorned evolution.

500|$|In the 1960 election, Vice President Nixon ran for President of the United States against Democratic {{opponent}} Senator John F. Kennedy. Pat {{was featured}} {{prominently in the}} campaign; an entire advertising campaign was built around the slogan [...] "Pat for First Lady". Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy, although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud. Pat had urged her husband to demand a recount of votes, though Nixon declined. Pat was most upset about the television cameras, which recorded her reaction when her husband lostâ€”"millions of television viewers witnessed her desperate fight to hold a smile upon her lips as her face came apart and the bitter tears flowed from her eyes", as one reporter <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> permanently dimmed Pat Nixon's view of politics.|$|E

So, you know, people are just kicking it around like that." [...] Actor Bob Balaban, who portrayed NBC executive Warren Littlefield in The Late Shift {{said he would like}} to portray Jeff Zucker, and said Jason Alexander would also be a good choice to play Zucker. Andy Richter jokingly told Movieline that he would want Justin Bieber to portray him in a film adaptation of the book.|$|E
500|$|While some {{commentators}} claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public, others {{claimed he was}} [...] "openly gay".

Let's <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: {{there were times when}} I was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks.

In the 1980s, he would often distance himself from his partner, Jim Hutton, during public events. In October 1986, The Sun claimed Mercury had [...] "confessed to a string of one-night gay sex affairs".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contained}} {{a number of}} references to pop culture. George explains that he broke the original statue when he was {{using it as a}} microphone, singing the song [...] "MacArthur Park", by Jimmy Webb; in early drafts of the script, George broke it while singing Eddie Cochran's [...] "Summertime Blues". The episode also contained numerous references to the 1960s television crime drama Dragnet,. This was because Larry Charles, who wrote the episode, watched a lot of reruns of the show when he was writing for Seinfeld. The cop Kramer pretends to be when he retrieves the statue was inspired by Joe Friday, the central character of Dragnet. Finland is also mentioned multiple times, as Rava is from there. At the end of the episode Kramer states [...] "Well, lets <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way, I didn't take them to The People's Court", a reference to the judicial television show.|$|E

500|$|Though Silent Spring had {{generated}} a fairly {{high level of}} interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in The New Yorker, {{which began in the}} June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book {{to the attention of the}} chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time Carson also learned that Silent Spring had been selected as the Book-of-the-Month for October; as she <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> would [...] "carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks likeâ€”much less The New Yorker." [...] Other publicity included a positive editorial in The New York Times and excerpts of the serialized version in Audubon magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street, {{from its}} {{earliest}} {{planning and development}} stages before its debut on PBS in 1969, has used music as a teaching tool. [...] The show's creators recognized that children responded to commercial jingles, so they wanted to use their characteristics, which included repetition, clever visuals, brevity, and clarity, in what they presented to young viewers. [...] For {{the first time in}} children's television, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum. The show's creators understood that music and sound effects provided a direct means of teaching children basic skills, and that children learned more effectively when new material was accompanied by a song. [...] Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney observed in her proposal for the new show, written in 1967, that children had an [...] "affinity for commercial jingles", so many of the show's songs were constructed like television ads. [...] Critic Peter Hellman <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: [...] "If [...] could recite Budweiser jingles from TV, why not give them a program that would teach the ABCs and simple number concepts?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first name}} of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion, since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix. Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock {{preferred}} to focus the audience's attention on {{the solution to the}} mystery, and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap. Instead of having Sam explain Norman's pathology to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist. (Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother at the time of writing the film.) The novel is more violent than the film; for instance, Crane is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death. Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect, since toilets were virtually never seen in American cinema in the 1960s. The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about [...] "Mother" [...] without tipping that something was being hidden. As Janet Leigh <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> gave Hitchcock more options for his camera.|$|E
