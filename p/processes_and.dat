30|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} how the <b>process</b> <b>and</b> outcome attributes of the EO sub-dimensions of innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness may interrelate with each other. Two important theoretical contributions to the EO research are made. First, it is highlighted that researchers need to carefully consider that <b>process</b> <b>and</b> outcome are salient {{for each of the}} sub-dimension of EO. Second, the sub-dimensions with the <b>process</b> <b>and</b> outcome attributes of each sub-dimension may vary independently of each other. Thus, as <b>process</b> <b>and</b> outcome can be distinctly different and vary independently of each other, researchers are urged to carefully conceptualize and operationalize the sub-dimensions and not necessarily bundle <b>process</b> <b>and</b> outcome together. This can include, for example, new measurement scales that clearly separate <b>process</b> <b>and</b> outcomes.|$|R

The research reported in this paper reveals that the literature has not progressed sufficiently beyond articulating the major issues in manufacturing strategy. Three causes for this lack of progress are identified: (1) a paucity of theory construction; (2) little empirical research; and (3) insufficient efforts in adopting ideas and methods from related fields. strategy manufacturing strategy operations management...|$|R
