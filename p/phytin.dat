40|$|THE {{phosphorus}} supplied in poultry rations by cereals, cereal by-products, soybeans, {{and other}} plant materials is {{largely in the}} form of phytic acid and its salts, collectively termed <b>phytin.</b> The uti-lization of this organically bound form of phosphorus is a question of considerable practical importance since phosphorus is one of the elements most likely to be de-ficient in unsupplemented rations. In some instances <b>phytin</b> is relied upon to supply {{a large portion of the}} total phos-phorus requirement of chickens, although the weight of evidence indicates that it is less readily utilized than inorganic phos-phates. Lowe, Steenbock, and Krieger (1939) supplemented a low phosphorus basal chick diet with <b>phytin</b> isolated from wheat bran and obtained no increase in calcifica-tion. These results were obtained, how-ever, in the absence of supplementary vitamin D or in the presence of subopti-mum amounts of this factor.

The drawback of the CTC method is that it tends by its nature, and unfortunately by adulteration, to homogenize all black tea flavors. In the process of crushing, tearing and pelletizing the tea leaves, pressures and stresses occur which break down the cells, releasing large amounts of the <b>phytins</b> that normally oxidize to produce black tea's mahogany color. Since, regardless of origin, CTC teas in their dry form are generically [...] "tea-like" [...] in aroma, and of similar pelletized appearance, {{it is easy to}} adulterate a more expensive CTC-type tea with inexpensive and generally mild lowland teas of the same process.

Comparison of the digestive breakdown among different structural components of oat bran was conducted by microscopically examining samples obtained from the tents of the large intestine (LIC) of the rats. Results of the examinations revealed that the (1 - 3) (1 - 4) - B - D - glucan - rich cell wall of the subaleurone layer, along with its cellular content, were relatively more digestible than the comparable structures of the aleurone layer. Most of the aleurone structural components, including the cell wall and the <b>phytin</b> globoids, as well as the outer fibrous layers of the bran, remained detectable in the ileum samples, indicating that they were poorly digested by the endogenous gastrointestinal enzymes of the rats.

As avalia????es realizadas foram: emerg??ncia, ??rea foliar e mat??ria seca da parte a??rea aos 25 dias ap??s a emerg??ncia. No segundo experimento, foi utilizado somente um n??vel de fertilidade do solo, com aduba????o conforme a recomenda????o da pesquisa. Foram utilizadas as seguintes fontes de f??sforo para o tratamento das sementes: fitina, fosfato monoc??lcico, fosfato de pot??ssio e fosfato de s??dio, sendo cinco dosagens de cada fonte: 0; 0, 9; 1, 8; 2, 7 e 3, 6 g por 100 g de sementes. As avalia????es realizadas foram: emerg??ncia; ??rea foliar e mat??ria seca da parte a??rea aos 25 e 50 dias ap??s a emerg??ncia; n??mero de sementes por planta; peso de mil sementes e produtividade por planta. O delineamento estat??stico utilizado foi o de blocos casualizados, com tr??s repeti????es. Os resultados permitiram concluir que: 1) a fitina e o fosfato monoc??lcico, aumentam a produtividade da cultura da soja em n??vel superior a 15 %; 2) o recobrimento de sementes de soja com f??sforo, provenientes de fitina e fosfato monoc??lcico, promove o aumento da ??rea foliar e mat??ria seca das plantas de soja; 3) a emerg??ncia das plantas de soja ?? afetada negativamente, quando se utiliza fosfato de s??dio, superfostato triplo ou fosfato monoam??nico no tratamento das sementes. The {{limitations on}} the availability of phosphorus in the early growing season could result in restrictions on development, a condition in which the plant does not recover afterwards, even though increasing the supply of phosphorus at appropriate levels. This study aimed to determine the effect of different sources and levels of phosphorus on growth and productivity of soybean plants, grown from seeds treated by the coating process. Two experiments were conducted. The first involved two levels of soil fertility: 1) soil fertilized according to recommendations of the survey for the soybean crop and 2) soil with fertilizer three times higher than that recommended by the survey. It was used the following sources of phosphorus in the treatment of seeds: <b>phytin,</b> dicalcium phosphate, natural daoui phosphate, triple superphosphate and monoammonium phosphate, and five doses: 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 g per 100 g of seeds from each source. The evaluations were: emergence, leaf area and shoot dry matter at 25 days after emergence. In the second experiment, it was used only one type of soil, with fertilizer as recommended by the research. It was used the following sources of phosphorus in the treatment of seeds: <b>phytin,</b> calcium phosphate, potassium phosphate and sodium phosphate, five doses of each source: 0, 0. 9, 1. 8, 2. 7 and 3. 6 g per 100 g of seeds. The evaluations were: emergence, leaf area and shoot dry matter at 25 and 50 days after emergence, number of seeds per plant, thousand seed weight and productivity per plant. The statistical design was a randomized block design with three replications. The results allowed to conclude that: 1) <b>phytin</b> and the monocalcium phosphate, increase the productivity of soybean in the 15 % level; 2) the coating of soybean seeds with phosphorus from <b>phytin</b> and monocalcium phosphate, promotes increased leaf area and dry weight of soybean plants; 3) the emergence of the soybean plants is adversely affected when using sodium phosphate,Triple superphosphate or monoammonium phosphate in the treatment of seeds...|$|E
40|$|Vesicular-arbuscular {{mycorrhiza}} {{were established}} in Trifolium parvij 7 orum in culture by inoculation with Endogone spores. In a medium containing 265 mg. phosphorus (P) /l., as CaHPO, and K,HP 04, infection occurred only when the medium lacked nitrogen (N). In a medium containing only roo mg. P/l., infection occurred readily {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 g. KNO,/I. Calcium monohydrogen phosphate, Ca phytate, Na phytate, Fe phytate, <b>phytin,</b> lecithin and DNA were adequate sources of phosphate for both plant and fungus. Ca phytate and DNA greatly stimulated fungal growth, and DNA also stimulated spore formation, in the agar medium. With Na in the medium infections in the root were sparse. Inositol may serve as a carbon source for Endogone. Mycorrhizal infection occurred with either FeCl, or Fe-EDTA in the medium; when so little iron was present that plants grew poorly, there was also little mycor-rhizal infection...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the changes in {{activity}} of enzymes involved in the breakdown of stored <b>phytin,</b> lipid, and hemicellulose in the aleurone layer of rice seed (Oryza sativa L., variety IR 8) during the 1 st week of germination in the light. Enzyme assays were made on crude extracts from degermed seed, and activities were expressed on a per seed basis. Phytase activity increased within the 1 st day of germination. The increase in activity of most other enzymes—phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, esterase, lipase, peroxidase, catalase, β-glucosidase, and α- and β-galactosidase—closely followed the increase in protein content. Their peak activities occurred by the 5 th to the 7 th day. Some enzymes, such as β- 1, 3 -glucanase and α-amylase, continued to increase in activity after the 7 th day. Phytase, β- 1, 3 -glucanase, and α-amylase followed a similar sequence of production in embryoless seed halves incubated in 0. 12 μM gibberellin A 3, but the production of lipase was delayed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that rhizosphere acidification would enhance the hydrolyzation of organic phosphates by increasing phosphatase activity. A Petri dish experiment with sterile agar and a pot experiment with a low P soil were used. In the Petri dish experiment, roots of each plant were cultured in two compartments, each of which contained agar with one of three nitrogen combinations: NH 4 +/N 0 (N 0 = nitrogen free), NH 4 +/NO 3 -, and NO 3 -/N 0. <b>Phytin</b> was supplied as the sole phosphorus (P) source to all compartments. In the pot experiment, the soil in each pot was treated with N 0, KNO 3, or (NH 4) 2 SO 4) together with 0 or 75 mg kg- 1 phytin-P. Dry weight, P concentration, and P content of roots were highest in the NH 4 + compartments in the Petri dish experiment. In the pot experiment, dry weight, P concentration, an...|$|E
