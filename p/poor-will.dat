60|$|The {{advance of}} the season now became as rapid as its first {{approach}} had been tedious and lingering. The days were uniformly mild, while the nights, though cool, were no longer chilled by frosts. The whip- <b>poor-will</b> was heard whistling his melancholy notes along {{the margin of the}} lake, and the ponds and meadows were sending forth the music of their thousand tenants. The leaf of the native poplar was seen quivering in the woods; the sides of the mountains began to lose their hue of brown, as the lively green of the different members of the forest blended their shades with the permanent colors of the pine and hemlock; and even the buds of the tardy oak were swelling with the promise of the coming summer. The gay and fluttering blue-bird, the social robin, and the industrious little wren were all to be seen enlivening the fields with their presence and their songs; while the soaring fish-hawk was already hovering over the waters of the Otsego, watching with native voracity for the appearance of his prey.|$|E
50|$|On {{cold winter}} nights, these birds can reduce their body {{temperature}} {{by as much}} as 10 to 12 °C (from their normal temperature of about 42 °C) to conserve energy. Such a capacity for torpor is not very common in birds. Other bird species capable of torpor include the common swift Apus apus, the common <b>poor-will</b> Phalaenoptilus nuttallii, the lesser nighthawk Chordeiles acutipennis, and various species of hummingbirds.|$|E
5000|$|This is the {{smallest}} North American nightjar, about 18 cm in length, with a wingspan of approximately 30 cm. It weighs 36 - 58 g. The sexes are similar, both gray and black patterned above. The outer tail-feathers are tipped with white, the markings slightly more prominent in the male.The common poorwill is told from similar nightjars by its small size, short bill, rounded wings with tips that {{reach the end of}} the short tail at rest, and pale gray coloration. [...] Like many other nightjars, the common name derives from its call, a monotonous <b>poor-will</b> given from dusk to dawn. At close range a third syllable of the call may be heard, resulting in a poor-will-low. It also gives a chuck note in flight.|$|E

50|$|The Simi Hills are {{the most}} {{critical}} wildlife corridor linkage from the Santa Monica Mountains — to the Santa Susana Mountains, and beyond to the Topatopa Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, and other Transverse Ranges further east. The Simi's undeveloped native habitat provides routes that protect larger land wildlife of the Santa Monicas from genetic isolation. Large sections of the Simi Hills are protected by parks and open space preserves. Animals in the area include mammals such as the Virginia opossum, ornate shrew, broad-footed mole, mountain lion, mule deer, bobcat, spotted and striped skunk, California badger, southern California weasel, California raccoon, ringtail cat, black bear, Botta's pocket gopher, desert cottontail, valley coyote, gray fox, California vole, brush rabbit, California ground- and California grey squirrel, {{as well as several}} species of mice (California pocket mouse, western harvest mouse, brush mouse, deer mouse, and house mouse), rats (agile kangaroo rat, dusky-footed woodrat, black rat, roof rat, and brown rat) and bats (long-eared myotis, long-legged myotis, California myotis, small-footed myotis, western pipistrelle, Brazilian free-tailed bat, western mastiff bat, and Tejon myotis). Some of the reptiles in the area include several species of snakes (coachwhip, southern Pacific rattlesnake, San Diego night snake, striped racer, California black-headed snake, two-striped garter snake, San Diego gopher snake, coast mountain kingsnake, California kingsnake, coast patch-nosed snake, ringneck snake) and lizards (western fence lizard, California side blotched lizard, western skink, western whiptail, San Diego horned lizard, California horned lizard, San Diego alligator lizard, silvery legless lizard). There are ten species of amphibians in Simi Valley: the California newt, western spadefoot, California toad, arroyo toad, California slender salamander, arboreal salamander, American bullfrog, California red-legged frog, California treefrog, and the Pacific treefrog.Birds in Simi Valley include Anna's hummingbird, Canada goose, mallard, California quail, common egret, great blue heron, American bittern, American coot, killdeer, mourning dove, roadrunner, belted kingfisher, black phoebe, barn swallow, cliff swallow, common raven, crow, white-breasted nuthatch, cactus wren, mockingbird, robin, cedar waxwing, phainopepla, starling, least Bell's vireo, hooded oriole, western tanager, several species of blackbird (western meadowlark, Brewer's blackbird and brown-headed cowbird) and woodpeckers (common flicker, Nuttall's woodpecker, acorn woodpecker, and yellow-bellied sapsucker). Raptors include turkey vulture, white-tailed kite, American kestrel, <b>poor-will</b> and several species of hawks (Cooper's hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, marsh hawk, red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and the common nighthawk) and owls (great horned owl, short-eared owl, long-eared owl, barn owl, and the burrowing owl). Grosbeaks, finches and sparrows include black-headed grosbeak, house finch, American goldfinch, lesser goldfinch, California towhee, Savannah sparrow, sage sparrow, dark-eyed junco, white-crowned sparrow and the house sparrow.|$|E

40|$|Bac k g r o u n d: Global {{climate change}} will have {{multiple}} effects on human health. Vulnerable populations—children, the elderly, and the <b>poor—will</b> be disproportionately affected. Objective: We reviewed projected impacts {{of climate change}} on children’s health, the pathways involved in these effects, and prevention strategies. Data s o u r c e s: We assessed primary studies, review articles, and organizational reports. Data synthesis: Climate change is increasing the global burden of disease and in the year 2000 was responsible for> 150, 000 deaths worldwide. Of this disease burden, 88 % fell upon children. Documented health effects include changing ranges of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue; increased diarrheal and respiratory disease; increased morbidity and mortality from extreme weather; changed exposures to toxic chemicals; worsened poverty; food and physical insecurity; and threats to human habitation. Heat-related health effects for which research is emerging include diminished school performance, increased rates of pregnancy complications, and renal effects. Stark variation in these outcomes is evident by geographic region and socioeconomic status, and these impacts will exacerbate health disparities. Prevention strategies to reduce health impacts of climate change include reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation through multiple publi...|$|E

40|$|I {{estimate}} that 215 bird species currently breed or have previously bred in Nebraska. This number compares {{with a total}} of 330 species that breed or have bred in the Great Plains region south of Canada, as I defined that region in my book on the breeding birds of the Great Plains (Johnsgard, 1979). Grasslands or potential grasslands make up about 81 percent of the Great Plains 2 ̆ 7 vegetation, and probably represented about 96 percent of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s original vegetation. Only in the Sandhills region is that vegetation type still essentially intact; the tall-grass prairie of eastern Nebraska is Virtually gone. In my 1979 summary, I judged that 36 species of Great Plain 2 ̆ 7 s bird are grassland-adapted forms, with 15 of these endemic to the Great Plains, and the rest more broadly distributed. Nine of these endemics breed in Nebraska (Greater Prairie-Chicken, Mountain Plover, Long-billed Curlew, Upland Sandpiper, Dickcissel, Lark Bunting, Clay-colored Sparrow, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur and Chestnut-collared Longspur), and the Chihuahuan Raven also once did. None of these ten species is considered endangered nationally, although the Greater Prairie-Chicken needs to be monitored closely. Birds of the tall-grass prairie that currently breed in eastern Nebraska include the Upland Sandpiper, Dickcissel. Eastern Meadowlark, Field Sparrow and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. Both of the latter are not, strictly speaking, prairie species, but either represent a later successional stage containing some small trees (Field Sparrow), or the presence some brushy or weedy elements (Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow). In the west the short-grass plains support several declining or rare species, including Ferruginous Hawk, Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Hawk, Prairie Falcon, Mountain Plover, Burrowing Owl, Common <b>Poor-will,</b> Lark Bunting, and two longspurs. Some of these also have certain additional non-vegetative needs such as cliff-side nest sites (Prairie Falcon), burrows (Burrowing Owl), nearly bare ground (Mountain Plover), or rocky substrates (<b>Poor-will).</b> The geographically and ecologically intermediate Sandhills prairies support many typical grassland and wet meadow breeders, such as Sharp-tailed Grouse, Long-billed Curlew, Bobolink, Lark Sparrow, Grasshopper Sparrow and Horned Lark. Woodlands and forests comprise about 15 percent of the native vegetation of the Great Plains states, and support some 51 percent of the region 2 ̆ 7 s breeding avifauna (Johnsgard, 1979). I {{estimate that}} in Nebraska this vegetation type occupies three percent of the state 2 ̆ 7 s surface area, and supports 48 percent of its avifauna. It is thus {{one of the most important}} vegetation types for generating species diversity of our avifauna. Bald Eagles are among the rare woodland-nesting species of Nebraska, although they are also strongly water-dependent for food. Several hawks (Broad-winged, Red-shouldered, Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s, etc.) are other clear associates of mature woodlands. Several woodland nesting passerines that have generally large ranges elsewhere in the central or western states are limited to woodlands in extreme northwestern Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s Pine Ridge region, or in the lower Missouri woodlands of extreme southeastern Nebraska (see Table 2) ...|$|E
40|$|About forty people {{participated in}} the 1981 Fall Field Day, which was {{scheduled}} from noon Saturday 3 October to noon Sunday 4 October, but which was anticipated by early arrivals Friday and on Saturday morning. The weather was windy and cool, the skies overcast much of the time, with some rain Saturday afternoon, and Sunday morning overcast {{so that it was}} hard to get colors. But almost as soon as the meeting broke up Sunday noon the sky cleared and everybody went home in bright sunshine. There was a slide show Saturday night. Of the reports on unusual species, submitted in accordance with the reporting form project adopted at the annual meeting (NBR 49 : 21), the Black-legged Kittiwake (NBR 49 : 41 - 42) was selected as the most unusual. The site was the 4 -H Camp, Nebraska National Forest, Halsey. Sixty-four species were reported from the Forest or immediately adjacent to it (compared to 71 at the 1980 Fall Field Day) : Double-crested Cormorant, Great Blue Heron, White-fronted Goose, Pintail, Wood Duck; Sharp-shined, Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s, Red-tailed, and Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Hawks; Golden Eagle, Marsh Hawk; Prairie and Peregrine Falcons: American Kestrel, Sharp-tailed Grouse, Ring-necked Pheasant, Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gull; Rock and Mourning Doves; Great Horned and Short-eared Owls; <b>Poor-will,</b> Chimney Swift, Belted Kingfisher, Common Flicker (both forms); Hairy and Downy Woodpeckers; Barn Swallow, Blue Jay, Black-billed Magpie, Common Crow, Black-capped Chickadee; White-breasted and Red-breasted Nuthatches; American Robin, Hermit Thrush, Eastern Bluebird, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaire, Ruby-crowned Kinglet, Cedar Waxwing; Orange-crowned, Yellow-rumped, and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers; Western Meadowlark, Common Grackle, Cardinal, Evening Grosbeak, House Finch, Pine Siskin, American Goldfinch, Red Crossbill, Rufous-sided Towhee; Vesper and Lark Sparrows; Dark-eyed Junco; Tree, Chipping, Clay-colored, Field, Harris 2 ̆ 7, White-crowned, White-throated, Lincoln 2 ̆ 7 s, and Song Sparrows. The Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaires were more numerous than usual, but they were outnumbered by the Red-Crossbills, whose presence at all was unusual. Fires and a poor food crop in their normal area apparently were responsible for the Crossbills 2 ̆ 7 presence...|$|E
