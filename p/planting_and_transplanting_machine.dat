40|$|Tree {{transplanting}} practices influence <b>plant</b> survival, establishment, <b>and</b> subsequent landscape value. The {{inability to}} adequately quantify effects of inappropriate tree <b>planting</b> <b>and</b> <b>transplanting</b> practices threatens long-term viability and productivity (sustainability) of trees within terrestrial ecosystems. Tree planting depth, i. e. {{location of the}} root collar relative to soil grade, is of particular concern for tree growth, development, and performance in the landscape. A series of model studies was conducted to investigate effects of planting depth, container production methods, <b>and</b> <b>transplanting</b> practices on landscape establishment of container-grown trees. Studies included determining the effect of <b>planting</b> depth <b>and</b> soil amendments on live oak (Quercus virginiana Mill.) and baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) L. Rich.), the effect of planting depth during container production and subsequent landscape establishment of lacebark elm (Ulmus parvifolia Jacq.), the effect of <b>planting</b> depth <b>and</b> irrigation practices on landscape establishment of sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.), {{and the effect of}} <b>planting</b> depth <b>and</b> <b>transplant</b> season on landscape establishment of baldcypress. Optimum planting depth varied among species and was dependent on cultural practices and/or environmental conditions. Overall, live oak and baldcypress growth was better when planted with root collars at grade in sand in raised beds compared to planting below grade in control soils. Lacebark elm growth was greater when planted at grade during the initial container production phase and below grade in the second container production phase. Subsequent landscape establishment was variable, but planting at grade to 5 cm above grade produced greater growth. Sycamore trees planted below grade had increased mortality and decreased growth compared to trees planted at grade or above grade, while irrigation had no effect. Baldcypress planted above grade had reduced growth compared to those planted at or below grade, while transplant season had no effect. Species and cultivars within species may differ markedly in their response to environmental/cultural stresses, including planting depth. Each tree species originating from a specific environment may represent an ecotype adapted to that particular environment. Therefore, tree survival and performance may depend on the difference between the environment from which the tree was grown and the experimental system into which it is introduced...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A parthenocarpic {{breeding}} line, Oregon T 5, from Oregon State University, was crossed {{with several}} commercial cultivars. Progenies were studied for 2 years as both direct-seeded <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>transplants</b> {{in the field}} at Corvallis, Oregon to determine the inheritance of parthenocarpy in Oregon T 5. Both quantitative and qualitative measurements of parthenocarpy were used. F₁, F₂ and backcross data indicated that the inheritance of parthenocarpy in T 5 is recessive. F₂ data fit a 9 seedy: 7 seedless ratio, suggesting duplicate recessive genes. F₂ data from a cross with 'Severianin', an unrelated parthenocarpic cultivar, indicated the inheritance of parthenocarpy in T 5 is due to different genes than in 'Severianin'. These data also support the hypothesis of 2 genes for parthenocarpy in T 5, with a possible interaction of modifiers for parthenocarpy from both parents. Chi square tests showed an association between parthenocarpy and earliness as measured by number of days to first ripe fruit. This earlier ripening in T 5 crosses resulted from a shorter interval between flowering and ripening, and not from earlier flowering, in most cases. In general, no association was indicated between parthenocarpy and fruit size...|$|R
