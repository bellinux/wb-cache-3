50|$|The M5OD {{is fully}} {{synchronized}} on all gears, including reverse. The synchronized reverse gear {{was one of}} the main features of the new units, to <b>protect</b> <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> from being damaged by inadvertent operation by the customer, and was protected by US Patent 4,757,726. The transmission has an integral bellhousing, making the power plant stiffness high enough to avoid harmful resonance. The transmission uses a hydraulic clutch setup and has an internal slave cylinder, which is a source of frustration for anyone having a slave cylinder failure, as it requires the entire transmission to be removed.|$|E
40|$|X- 33 is an {{advanced}} technology demonstrator {{vehicle for the}} Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program. The thermal protection system (TPS) for the X- 33 is composed of complex layers of materials to <b>protect</b> <b>internal</b> <b>components,</b> while withstanding severe external temperatures induced by aerodynamic heating during high speed flight. It also serves as the vehicle aeroshell in some regions using a stand-off design. MSC/NASTRAN thermal analysis capability was used to predict transient temperature distribution (within the TPS) throughout a mission, from launch through the cool-off period after landing. In this paper, a typical analysis model, representing a point on the vehicle where the liquid oxygen tank is closest to the outer mold line, is described. The maximum temperature difference between the outer mold line and the internal surface of the liquid oxygen tank can exceed 1500 F. One dimensional thermal models are used to select the materials and determine the thickness of each layer for minimum weight while insuring that all materials remain within the allowable temperature range. The purpose of working with three dimensional (3 D) comprehensive models using MSC/NASTRAN is to assess the 3 D radiation effects and the thermal conduction heat shorts of the support fixtures...|$|E

40|$|Currently, many drivers {{experience}} some difficulty in viewing {{the road ahead}} of them during times ofreduced visibility, such as rain, snow, fog, or the darkness ofnighl Recent studies done by the National Safety Council provide a detailed contrast between fatal accidents occurring {{during the day and}} night. Revealed was that the motor vehicle night death rate (4. 41 deaths per 100 million miles driven) was sharply higher than the corresponding death rate during daylight hours (l. 21). By providing a delineating system powered by the natural resource of solar power, a constant source of visibility may be maintained throughout the evening. Along with providing enough light to trace the outline of the road, other major goals defined in producing this delineator system are as follows: 1. A strong and durable design that would <b>protect</b> the <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> and survive extreme weather conditions. 2. A low maintenance system where components need few repairs or replacements...|$|R
30|$|Biological {{membranes}} {{are designed}} to efficiently <b>protect</b> the <b>internal</b> cellular <b>components</b> from foreign materials. In general, passage across the lipid bilayer follows active or passive transport [15]. Active uptake processes follow energy-dependent endocytotic or pinocytotic pathways, while passive transport is energy-independent and characteristically reserved for small molecules/particles that diffuse through small protein channels or the lipid bilayer itself [16]. Most delivery vectors are trapped inside endosomal compartments, leading to a weak pharmacokinetic profile [17 – 19]. Recently, we showed that {{a particular type of}} mixed-ligand NP exhibiting order in its structured ligand shell gives rise to passive transport properties through biological membranes [20].|$|R
40|$|The TPS 54340 is a 42 V, 3. 5 A, {{step down}} {{regulator}} with an integrated high side MOSFET. The device survives load dump pulses up to 45 V per ISO 7637. Current mode control provides simple external compensation and flexible component selection. A low ripple pulse skip mode reduces the no load supply current to 146 μA. Shutdown supply current {{is reduced to}} 1 μA when the enable pin is pulled low. Undervoltage lockout is internally set at 4. 3 V but can be increased using the enable pin. The output voltage start up ramp is internally controlled to provide a controlled start up and eliminate overshoot. A wide switching frequency range allows either efficiency or external component size to be optimized. Frequency foldback and thermal shutdown <b>protects</b> <b>internal</b> and external <b>components</b> during an overload condition.

40|$|The present {{manuscript}} {{comes with}} an innovative thought of designing a rescue robot, which aims in aiding human caught on fire. The proposed robotic system will rescue into the fire and detect the human (being alive). The fire protective object detection sensor is used, as it {{has the ability to}} reserve its features even in the environment surrounded with smoke and high degree centigrade temperature (due to the fire explored). The body of the robot is made-up of a metal that <b>protect</b> its <b>internal</b> <b>components.</b> Arm 7 Micro controller to provide control and co-ordination between every component is adopted. The information regarding the victim can be communicated with the aid of mobile ad-hoc networks. Wireless communication system assists the robot by enabling the communication between the victim and the RT (Rescue Team). Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) based wireless communication algorithm has been used to provide the back and forth message transmission. The robot can send the feedback to an operator generally located at certain distance, which can guide the rescue team by providing in time information that saves the lives of victims. The entire robot deign is fire and heat protective so that it can easily enter into the regions where a rescuer cannot and can communicate to the RT (Rescue Team) by sending feedback regarding those who trapped on fire...|$|R

Large tower cases provide extra internal space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor, while desktop cases provide less expansion room. All-in-one style designs from Apple, namely the iMac, and similar types, include a video display in the same case. Portable and laptop computers require cases that provide impact protection for the unit. A current development in laptop computers is a detachable keyboard, which allows the system to be configured as s touch-screen tablet. Hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights, paint, or other features, in an activity called case modding.|$|R

40|$|The {{scientific}} understanding of key physical processes between the Sun and the Earth require simultaneous measurements from many vantage points in space. Nano-satellite technologies will enable {{a class of}} constellation missions for the NASA Space Science Sun-Earth Connections. This recent emphasis on the implementation of smaller satellites leads to a requirement for development of smaller subsystems in several areas. Key technologies under development include: advanced miniaturized chemical propulsion; miniaturized sensors; highly integrated, compact electronics; autonomous onboard and ground operations; miniatures low power tracking techniques for orbit determination; onboard RF communications capable of transmitting data to the ground from far distances; lightweight efficient solar array panels; lightweight, high output battery cells; lightweight yet strong composite materials for the nano-spacecraft and deployer-ship structures. These newer smaller systems may have higher power densities and higher thermal transport requirements than seen on previous small satellites. Furthermore, the small satellites may also have a requirement to maintain thermal control through extended earth shadows, possibly up to 8 hours long. Older thermal control technology, such as heaters, thermostats, and heat pipes, may {{not be sufficient to}} meet the requirements of these new systems. Conversely, a miniature two-phase heat transport system (Mini-HTS) such as a Capillary Pumped Loop (CPL) or Loop Heat Pipe (LBP) is a viable alternative. A Mini-HTS can provide fine temperature control, thermal diode action, and a highly efficient means of heat transfer. The Mini-HTS would have power capabilities in the range of tens of watts or less and provide thermal control over typical spacecraft ranges. The Mini-HTS would allow the internal portion of the spacecraft to be thermally isolated from the external radiator, thus <b>protecting</b> the <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> from extreme cold temperatures during an eclipse. The Mini-HTS would transport the beat from these components to a radiator during their operational modes, and it would be shutdown during non-operational or eclipse modes. Shutdown of the Mini-HTS would be accomplished with small heaters and has been successfully demonstrated on numerous occasions, both in the lab and on flight experiments. Efforts are now underway to miniaturize two-phase heat transport systems for the Nanosatellite project, with potential application to other small satellite programs. 'ne goal of this project is to design, build, and test miniature heat transport systems (MHTS) that would demonstrate the feasibility of a small Capillary Pumped Loop (CPL) or Loop Heat Pipe (LBP) ...|$|R
