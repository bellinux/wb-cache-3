40|$|The 14 th of November 2016 {{marks the}} 15 th {{anniversary of the}} World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Doha Ministerial Declaration. The Doha Development Round, or the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), aims at {{reforming}} the multilateral trading system through lower trade barriers and new trade rules. Leaving minor successes, such as {{the conclusion of the}} Bali Package in 2013, aside, skepticism about the Round seems to prevail. Increasingly {{there appears to be a}} consensus that the negotiation mandate is outdated and ill-suited to the realities of 21 st century international trade. The lack of new trade rules is considered a threat to the centrality of the WTO, as many WTO Members actively pursue a trade policy that aims at concluding bilateral or regional trade agreements with like-minded trading partners outside of the WTO. Mega-regional agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and plurilateral agreements such as the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) are relevant examples. In absence of any concrete results in the DDA, this contribution seeks to explore what other methods WTO Members have employed to ‘create’, or ‘make’, new rules in the field of international trade (WTO) law within the multilateral framework offered by the WTO. In particular this paper analyzes three examples of international trade law-making in the WTO. First, this paper examines the proliferation of decisions by Committees in the WTO. In some instances, Committees, such as the TBT Committee, have issued decisions that include interpretations of certain terms in the relevant agreement. This raises questions as to the legal status of these decisions, in particular since they have been applied in the context of WTO Dispute Settlement Proceedings. Second, in some areas WTO Members have been able to agree on plurilateral agreements that are more limited in scope. The Government Procurement Agreement and the Information Technology Agreement are relevant examples. What are the characteristics of the negotiations that have led to the successful conclusion of these negotiations and can they be transposed to other areas? Third, in light of the controversy surrounding the inclusion of WTO-Plus commitments in WTO <b>Protocols</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession,</b> it is warranted to ask the question whether WTO Members have attempted (and perhaps succeeded) to create new rules for newly-acceded Members in an attempt to ‘multilateralize’ these rules at a later stage. This contribution offers a comparative assessment <b>of</b> all 33 <b>Protocols</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> in an attempt to determine whether WTO Members have indeed created new rules on international trade in the course <b>of</b> the <b>accession</b> process <b>of</b> new Members. Central to the analysis in all three examples is the question to what extent concepts typically associated with the multilateral trading system, such as the single-undertaking, reciprocal concessions and consensus-based decision-making are still adequate in 21 st-century trade governance. Thereto, the contribution ends with some concluding observations about the way in which the WTO could retain its status as the main organization for international trade governance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In 2014, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) adopted seven panel {{reports and}} six Appellate Body rulings. Two {{of the cases}} relate to {{anti-dumping}} measures. Three cases, comprising five complaints, are of particular interest and these are summarized and discussed below. China – Rare Earths further refines the relationship between <b>protocols</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> and the general provisions of WTO agreements, in particular the exceptions of Article XX GATT. Recourse to that provision is no longer excluded but depends on a careful case-by-case analysis. While China failed {{to comply with the}} conditions for export restrictions, the case reiterates the problem of insufficiently developed disciplines on export restrictions on strategic minerals and other commodities in WTO law. EC – Seals Products is a landmark case for two reasons. Firstly, it limits the application of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) resulting henceforth in a narrow reading of technical regulations. Normative rules prescribing conditions for importation are to be dealt with under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) instead. Secondly, the ruling permits recourse to public morals in justifying import restrictions essentially on the basis of process and production methods (PPMs). Meanwhile, the more detailed implications for extraterritorial application of such rules and for the concept of PPMs remain open as these key issues were not raised by the parties to the case. Peru – Agricultural Products adds to the interpretation of the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), but most importantly, it confirms the existing segregation of WTO law and the law of free trade agreements. The case is of particular importance for Switzerland in its relations with the European Union (EU). The case raises, but does not fully answer, the question whether in a bilateral agreement, Switzerland or the EU can, as a matter of WTO law, lawfully waive their right of lodging complaints against each other under WTO law within the scope of their bilateral agreement, for example the Agreement on Agriculture where such a clause exists...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} promote a more {{balanced}} trade relationship, China will continue {{to take steps to}} expand domestic consumption and imports in accordance with the 12th Five-Year Plan; and the United States will increase domestic savings and exports, including through the National Export Initiative. China takes promotion of employment as the priority objective for economic development, and strives to achieve full employment. China strives to raise the proportion of residents’ income in gross national income, increase the proportion of wages in the primary income distribution, and realize the increase of people’s income in line with economic development and the increase of workers’ pay in line with gains in labor productivity. China’s minimum wage has steadily increased in recent years {{and will continue to do}} so in the future. China will raise the ratio of services value-added to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by four percentage points over the next five years, with measures to develop the services sector including expanding areas open to foreign involvement, encouraging and guiding a variety of categories of capital into the services sector, and actively developing services enterprises with diversified forms of ownership. The U.S. economy is rebalancing toward sustainable growth, emphasizing higher domestic savings, a commitment to improving long-term fiscal sustainability and productivity-enhancing investments. The personal savings rate was 5.8 percent in 2010, which is the highest rate since 1993 and well above the 2.7 percent average between 2000 and 2007. Thus, much of the transition on the private side to higher saving has already taken place. To increase public saving, the President’s Budget freezes discretionary spending for five years, freezes government salaries for two years, and brings the deficit to three percent of GDP by the second half of this decade - a path consistent with the Administration’s commitments to cut the deficit in half by 2013, and to stabilize or reduce the national debt as a share of the economy. To lay the foundation for future growth, including through greater U.S. exports, the United States will increase and improve investment in innovation, infrastructure, and education. …… The two countries reiterate their support for the G-20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth, and reaffirm their commitments to improve the living standards of our citizens through strong economic and jobs growth, and use the full range of policies required to strengthen the global recovery and to reduce excessive external imbalances and maintain current account imbalances at sustainable levels. The two sides support a bigger role for the G-20 in international economic and financial affairs, and pledge to strengthen communication and coordination to follow through on the commitments of the G-20 summits and push for positive outcomes at the Cannes summit in November. …… II. Strengthening Financial Systems and Improving Financial Supervision [...] The two countries reaffirmed their commitment to deepen bilateral and multilateral cooperation on financial sector investment and regulation, in order to enhance global regulation, establish stronger international coordination to prevent future crises, and ensure a level playing field. Recognizing the positive contributions that financial institutions from each country can play, the two sides pledged to support open environments for investment in financial services and cross-border portfolio investment, consistent with prudential and national security requirements. The United States and China commit to further promote and strengthen financial sector reform.Following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the United States is implementing comprehensive financial reform that better serves households, workers, entrepreneurs, and businesses by reducing systemic risk, raising prudential standards, establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for derivatives, ending the problem of “too big to fail” financial institutions, creating a Federal Insurance Office, and ensuring robust consumer financial protection. China will continue to deepen the reform of its financial system, which has supported the process of transforming its economic development model, developing a financial system that consists of diverse institutions, provides efficient service, controls risks, and encourages financial innovation. China will increase the use of direct financing channels, including stocks, bonds and private equity, to better satisfy the diverse demands in its economy for investment capital and financing. In accordance with the medium- and long-term development perspectives, China will push forward the market-based reform of interest rates. …… The United States and China committed to further strengthen their respective financial systems against money laundering, counterfeiting, terrorism financing, and WMD proliferation financing activities. China will continue to develop and strengthen its regulatory framework for freezing terrorist assets. The two countries will continue to enhance both policy and operational cooperation on combating illicit finance. The two countries will also continue to work collaboratively in the freezing, seizing, and forfeiture of criminal proceeds. Both countries seek to rely on bilateral mutual legal assistance to implement forfeiture orders, and seek to avoid unilateral enforcement action of forfeiture orders to the extent possible. III. Enhancing Trade and Investment Cooperation [...] The two countries, recognizing the importance of open trade and investment in fostering economic growth, job creation, innovation, and prosperity, re-affirmed their commitment to take further steps to liberalize global trade and investment, and to oppose all forms of trade and investment protectionism. The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to work proactively to resolve bilateral trade and investment disputes in a constructive, cooperative, and mutually beneficial manner. China will take stock of the results of the Special Campaign against IPR Infringement and Fake and Shoddy Products (Special Campaign), and improve on the high-level, long-term mechanism of IPR protection and enforcement, building on the Special Campaign currently in place. China will strengthen the government inspection mechanism so as to make sure that the software being used by the government agencies at all levels is legitimate. China and the United States will strengthen cooperation in the JCCT IPR Working Group on software legalization. …… China and the United States reaffirm their prior SED outcomes on transparency. The United States welcomes China’s statement that it will issue a measure in 2011, to implement the requirement to publish all proposed trade- and economic-related administrative regulations and departmental rules on the SCLAO website for a public comment period of not less than 30 days from the date of publication, except as specified in China’s <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> to the WTO or in public emergency situations.

The TRM has the objective of monitoring and enforcement of implementation of WTO commitments, promoting transparency and the exchange of information in trade relations with China. China is lowering the expectations of some of the WTO members for the outcome of the TRM. It follows that the WTO members' participation in the review had declined in favour of bilateral negotiations which result in the best means to overcome many problems in China's WTO compliance. It is necessary to try to understand if there are comprehensive and justifiable reasons for China to delegitimize the multilateral system at the WTO in general and in the TRM context. According to some scholars, the general Chinese behaviour not in favour of the TRM could be explained with reference to the Chinese cultural tradition, where the best way to resolve the disputes was through mediation and conciliation. China is a high-context society, where the central role is played by collective entities and groups and not by individuals. A key element in the Chinese mentality (such as in other Asian, Middle East and South American countries) is the concept of preserving group harmony and maintaining one's public image. The best behaviour is to try to avoid any direct confrontation, such as bringing a lawsuit. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{text of the}} GATT signed at Geneva on October 30, 1947 {{was drafted}} as any {{self-sufficient}} international agreement, therefore specifying the modalities of its (definitive) acceptance by the contracting parties and of its (definitive) entry into force, notwithstanding the contextual signature <b>of</b> the <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> Provisional Application and the pending coming into existence of the ITO Charter which would {{have the effect of}} replace it. Indeed, the provisions of Art. XXVI were not strictly limited to the subject of the acceptance, entry into force and registration, as the title might suggest. Art. XXVI: 1 also provided an assessment of the “date of this agreement [i. e. GATT]” which affected the implementation of other GATT provisions. Art. XXVI: 5 (c) introduced a procedure <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> to the GATT which was alternative to the general one provided in Art. XXXIII, allowing customs territories having gained full autonomy in the conduct of their external commercial relations to accede through sponsorship by an existing contracting party previously responsible for the territory. Art. XXVI was amended several times, with the hidden or declared purpose of encouraging the Contracting Parties to abide definitively by the GATT. During the 1949 Third Session of the CONTRACTING PARTIES at Annecy a <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> Terms <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> was adopted, containing standard terms envisaging a right of acceding governments that were not entitled to accept the General Agreement under Art. XXVI: 2, to accede definitely to the GATT at any time after its entry into force following a procedure similar to the one for acceptance contained in Art. XXVI. The Annecy Protocol served as a model for all subsequent accession protocols. In the 1954 - 1955 Review Session, the CONTRACTING PARTIES agreed on the validity of reservations accompanying an act of acceptance pursuant to Art. XXVI to the effect that Part II of the GATT will be applied to the fullest extent not inconsistent with existing domestic legislation (the “grandfather clause”). The Review Session also resulted in the deletion of the Ad Note Art. XXVI included in the Geneva 1947 text. These amendments did not suffice to convince the Contracting Parties to accept GATT definitely for their concerns, especially those regarding existing legislation, never weakened. Art. XXVI has been superseded by Art. XIV of the Treaty establishing the WTO as far as the subject of acceptance, entry into force and deposit of the agreement is concerned. The provisions of Art. XXVI: 1 and of Art. XXVI: 5 (c) were not continued, and thus do not have a correspondent in the WTO Treaty. On the whole, Art. XXVI has had a limited application. The only provision of this Art. which has had a considerable impact on the asset and functioning of the General Agreement has been para 5 (c). Since entering GATT under Art. XXVI: 5 (c) had produced the undesirable result of making it possible to become Contracting Party without having undertaken significant obligations (for example, if the sponsoring State had previously made limited tariff concessions), Art. XI of the WTO Agreement on original membership, in requiring that all original Members have schedules, was designed to remove this inconvenience, i. e. to ensure that all WTO Members have made tariff and other commitments, even if they had not done so in GATT...|$|R

The result of these negotiations is contained in an accession package which contains a <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession,</b> a Working Party Report and Schedules of Concessions. Many commentators have expressed their concern {{about the fact that}} the WTOâs membership has essentially become two-tiered, with different Members having to adhere to different obligations. 33 accessions have been completed to this day. This paper presents the results of a mapping exercise of all 33 Protocols of Accession and Working Party Reports with the aim of establishing i) whether the number of commitments made by applicants has increased over time; and ii) whether the content of the commitments has become âmore stringentâ over time. Ultimately, one may question whether the WTOâs accession process poses a risk to the Single-Undertaking that forms the foundation of the organization. However, it is submitted that in order to answer this question, a better understanding is needed of both the amount and content of the commitments that applicants have made upon accession. After recent reports by panels and the Appellate Body, it is clear that one must look closely at the language of the relevant commitment in order to determine its relationship with a provision in the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement). Building on prior scholarship, this paper suggests a refined categorization of commitments in Protocols of Accession and examines the commitments in the fields of transparency, anti-dumping and export duties in more detail. status: publishe...|$|E

In recent years China is going global as well. Accompanied with {{a large amount of}} outbound FDI, the level of debt is also increasing. Thus it is necessary for China to adopt a sustainable development policy and behave based on rules. China needs to work with the world to promote a rules-based investment climate. At a multilateral level, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 and promised general and specific obligations on market entry and non-discrimination principles. Bilaterally, only after 2001, China has started negotiating preferential trade agreements (PTAs). The first part of the thesis analyses China’s legal obligations in investment agreements in pre- and post-WTO entry phases. Chapter 1 introduces China’s investment policy before 2001. Chapter 2 clarifies China’s commitments on non-discrimination principles under the WTO agreements, especially China’s <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession.</b> Chapter 3 compares Chinese BITs and PTAs with regard to investment principles. The second part of the thesis concerns interpretation on substantive and procedural provisions. Chapter 4 tries to answer the question of whether and how do tribunals consider jurisprudential concepts developed in the case law of the trade regime when resolving investment cases. Chapter 5 examines different remedies in trade and investment agreements. It is important for China to keep compliance with its commitments in international agreements, otherwise, it would face countermeasures which are highly costly. Also, China can implement competition rules in its domestic market for improving firms’ efficiency.

Among the 30 local pummelo accessions, accession number 6, 8, 10, 15, 17 and 22 were found better in respect of fruit characteristics compared to the rest <b>of</b> the <b>accessions.</b> The plants <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> number 8 bore the maximum number of fruits (52. 66) and plants <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> number 5 bore the minimum number of fruits (13. 00). The fruit <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> number 27 was the heaviest (2160 g) whereas accession number 7 produced the smallest fruits (718. 33 g). Fruits <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> number 6 contained the highest TSS (9. 66 %). The edible qualities <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> number 6, 8, 15, 17, 21 and 22 were found better compared to others.

40|$|PhDIn November 2001, the WTO members {{allowed the}} People's Republic of China, a {{formerly}} planned {{economy that is}} going through different stages of domestic economic and related legal restructuring, to accede to the WTO. This accession {{is believed to be}} necessary for the WTO to become a truly international organisation in the post-Cold War era, along side of the IMF and the World Bank, and for China to become an integrated member of the international economic community. Although the end of the Cold War has changed European trade policy profoundly, the European Community (EC) " has maintained a traditionally bifurcated trade policy, in which planned economies, also referred to as "non-market economies", are given treatment different from market economies in trade policy instruments, such as the EC emergency safeguards provisions and EC anti-dumping regulation. The EC perceives the Chinese domestic legal and economic reforms as unfinished; and, although the treatment of Chinese products under the EC import and anti-dumping regulations has been liberalised in recent years, China is still generally considered to be a non-market economy. It is questionable whether in light of China's WTO accession such a non-market approach vis-Ã¤-vis China, as approved in the Chinese <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession,</b> is justified. This thesis argues that the non-market approach for China, as it stands today, should be adjusted for two basic reasons. First, this approach does not allow China to benefit fully from its WTO accession {{for a number of years}} to come. Second, as long as the period allowing non-market economy treatment continues, the danger exists that the non-market economy trade policy, especially as far as anti-dumping is concerned, may tend to be abused for protectionist purposes by the EC. Protectionist abuse would be harmful for China because its export-oriented growth is necessary to advance the country's domestic legal and economic reforms. Protectionism, equally, would be harmful for the EC because it prevents the Community industry from adjusting itself to face the challenge of increased Chinese competition. Because there is no satisfactory methodological solution to deal with the new variant of non-market economies, and because it is impossible for China - despite all good intentions - to implement fully the WTO accession requirements by the time they must phase in, the suggested approach is for the EC to show restraint in employing these trade policy instruments against China. As far as emergency safeguards are concerned, this restraint is already a fact. Nonetheless, some holdovers from the Cold War should be put up for change. Such adjustments will also be required for the EC anti-dumping regulation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper explores both {{quantitative}} and qualitative implications <b>of</b> Turkish <b>accession</b> to the EU for the transport sector. In part, this involves the application of numerical estimates of the economy-wide and sector impact <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> (given the pre-existence of a customs union) on the sector. This is followed by factor analysis of regulatory regimes. There is little evidence pointing to significant pressure to restructure, due to general market access conditions or regulatory convergence as part <b>of</b> <b>accession.</b> A general economy-wide assessment of the macro effects <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> is also provided.
