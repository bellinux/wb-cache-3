40|$|Three {{batches of}} milk were ultrafiltered to 60, 65, or 70 % volume {{reduction}} before diafiltration. Starting diafiltration at 70 % volume reduction took less time and water without affecting nutrient recovery. Whole milk was heated to 60, 72, and 82 °C for 16 s. Milk representing each heat treatment {{was divided into}} three batches, one unacidified (pH 6. 6), the others acidified to pH 6. 2 and 5. 8. The milk was ultrafiltered, diafiltered, and concentrated to 5 x (80 % volume reduction). Retentate was inoculated with. 5 % lactic culture and incubated at 28 °C to pH 5. 1. Each lot of fermented retentate was evaporated under 76 kPa vacuum until moisture was reduced to 35 - 38 %, then made into pasteurized <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> by cooking to 82 °C. The final product contained 43 - 44 % moisture, 24 - 28 % fat, 1. 7 % salt, and 2. 5 % sodium citrate. Fat and protein recovery were not affected by heat treatment or pH adjustment of the milk. Recovery of calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were significantly reduced following acidification of milk. Riboflavin recovery was higher when milk was preheated to 60 °C as opposed to 72 or 82 °C. Effect of cooking temperature on meltability of <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> was evaluated by repeating the above experiment at three cooking temperatures, 70, 76, or 81 °C. Cooking temperature significantly affected meltability. Cheese cooked to 70 °C melted best for all treatments. At all cooking temperatures, cheese from unacidified milk (pH 6. 6) had greater meltability than cheese from milk acidified to pH 5. 8 or 6. 2. Cooking temperature had a greater effect on meltability of <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> made from ultrafiltered retentate than calcium content. Preheating milk before ultrafiltration did not significantly affect meltability of pasteurized <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food.</b> Meltability of pasteurized <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> was best when made from retentate heated (following ultrafiltration) to 61 °C for 16 sand poorest when retentate was heated to 72 or 83 °C. During ultrafiltration without diafiltration, amino acid analysis was on samples taken at 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 % volume reduction. There were no differences in amino acid composition (g/ 100 g protein) between milk and 5 x retentate. Soluble nitrogen at pH 4. 6 in pasteurized <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> was an approximate measure of undenatgred whey protein. As processing temperature increased from 66 to 82 °C, undenatured whey protein decreased. Decrease in meltability due to increased processing temperature was related to denaturation of whey protein. <b>Process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> made from blends of UF curd and Cheddar cheese had acceptable meltability with up to 66 % UF curd when the final processing temperature was 68 °C. Milk with high bacterial numbers (7. 8 x 106 CFU/ml) was heated to 72 °C for 16 s, acidified to pH 5. 8 and ultrafiltered to a 5 x concentration.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of starches on the rheological and functional properties of <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> The key challenge of this project was to succeed in developing a reduced protein <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> To do so, a fundamental understanding was needed of the textural and functional contributions of the starches in a dynamic <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> environment. A collection of different techniques, namely rheology, confocal microscopy, particle size measurement and functionality tests (firmness, stress and strain, melt) were used. The effects of various starches were studied in two formulations: model rennet casein-based <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> spread and an Individual Wrapped Slice (IWS) <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> A range of experimental cheeses was produced by addition of starches at different rates. Samples were prepared on three different pieces of equipment: a Paar-Physica Rheometer (starch cell), a Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA), and a Blentech cooker (pilot-plant). Ten different starches (Cornstarch, Waxy cornstarch, High amylose cornstarch (HACS). Rice starch, Waxy rice starch, Potato starch, Wheat starch, Resistant starch, Acid converted starch and Perfectamyl (Di-starch phosphate of potato starch) were used for the study. These showed differences in rheological, microstructural and functional properties of the final products. The differences arising in the samples prepared on the various equipment might be due to the physio-chemical properties of the food components and/or to differences in processing conditions. The rennet casein-based <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> spreads were prepared on the Paar-Physica and the RVA with 9. 7 % protein level. Addition of starch (ten starches) to <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> spread increases the rheological attributes, such as complex modulus (G*), strain and viscosity. However the extent of this increase is totally dependent on the type and physio-chemical properties of the starch. For better understanding of the effect of starch addition, microstructural evaluation and particle size distribution were required in addition to rheological behaviour. The microstructure showed marked differences, which were attributed to different processing conditions and also the physio-chemical properties of the food components (protein, fat and starch). This was also observed in the particle size distribution, where the RVA tended to produce smaller fat droplets than the Paar-Physica. The protein level in the rennet casein-based <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> spread was decreased from 9. 7 % to 8. 5 % and 7. 5 %. Six different starches (Waxy cornstarch, HACS, Rice starch, Potato starch, Wheat starch and Acid converted starch) were investigated in these reduced protein systems. It was found that reducing the level of protein in the <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> influenced the rheological properties, the mean particle size and the microstructural properties of model <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> spreads. The emulsifying properties and gel strength of the gel network decrease with reduction in the protein level, thereby decreasing the elasticity of the <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> Validation of the effects of starch on rennet casein-based <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> spreads was carried out in an IWS <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> system using the RVA. The impact of four different starches on the meltability and textural properties of IWS <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> was dependent on the type of starch. Potato starch, wheat starch and rice starch increased the firmness and viscosity of the <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> However, as the firmness increased the melt decreased. HACS contributed slightly to the firmness and viscosity of the IWS <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> Strain values were largely unaffected by starch addition suggesting that the <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> structure remained a continuous protein network. Among all the starches, potato starch gave the best results in terms of textural properties of the <b>processed</b> <b>cheese,</b> especially firmness. Protein substitution of 1 and 2 wt% was achieved by replacement with 1 and 2 wt% potato starch respectively. The low protein and high starch levels introduced some stickiness into the product. On a pilot-plant scale, when potato starch was used to replace protein at 1 and 2 wt% levels, the firmness of the control was retained in the resulting reduced protein <b>processed</b> <b>cheeses</b> and the flavour of the starch containing products was found to be satisfactory. Although the melt characteristics decreased, they remain within the commercially acceptable limits. However stickiness was again an issue that needs to be addressed before commercialisation. <b>Processed</b> <b>cheese</b> is a very complex system involving protein-protein, protein-fat and protein-water interactions. Addition of starch increases the number of different interactions. Differences in the processing conditions along with physio-chemical properties of the food components lead to differences in the rheological and functional behaviour of the <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> Despite all these complexities, this work provides useful information on the effects of adding starch on the rheological, microstructural and functional properties of <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> This work demonstrates reduced protein IWS <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> manufacture is possible although some further work is needed on the stickiness issue...|$|R
