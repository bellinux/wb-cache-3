50|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> {{the common law}} of contract provides that a contract cannot confer rights or impose obligations arising under it on any person or agent except the parties to it.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas v. Winchester, 6 N.Y. 397 (1852), which {{established}} the [...] "imminent danger to human life" [...] doctrine, {{was at the}} head of the cases in assaulting the protective wall of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> the tort field. Subsequent examples include: MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., Goldberg v. Kollsman Instrument Corp., and finally, Judge Jones's landmark holding in Codling v. Paglia, in which the Court demolished what was left of the <b>privity</b> barrier <b>in</b> tort cases by adopting the doctrine of strict products liability.|$|R
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the Nebraska Supreme Court missed an {{opportunity}} to reconsider the entrenched common law rule <b>in</b> Nebraska requiring <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> legal malpractice actions. Part II briefly explores the role of <b>privity</b> nationally and <b>in</b> Nebraska, while Part III discusses the facts of Swanson v. Ptak. Part IV explores the implied relationship doctrine, concluding that the harshness of the privity requirement for clients who reasonably relied on what they assumed to be an attorney-client relationship outweighs any benefits it may have to the legal profession...|$|R
50|$|The {{assignment}} {{does not}} necessarily {{have to be in}} writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish <b>privity</b> (<b>in</b> other words, contractual relationship, including right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party obligor and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, it {{has been}} held that {{third-party}} beneficiaries may uphold a promise made for its benefit in a contract of insurance {{to which it is}} not a party (Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v. McNiece Bros Pty Ltd (1988) 165 CLR 107)Austlii. It {{is important to note that}} the decision in Trident had no clear ratio, and did not create a general exemption to the doctrine of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> Australia.|$|R
50|$|Jack: {{the first}} jack played <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> forces the next player {{to take two}} cards from the stock and forfeit their turn. A second jack <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> forces the next player in turn to take four cards; three jacks <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> force the next player <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> to take six cards, and four jacks <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> force the next player to take eight cards.|$|R

50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> the common law's {{law of contract}} dictates that persons may not reap the benefits nor suffer the burdens of a contract {{to which they were}} not a party. Under the doctrine, if a consumer bought goods from a retailer who had originally bought them from the manufacturer, then, if the goods proved faulty, the consumer should sue the retailer. The consumer could not sue the manufacturer in contract law because no contract existed between them. The retailer could then counterclaim against the manufacturer. In most cases, however, consumers may rely on the manufacturer's guarantee that will have been assigned to them.|$|R
