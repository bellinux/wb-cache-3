5000|$|A {{wide range}} of {{accessories}} made this camera a system: <b>panorama</b> <b>head,</b> sun shade, parallax-corrected close-ups lenses, color correction, contrast enhancing, and special effect filters, all mounted with a quick release bayonet, {{as well as a}} quick-change tripod attachment. Some, professional, amateur and fine-art photographers still shoot Rolleiflex TLR film cameras with color transparency, color negative, or black-and-white film. The later f2.8 and f3.5 letter models (Planar or Xenotar lens) are highly sought after in the used market, and command the greatest price. [...] Historically there were five focal length cameras available including 5.5 cm Rollei-Wide, 6.0 cm Baby Rollei, 7.5 cm (f:3.5), 8.0 cm (f2.8), and 13.5 cm (f:4 Zeiss Sonnar) Tele-Rolleiflex. Although all Rolleflex cameras can be fine user cameras, there is also an active market for many Rolleiflex models as collectables, and this adds (greatly in some models) to the end price paid, particularly in Japan.|$|E
40|$|For {{mapping of}} {{building}} interiors various 2 D and 3 D indoor surveying systems are available today. These systems essentially differ {{from each other}} by price and accuracy {{as well as by}} the effort required for fieldwork and post-processing. The Laboratory for Photogrammetry & Laser Scanning of HafenCity University (HCU) Hamburg has developed, as part of an industrial project, a lowcost indoor mapping system, which enables systematic inventory mapping of interior facilities with low staffing requirements and reduced, measurable expenditure of time and effort. The modelling and evaluation of the recorded data take place later in the office. The indoor mapping system of HCU Hamburg consists of the following components: laser range finder, <b>panorama</b> <b>head</b> (pan-tilt-unit), single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) with digital camera and battery power supply. The camera is pre-calibrated in a photogrammetric test field under laboratory conditions. However, remaining systematic image errors are corrected simultaneously within the generation of the panorama image. Due to cost reasons the camera and laser range finder are not coaxially arranged on the <b>panorama</b> <b>head.</b> Therefore, eccentricity and alignment of the laser range finder against the camera must be determined in a system calibration. For the verification of the system accuracy and the system calibration, the laser points were determined from measurements with total stations. The differences to the reference were 4 - 5 mm for individual coordinates...|$|E
5000|$|Directions: From Los Angeles take Interstate 5 {{north to}} Highway 99 north to Bakersfield. Exit at Rosedale Highway (Highway 58)/24th Street (Highway 178), merge right onto 24th Street going across the Kern River into downtown. You will merge onto 23rd street {{continuing}} east.

After crossing North Chester Avenue, Merle Haggard Drive will turn into Manor Street and will curve to the south. When you cross the Kern River and start to go up the bluffs at Garces Memorial High School you will exit to your right onto an onramp that will circle back over Manor and put you onto <b>Panorama</b> Drive <b>heading</b> east to Mt. Vernon Avenue. Parking is on two main large lots off Mt. Vernon Avenue and another off University Avenue. There are no parking fees for events at the stadium. Tailgating is an encouraged tradition ...|$|R
