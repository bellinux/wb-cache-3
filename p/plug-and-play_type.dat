Our goals in developing this tool were to provide 1) a <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>type</b> of system that facilitates the integration of new modules and experimentation with different core modules 2) configuration options that effect {{the behavior of the}} modules so that the system can be flexibly fine-tuned for a number of learning studies and 3) an authoring language for setting up the domain knowledge and resources needed by the system modules...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to provide {{services}} to alleviate range anxiety of electric vehicles, we consider the problem of balancing charging demand across a network of charging stations. Our objective is to reduce the potential for excessively long queues to build up at some charging stations, although other charging stations are underutilized. A stochastic balancing algorithm is presented to achieve these goals. A further feature of this algorithm is that it is fully decentralized and facilitates a <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>type</b> of behavior. Using our system, the charging stations can join and leave the network without any changes to, or communication with, a centralized infrastructure. Analysis and simulations are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{provision}} {{of very high}} data rates in a ubiquitous manner throughout the service area is a great challenge for 4 G and beyond- 4 G wireless networks. Towards that end, the deployment of fixed relays by the operators has become an accepted radio access network concept in various standardization activities including LTE-A and 802. 16 j. It is envisaged that next-generation networks will comprise a plethora of wireless relay stations. Worthy of mention is the <b>plug-and-play</b> <b>type</b> of relay known as nomadic relay. We devise novel radio resource management (RRM) schemes to facilitate the operation of fixed relay stations (FRSs) and nomadic relay stations (NRSs) in OFDMA-based multicellular networks. Two schemes of different decentralization levels are devised and classified as distributed and semi-centralized. A novel user-based dynamic routing or link selection that significantly reduces the feedback overhead is employed. We develop methods by which the NRSs act autonomously to acquire radio resources without relying on a central entity. NRS operation is {{the same in the}} two schemes and can be extended to any other OFDMA-based RRM scheme. Through the asynchronous opportunistic medium access of the NRSs, smart and opportunistic intra-cell channel reuse is attained. This is different from the static intra-cell reuse patterns often adopted in literature. Furthermore, we introduce a method to enable the cooperation between an NRS and a serving FRS to assist a troubled wireless terminal (WT). We thus establish the concept of nomadic relay-augmented fixed relay networks. To the extent of our knowledge of the literature, no other work has undertaken this task so far.
