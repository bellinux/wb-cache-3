25|$|In November 1916, she was {{travelling}} by steamer from Spain {{when her}} ship called at the British port of Falmouth. There {{she was arrested}} and brought to London where she was interrogated at length by Sir Basil Thomson, Assistant Commissioner at New Scotland Yard in charge of counter-espionage. He gave an account of this in his 1922 book Queer <b>People,</b> <b>saying</b> that she eventually admitted to working for the Deuxième Bureau. Initially detained in Cannon Street police station, she was then released and stayed at the Savoy Hotel. A full transcript of the interview is in Britain's National Archives and was broadcast, with Mata Hari played by Eleanor Bron, on the independent station LBC in 1980. It is unclear if she lied on this occasion, believing the story made her sound more intriguing, or if French authorities were using her {{in such a way}} but would not acknowledge her due to the embarrassment and international backlash it could cause.|$|E

500|$|Although Eugenides sought {{expert advice}} about intersex, sexology, and the {{formation}} of gender identity, he refrained from meeting with intersex <b>people,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] " [...] decided not to work in that reportorial mode. Instead of trying to create a separate person, I tried to pretend that I had this [...] and that I had lived through this as much as I could". Eugenides read books, sifted through many sheets of microfiche, and combed through videotapes and newsletters that dealt with the subject. He visited the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture to search for the sole copy of a book about an [...] "elusive historical figure". He discovered details of what he considered a vivid intersex condition while browsing Columbia University's medical library.|$|E
500|$|Other issues {{included}} the studio's desire to substitute Montreal or Prague for Paris {{in order to}} lower costs, Liman's insistence {{on the use of}} a French-speaking film crew, and poor test audience reactions to the film's Paris finale. The latter required a late return to location in order to shoot a new, more action-oriented conclusion to the Paris story arc. In addition to Paris, filming took place in Prague, Imperia, Rome, Mykonos, and Zürich; several scenes set in Zürich were also filmed in Prague. Damon described the production as a struggle, citing the early conflicts that he and Liman had with the studio, but denied that it was an overtly difficult process, stating, [...] "When I hear <b>people</b> <b>saying</b> that the production was a nightmare it's like, a 'nightmare'? Shooting's always hard, but we finished." ...|$|E

500|$|Al Jean, showrunner since season thirteen, {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} criticism, with some arguing that the show has {{continued}} to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is [...] "on auto-pilot", [...] "too sentimental", and the episodes are [...] "just being cranked out." [...] Some critics believe that the show has [...] "entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny." [...] John Ortved, author of , characterized the Jean era as [...] "toothless", and criticized what he perceived as the show's increase in social and political commentary. Jean responded: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two <b>people</b> <b>saying,</b> 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, Joss Whedon {{deflected}} {{any direct}} influences from other series, {{such as the}} efforts of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in The X-Files, and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on [...] "the peripheral people...the people {{on the edges of}} the grand adventures." [...] As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences [...] "seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that." [...] Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered <b>people,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E

500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard <b>people</b> <b>saying,</b> ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E
500|$|Tintin in the Congo was serialised {{under the}} French title of Tintin au Congo in Le Petit Vingtième from 5 May 1930 to 11 June 1931; it was {{syndicated}} to the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants. Drawn {{in black and}} white, it followed the same formula employed in Land of the Soviets, remaining [...] "essentially plotless" [...] according to Michael Farr, and consisting of largely unrelated events that Hergé improvised each week. Hergé later commented {{on the process of}} writing these early adventures, stating, [...] "The [...] came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning how I was going to get Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week." [...] The strip's visual style was similar to that of Land of the Soviets. In the first instalment of Tintin in the Congo, Hergé featured Quick and Flupke, two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another Le Petit Vingtième comic strip, in the crowd of <b>people</b> <b>saying</b> goodbye to Tintin.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure. Jacob Burch, an administrator of the website NoHomers.com, {{said in an interview that}} the show [...] "seems less cohesive, more about trying to get the jokes in there, instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that" [...] and adds [...] "I just think there's only so much you can do [...]" [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two <b>people</b> <b>saying,</b> 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13.

500|$|Cruise's {{representative}} {{responded to}} the controversy shortly after it broke, telling the Associated Press that the allegations of Cruise's involvement were [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "he never said that". According to The Washington Post, Cruise's publicist asserted that [...] "Tom {{had nothing to do}} with this matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC's Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, [...] "First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are <b>people</b> <b>saying</b> about me?'" [...] A representative of Cruise had also denied any involvement of Cruise with the issue, specifically responding to allegations of Cruise's reputed corporate power play.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season (1998). He once again became show runner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean called it [...] "a great job with a lot of responsibility," [...] and cited [...] "the fact that people love it so much" [...] as [...] "great." [...] He adds, however, that [...] "the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] Jean's return was initially welcomed, with MSNBC's Jon Bonné stating: [...] "Jean, who took the show's helm from executive producer Mike Scully in 2001, has guided the show away from its gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation...these are certainly brighter days for the show's long-time fans." [...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two <b>people</b> <b>saying,</b> 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13.

500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} what I had done. I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard <b>people</b> <b>saying</b> 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E
