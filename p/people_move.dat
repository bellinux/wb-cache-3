5|$|As well {{as being}} an {{important}} industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, new construction added approximately 137,000 square meters (1.5 million square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. More than 1,300 <b>people</b> <b>move</b> into the city daily, bolstering the economy by approximately 100 million Yuan.|$|E

He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.|$|E

5|$|Fady can {{not only}} help protect lemurs and their forests under stable {{socioeconomic}} situations, {{but they can also}} lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town. In other ways, fady does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead. Fady can vary from village to village within the same region. If <b>people</b> <b>move</b> to a new village or region, their fady may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. Fady restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, the population has started rising again as elderly <b>people</b> <b>move</b> into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that TMS {{can be used to}} manipulate the perception of authorship of a specific choice. Experiments showed that neurostimulation could affect which hands <b>people</b> <b>move,</b> even though the experience of free will was intact. An early TMS study revealed that activation of one side of the neocortex could be used to bias the selection of one's opposite side hand in a forced-choice decision task. Ammon and Gandevia found {{that it was possible to}} influence which hand <b>people</b> <b>move</b> by stimulating frontal regions that are involved in movement planning using transcranial magnetic stimulation in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.|$|E

25|$|Statistics New Zealand also {{publishes a}} range of data on the {{economic}} well-being of New Zealanders and, in 2012, released a discussion paper highlighting the need for government agreement {{on the development of}} more useful criteria and statistics related to poverty. Currently the information that is collected is 'static data' – it shows the percentage of citizens below a certain level of income. But New Zealand is unique among western OECD countries in that it does not collect 'dynamic' data which captures the extent to which <b>people</b> <b>move</b> in and out of poverty.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>people</b> <b>move</b> {{to urban}} areas {{primarily}} because cities promise more jobs, better schools for poor's children, and diverse income opportunities than subsistence farming in rural areas. For example, in 1995, 95.8% of migrants to Surabaya, Indonesia reported that jobs were their primary motivation for {{moving to the}} city. However, some rural migrants may not find jobs immediately because of their lack of skills and the increasingly competitive job markets, which leads to their financial shortage. Many cities, on the other hand, do not provide enough low-cost housing for {{a large number of}} rural-urban migrant workers. Some rural–urban migrant workers cannot afford housing in cities and eventually settle down in only affordable slums. Further, rural migrants, mainly lured by higher incomes, continue to flood into cities. They thus expand the existing urban slums.|$|E

25|$|The A12 trunk Road, {{running from}} London to Great Yarmouth {{originally}} {{built by the}} Romans to connect London and Colchester, used {{to pass through the}} city but is now diverted around the east. The £34.8m nine-mile (14km) bypass opened in November 1986. It is a very important route, linking London and the M25 motorway with the docks at Harwich and Felixstowe, and the East Coast. Despite being notorious for frequent congestion, poor road surfaces and potholes, as well as accidents, many <b>people</b> <b>move</b> to Chelmsford for it being so well connected by not only rail services, but roads. The A414 trunk road, running from Hemel Hempstead to nearby Maldon, is a main road into the city, just off the A12, and also links the city to the M11 motorway at J7 near Harlow. The A130 provides an important link down to the A127 and A13, while the A131 passes through smaller towns and villages. The nearest motorway is the M25 London Orbital at J11 on the A12, 14 miles away.|$|E
25|$|Many railfans have a {{fixation}} with steam locomotives, which sometimes also fascinate the general public, {{as seen by}} the attendance at stations to view steam-hauled railtours. Sometimes the appeal of trains is nostalgic, recalling an earlier era when the railroads {{played a central role}} in commerce and transportation, and the depot was the center of every town. Nostalgia may also result from the long, lonesome wail of the train's horn, which mimics vocalizations that want for a more simple time reminiscent of home, as heard in country or folk music worldwide. Sometimes the appeal is due to a fondness for large machinery that can be inspected and photographed up close. Sometimes there is an appeal of the scenery of the railroad running through open, uninviting terrain, or the gritty ambiance of the urban train yard. In this case, urban exploration poses a similar appeal. Some people were raised near streetcar tracks or railways. Everyday activities were associated with railroad, which seemed to be a part of life. This may lead to an interest in railcars, how they move, numbering, and other rail systems in the world and how they compare with their native ones. If these <b>people</b> <b>move</b> to another locale, their interest in railroads might be nostalgic.|$|E
