40|$|A graph is IC-planar if it admits {{a drawing}} {{in the plane}} with at most one {{crossing}} per edge and such that two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> edges share no common end vertex. IC-planarity specializes both NIC-planarity, which allows a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> edges to share at most one vertex, and 1 -planarity, where each edge may be crossed at most once. We show that there are infinitely maximal IC-planar graphs with n vertices and 3 n- 5 edges and thereby prove a tight lower bound on the density of this class of graphs...|$|R

5000|$|The Möbius-Kantor graph is a {{subgraph}} of the four-dimensional hypercube graph, {{formed by}} removing eight edges from the hypercube [...] Since the hypercube is a unit distance graph, the Möbius-Kantor graph {{can also be}} drawn in the plane with all edges unit length, although such a drawing will necessarily have some <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> edges.|$|R
