5|$|Mercury is an {{ingredient}} in dental amalgams. Thiomersal (called Thimerosal in the United States) is an organic compound {{used as a}} <b>preservative</b> in vaccines, though this use is in decline. Thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based <b>preservative</b> could cause or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link. Nevertheless, thiomersal has been removed from, or reduced to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 {{years of age and}} under, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.|$|E

50|$|Chemical <b>preservatives</b> can be {{classified}} into three broad categories: water-borne <b>preservatives,</b> oil-borne <b>preservatives,</b> and light organic solvent <b>preservatives</b> (LOSPs). These are discussed in more detail below.|$|R
30|$|Policy and {{legislative}} measures {{to ban the}} use of toxic <b>preservatives,</b> and growing awareness on using less toxic and more environmentally friendly <b>preservatives</b> would be another {{way to reduce the}} environmental impacts (Lin et al. 2009). For example, a number of toxic <b>preservatives</b> such as CCA, cresote, and <b>preservatives</b> based on volatile organic solvent (VOC), are restricted in Europe and the USA. Instead, use of environmentally friendly <b>preservatives</b> such as copper-organic <b>preservatives</b> replacing CCA, CCB and CCP <b>preservatives,</b> microemulsion water-dilutable concentrates with organic fungicides and insecticides, and water and solvent-based coloured <b>preservatives</b> replacing creosote, have emerged to fill the gap (Coggins 2008; EU 2006). Therefore, stringent environmental policies will have to be practiced to reduce the use of harmful chemicals in wood <b>preservatives,</b> as practiced under Biocidal Products Directives within European Union (Hingston et al. 2001) and restricted pesticidal use of three primary heavy duty wood <b>preservatives</b> (“HDWPs”) under Environmental Protection Agency, USA in 2008 (Tomasovic 2012).|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine <b>preservative,</b> the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this <b>preservative</b> would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the {{quantity}} and chemical type of phosphorus (P) content in cooked ham products with or without <b>preservatives</b> using a novel biochemical procedure. METHODS: We examined {{the quantity}} and types of P in 40 samples of cooked ham, including 20 without and 20 with P-containing <b>preservatives,</b> which were purchased randomly from a grocery store in Italy. Food samples were analyzed for dry matter, nitrogen, fat, and P content. Novel spectrophotometric methods were used to measure total P and 3 different P subtypes, that is, water-soluble (inorganic) P including added <b>preservatives</b> and natural P derived from phospholipids and phosphoproteins, separately. RESULTS: Compared with hams without <b>preservatives,</b> hams with P-containing <b>preservatives</b> had significantly lower dry matter and protein and fat contents. There was 66 % more inorganic P (IP) in ham with <b>preservatives</b> than in samples without <b>preservatives</b> (169 ± 36 vs. 102 ± 16 mg/ 100 g, P <. 001, respectively). There {{were no significant differences}} in P contents derived from proteins or lipids. The P-to-protein ratio was higher in ham samples with <b>preservatives</b> than in those without <b>preservatives</b> (16. 1 ± 4. 0 and 9. 8 ± 0. 8 mg/g, P <. 001). The sum of measured IP and P from phospholipids and phosphoproteins was 91 % ± 4 % of measured total P (207. 1 ± 50. 7 vs. 227. 2 ± 54. 4 mg/ 100 g), indicating a small portion of unspecified P and/or under measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Novel differential dietary P measurement detects added P-containing <b>preservatives.</b> Cooked ham with <b>preservatives</b> has 66 % more measurable IP and 64 % higher P-to-protein ratio than ham without <b>preservatives.</b> The contribution of food added with P-containing <b>preservatives</b> to global dietary P burden can negatively influence chronic kidney disease outcome and counteract the efficacy of P-binder medications: this is an important topic that warrants additional investigations...|$|R

40|$|Effect of wood <b>preservatives</b> (waterborne and organicborne) on the {{performance}} of surface finishing properties is investigated. Sapwood of scots pine, (Pinus sylvestris L.), oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky), and chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) specimens (300 × 100 × 15 [*]mm along the grain) were impregnated with aqueous solution of 2 % CCA, 2 % Tanalith E, 1 % boric acid, and Immersol aqua. Surface roughness, dry film thickness, adhesion strength, gloss measurement, scratch, and abrasion resistance were determined according to related standards for treated and untreated samples. The results indicated that surface roughness and adhesion strength depended on wood species and the chemical composition of <b>preservatives.</b> Generally, waterborne wood <b>preservatives</b> increased the surface roughness of wood while the organic-based wood <b>preservatives</b> decreased it. The organic-based wood <b>preservatives</b> decreased adhesion but they increased gloss value. Wood <b>preservatives</b> did not affect the scratch resistance which was found to depend on properties of the coating. All the wood <b>preservatives</b> increased abrasion resistance...|$|R

5|$|Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a <b>preservative</b> in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove thiomersal from vaccines {{as quickly as possible}} as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European vaccines. It is still used in all multi-dose vials of flu vaccines in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the <b>preservative</b> caused autism.|$|E

5|$|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) is a stout {{produced}} by the Guinness Brewery, an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo, a drinks multinational. First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is more heavily hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout, and typically has a higher alcohol content (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more bitter taste. The extra hops were intended as a natural <b>preservative</b> for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E

5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural <b>preservative</b> and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, {{the diaries}} of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published. His {{description}} of Napoleon {{in the months}} before his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in Nature to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate arsenic poisoning. Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong <b>preservative,</b> and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.|$|E

5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a <b>preservative</b> and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as electrolytes {{inside and outside}} cells.
