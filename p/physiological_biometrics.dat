Common <b>physiological</b> <b>biometrics</b> include finger characteristics (fingertip [fingerprint], thumb, finger length or pattern), palm (print or topography), hand geometry, wrist vein, face, and eye (retina or iris).

30|$|<b>Physiological</b> <b>biometrics</b> uses {{physical}} traits, such as fingerprint or {{the iris}} [2]. This type of biometrics is stable and accurate since {{it relies on}} unique and permanent physical traits. However, they cannot be changed or reissued if the biometric data are exposed or counterfeited [3]. They are also perceived as obtrusive [4]. In behavioral biometrics, a person’s identity is verified through action patterns which can be repeated in a unique manner [5]. In comparison to <b>physiological</b> <b>biometrics,</b> behavioral biometrics are less stable since behavior may change due to the environment or the physical state of the individual. On the other hand, they are not obtrusive and are difficult to disguise or to be imitated by others [6]. Examples of behavioral biometrics include voice, keystroke dynamics, signature, and gait. Voice {{can be used for}} remote identity verification [7]. Keystroke verifies the identity of a user while he/she uses a computer [8]. Signature can be used in online transactions [9]. Gait has been proven to be useful for surveillance applications where data can be collected from a distance [10].|$|E

In fact, only biometrics methods truly identify humans, not keys and cards they posses or passwords they should remember. The future of biometrics will surely lead to systems based on image analysis as the data acquisition is very simple and requires only cameras, scanners or sensors. More importantly such methods could be passive, {{which means that the}} user does not have to take active part in the whole process or, in fact, would not even know that the process of identification takes place. There are many possible data sources for human identification systems, but the <b>physiological</b> <b>biometrics</b> seem to have many advantages over methods based on human behaviour. The most interesting human anatomical parts for such passive, <b>physiological</b> <b>biometrics</b> systems based on images acquired from cameras are face and ear. Both of those methods contain large volume of unique features that allow to distinctively identify many users and will be surely implemented into efficient biometrics systems for many applications. The article introduces to ear biometrics and presents its advantages over face biometrics in passive human identification systems. Then the geometrical method of feature extraction from human ear images in order to perform human identification is presented...|$|E

Representing one of the simplest key-binding approaches the fuzzy commitment scheme [15] has been successfully applied to iris [32] (and other biometrics). Iris-codes appear to exhibit sufficient information to bind and retrieve long cryptographic keys. Shielding functions [51] and quantization scheme [22, 82] have been applied to several <b>physiological</b> and behavioral <b>biometrics,</b> while focusing on reported performance rates, these schemes require further studies. The fuzzy vault scheme [16] which represents {{one of the most popular}} BCS has frequently been applied to fingerprints.

Recently, several techniques [56, 57] to overcome the shortcoming of pre-alignment have been proposed. In addition, the feature of order-invariance offers solutions to implement applications such as biometric-based secret sharing in a secure manner [122].

We propose a transparent multimodal biometric authentication (TMBA) for video conferencing applications. The user is identified based on his/her <b>physiological</b> and behavioral <b>biometrics.</b> The technique is based on a ‘Steps-Free’ method, where the user does not have to perform any specific steps during authentication. The system will authenticate the user in a transparent way. We propose authentication techniques as an additional security layer for various ‘user-to-user’ and ‘user-to-service’ systems. For ‘user-to-user’ video conferencing systems, we propose an authentication and trust establishment procedure to identify users during a video conference. This technique enables users that have never met before to verify the identity of each other, and aims at enhancing the user’s trust in each other. For ‘user-to-service’ video conferencing systems, we propose a transparent multimodal biometric authentication technique for video banking. The technique can be added to online transaction systems as an additional security layer to enhance the security of online transactions, and to resist against web attacks, malware, and Man-In-The-Browser (MITB) attacks. In order to have a video banking conference between a user and a bank employee, the user has to be logged in to an online banking session. This requires a knowledge-based authentication. Knowledge-based authentication includes a text-based password, the ‘Challenge Questions’ method, and graphical passwords.

This is to no surprise because most of the time a hydrologist, and vice versa a biologist, tries to solve problems on his own, rarely calling for a partner from the other field. In the personal view of a biologist aspects are pointed out which may lead to a better interpretation of biological processes through habitat-related hydrological and/or hydraulic assessments. The terms macrophytes, environment and success are defined first. The function of macrophytes as a part of the aquatic ecosystem is explained, and related to important environmental factors.

50|$|Biometric research. For {{thousands}} of years, humans have used visually perceived body {{characteristics such as}} face and gait to recognize each other. This remarkable ability of human visual system has led Professor Venetsanopoulos to build automated systems to recognize individuals from digitally captured facial images and gait sequences. Face and gait recognition belong {{to the field of}} biometrics, a very active area of research in the computer vision and pattern recognition society, mainly motivated by government and security-related applications. Face and gait are two typical <b>physiological</b> and behavioral <b>biometrics</b> respectively. Venetsanopoulos has contributed to both areas and his research was cited extensively. There are two general approaches: the model-based approach and the appearance-based approach. Appearance-based face recognition approach processes a 2-D facial image as 2-D holistic patterns. The whole face region is the raw input to a recognition system and each face image is commonly represented by a high-dimensional vector consisting of the pixel intensity values in the image. Thus, face recognition is transformed to a multivariate statistical pattern recognition problem. Although the embedding is high-dimensional, the natural constraints of the face data indicate that the face vectors lie in a lower-dimensional subspace (manifold). The popular subspace learning is such a method to identify, represent, and parameterize this subspace with some optimality criteria. Similar to appearance-based face recognition, appearance-based gait recognition approach considers gait as a holistic pattern and uses a full-body representation of a human subject as silhouettes or contours. Gait video sequences are naturally three-dimensional objects, formally named tensor objects, and they are very difficult to deal with using traditional vector-based learning algorithms. In order to deal with these tensor objects effectively, Venetsanopoulos and his research team developed a framework of multilinear subspace learning, so that computation and memory demands are reduced, natural structure and correlation in the original data are preserved, and more compact and useful features can be obtained. Model-based gait recognition approach considers a human subject as an articulated object, represented by various body poses. Professor Venetsanopoulos proposed a full-body layered deformable model (LDM) inspired by the manually labeled body-part-level silhouettes. The LDM has a layered structure to model self-occlusion between body parts and it is deformable, so simple limb deformation is taken into consideration. In addition, it also models shoulder swing. The LDM parameters can be recovered from automatically extracted silhouettes and then used for recognition.|$|R

The basic model can be expressed as a linear superposition of basis functions. This idea inspired us to implement two well known linear projection techniques, namely Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to extract the palmprint texture features. Two different frameworks of ICA [1] are adopted to compare with PCA for the recognition performances by using three different classification techniques. Framework I observed images as random variables and the pixels as outcomes while framework II treated pixels as random variables and the images as outcome. We are able to show that ICA framework II yields the best performance for identifying palmprints and it is able to provide both False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) as low as 1...|$|E
40|$|Human {{identification}} {{has always}} been a topic that interested researchers around the world. Biometric methods are found to be more effective and much easier for the users than the traditional identification methods like keys, smart cards and passwords. Unlike with the traditional methods, with biometric methods the data acquisition is most of the times passive, which means the users do not take active part in data acquisition. Data acquisition can be performed using cameras, scanners or sensors. Human <b>physiological</b> <b>biometrics</b> such as face, eye and ear are good candidates for uniquely identifying an individual. However, human ear scores over face and eye because of certain advantages it has over face. The most challenging phase in human identification based on ear biometric is the segmentation of the ear image from the captured image which may contain many unwanted details. In this work, PDE based image processing techniques are used to segment out the ear image. Level Set Theory based image processing is employed to obtain the contour of the ear image. A few Level set algorithms are compared for their efficiency in segmenting test ear images. Comment: 15 page...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{approach}} that enables the determination and measurement of important features associated with the human body movement. This information {{can be used in}} the construction of a biometric personal identification system. Biometrics is, essentially, a pattern recognition system based on measurements of unique physiological or behavioural features as acquired from an individual. The domain of biometric techniques is currently placed within recently developed disciplines of science. Biometry or biometrics is simply defined as automatically recognizing a person using distinguishing traits and is widely used in various security systems. Biometry can be defined as a method of personal identification based on individuals ' physical and behavioural features. <b>Physiological</b> <b>biometrics</b> covers data coming directly from a measurement of part of a human body, for example a fingerprint, the shape of the face, or from the retina. Behavioural biometrics analyses data obtained on the basis of an activity performed by a given person, for example speech and the handwritten signature. The system of biometrics defined above can now be expanded, and a new biometrics system can be considered. In our approach, human foot pressure on a surface is measured and the pressure data retrieved. The pressure parameters are collected without the necessity of any movements of the feet. 1...|$|E
40|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{agencies have been}} exploiting biometric identifiers for decades as key tools in forensic identification. With the evolution in information technology and the huge volume of cases {{that need to be}} investigated by forensic specialists, it has become important to automate forensic identification systems. While, ante mortem (AM) identification, that is identification prior to death, is usually possible through comparison of many biometric identifiers, postmortem (PM) identification, that is identification after death, is impossible using behavioral biometrics (e. g. speech, gait). Moreover, under severe circumstances, such as those encountered in mass disasters (e. g. airplane crashers) or if identification is being attempted {{more than a couple of}} weeks postmortem, under such circumstances, most <b>physiological</b> <b>biometrics</b> may not be employed for identification, because of the decay of soft tissues of the body to unidentifiable states. Therefore, a postmortem biometric identifier has to resist the early decay that affects body tissues. Because of their survivability and diversity, the best candidates for postmortem biometric identification are the dental features. In this paper we present an over view about an automated dental identification system for Missing and Unidentified Persons. This dental identification system can be used by both law enforcement and security agencies in both forensic and biometric identification. We will also present techniques for dental segmentation of X-ray images. These techniques address the problem of identifying each individual tooth and how the contours of each tooth are extracted. 1...|$|E
