5|$|Like other fairywrens, male {{variegated}} fairywrens {{have been}} observed carrying brightly coloured <b>petals</b> to display to females {{as part of a}} courtship ritual. In this species, the <b>petals</b> that have been recorded have been yellow. <b>Petals</b> are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory.|$|E

The miniature evergreen Hippeastrum papilio or 'Butterfly Amaryllis' whose <b>petals</b> resemble a butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and striations of pale green on the upper <b>petals</b> and narrow stripes on the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.|$|E

5|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males {{of this and}} other fairywren species pluck yellow <b>petals,</b> which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. The <b>petals</b> often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Males sometimes show <b>petals</b> to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though {{both males and females}} will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.|$|E
5|$|Shuffle! is {{the first}} project {{developed}} by the visual novel developer Navel, and {{is the first}} title in the series. Shuffle! development team was largely composed of members involved with Basil's Cherry <b>Petals</b> Fall Like Teardrops. The scenarios were written by Baria Ago, who had previously {{been in charge of}} writing the scenario for Cherry <b>Petals</b> Fall Like Teardrops and Long Cube. Art direction and character design was split between Aoi Nishimata, who had previously illustrated Cherry <b>Petals</b> Fall Like Teardrops, and Hiro Suzuhira. The music for the game was composed by Nachtmusik. The opening video was produced by Iris Motion Graphics.|$|E
5|$|The later evolved commelinids have {{various kinds}} of flower, few of which are 'lily-like'. In the order Poales, {{comprising}} grasses, rushes and sedges, flowers are either petal-less or have small, unshowy <b>petals.</b> Many Zingiberales species have brightly coloured and showy flowers. However, their apparent structure is misleading. For example, the six tepals of cannas are small and hidden under expanded and brightly coloured stamens or staminodes which resemble <b>petals</b> and may be mistaken for them.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm. He {{notes that}} some have a hollow stem, such as deadly {{nightshade}} and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} <b>petals,</b> roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more <b>petals,</b> and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{habit of}} males {{of this and}} other fairywren species during the reproductive season is to pluck <b>petals</b> (in this species, predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage) and show them to female fairywrens. <b>Petals</b> often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show <b>petals</b> to females in other territories, presumably to promote themselves. It is notable that fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, but regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting. Thus, petal-carrying might be a behaviour that strengthens the pair-bond. Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the female. In either case, the data does not strongly link petal-carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Fairywrens exhibit one of {{the highest}} incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods are brought up a by male who is not the natural father. However, {{courtship}} methods among white-winged fairywrens remain unclear. Blue-plumaged males have been seen outside of their territory and in some cases, carrying pink or purple <b>petals,</b> which among other species advertise the male to neighboring females. In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue <b>petals.</b> While petal-carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring, further genetic analysis is necessary.|$|E

40|$|A <b>petal</b> graph is an aesthetically {{attractive}} and applauded tool for visualising parameter sets. For instance, <b>petal</b> graphs {{are often used}} by Norwegian policy makers and decision makers in higher education as the Ministry of Education and Research relies on <b>petal</b> graphs in their reports. This study argues that <b>petal</b> graphs are prone to misinterpretation. It is challenging to interpret a <b>petal</b> graph in general, {{it is hard to}} compare two or more <b>petal</b> graphs and this study demonstrates that the physical characteristics of <b>petal</b> graphs can be incorrect in terms of the parameters on display. This study concludes that the use of <b>petal</b> graphs should be abolished and that other visualisation techniques to be used instead. Several alternatives are suggested. ...|$|R
5|$|Flower {{development}} {{begins when}} the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem {{capable of producing}} stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs {{at the end of}} the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five <b>petals,</b> five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by <b>petals,</b> and these <b>petals</b> do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four generaâ€”a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The <b>petals</b> of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have <b>petals</b> that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup <b>petals.</b> These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup <b>petals</b> have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding {{the floral}} tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) {{from the rest}} of the {{perianth}} are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, that is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (<b>petals),</b> but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments <b>petals.</b> The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.|$|E
5|$|Thin {{film with}} diffuse reflector, {{based on the}} top two layers of a buttercup's <b>petals.</b> The {{brilliant}} yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved <b>petals</b> form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at {{the centre of the}} flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature.|$|E

5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower <b>petals,</b> while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 <b>petals</b> {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower <b>petals</b> the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the <b>petals</b> move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow <b>petals</b> and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display.|$|E
