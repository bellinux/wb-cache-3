5|$|In 1998 Congressman Lamar S. Smith, {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, held hearings on the compensation issue. He questioned the DoD representatives as to why compensation had not also been offered to the U.S. family members.

5|$|The modern law of {{criminal}} damage is mostly {{contained in the}} Criminal Damage Act 1971, which redefines or creates several offences protecting property rights. The Act provides a comprehensive structure covering merely preparatory acts to the most serious offences of arson and causing damage with intent to endanger life. As such, punishments vary from a fixed penalty to life imprisonment, and the court may order <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to a victim.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeals {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the claim for trespass, {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession. The Court of Appeals also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> was a condition precedent. Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Jurisdictions {{differ on}} whether the state is {{required}} to pay compensation upon extinguishing aboriginal title.

25|$|The {{laws were}} a civil {{rather than a}} {{criminal}} code, concerned with the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> for harm done and the regulation of property, inheritance and contracts; the concept of state-administered punishment for crime was foreign to Ireland's early jurists. They show Ireland in the early medieval period {{to have been a}} hierarchical society, taking great care to define social status, and the rights and duties that went with it, according to property, and the relationships between lords and their clients and serfs.|$|E
25|$|Speculation {{about the}} case {{continued}} long after Bain was acquitted, including {{whether or not he}} should receive compensation for the years he spent in prison. Canadian jurist Ian Binnie was appointed in November 2011 to review the circumstances and advise the government on whether compensation should be paid. Binnie concluded that the Dunedin police made 'egregious errors' and that the 'extraordinary circumstances' in the case justified the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation.</b> This report was rejected by the Minister of Justice, on advice from High Court Judge Robert Fisher.|$|E
25|$|In {{the joint}} {{advisory}} committee meeting on June 17, 2017 {{it was announced}} that the State government has given administrative sanction for acquisition of land required for the proposed expansion of the runway.

25|$|Once a case came to court, {{the method}} used {{to come to a}} {{decision}} was usually by compurgation. Under this system the person accused or the parties to a dispute would give their version under oath, following which they had to find a number of others who would take an oath that the principal's oath could be trusted. The number of compurgators required depended {{on the nature of the}} case. The judge or judges would then come to a decision. Capital punishment was only prescribed for a small number of crimes. Homicide was usually dealt with by the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to the victim's family, while theft could be punished by death only if it was theft by stealth and the thief was caught with the goods in hand; the value of the goods stolen also had to exceed four pence. Most other offences were punished by a fine.|$|E
25|$|The Legal Advisory and Conveyancing Office (LACO, 法律諮詢及田土轉易處) {{is part of}} the Lands Department. It {{provides}} {{legal advice}} primarily to the Lands Administration Office of the Lands Department and other government departments on land related matters and ordinances. LACO is responsible for drafting and settling government land disposal and lease modification documents. LACO is also responsible for the preparation of documentation relating to the acquisition of land from private owners pursuant to statutory powers and the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to those owners. LACO administers the Lands Department Consent Scheme to approve applications by developers to sell flats in uncompleted developments. It also approves Deeds of Mutual Covenant requiring approval under land leases. LACO also provides conveyancing services to the Financial Secretary Incorporated for the extension of non-renewable leases, the Government Property Agency for the sale and purchase of government properties and the Secretary for Home Affairs Incorporated for the purchase of accommodation for welfare purposes in private developments. It handles applications for the apportionment of premium and government rents under the Government Rent and Premium (Apportionment) Ordinance. In addition, it is responsible for the recovery of arrears of government rents other than rents under the Government Rent (Assessment and Collection) Ordinance.|$|E

500|$|By tradition, Welsh Law was {{compiled}} during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda, king {{of most of}} Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' (...) , as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. Other than in the Marches, where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales {{following the death of}} Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of Wales and England since 1536, and continues to be so, although there is now a growing body of contemporary Welsh law since devolution to Wales since 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{features}} of these codes include {{an emphasis on}} the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> for a crime to the victim or the victim's kin rather than on punishment by the ruler.

2500|$|Spain {{returned}} to Manawatu and Wanganui, but discovered chiefs now refused to sell {{regardless of the}} level of compensation, ignoring William Wakefield's attempt to distribute £1000 in gold and silver coins. Although the Land Claims Ordinance authorised Spain only to [...] "respectfully recommend" [...] the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation,</b> he told chiefs: [...] "Your refusal to accept the payment will not prevent the land going to the Europeans." [...] He awarded the company almost all it had claimed and held the money for it to be later claimed by Maori in those areas.|$|E

2500|$|Cameron determinedly {{attempted}} {{to increase his}} public visibility, offering quotations on matters of public controversy. He opposed the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to Gurbux Singh, who had resigned {{as head of the}} Commission for Racial Equality after a confrontation with the police; and commented that the Home Affairs Select Committee had taken a long time to discuss whether the phrase [...] "black market" [...] should be used. However, he was passed over for a front-bench promotion in July 2002; Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith did invite Cameron and his ally George Osborne to coach him on Prime Minister's Questions in November 2002. The next week, Cameron deliberately abstained in a vote on allowing same-sex and unmarried couples to adopt children jointly, against a whip to oppose; his abstention was noted. The wide scale of abstentions and rebellious votes destabilised the Duncan Smith leadership.|$|E
2500|$|The Society helped {{enact the}} 1799 law for gradual {{emancipation}} of slaves in New York, which Jay {{signed into law}} as governor. [...] "An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery" [...] provided that, from July 4 of that year, all children born to slave parents would be free (subject to lengthy apprenticeships) and that slave exports would be prohibited. These same children {{would be required to}} serve the mother’s owner until age 28 for males and age 25 for females, years beyond the typical period of indenture. The law thus defined a type of indentured servant while providing for eventual freedom for children born to slaves. It did not provide government <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to the owners. It also provided legal protection and assistance for free blacks kidnapped for the purposes of being sold into slavery. All slaves were emancipated by July 4, 1827. The process in New York may perhaps have been the largest total emancipation in North America before 1861.|$|E
2500|$|The Prime Ministers (Dalawas or Dewans) {{started taking}} control of the kingdom {{beginning}} with Velu Thampi Dalawa (Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi) (1799–1809) who was appointed as the divan following the dismissal of Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri (1798–1799). Initially, Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi and the English East India Company got along very well. When a section of the Travancore army mutinied in 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, he sought refuge with the British Resident and later used English East India Company troops to crush the mutiny. Velu Thampi also {{played a key role in}} renegotiating a new treaty between Travancore and the English East India Company. However, the demands by the East India Company for the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> for their involvement in the Travancore-Mysore War (1791) on behalf of Travancore, led to tension between the Diwan and the East India Company Resident. Velu Thampi and the diwan of Cochin kingdom, Paliath Achan Govindan Menon, who was unhappy with the Resident for granting asylum to his enemy Kunhi Krishna Menon, declared [...] "war" [...] on the East India Company.|$|E
