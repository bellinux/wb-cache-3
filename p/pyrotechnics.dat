50|$|A <b>pyrotechnic</b> heat source, {{also called}} heat pellet, is a <b>pyrotechnic</b> device {{based on a}} <b>pyrotechnic</b> {{composition}} with a suitable igniter. Its role is to produce controlled amount of heat. <b>Pyrotechnic</b> heat sources are usually based on thermite-like (or sometimes delay composition-like) fuel-oxidizer compositions with slow burn rate, high production of heat at desired temperature, and low to zero production of gases.|$|R

5|$|After the show, WWE {{was criticized}} for a {{malfunction}} in the <b>pyrotechnics</b> during The Undertaker's victory celebration. During the celebration, a hot cable for <b>pyrotechnics</b> was sent flying into audience members in the upper seating bowl of the stadium, leaving 45 injured, with some hospitalized. The accident was apparently due to a cable which fireworks were traveling across snapping, thus resulting in the fireworks exploding into the top rows of the upper bowl of the stadium. WWE's corporate website released a statement afterward stating that they would investigate the incident, but {{the results of the}} investigation were never released.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA type of <b>pyrotechnic</b> {{compositions}} battery {{was developed}} to meet the requirements of a subminiature and fastactivated reservoir battery which would be applied to shell fuze. This battery was activated by the <b>pyrotechnic</b> compositions contained in the electrodes. Once the ignition impulse worked, the <b>pyrotechnic</b> compositions took fire immediately and melted the electrolyte. Then the rest <b>pyrotechnic</b> compositions served as anode and cathode. The battery began to discharge. Electrical property tests taken on the prototype cells indicated that the performance of the <b>pyrotechnic</b> compositions batteries were improved greatly compared with common fuze batteries. Such property parameters contained volume, activation time and energy density...|$|R

5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over <b>pyrotechnics.</b> The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{also stated}} during the 1993 {{interview}} that he first began taking painkiller medications regularly in 1984. On January 24 of that year, Jackson was filming a Pepsi commercial when his hair caught on fire from faulty <b>pyrotechnics</b> on stage that were intended {{to be part of}} one of many being filmed. He sustained second-degree burns to his scalp and never fully recovered from the injury or from the lingering pain. He reportedly began taking the painkillers after refusing at first {{in order to deal with}} the intense pain.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the special}} effects in A Trip to the Moon, as in {{numerous}} other Méliès films, were created using the substitution splice technique, in which the camera operator stopped filming long enough for something onscreen to be altered, added, or taken away. Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects, such as {{the transformation of the}} astronomers' telescopes into stools or the disappearance of the exploding Selenites in puffs of smoke. Other effects were created using theatrical means, such as stage machinery and <b>pyrotechnics.</b> The film also features transitional dissolves.|$|E

5|$|The Review Board still {{considered}} Parsons a liability {{because of his}} historical Marxist affiliations and investigations by the FBI, and in January 1952 they permanently reinstated their ban on his working for classified projects, effectively prohibiting him from working in rocketry. To make a living he founded the Parsons Chemical Manufacturing Company, which was based in North Hollywood and created <b>pyrotechnics</b> and explosives such as fog effects and imitation gunshot wounds for the film industry, and he also returned to chemical manufacturing at the Bermite Powder Company in Saugus.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were created using stage machinery, {{miniature}} models, <b>pyrotechnics,</b> and the editing technique {{known as the}} substitution splice. Long shots showing the car were filmed with a miniature car and a landscape rolling past it, creating a multiplane effect. Most scenes, including the detailed and faithful recreation of the Place de l'Opéra outside the Opera House, were painted studio sets, as was Méliès's custom. However, the last scene, showing the arrival at Monte Carlo, was filmed not in the studio but outdoors in Méliès's garden.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is used {{in steel}} as an {{alloying}} element (ferro-titanium) to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer, and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content. Titanium is often alloyed with aluminium (to refine grain size), vanadium, copper (to harden), iron, manganese, molybdenum, and other metals. Titanium mill products (sheet, plate, bar, wire, forgings, castings) find application in industrial, aerospace, recreational, and emerging markets.

5|$|Another riot {{occurred}} in August 1992 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, during a co-headlining tour with Metallica. Prior to Guns N' Roses' appearance, Metallica's set {{was cut short}} after singer-guitarist James Hetfield suffered second-degree burns in a <b>pyrotechnics</b> accident. However, Guns N' Roses was unable to go on stage early, because Rose once again was late arriving at the venue. Nearly an hour into their show, Rose complained of voice problems before walking off stage, following which a riot erupted in downtown Montreal, resulting in an estimated $400,000 in damages. In November of that year, Rose was convicted of property damage and assault {{in relation to the}} Riverport riot; he was fined $50,000 and received two years' probation.|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in <b>pyrotechnics</b> and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E

5|$|Later, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are met by Phoebe Green, an {{investigator}} from London's Metropolitan Police and Mulder's former lover from Oxford University.

The only links between the crimes are the suspect's love letters to the victims' wives. His latest target is Sir Malcolm Marsden, who is visiting Cape Cod for protection after escaping an attack by the killer. Mulder and Scully visit a <b>pyrotechnics</b> expert who says that only rocket fuel can burn hot enough to destroy evidence of its origins.|$|E

5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's <b>pyrotechnics</b> were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E
