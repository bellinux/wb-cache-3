50|$|A {{hydraulic}} cylinder without a piston {{or with a}} piston without seals is called a <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder</b> can only {{be used as a}} pushing cylinder; the maximum force is piston rod area multiplied by pressure. This means that a <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder</b> in general has a relatively thick piston rod.|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} motion compensator is {{the anchor}} chain of a ship. Not {{only does the}} anchor prevent the ship from drifting, but the chain itself dampens {{the movement of the}} ship due to undulating motion of the waves. Generally, motion compensators are implemented as springs. For very large forces (dozens to hundreds of tonnes), the springs are implemented as gas springs: hydropneumatic devices [...] - [...] a <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder</b> buffered by a volume of gas.|$|E

50|$|In {{case the}} {{retracted}} {{length of the}} cylinder is too long for the cylinder {{to be built in}} the structure, Telescopic cylinder can be used. One has to realize that for simple pushing applications telescopic cylinders might be easily available; for higher forces and/or double acting cylinders, they must be designed especially and are very expensive. If hydraulic cylinders are only used for pushing and the piston rod is brought in again by other means, one can also use <b>Plunger</b> <b>cylinders.</b> <b>Plunger</b> <b>cylinders</b> have no sealing over the piston, if the piston even exists. This means that only one oil connection is necessary. In general the diameter of the plunger is rather large compared with a normal piston cylinder, whereas a hydraulic motor will always leak oil. A hydraulic cylinder does not have a leakage over the piston nor over the cylinder head sealing so that {{there is no need for}} a mechanical brake.|$|R

50|$|A {{differential}} cylinder {{acts like a}} normal cylinder when pulling. If the cylinder however has to push, the oil from the piston rod side of the cylinder is not returned to the reservoir, but goes to the bottom side of the cylinder. In such a way, the cylinder goes much faster, but the maximum force the cylinder can give is like a <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A {{differential cylinder}} can be manufactured like a normal cylinder, and only a special control is added.|$|E
5000|$|If {{bleeding}} brakes {{because of}} master cylinder replacement the master cylinder is usually [...] "bench bled" [...] before installation. Typically by securing {{it on the}} bench, filling it with fluid, connecting fittings and hoses to route fluid from the outlet ports on the master cylinder back to its reservoir, and repeatedly depressing the master <b>cylinder</b> <b>plunger</b> until bubbles are no longer seen coming from the hoses.|$|R

The aim is to develop the means and methods for control of the liquid hydraulics in canals of variable section taking into consideration influence of the rheologic properties of liquids, forms, dimensions and number of cavities on the separated flows. The hypothesis about control possibility of separated flows has been confirmed, the influence of rheologic properties and geometric factors of cavities on the characteristic of separated flow has been determined. The control means and methods of flow hydraulics permitting to improve the operating characteristics {{as an example of the}} hole bull pumps have been developed.

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{tool for}} safely separating one multipin electrical connector from another is presented. The separation tool {{consists of a}} master cylinder which operates a pair of slave cylinders. Each slave cylinder has a corresponding operative shaft and an extraction tab. The slave cylinders are spaced apart from one another {{so that they may}} be positioned on either side of mated connector pairs of different sizes and so that their extraction tabs may be slid between the connectors. When the master <b>cylinder's</b> <b>plunger</b> is operated, its operation is hydraulically transmitted to the operative shafts of the slave cylinders which extend outward and, once pressed against a substrate, causes the slave cylinders and corresponding extractor tabs to move away and separate one connector from the other. A second preferred separation tool includes an additional pair of extractor tabs, one {{at the end of each}} operative shaft, so that the tool can be used to separate a mated connector pair hanging in free space...|$|R

Fillet lightness was higher for F fish (p< 0, 05). Muscle pH, measured immediately after slaughter, was higher (p< 0, 001) for F fillet. Difference in fillet firmness, the selective trait at slaughter, was still significant at 48 h post-mortem (pm). No difference between M and F was measured for ultimate pH (48 h pm) or white muscle fibre mean diameter. Muscle transcriptome analysis revealed, between M and F, differences in the expression of genes coding for structural components, especially for connective tissue and enzymes (metabolic and proteolytic) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Minimizing the {{cylinder}} wear and the consumption rate of cylinder {{oil in a}} large two-stroke diesel engine is of great economic importance. A motor-driven cylinder lubricator for Sulzer RT-flex large two-stroke diesel engines developed by authors is in need of mounting a quill system to lubricate cylinder parts for a smooth operation. In order to apply the common-rail lubricating system to the developed cylinder lubricator as the second research stage, the mechanical quill system with a progressively quantitative distributor (M. D. S.) is improved in the electronically controlled quill system with an accumulating distributor (E. D. S.). In this study, the effects of lubricator motor speed, <b>plunger</b> stroke and <b>cylinder</b> back pressure on oil feed rate and inequality rate are experimentally investigated by applying E. D. S. to the developed cylinder lubricator. It is found that the oil feed rate of E. D. S. is higher than that of M. D. S. because of the increase of delivery speed and volume by changing the role of accumulator in the same experimental condition. It can be also shown that, in E. D. S., the inequality rate is decreased a little or hardly unchanged as {{the cylinder}} back pressure and plunger stroke is elevated, while the inequality rate increased in M. D. S [...] The inequality rates of E. D. S. and M. D. S. are lowered as the lubricator motor speed is increased.
