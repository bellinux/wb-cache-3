The quantity <b>of</b> electric <b>charge,</b> the amount <b>of</b> positive <b>charge</b> minus the amount <b>of</b> negative <b>charge</b> in the universe, is always conserved.

The system under study consists of N voltage-mode-controlled buck converters connected in parallel. Three kinds of active current-sharing schemes are considered, namely, master-slave scheme with automatic master, master-slave scheme with dedicated master, and democratic scheme.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a SAR ADC interface circuit, where the input sensing voltage from a bipolar high voltage domain is linearly translated into the low voltage domain where the SAR ADC operates. The proposed interface circuit employs the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transfer amplifier to deliver information between two different power domains, in one step, without static power consumption, even if both domains {{do not share}} the the same ground voltages.
