This complex consisted of four similar three-storey blocks linked at the corners. The frame is of pre-cast reinforced concrete with columns in groups of four and the whole is planned as a tartan grid, allowing services to be carried vertically and horizontally so that at no point in a room are services more than ten feet away. The building received the 1966 RIBA Architecture Award for the West Midlands. It was statutorily listed in 1993.

40|$|Functionally graded {{materials}} (FGMs) are {{advanced materials}} with improved properties that {{enable them to}} withstand severe working environment which the traditional composite materials cannot withstand. FGM found their applications in several areas which include: military,medicine and aerospace. Various manufacturing processes are used to produce functionally graded materials that include: powder <b>metallurgy,</b> <b>physical</b> vapour deposition, chemical vapour deposition process and laser metal deposition process. Laser metal deposition (LMD) process is an additive manufacturing process {{that can be used to}} produce functionally graded material directly from the three dimensional (3 D) computer aided design (CAD) model of the part in one single process. LMD process is a fairly new manufacturing process and a highly non-linear process. The process parameters are of great importance in LMD process and they need to be optimized for the required application. In this study, functionally graded titanium alloy composite was produced using optimized process parameters for each material combination as obtained through a model that was developed in an initial study and the FGM was characterized throughmetallurgical, mechanical and tribological studies.

Design/methodology/approach: Samples of investigated steel were austenitized at the temperature of 900 ºCand hardened in oil. Next, four from five samples were tempered. Tempering consisted of heating the samples upto chosen temperatures with a heating rate of 0. 05 ºC/s and, after reaching desired temperature, fast cooling. CEMStechnique was applied for Mössbauer studies. Findings: Secondary cementite remaining in the microstructure of 120 MnCrMoV 8 - 6 - 4 - 2 steel hardened from 900 ºC is alloyed to a degree which allows paramagnetism. Research limitations/implications: The influence of hypereutectoid cementite on the cementite precipitationsduring continuous heating from as-quenched state of high carbon Cr-Mn-Mo steel was determined. Practical implications: The knowledge {{of the influence of}} hypereutectoid cementite on the cementiteprecipitations during continuous heating enables proper design of the heat treatment of 120 MnCrMoV 8 - 6 - 4 - 2 steelin respect to its application for hot working tools.
