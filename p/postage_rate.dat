25|$|The U.S. Postal Service {{issued a}} 37-cent Ronald Reagan {{commemorative}} stamp on February 9, 2005. The {{first day of}} issue occurred in Simi Valley, California. The stamp design is by Howard E. Paine of Delaplane, Virginia. The image of Reagan was modeled after a portrait painted by award-winning artist Michael J. Deas.

25|$|Thomas Jefferson {{was honored}} {{not only in}} the Union, but in the Confederacy {{beginning}} November 8, 1861 on a 10-cent stamp. Designed by Hoyer & Ludwig of Richmond, Virginia, this issue was based on the same portrait that had been replicated on the U.S. 5-cent stamp of 1856. Both Hoyer & Ludwig and J.T. Paterson & Co. of Augusta, Georgia printed this lithographed design. The stamp was typically used for the <b>postage</b> <b>rate</b> after the rate increase to 10¢ on July 1, 1862. The first stone was used for 1,400,000 printings.|$|E
500|$|Impetus for {{the passage}} of a three-cent coin came when Congress, in January 1851, {{considered}} reducing postage rates from five cents to three. [...] In 1849, House Committee on Ways and Means chairman, Samuel Vinton, had written to Mint director Robert M. Patterson that his committee was considering both reducing the <b>postage</b> <b>rate</b> and instituting a three-cent coin. [...] Although no legislative action was then taken, Patterson had the mint prepare experimental pattern coins. The House committee proposing the 1851 bill included Dickinson's three-cent piece, and provided that it be legal tender up to 30 cents. [...] When the bill was debated in the House on January 13, 1851, New York Congressman William Duer indicated that he felt both coin and stamp should be denominated at 2 cents, and his fellow New Yorker, Orsamus Matteson, offered an amendment to that effect. [...] The amendment failed, as did every other attempt to change the legislation, including Dickinson's plea, in the Senate, to restore the requirement that the new coin be used to retire some of the Spanish silver. [...] The bill passed both houses, and became the Act of March 3, 1851 when President Millard Fillmore signed it.|$|E

500|$|With the {{discontinuance}} of the two-cent {{piece and}} three-cent silver in 1873, the cent and the three-cent nickel were the sole {{survivors of the}} coins valued at less than five cents. [...] The three-cent nickel, by this time, was unpopular because of its odd denomination and (with the return of silver coinage) its similarity in size to the dime. [...] A three-cent <b>postage</b> <b>rate</b> {{had been one of}} the reasons why that denomination had begun, in the 1850s; in the early 1880s the Post Office decreased the basic rate for letters to two cents. [...] This change both increased demand for cents, and decreased the demand for the three-cent nickel, which was abolished in 1890. In most years of the 1880s, there were large issues of Indian Head cents. The exception was in the mid-1880s, when poor economic times led to less demand for minor coins. No cents or five-cent nickels were minted after February 1885 until near the end of 1886. Production of undated dies into which the year of issue could be punched did continue, and during the hiatus in coin production, Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber modified the design, removing light outlines between the lettering on the obverse and the rest of the design, and making other changes. [...] This led to two types for the 1886 Indian Head cent, which may be distinguished: on the Type I, the lowest feather on the obverse points between the I and the C in [...] "AMERICA", while on the Type II it points between the C and the final A. Snow estimates that 14 million of the mintage of 17,654,290 were Type I, as were a majority of the 4,290 proof strikings.|$|E
2500|$|This {{system also}} {{simplifies}} calculating the weight paper. Under ISO 536, paper's grammage {{is defined as}} a sheet's weight in grams (g) per area in square metres (abbreviated g/m2 or gsm). Since an A0 sheet has an area of 1m2, its weight in grams is the same as its grammage. One can derive the grammage of other sizes by arithmetic division in g/m2. A standard A4 sheet made from 80g/m2 paper weighs 5g, as it is [...] (four halvings, ignoring roundings to exact mm) of an A0 page. Thus the weight, and the associated <b>postage</b> <b>rate,</b> can be easily approximated by counting the number of sheets used.|$|E
2500|$|To {{make it more}} {{complicated}} {{a new set of}} definitives appeared later in 1926, this time a very beautiful set showing George V and a shield on the values to 6d and a series of engraved scenes on the higher values to 10/-. But again the set was reissued with an overprint [...] "Postage and Revenue" [...] in 1928, when it was decided that revenue stamps were no longer needed. A 6d stamp was also overprinted [...] "AIR MAIL" [...] in 1928 and was Malta's first airmail stamp value, being in addition to the sea <b>postage</b> <b>rate.</b> This beautiful set was once again reissued with [...] "Postage and Revenue" [...] in the legend. Therefore, Malta had a total of 7 sets of definitives between 1920 and 1930.|$|E

2500|$|Hill's pamphlet, Post Office Reform: its Importance and Practicability, {{referred}} to above, was privately circulated in 1837. The report called for [...] "low and uniform rates" [...] according to weight, rather than distance. Hill's study reported his findings {{and those of}} Charles Babbage {{that most of the}} costs in the postal system were not for transport, but rather for laborious handling procedures at the origins and the destinations. Costs could be reduced dramatically if postage were prepaid by the sender, the prepayment to be proven by the use of prepaid letter sheets or adhesive stamps (adhesive stamps had long been used to show payment of taxes, on documents for example). Letter sheets were to be used because envelopes were not yet common; they were not yet mass-produced, and in an era when postage was calculated partly {{on the basis of the}} number of sheets of paper used, the same sheet of paper would be folded and serve for both the message and the address. In addition, Hill proposed to lower the <b>postage</b> <b>rate</b> to a penny per half ounce, without regard to distance. He first presented his proposal to the Government in 1837.|$|E
