5|$|The British colonial {{government}} did not support industrialisation in the region, and local capital remained invested mostly in land and money lending, {{which led to the}} later development of banking in the region. With the arrival of European missionaries in the early 19th century, the region saw the development of educational institutions and a modern industrial base, modelled on European industries. The opening of the Lutheran Swiss Basel Mission in 1834 was central to the industrialisation <b>process.</b> <b>Printing</b> press, cloth-weaving mills and factories manufacturing Mangalore tiles were set up by the missionaries. When Canara (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was bifurcated into North Canara and South Canara in 1859, Mangalore was transferred into South Canara and became its headquarters. South Canara remained under Madras Presidency, while North Canara was detached from Madras Presidency and transferred to Bombay Presidency in 1862.|$|E

25|$|In 1993 Indigo {{launched}} the E-Print 1000 at IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing setup <b>process,</b> <b>printing</b> {{directly from a}} computer file, and enabled inexpensive short-run color printing. Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed from page to page, requiring neither additional setup or pauses in the print run. Instead of printing to metal plates, the E-Print created a latent image on the Photo Imaging Plate or PIP {{through the use of}} an electrostatic charge. This charged area would then attract the charged ElectroInk, which would in turn be transferred to the ITM or blanket, and then again transfer from the blanket to the paper or other substrate. Because 100% of the ink transfers from PIP to blanket to substrate, a different image and color could be printed with each rotation of the press. At the same time, Indigo's ElectroInk-based color inks offered print quality rivaling that of traditional printing processes. Almost 20 years later, and despite the numerous technological improvements, Indigo presses are still based on this core technology.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} form of {{commercial}} T-shirt decoration is screen-printing. In screen-printing, a design is separated into individual colors.

To achieve a wider color spectrum with a limited number of colors, <b>process</b> <b>printing</b> (using only cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink) or simulated process (using only white, black, red, green, blue, and gold ink) is effective. <b>Process</b> <b>printing</b> is best suited for light colored shirts.
