Using the process measurements data obtained from a design of experimental study, predictive partial least squares models were developed for spraying and drying phases. Measured and calculated process parameters from an instrumented fluid bed granulation environment were used as explaining factors, whereas an in-line <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>data</b> determined by spatial filtering technique were used as response.

While the measured in-line d 50 data were markedly influenced by different process failures, e. g., impaired fluidization activity, the predicted data remained more consistent.

Elevated smectite contents at the base of Site 1119 (latest Early Pliocene ∼ 3. 9 – 3. 5 Ma) also occur regionally in the Southern Ocean and point towards an alternative sediment source other than nearby New Zealand terranes. The abrupt reduction in smectite content at ∼ 3. 5 Ma and replacement by dominant chlorite–illite assemblages corresponds to the onset of Late Pliocene cooling climate conditions and more intense onland physical weathering. High illite contents in Late Pliocene–Early Pleistocene (∼ 3. 0 – 1. 7 Ma) sediments suggest a more southern terrane (e. g. Haast Schist) source influence and widened shelf conditions. An upward increase in clay content reflects an increased supply of glacier-derived detrital sediment, concurrent with global climate deterioration during the Late Pliocene–Pleistocene. Grainsize fining of the background mean sortable silt (mss) signal indicates reduced Southland Current flow, consistent with its forced seaward migration across Site 1119 over time due to continual eastward shelf progradation.

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{increase}} of urbanization and modification of agricultural practices, peri-urban areas experiment a quick change in land use. The impact of such change on the catchment hydrological cycle must be quantified. To achieve this goal, distributed hydrological models offer {{the ability to take}} into account land use change, and more specifically its effect on surface infiltration capacity. A distributed assessment of infiltration properties and their variability at the catchment scale is thus of great importance if accurate simulation of the water balance are expected on such catchments. This paper presents a field campaign conducted in a 7 km 2 peri-urban catchment, located in the Mont du Lyonnais area, close to the city of Lyon (France) in order to document the topsoil hydraulic properties. The sampling strategy was set up in order to sample the largest number of soil/land use combinations. The locations were chosen from a GIS analysis based on the overlapping of the pedology and land use maps, and accessibility consideration. At each location, two types of infiltration tests were performed: infiltration tests under suction using mini-disk infiltrometers and single ring infiltration tests under positive head. Three replicates were performed for each method. <b>Particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>data</b> and organic matter analysis were also conducted at each location.
