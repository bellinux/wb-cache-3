40|$|Compounds {{with two}} or more {{different}} <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> in a single molecule are designated as hybrid drugs. If several stereoisomers with different <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> exist in one molecule, the term pseudo-hybrid drug is applied. In the treatment of hypertension, the use of hybrid drugs enables a considerable {{reduction in the number}} of tablets to be taken per day. Conversely, the dose of each individual component cannot be tritrated. Most hybrid drugs used in antihypertensive treatment are beta-blockers with an additional vasodilator component, caused by different mechanisms such as alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonism, ACE inhibition or direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Examples include labetalol (in fact, a mixture of four stereoisomers), carvedilol, celiprolol, dilevalol, tertatolol and BWA- 575 C. A combination of beta-receptor blockade and vasodilation may be beneficial from a hemodynamic point of view. More recently it has been recognized that urapidil and ketanserin are hybrid drugs, each containing at least two <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> in their molecule...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> of two beta {{adrenergic}} antagonists, propranolol and practolol, {{were compared}} in eight hypertensive patients. The activity of each antagonist {{was established in}} relation to its blood concentration at maximal and submaximal adrenergic blockade defined by inhibition of exercise tachycardia. Maximal inhibition of exercise tachycardia was comparable with both drugs and averaged 74 ± 7 % of the control value during drug treatment. This inhibition was achieved with a blood concentration of 2. 5 ± 0. 4 μg/ml practolol and 0. 10 ± 0. 08 μg/ml propranolol. The antagonist activities of these drugs against adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol infusion indicated a much greater relative potency of propranolol against this stimulus, and in vivo estimates of PA 2 values differed by more than 600 -fold. Relative antagonist activity of practolol during isoproterenol stimulation was equivalent both at cardiac (inotropic and chronotropic) and at vascular adrenergic receptors, whereas greater antagonist activity of propranolol was observed at vascular receptors than at cardiac receptors. Thus, the activity of practolol {{was not limited to}} cardiac receptors as previously suggested. Practolol did not reduce cardiac output at any dose level and the effect on resting blood pressure was small. Both practolol and propranolol had much greater hypotensive activity during exercise. These studies have defined the differing <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> on the cardiovascular system of two effective beta adrenergic receptor antagonists and have established the blood levels of these antagonists necessary to achieve effective adrenergic blockade...|$|R

Salmeterol has been reformulated using the non-chlorinated propellant Glaxo inhalation grade HFA 134 a. METHODS [...] The safety, tolerability and systemic <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activity</b> of the salmeterol/HFA 134 a inhaler, the current salmeterol inhaler, and placebo (HFA 134 a) were compared in 12 healthy volunteers in a double blind, randomised crossover study using a cumulative dosing design. RESULTS [...] Safety and tolerability were similar and the response was related to the dose over the range used (50 - 400 micrograms) with both salmeterol inhalers. The salmeterol/HFA 134 a inhaler showed no differences from the current inhaler for pulse rate, blood pressure, tremor, QTc interval, and plasma glucose levels. The salmeterol/HFA 134 a inhaler had significantly less effect on plasma potassium levels.

40|$|Cats are not small dogs. ” Every cat {{practitioner}} knows this, but it {{is particularly}} true {{in regards to the}} use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The pharmacokinetics, metabolism, toxicity, and the degree of inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase 1 (COX- 1), cyclo-oxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and lipoxygenase (LOX) of NSAIDs are very species specific. [1, 2] Accurate descriptions of the behavior of NSAIDS in cats are few in number, although recently more {{attention has been paid to}} this species. The pharmacodynamics (the therapeutic effects of a drug) of NSAIDs are very different from the pharmacokinetics (a description of the drug’s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination). NSAID drug concentrations do not correlate well with drug activity. Thus, in order to really understand how a NSAID is acting, not only do the drug concentrations need to be measured, but accurate measures of drug activity also need to be assessed. One of the easiest <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> to measure is the production of fever after some challenge, such as endotoxin.

The levels of VEN in serum and brain were higher in PCS rats than in controls after a single injection and chronic treatment with VEN (10 mg/kg). After reducing the dose by 50 % to PCS rats (i. e. 5 mg/kg, single injection), the levels of VEN were still higher in experimental HE than in controls. Furthermore, since the T 1 / 2 for VEN was prolonged by 80 % in experimental HE, {{the results suggest that}} liver-insufficient patients may have to be treated with both reduced doses and with longer dosing intervals than patients with intact liver function. The S/R ratio of the enantiomers of VEN differed between serum and brain in both experimental HE and controls, but the ratio was not altered in experimental HE versus controls. This could be reassuring regarding drug safety for VEN in patients suffering from HE. There were no major differences in S/R ratio of CIT between serum and brain of normal rats. The levels of 5 -HT in brain dialysis samples were higher in the PCS rats compared to controls following administration of 10 mg/kg to both groups. However, the 5 -HT levels were not higher in experimental HE compared to normal rats when the dose of VEN was reduced in PCS rats. In conclusion, both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations were observed in experimental HE after administration of the antidepressant drugs VEN and CIT...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> of fluconazole and amphotericin B given alone and in combination against Candida albicans {{by using an}} in vitro model of bloodstream infection that simulates human serum pharmacokinetic parameters for these antifungals. Fluconazole was administered as a bolus into the model to simulate regimens of 200 mg every 24 h (q 24 h) and 400 mg q 24 h. Amphotericin B was administered at doses producing the peak concentration (2. 4 μg/ml) observed with a regimen of 1 mg/kg of body weight q 24 h. A combination regimen of fluconazole (400 mg q 24 h) and amphotericin B (1 mg/kg q 24 h) administered simultaneously and as a staggered regimen (amphotericin B bolus given 8 h after fluconazole bolus) was also simulated in the model to characterize possible antagonism between these agents. Fluconazole alone and amphotericin B alone demonstrated fungistatic (99. 9 % reduction) activity, respectively. When fluconazole and amphotericin B were administered simultaneously, fungicidal activity similar to that observed with amphotericin B alone was observed. Staggered administration of fluconazole and amphotericin B, however, resulted in a substantial reduction of the fungicidal activity of amphotericin B, producing fungistatic activity similar to that observed with noncombination fluconazole regimens. These results demonstrate the usefulness of this model for comparing the in vitro pharmacodynamic characteristics of different antifungal regimens and support the theory of azole-polyene antagonism. The effects of this antagonism on the in vivo activity and clinical usefulness of combination antifungal therapy, however, remain to be determined...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profi les of mavrilimumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor-α, {{in subjects with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating phase I study in subjects with RA who received stable methotrexate treatment for ≥ 3 months before enrolment. Subjects received single intravenous escalating doses of mavrilimumab (0. 01 – 10. 0 mg/kg) or placebo. Results 32 subjects were enrolled in this study (1 unblinded subject at 0. 01 mg/kg and another at 0. 03 mg/kg were followed by fi ve sequential double-blinded cohorts, n= 6 each, treated with 0. 1, 0. 3, 1. 0, 3. 0 and 10. 0 mg/kg, respectively). Adverse events were mild or moderate and were reported with similar frequency across all treatment cohorts. One subject (10. 0 mg/kg) experienced moderate face and neck urticaria during infusion that resolved with symptomatic treatment. Systemic clearance of mavrilimumab approached that of endogenous IgG at doses> 1. 0 mg/kg; <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activity</b> was confi rmed in the 1. 0 and 3. 0 mg/kg cohorts by suppression of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 mRNA transcripts. In exploratory analyses, reductions of acute phase reactants were observed in subjects with elevated C-reactive protein (> 5 mg/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (≥ 20. 0 mm/h) at baseline.

To select a topical dose of SB 705498 using the TRPV 1 agonist capsaicin; to confirm engagement of the TRPV 1 antagonistic action of SB 705498 and assess whether the dose selected has an effect on itch induced by two challenge agents. A clinical study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers to assess the effects of 3 doses of SB 705498 on skin flare induced by capsaicin. Subjects with a robust capsaicin response were chosen to determine if the selected topical formulation of SB 705498 had an effect on challenge agent induced itch. Following capsaicin challenge the greatest average reduction in area of flare was seen for the 3 % formulation. This dose was selected for further investigation. Itch intensity induced by two challenge agents (cowhage and histamine) was assessed on the Computerised Visual Analogue Scale. The difference in average itch intensity (Weighted Mean Over 15 Mins) between the 3 % dose of SB 705498 and placebo for the cowhage challenge was - 0. 64, whilst the histamine challenge showed on average a - 4. 65 point change.

In a phase I program with double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending oral-dose studies, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and ex vivo <b>pharmacodynamic</b> antimalarial <b>activity</b> of artemisone. Single doses (10, 20, 30, 40, and 80 mg) and multiple doses (40 and 80 mg daily for 3 days) of artemisone were administered orally to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of artemisone and its metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). Artemisone was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and no clinically relevant changes in laboratory and vital parameters. The pharmacokinetics of artemisone over the 10 - to 80 -mg range demonstrated dose linearity. After the single 80 -mg dose, artemisone had a geometric mean maximum concentration of 140. 2 ng/ml (range, 86. 6 to 391. 0), a short elimination half-life (t(1 / 2)) of 2. 79 h (range, 1. 56 to 4. 88), a high oral clearance of 284. 1 liters/h (range, 106. 7 to 546. 7), and a large volume of distribution of 14. 50 liters/kg (range, 3. 21 to 51. 58). Due to artemisone's short t(1 / 2), its pharmacokinetics were comparable after single and multiple dosing. Plasma samples taken after multiple dosing showed marked ex vivo <b>pharmacodynamic</b> antimalarial <b>activities</b> against two multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum lines. Artemisone equivalent concentrations measured by bioassay revealed higher activity than artemisone measured by LC/MS-MS, confirming the presence of active metabolites.

Infected platelet-fibrin clots were prepared with human cryoprecipitate, human platelets, calcium, thrombin, and approximately 10 (9) CFU of organisms (MSSA 1199 and MRSA 494) per g and then were suspended via monofilament line into the in vitro model containing Mueller-Hinton growth medium. Antibiotics were administered by bolus injection into the model to simulate human pharmacokinetics; the regimens simulated included levofloxacin at dosages of 800 mg every 24 h (q 24 h) and 400 mg q 12 h, vancomycin at 1 g q 12 h, and rifampin at 600 mg q 24 h. Each model was run in duplicate over a 72 -h period. Infected platelet-fibrin clots were removed in duplicate from each model, weighed, homogenized, serially diluted with sterile 0. 9 % saline, and plated on tryptic soy agar plates and plates containing antibiotics at 3, 6, and 12 times the MIC to evaluate the emergence of resistance. Time-kill curves were constructed by plotting the inoculum size versus time. Residual inoculum at 72 h {{was used to compare}} regimens. All levofloxacin regimens were significantly better than vancomycin monotherapy against both isolates (P < 0. 002). Against MSSA 1199, levofloxacin q 24 h was significantly better than all other regimens, including levofloxacin q 12 h (P < 0. 002); however, no difference between the levofloxacin monotherapy and combination therapy (with rifampin) regimens against MRSA 494 was seen. Killing activity for levofloxacin appeared to correlate better with the peak/MIC ratio than with the area under the curve/MIC ratio. The addition of rifampin significantly enhanced the activity of vancomycin but had little effect upon the activity of levofloxacin. For MRSA 494, vancomycin plus rifampin resulted in the greatest killing (P < 0. 05). Development of resistance was not detected with any regimen. Levofloxacin may be a useful therapeutic alternative in the treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis, and further study with animal models of endocarditis or clinical trials are warranted...|$|R
40|$|The in vivo <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> of two glycylcyclines (GAR- 936 and WAY 152, 288) were {{assessed}} in an experimental murine thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. Mice were infected {{with one of}} several strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most infections were treated with a twice-daily dosing schedule, with administration of 0. 75 to 192 mg of GAR- 936 or WAY 152, 288 per kg of body weight. A maximum-effect dose-response model was {{used to calculate the}} dose that produced a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h of therapy. This dose was called the bacteriostatic dose. More extensive dosing studies were performed with S. pneumoniae 1199, E. coli ATCC 25922, and K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816, with doses being given as one, two, four, or eight equal doses over a period of 24 h. The dosing schedules were designed in order to minimize the interrelationship between the various pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters studied. These parameters were time above 0. 03 to 32 times the MIC, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax). The bacteriostatic dose remained essentially the same, irrespective of the dosing frequency, for S. pneumoniae 1199 (0. 3 to 0. 9 mg/kg/day). For E. coli ATCC 25922 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816, however, more frequent dosing led to lower bacteriostatic doses. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated dose-dependent elimination half-lives of 1. 05 to 2. 34 and 1. 65 to 3. 36 h and serum protein bindings of 59 and 71 % for GAR- 936 and WAY 152, 288, respectively. GAR- 936 and WAY 152, 288 were similarly effective against the microorganisms studied, with small differences in maximum effect and 50 % effective dose. The glycylcyclines were also similarly effective against tetracycline-sensitive and tetracycline-resistant bacteria. Time above a certain factor (range, 0. 5 to 4 times) of the MIC was a better predictor of in vivo efficacy than Cmax or AUC for most organism-drug combinations. The results demonstrate that in order to achieve 80 % maximum efficacy, the concentration of unbound drug in serum should be maintained above the MIC for at least 50 % of the time for GAR- 936 and for at least 75 % of the time for WAY 152, 288. The results of these experiments will aid in the rational design of dose-finding studies for these glycylcyclines in humans...|$|R

Introduction: As a topical {{delivery}} system, a nanoscaled emulsion is considered a good carrier of several active ingredients that convey several side effects upon oral administration, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Objective: We investigated the in vitro permeation properties and the in vivo <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> of different nanoscaled emulsions containing ibuprofen, an NSAID, as an active ingredient and newly synthesized palm olein esters (POEs) as the oil phase. Methodology: A ratio of 25 : 37 : 38 of oil phase:aqueous phase:surfactant was used, and different additives {{were used for the}} production of a range of nanoscaled emulsions. Carbopol&reg; 940 dispersion neutralized by triethanolamine was employed as a rheology modifier. In some circumstances, menthol and limonene were employed at different concentrations as permeation promoters. All formulae were assessed in vitro using Franz diffusion cell fitted with full-thickness rat skin. This was followed by in vivo evaluation of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the promising formulae and comparison of the effects with that of the commercially available gel. Results and discussion: Among all other formulae, formula G 40 (Carbopol&reg; 940 -free formula) had a superior ability in transferring ibuprofen topically compared with the reference. Carbopol&reg; 940 significantly decreased the amount of drug transferred from formula G 41 through the skin as a result of swelling, gel formation, and reduction in drug thermodynamic activity. Nonetheless, the addition of 10 % w/w of menthol and limonene successfully overcame this drawback since, relative to the reference, higher amount of ibuprofen was transferred through the skin. By contrast, these results were relatively comparable to that of formula G 40. Pharmacodynamically, the G 40, G 45, and G 47 formulae exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects compared with other formulae. Conclusion: The ingredients and the physical properties of the nanoscaled emulsions produced by using the newly synthesized POEs succeeded to deliver ibuprofen competently.

40|$|Perhexiline maleate {{was first}} {{introduced}} for the prophylaxis of exertional angina in the 1970 s but reports of adverse reactions, including potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, increasingly restricted its application. By 1988 Australia and New Zealand were the only countries permitting its use, limited {{to the treatment of}} refractory angina pectoris conditional upon the therapeutic monitoring of patients, due to recognition of the concentration dependent nature of its efficacy and toxicity. An understanding of the extreme interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of perhexiline due to metabolism by the polymorphic Cytochrome P 450 2 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6) has prompted a recent resurgence of its use in Australasia and Europe. Perhexiline is a chiral molecule and is administered as a racemic mixture. Prior to the publication of the papers that are the topic of this thesis the characterisation of the clinical pharmacology of the enantiomers of perhexiline had been limited to one pharmacokinetic study that suggested that the (+) enantiomer of perhexiline may display a smaller polymorphic effect in its metabolism than its optical antipode. The four publications that comprise this thesis describe a comprehensive investigation of the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the enantiomers of perhexiline in extensive and poor metabolisers (EM and PM, respectively) of CYP 2 D 6 in both an in vitro model and clinically. The aim was to determine if the CYP 2 D 6 polymorphism affects the metabolism of (+) -perhexiline significantly less than (-) -perhexiline, such that the inherent variability observed in the pharmacokinetics of the racemic preparation used clinically might be overcome by administration of only (+) -perhexiline. Although both the in vitro and in vivo studies determined that the involvement of CYP 2 D 6 was proportionately greater in the total clearance of (-) - than (+) -perhexiline, the empirical data also demonstrated that the role of CYP 2 D 6 in the metabolism of (+) -perhexiline was simply too pre-eminent for a chiral preparation of this enantiomer to significantly reduce the difference in clearance observed between EM and PM. An unexpected finding was that the enantioselectivity observed in the clinical pharmacokinetics of perhexiline in EM was, in fact, significantly greater in PM. Whilst the enantioselectivity in EM was attributable to metabolism by CYP 2 D 6, the mechanism responsible for this in PM could not be determined, but was postulated to involve enantioselective biliary excretion. Because PM are effectively exposed to greater concentrations of (+) -perhexiline and lower concentrations of (-) -perhexiline, when the relative <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities</b> of the individual enantiomers have been established therapeutic drug monitoring may be improved by the development of specific enantiomer target concentration ranges in plasma. What is certain is that perhexiline will remain an essential option in the armamentarium for the treatment of refractory angina pectoris and therapeutic drug monitoring will remain obligatory due to the inter- and intra-subject pharmacokinetic variability attributable to the respective polymorphic and saturable metabolism of both enantiomers by CYP 2 D 6.

40|$|Background: Drug {{blood levels}} can only {{serve as a}} {{surrogate}} {{because of the lack}} of information on the drug’s direct pharma-cological effects in the individual patient. Measurement of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity dependent on the phosphorylation status of p 70 S 6 kinase (p 70 S 6 K) offers a practical way for monitoring <b>pharmacodynamic</b> drug <b>activity,</b> with the potential to better assess the state of immunosuppre-ssion in individual patients. Material and Methods: Here, we established a novel in vitro model system by treating Jurkat cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells with different concentrations of sirolimus after stimulation with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. Results: A dose-dependent reduction of the p 70 S 6 K phosphor-ylation status was demonstrated by Western blot and a newly established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Rela-tive phospho-p 70 S 6 K values from ELISA and relative densities from Western blot analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed a strong correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient rs = 0. 7, P = 0. 01). Finally, parallel assays confirmed a sirolimus dose-dependent reduction of cytokine production and cell proliferation in the in vitro model. Conclusions: Pharmacodynamic monitoring of mTOR inhibi-tion with a p 70 S 6 K ELISA could guide mTOR inhibitor immunosuppression therapy toward a more individualized ther-apy. The usage of this technique now has to be evaluated in a clinical series of patients.

40|$|Multiparametric {{analyses}} of phospho-protein activation {{in patients with}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML) offers a quantitative measure to monitor the activity of novel intracellular kinase (IK) inhibitors. As recent clinical investigation with FMS-like tyrosine- 3 inhibitors demonstrated, targeting IK with selective inhibitors can have a modest clinical benefit. Because multiple IKs are active in patients with AML, multikinase inhibitors may provide the necessary inhibition profile to achieve a more sustained clinical benefit. We here describe a method of assessing the activation of several IKs by flow cytometry. In 40 different samples of patients with AML we observed hyper-activated phospho-proteins at baseline, which is modestly increased by adding stem cell factor to AML cells. Finally, AML cells had a significantly different phospho-protein profile compared with cells of the lymphocyte gate. In conclusion, our method offers a way to determine the activation status of multiple kinases in AML and hence is a reliable assay to evaluate the <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activity</b> of novel multikinase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Levetiracetam, the α-ethyl {{analogue}} of the nootropic piracetam, is {{a widely}} used antiepileptic drug (AED) that provides protection against partial seizures and is also effective {{in the treatment of}} primary generalized seizure syndromes including juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Levetiracetam was discovered in 1992 through screening in audiogenic seizure susceptible mice and, 3 years later, was reported to exhibit saturable, stereospecific binding in brain to a ∼ 90 [*]kDa protein, later identified as the ubiquitous synaptic vesicle glycoprotein SV 2 A. A large-scale screening effort to optimize binding affinity identified the 4 -n-propyl analogue, brivaracetam, as having greater potency and a broadened spectrum of activity in animal seizure models. Recent phase II clinical trials demonstrating that brivaracetam is efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of partial onset seizures have validated the strategy of the discovery programme. Brivaracetam is among the first clinically effective AEDs to be discovered by optimization of <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activity</b> at a molecular target...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Iron {{chelation}} {{has improved}} survival {{and quality of}} life of patients with thalassemia major. there are currently 3 commercially available iron-chelating drugs with different pharmacokinetic and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activity.</b> The choice of adequate chelation treatment should be tailored to patient needs and based on up-to-date scientific evidence. Methods: A review of the most recent literature was performed. Findings: The ability of the chelators to bind the redox active component of iron, labile plasma iron, is crucial for protecting the cells. Chelation therapy should be guided by magnetic resonance imaging that permits the tailoring of therapy according {{to the needs of the}} patient because different chelators preferentially clear iron from different sites. Normal levels of body iron seem to decrease the need for hormonal and cardiac therapy. Implications: The 3 chelators currently available have different benefits, different safety profiles, and different acceptance on the part of the patients.

40|$|Ten {{patients}} {{were treated with}} conventional dosing (CD) and continuous-infusion (CI) vancomycin therapy in this prospective, randomized, crossover study. Patients were randomized to receive either CD or CI therapy for 2 consecutive days and then crossed over to receive the opposite regimen for 2 days. CD therapy consisted of 1 g of vancomycin every 12 h. CI therapy consisted of a 500 -mg loading dose followed by 2 g infused over 24 h. Ten serum samples were obtained {{on the second day}} of each therapy for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses. Two clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, one methicillin sensitive (MSSA 1199) and one methicillin resistant (MRSA 494), were chosen for pharmacodynamic evaluation of both regimens. The patient demographics (means +/- standard deviations [SD]) were as follows: sex, six males, four females; age, 36 +/- 11 years; and serum creatinine, 0. 72 +/- 0. 18 mg/dl. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters +/- SD for CD therapy were as follows: elimination rate constant, 0. 16 +/- 0. 07 h- 1; half-life, 5. 6 +/- 3. 5 h; volume of distribution, 33. 7 +/- 25 liters, 0. 5 +/- 0. 2 liters/kg; maximum concentration in serum, 53. 4 +/- 19. 3 micrograms/ml; and minimum concentration, 8. 4 +/- 5. 9 micrograms/ml. The steady-state concentration for CI was 20. 2 +/- 11. 1 micrograms/ml. Overall, both regimens resulted in the MIC being exceeded 100 % of the time. The mean CD trough serum bactericidal titer (SBT) was 1 : 8, and the average CI SBTs were 1 : 16 for both isolates. Even though there was no statistically significant difference between CD trough and CI SBTs, the CI SBTs remained > 1 : 8 for 100 % of the time versus 60 % of the time for CD therapy. During CI therapy, 20 and 40 % of the patients maintained SBTs of > 1 : 32 throughout the dosing interval for MSSA 1199 and MRSA 494, respectively. During CD therapy, however, only 10 % of patients maintained SBTs of > 1 : 32 during the entire dosing interval for both isolates. The mean areas under the bactericidal titer-time curve (AUBC 24 s) +/- SD for MSSA 1199 were 528 +/- 263 for CD therapy and 547 +/- 390 for CI therapy. The mean AUBC 24 s +/- SD against MRSA 494 were 531 +/- 247 for CD and 548 +/- 293 for CI therapy. Similar to the AUBC 24, the mean area under the concentration-time curve for a 24 -h dosing interval divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC 24) ratios +/- SD were 550. 0 +/- 265. 7 for CD and 552. 6 +/- 373. 4 for CI therapy, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between any of the pharmacodynamic parameters for CD and CI therapy. In addition, no adverse effects with either CD or CI therapy were observed during the study. We conclude that CI and CD vancomycin therapy demonstrated equivalent <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>activities.</b> Although CI therapy was more likely to result in SBTs that remained above 1 : 8 for the entire regimen, the clinical impact of this result is unknown. Serum drug concentration variability was observed with both treatment regimens but to a lesser extent with CI administration. CI administration of vancomycin should be further evaluated to determine the clinical utility of this method of administration...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to simulate standard and optimized dosing regimens for intravenous antibiotics against contemporary populations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using MIC distribution data to determine which of the tested carbapenem regimens provided the greatest opportunity for obtaining maximal <b>pharmacodynamic</b> (PD) <b>activity.</b> METHODS: The isolates studied were obtained from the COMPACT-COLOMBIA surveillance program conducted between February and November 2009. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by broth microdilution method according to the CLSI guidelines. Doripenem, imipenem-cilastatin, and meropenem, were the modeled antibiotics. A 5, 000 patient Monte Carlo simulation was performed for each regimen and PD targets were defined as free drug concentrations above the MIC for at least 40 % of the dosing interval. RESULTS: All carbapenem regimens obtained optimal exposures against E. coli, unlike the other Enterobacteriaceae tested. Against P. aeruginosa, only a prolonged infusion of doripenem exceeded the 90 % cumulative fraction of response (CFR) threshold. Worrisomely, no regimens for any of the drugs tested obtained optimal CFR against A. baumannii. For P. aeruginosa intensive care unit (ICU) isolates, CFR was approximately 20 % lower for isolates collected in the respiratory tract compared with bloodstream or intra-abdominal for imipenem and meropenem. Noteworthy, all doripenem and meropenem regimens achieved greater than 90 % CFR against bloodstream and respiratory isolates of K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that higher dosing and prolonged infusion of doripenem or meropenem may be suitable for empirically treating ICU P. aeruginosa, while none of the carbapenems achieved optimal cumulative fraction of response against A. baumannii. Standard dosing regimens of all the carbapenems tested achieved optimal CFR against E. coli isolates, but higher carbapenem dosages might be required for empiric treatment of K. pneumoniae, particularly from an intra-abdominal source. Non-standard dosage regimens studied in this modeling should be proven effective in prospective clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, {{antimicrobial}} activity, clinical safety, {{and current}} regulatory status of solithromycin are reviewed. Summary Solithromycin {{is a novel}} ketolide antibiotic developed {{for the treatment of}} community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Its pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> properties provide <b>activity</b> against a broad range of intracellular organisms, including retained activity against pathogens displaying various mechanisms of macrolide resistance. Phase III clinical trials of solithromycin demonstrated noninferiority of both oral and i. v. -to-oral regimens of 5 – 7 days’ duration compared with moxifloxacin for patients with moderately severe CABP. Nearly one third of patients receiving i. v. solithromycin experienced infusion-site reactions. Although no liver-related adverse events were reported in patients receiving oral solithromycin, more patients receiving i. v. -to-oral solithromycin experienced asymptomatic, transient transaminitis, with alanine transaminase levels of 3 ̆e 3 to 3 ̆e 5 times the upper limit, compared with those treated with moxifloxacin. These results led the Food and Drug Administration to conclude that the solithromycin new drug application was not approvable as filed, adding that the risk of hepatotoxicity had not yet been adequately characterized. The agency further recommended a comparative study of patients with CABP to include approximately 9, 000 patients exposed to solithromycin in order to exclude drug-induced liver injury events occurring at a rate of 1 in 3, 000 with 95...|$|R
