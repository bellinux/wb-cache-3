5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Orsborne took part in further {{maritime}} adventures and served in the navy in the Second World War. He died in 1957. In Georgetown Girl <b>Pat</b> <b>was</b> acquired by new owners who returned her to Britain, where she was displayed as a tourist attraction in several resorts. In 1939 she was sold to the Port of London Authority {{for use as a}} wreck-marking vessel and, after being requisitioned by the Royal Navy during the war, was returned to the authority in 1945.

5|$|Battering Aitutaki {{with wind}} gusts {{in excess of}} 185km/h (115mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78percent of homes were damaged, with 72structures destroyed. The {{electrical}} grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name <b>Pat</b> <b>was</b> later retired and replaced with Pili.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (<b>PAT)</b> <b>was</b> designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E

In his mid-teens, Pete had {{a one-night stand}} with prostitute Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) who informed Pete she was pregnant.

During the marriage, Pat gave birth to two sons, David (Michael French) and Simon (Nick Berry), the latter of whom Pete believed to be his. Yet Pat could not settle down. She had various affairs, including a tryst with her former lover Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), a one-night stand with Den, and an affair with Pete's older brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). Lou found Pat and Kenny in bed together and banished Kenny abroad, but Pete was unaware of the affair. <b>Pat</b> <b>was</b> also having an affair with another man named Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield).

Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy, although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud.

500|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone <b>Pat</b> <b>was</b> a {{small but}} strong {{tropical}} cyclone that passed directly over Aitutaki, Cook Islands, in southern Pacific Ocean on February10, 2010.

The storm steadily organized as it moved generally southeast, becoming a tropical cyclone on February8.

The [...] wide system displayed annular characteristics and a [...] wide eye. Pat reached its peak strength early on February10 as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a barometric pressure of 960mbar (hPa; 28.35inHg). Hours later it struck Aitutaki, producing gusts in excess of 185km/h (115mph) on the island. Hostile wind shear then prompted rapid weakening of the cyclone. The system degraded below gale-intensity on February11, just 24hours after it peaked, and was last noted early on February12.|$|E

After leaving port, Orsborne informed the crew that they were going on an extended cruise in more southerly waters. Nothing more was heard of them until mid-May, when the owners, who had by then assumed the vessel lost, received invoices relating to its repair and reprovisioning in the northern Spanish port of Corcubión. Subsequent sightings placed her in the Savage Islands, at Dakar in Senegal, and Îles du Salut off the coast of French Guiana in South America.
