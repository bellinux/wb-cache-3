40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The development of a DC-DC converter {{for use in a}} proposed range of one to ten kilowatt off-line power supplies is presented. The converter makes good use of established design practices and recent technical advances. The thesis begins with a review of traditional design practices, which are used in the design of a 3 kW, 48 V output DC-DC converter, as a bench-mark for evaluation of recent technical advances. Advances evaluated include new converter circuits, control techniques, components, and magnetic component designs. Converter circuits using zero voltage switching (ZVS) transitions offer significant advantages for this application. Of the published converters which have ZVS transitions the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>controlled</b> full bridge converter is the most suitable, and assessments of variations on this circuit are presented. During the course of the research it was realised that the ZVS range of one leg of the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>controlled</b> full bridge converter could be extended by altering the switching pattern, and this new switching pattern is proposed. A detailed analysis of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>controlled</b> full bridge converter operation uncovers a number of operational findings which give a better and more complete understanding of converter operation than hitherto published. Converter design equations and guidelines are presented and the effects of the new improvement are investigated by an approximate analysis. Computer simulations using PSPICE 2 are carried out to predict converter performance. A prototype converter design, construction details and test results are given.
