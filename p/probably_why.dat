25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why they built the Ogmore Valley as a {{standard}} gauge railway in a broad gauge area, forcing the decision to build a dock at considerable expense. It may have been unavoidable owing to the Gauge Act of 1846. If so then perhaps {{it would have been}} cheaper to build the line as dual gauge from the start instead of building a dock. Perhaps even this was not permissible. The Llynvi Valley Railway was formed in 1861 by reopening pre-1846 lines. This is <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> it was permitted to use broad gauge. What is clear is that Brogdens sold off the Ulverston and Lancaster {{at about the same time}} as they started the Ogmore Valley Railway.|$|E
25|$|Chavacano or Chabacano is a Spanish-based creole {{language}} and known in linguistics as Philippine Creole Spanish. Chabacano is originally spoken by {{majority of the}} Caviteños that lived in Cavite City and Ternate after {{the arrival of the}} Spaniards three centuries ago. The various dialects of Chabacano were formed out of necessity like all languages, though scholars and laypersons disagree about exactly when and where it all began. The various language groups working at the Cavite naval base needed a way to communicate with each other, and to the soldiers who were barking the orders in less-than-genteel Spanish. It was from this situation that Cavite Chabacano began as a simplified form of Spanish – a pidgin language that later developed into a mixed, or creole language. The fact that the first Chabacanos learned their Spanish from the coarse language of soldiers is <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> they were called Chabacanos in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Bestwick {{was born}} at Tag Hill, Heanor, Derbyshire {{the son of a}} miner and worked at Coppice Pit from the age of 11. He debuted for the Derbyshire team in 1898, as a {{professional}} although still working in the mine in winter. He is one of only two bowlers to have hit ten wickets in a single innings for Derbyshire, a feat he achieved in June 1921, the other being five-time Test cricketer Tommy Mitchell. He was a true tailender batsman, who never averaged above eight with the bat in a single season for Derbyshire, and did not once reach twenty in his last two hundred and eighty first-class innings, a run of batting failures equalled only by Eric Hollies between 1939 and 1954. This extreme weakness as a batsman (and also in the field) was <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> Bestwick never managed to gain a single Test cap.|$|E

500|$|The cookiecutter shark {{regularly}} replaces {{its teeth}} like other sharks, but sheds its lower teeth in entire rows {{rather than one}} at a time. A cookiecutter shark [...] long has been calculated to have shed 15 sets of lower teeth {{by the time it}} is [...] long, totaling 435465 teeth. This represents a significant investment of resources and is <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> the shark swallows its old sets of teeth, so that it can recycle the calcium content. Unlike other sharks, the retina of the cookiecutter shark has ganglion cells concentrated in a concentric area rather than in a horizontal streak across the visual field; this may help to focus on prey in front of the shark. This fat shark has been known to travel in schools, which may increase the effectiveness of its lure (see below), as well as discourage counterattacks by much larger predators.|$|E
50|$|Many early {{settlers}} to {{the township}} under British rule were New England Planters from Newport, Rhode Island, which <b>probably</b> explains <b>why</b> Morris felt that residents might be agreeable to Lord Newport's name being {{attached to the}} new township.|$|R

500|$|Filming {{began in}} New York in October 1986. Madonna {{would ask for}} five minutes to study the script for the scene they were filming. For example, before {{a scene in which}} she needed to appear out of breath, she did a series of push-ups before going on set. Dunne {{observed}} that [...] " [...] likes her first take best. I think my best is around fourth. She always says, 'You got it, you got it,' and she was driving me crazy just like her character would. We had to make a compromise as to which take is the best." [...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know what she was doing, she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie's love {{of acting}} led his total {{immersion}} in the characters he created for his music. [...] "Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David." [...] With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting {{the same role}} over an extended period, it became {{impossible for him to}} separate Ziggy Stardust—and, later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, [...] "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity." [...] His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage [...] "retirement" [...] at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} a decade later that the album started to receive almost {{unanimous}} praise from rock critics, many of whom made particular note of its influence in modern rock music. Christgau wrote in his 1977 retrospective review for The Village Voice that the record was difficult to understand in 1967, [...] "which is <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> people are still learning from it. It sounds intermittently crude, thin, and pretentious at first, but it never stops getting better". In The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (1998), Colin Larkin called it a [...] "powerful collection" [...] that [...] "introduced Reed's decidedly urban infatuations, a fascination for street culture and amorality bordering on voyeurism." [...] In April 2003, Spin led their [...] "Top Fifteen Most Influential Albums of All Time" [...] list with the album. On November 12, 2000, NPR included it in their [...] "NPR 100" [...] series of [...] "the most important American musical works of the 20th century". Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time in November 2003, calling it the most prophetic rock album ever made.|$|E

500|$|After some {{errors in}} her {{pronunciation}} of Sanskrit shloka [...] "Yoga Taravali" [...] during the song [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi", the BBC arranged for Madonna to take telephonic lessons {{to learn the}} basic correct pronunciation of Sanskrit words from eminent scholar Dr B P T Vagish Shastri. She then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album. In an interview with MTV, Madonna recalled the recording of the album, and said her business partner Guy Oseary was a helpful friend, and that after she and Orbit played him the tracks, he, to their dismay, said nothing and left the studio. [...] "He really hates those icy strings. Right when I think the track's done, he sort of pushes us another step further. 'Maybe we should try this', or 'I really don't want to hear that'. And then of course, later on, it creeps in my brain, and I'm like, 'maybe I should have done a background vocal on that'. And then she comes in and happily does it, right?", Madonna said. Orbit also recalled during an interview with Q magazine that Madonna recorded [...] "Swim" [...] the day her friend and fashion designer Gianni Versace was killed in Miami, Florida. He also commented that this is <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> the track has an emotional impact.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called the episode a [...] "generally good program, though {{not one of}} the year’s best". Jacobson said he dislikes Marge's mother; [...] "she’s one of the series’ less interesting characters, which is <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> she appears so rarely." [...] However, he thinks Grampa is [...] "always fun", and [...] "it’s nice to see him in an ebullient mood, at least for a while." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B grade and said he is [...] "never terribly interested in episodes that revolve around [...] Simpson". He believes Grampa is [...] "great as a background character, but less so when he takes center stage". He added: [...] "I'm also especially uninterested in episodes revolving around Marge's mother. Having said that, this episode does have a number of inspired moments—notably the subplot involving Bart's pursuit of an Itchy & Scratchy cel, as well as one of the series' many homages to The Graduate." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Homer's nightmare vision of Bart, Lisa and Maggie as ordinary kids is a highlight of this especially crazy—surreal jokes, flashbacks and dream sequences whizz by at an alarming rate—installment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Miss Independent" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics, who lauded Clarkson for distancing herself from her American Idol persona, but criticized the song's resemblance {{to some of}} the songs on Stripped— particularly [...] "Dirrty" [...] and [...] "Fighter" [...] (2002). On its release, Brian Hiatt of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "its hard R sound may shock fans who embraced the mellow [...] "A Moment Like This." [...] "Miss Independent" [...] begins with Clarkson singing in a throaty moan over a bangin' hip-hop beat, then bursts into a power-chord-propelled, disco-diva chorus that's not unlike Britney Spears' [...] "Stronger"." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] ""A Moment Like This" [...] was exactly the sort of treacly by-the-numbers ballad critics expected of a TV-contest winner; that's <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> its assertive follow-up, [...] "Miss Independent," [...] was such a surprise." [...] AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it [...] "managed to make Kelly Clarkson seem younger and hipper without slutting her up like Christina Aguilera (who, ironically, co-wrote [...] "Miss Independent," [...] the first single from Thankful) while retaining a strong sense of melodic songcraft." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song [...] "gives Clarkson the youthful edge she desperately needs to balance out the Adult Contemporary goo of songs like [...] "Anytime" [...] and [...] "A Moment Like This." [...] Cinquemani also added, [...] ""Miss Independent" [...] is no [...] "Dirrty," [...] but it proves that if anyone can out-sing Aguilera, it's Clarkson." [...] On March 5, 2013, Billboard ranked the it the number sixteen in its list of [...] "Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time".|$|E

50|$|This mixed {{influence}} is {{probably due to}} the high preponderance of Taoists and Buddhists in the same area.

500|$|Later in the series, Ellen Pompeo {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} with numerous critics lauding her {{portrayal of the}} character. Reviewing the episode She's Leaving Home CarterMatt called her the [...] "anchor" [...] for Grey's saying, [...] "Throughout, this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo, who has done some of her best work ever on the show {{the past couple of}} weeks. Tonight, she cried, she fought, and she learned that she was carrying his child." [...] and added that Pompeo is often [...] "ovelooked" [...] saying, [...] "Her subtlety is <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> she is often overlooked." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it reviewing [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] wrote, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen {{for more than half of}} it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] USA Today also lauded Pompeo saying, [...] " [...] In some ways, the episode (How to Save a Life) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo. She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes, from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album seem {{to be based on}} the {{pressures}} of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include [...] "Not for You", [...] "Pry, To", [...] "Corduroy", [...] "Bugs", [...] "Satan's Bed", and [...] "Immortality". Vedder said, [...] "I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's <b>probably</b> <b>why</b> I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship with a million people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing." [...] "Better Man" [...] is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote [...] "Better Man" [...] when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio.
