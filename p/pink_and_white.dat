5|$|Cockatoos are {{recognisable}} by the showy crests and curved bills. Their plumage {{is generally}} less colourful {{than that of}} other parrots, being mainly white, grey or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks or tail. On average they are larger than other parrots; however, the cockatiel, the smallest cockatoo species, is a small bird. The phylogenetic position of the cockatiel remains unresolved, other than that {{it is one of}} the earliest offshoots of the cockatoo lineage. The remaining species are in two main clades. The five large black coloured cockatoos of the genus Calyptorhynchus form one branch. The second and larger branch is formed by the genus Cacatua, comprising 11 species of white-plumaged cockatoos and four monotypic genera that branched off earlier; namely the <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> Major Mitchell's cockatoo, the pink and grey galah, the mainly grey gang-gang cockatoo and the large black-plumaged palm cockatoo.|$|E

He began to build on his geological knowledge, taking a particular interest in vulcanology and wrote an article on Auckland's volcanoes for a geological journal in England. He completed several paintings of volcanoes as well as thermal attractions in the Bay of Plenty including the famous <b>Pink</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> Terraces.

25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
25|$|An oblong marble plaque {{of white}} field with black framing, and {{containing}} an embossed heraldic shield surmounted by a lion crest, is to Christopher Randolph Turnor (1886–1914), {{who was a}} lieutenant in the 10th Royal Hussars, killed near Ypres, Belgium, and buried in Zandvoorde; {{he was the son}} of Algernon and Lady Henrietta Turnor. Above this plaque are two others, both of a black recessed field, surrounded by a raised figured <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> marble frame incised with flat straight grooves and square corner devices with embossed details. One is dedicated firstly to Elizabeth Turnor (died 1801 aged 27), first wife of Edmund Turnor (1755–1829), and daughter of Philip Bowes Broke (commander of HMS Shannon in the capture of USS Chesapeake); and secondly to Edmund Turnor’s second wife Dorothea (died 1874 aged 77 years). The second is to Edmund Turnor (died 1806 aged 89 years)—who was the father of Edmund Turnor (1755–1829)—and his wife Mary (died 1818 aged 86 years). A further memorial of double dedication is of a white bolection moulding surrounding two raised plaques on a black field; all marble. Both dedications mention Reginald Charles Turnor (1850–1910); the first for his first wife Gabrielle (died 1898 at Cannes), the daughter to Marquis Sampieri, and whose ashes are held behind the memorial; the second for his death as a major of 1st Life Guards, and the husband of Laura Leticia Turnor. Below this double dedication is a plaque to Laura Letitia Turnor (1872–1952).|$|E

500|$|Peniophora quercina {{produces}} spores {{which take}} {{the shape of}} a curved cylinder (sausage shaped), and have been variously reported as light red, <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> <b>white.</b> They measure from 8 to 12 by 3 to 4 micrometres (μm).

The species has hyaline cystidia with thick cell walls, which are [...] "heavily encrusted with crystalline material". The cystidia are often buried within the fruit body as it grows, but can be found in large numbers. They have been variously described as spindle-shaped or conical, and measure 25 to 35 by 10 to 15 μm. The hyphae have clamp connections, and the base of the fruit body is made up of brown hyphae with moderately thick cell walls, measuring 3 to 4 μm in width.|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, a judge {{agreed that}} the [...] "pink room scene', which shows Rihanna {{dominating}} a {{man in front of}} <b>pink</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped walls, was very similar to LaChapelle's [...] "Striped Face" [...] photograph; the judge pinpointed a scene where Rihanna is seen against a blue background, wearing pink latex and placing a sweet on her tongue." [...] Rihanna and LaChapelle settled the case out of court for an undisclosed sum. After the case, LaChapelle said the lawsuit was [...] "not personal, it's strictly business", and that [...] "musicians commonly pay to sample music or use someone's beats and there should be no difference when sampling an artist's visuals." [...] In June 2011, German photographer Philipp Paulus sued Rihanna and her record labels, alleging further copyright violations with regard to a scene in the music video where Rihanna wears an expansive dress and is taped to the wall with a plastic sheet in front of her. According to Paulus, Rihanna and Matsoukas appropriated the image from his photographic series Paperworld.|$|E
