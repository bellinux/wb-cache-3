40|$|This paper {{introduces}} nonparametric Bayesian credibility without imposing stringent parametric assumptions on claim distributions. We {{suppose that}} a claim distribution {{associated with an}} unknown risk characteristic of a policyholder is an unknown parameter vector with infinite dimension. In this way, we incorporate {{the uncertainty of the}} functional form of the claim distribution associated with the unknown risk characteristic in calculating credibility <b>premiums.</b> <b>Using</b> the results of Ferguson (1973), formulas of the Bayesian credibility premiums are obtained. The formula for the Bayesian credibility pure premium is a linear combination of the overall mean and the sample mean of the claims. This is consistent with the result in the classical credibility theory. We perform a simulation study for the nonparametric Bayesian credibility pure premiums and compare them with the corresponding Bühlmann credibility premiums.

40|$|Is {{the value}} premium predictable? We study time-variations of the {{expected}} value <b>premium</b> <b>using</b> a two-state Markov switching model. We find that when conditional volatilities are high, the expected excess returns of value stocks are more sensitive to aggregate economic conditions than the expected excess returns of growth stocks. As a result, the expected value premium is time-varying: it spikes upward in the high-volatility state, only to decline more gradually in the ensuing periods. However, out-of-sample predictability of the value premium is close to nonexistent. We study time-variations {{of the expected}} value <b>premium</b> <b>using</b> a two-state Markov switching framework with time-varying transition probabilities. In contrast to predictive regressions, in which the intercept, the slopes, and the residual volatility are all constant, the nonlinear Markov switching framework allows these estimates to vary with a single latent state variable. The nonlinear econometric framework delivers several fresh insights. First, in the high-volatility state the expected excess returns of value stocks are most sensitive, and the expected excess returns of growth stocks are least sensitive to worsening aggregate economic conditions. For example, in bivariate estimation in which we fit the Markov switching model on the value and growth portfoli...|$|R

A long-horizon analysis may provide new evidence about three key issues concerning the foreign exchange risk premium. The Þrst issue is the relation-ship between expected foreign exchange returns and expected returns on other assets. Long-horizon regressions are able to explain {{a large portion of the}} variation of foreign exchange returns using instruments that have been shown to predict domestic asset returns. I undertake a careful small-sample study to examine the size of the statistics and provide evidence of increased power. The second issue is the high variability of the foreign exchange risk <b>premium.</b> <b>Using</b> the long-horizon regression results, I show that Famas (1984) Þnding that the variability of the risk premium is greater than that of the expected change in the spot rate holds even for horizons extending out to four years and is, therefore, not the result of market frictions which would bind only in the short run. The third issue is the economic model that can explain foreign exchange risk premia.
