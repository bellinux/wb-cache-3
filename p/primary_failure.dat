40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Primary</b> ovarian <b>failure</b> {{is a rare}} disorder, and {{approximately}} 90 % of cases are of unknown etiology. The {{aim of this study}} was to search for mutations in NANOS 3, a gene that was recently related to the etiology of <b>primary</b> ovarian <b>failure,</b> in a group of Brazilian women. METHODS: We screened for NANOS 3 DNA variants in 30 consecutive women who were previously diagnosed with <b>primary</b> ovarian <b>failure,</b> of unknown etiology and compared the results with those from 185 women with normal fertility. The NANOS 3 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pairs of specific primers and then sequenced. The resulting sequences were compared with control sequences available in the National Center for Biotechnology and Information database. RESULTS: No mutations in NANOS 3 were found in <b>primary</b> ovarian <b>failure</b> patients, but four previously described polymorphisms were identified at a similar frequency in the control and <b>primary</b> ovarian <b>failure</b> groups. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in NANOS 3 were not associated with <b>primary</b> ovarian <b>failure</b> in the present cohort...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a {{distributed approach}} for monitoring and diagnosing {{the execution of}} a plan where concurrent actions are performed {{by a team of}} cooperating agents. The notions of plan diagnosis and agent diagnosis are introduced to model <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>failures</b> and the root causes of the <b>primary</b> <b>failures</b> respectively. The paper addresses the problem of diagnosing multi-agent plans when the partial observability of the status of the system does not allow to univocally determine the outcome of all the actions executed so far. In particular, we presents a methodology where the detection of the outcome of target actions activates a diagnostic process, aimed at estimating the outcome of other actions previously executed and at detecting, if any, <b>primary</b> <b>failures.</b> Such diagnostic inferences are then propagated to the other agents for determining the secondary failures. In the monitoring and diagnostic steps, the system makes use of a relational model of the actions for capturing both the nominal and the abnormal result of their execution...|$|R

This incorporates a double-swept shape that reduces the noise generation of blade-vortex interactions (BVI), a phenomenon which occurs when the blade impacts a vortex created at its tip, resulting in a 3â€“4dB noise reduction and raising the effective payload by [...] compared with a scaled Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin rotor design. Aerodynamic innovations include a biplane tailplane stabiliser for greater low speed stability, and a quieter canted fenestron which combined produce an extra 80kg of lift. The H160 {{is the first}} civilian helicopter to utilise a canted fenestron anti-torque tail rotor. The H160 will be powered by two Turbomeca Arrano turboshaft engines; a second engine, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210E, was to be offered as an alternative option, but this was eliminated due to insufficient power output and to reduce design complexity.

50|$|The term <b>primary</b> <b>failure</b> of {{eruption}} {{was named}} by Dr. William Proffit and Dr. Katherine Vig in 1981. This {{type of failure}} of eruption has a genetic or familial background precursor as a cause. The prevalence is of PFE is about 0.06% in population. In this type of failure, teeth that are non-ankylosed fail to erupt in the mouth. These teeth {{do not have a}} precursor tooth that is blocking their path. These teeth tend to erupt partially but then fail to erupt as the time goes on. Profitt stated that only the posterior teeth are the ones to be affected and all the teeth which are distal to the affected tooth are also affected. Both permanent and primary teeth may equally be affected. This often results in posterior open bite in patients mouth who have <b>primary</b> <b>failure</b> of eruption. This phenomenon can occur in any quadrant of the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{microcephaly}} shows {{a clinical}} image of craniosynostosis, {{but due to}} a different cause. The <b>primary</b> <b>failure</b> {{is the absence of}} growth of the brain, rendering the sutures of the cranial vault useless. As a consequence, the sutures close, presenting a pansynostosis like image.A differentiation between these two conditions can be made with a computed tomography (CT) scan. The subarachnoid spaces are typically enlarged with primary microcephaly, whereas they are reduced or absent in true pansynostosis.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of failure}} of {{eruption}} takes place when the affected tooth is ankylosed to the bone around it. This is different than <b>primary</b> <b>failure</b> of eruption where the affected tooth/teeth were not ankylosed. In mechanical failure of eruption, affected tooth has partial or complete loss of PDL in a panoramic radiograph and teeth distal to affected tooth do not have this condition. On a percussion test, a tooth with mechanical failure of eruption will have a dull metallic sound.|$|E

Ninety three patients were randomized to receive 75 mg/daily of clopidogrel or placebo.

The primary outcome was AVF failure eight weeks after fistula creation. With a permuted block randomization schedule, 46 patients received clopidogrel and 47 patients received control placebo. The <b>primary</b> AVF <b>failures</b> at two months were 21. 6 % in placebo group and 5. 2 % in clopidogrel group (P = 0. 03).
