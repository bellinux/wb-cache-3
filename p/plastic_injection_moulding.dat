40|$|In typical product {{development}} processes, like <b>plastic</b> <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> design, design information flow {{is not well}} supported by the current available IT systems. At different stages of a product life cycle, from documentation of requirement specifications, to conceptual design, detailed structure design and production, engineering knowledge is striped off except the bare minimum geometrical and control data, such as computer-aided design (CAD) solid models and cutting tool paths. Associative relations among engineering features are normally ignored; hence data consistency and design changes are difficult to be managed. In this paper, interfacing knowledge oriented tools and CAD application is identified as a technical gap for intelligent {{product development}}, {{and the concept of}} associative feature is introduced. For high-level reasoning and the execution of decisions, to define associative features in the form of self-contained and well-defined design objects is essential. As a case study, cooling channels in the design of <b>plastic</b> <b>injection</b> <b>moulds</b> with a CAD tool are modeled as an illustrating associative feature type. Potential integration among different applications based on such associative features is also explored...|$|R

Mould flow analysis software is used to perform the analysis of filling, wrap and best gate location. This will discuss the flow of molten <b>plastic</b> inside the <b>injection</b> <b>mould.</b> The analysis begins with the origin of the flow channels such as Barrel, nozzle, sprue, runners, and gates until the cavity is completely filled. In this analysis, plastic flow behavior is studied together with parameters settings in <b>plastic</b> <b>injection</b> <b>mould,</b> Based on the analysis improvement has been made to the part design and feed systems in the mould. This includes the location of the gate at the part design, size of sprue, runners and gates. From the analysis also, CAE helps to determine the part defects that might occurred during <b>plastic</b> <b>injection</b> molding process such as Short shot, unequal filling, over filling, welding lines and others. From that, the optimum parameters setting are selected {{in order to get a}} quality plastic. So this will explain the plastic flow analysis clearly. I...|$|R
