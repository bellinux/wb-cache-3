There were Logistics Vessels to service the rapid delivery requirements of the United States Air Force, United States Navy and Defense Logistics Agency. These included container ships for Air Force munitions, missiles and spare parts; a 500-bed hospital ship, and floating storage and offloading units assigned to Military Sealift Command supporting the Defense Logistics Agency, and an offshore petroleum discharge system (OPDS) tanker.

The {{goal of this}} research is to develop an emergency response planning tool that determines the location and quantities of various types {{of emergency}} supplies to be <b>pre-positioned,</b> under uncertainty about if, or where, a natural disaster will occur. The paper presents a two-stage stochastic mixed integer program (SMIP) that provides an emergency response <b>pre-positioning</b> strategy for hurricanes or other disaster threats. The SMIP is a robust model that considers uncertainty in demand for the stocked supplies as well as uncertainty regarding transportation network availability after an event. Due to the computational complexity of the problem, a heuristic algorithm referred to as the Lagrangian L-shaped method (LLSM) is developed to solve large-scale instances of the problem. A case study focused on hurricane threat in the Gulf Coast area of the US illustrates application of the model. <b>Pre-positioning</b> strategies L-shaped method Emergency response Stochastic program Facility location...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{increasing}} number of natural disasters {{in the last decade}} necessitates the increase in capacity and agility while delivering humanitarian relief. A common logistics strategy used by humanitarian organizations to respond this need is the establishment of <b>pre-positioning</b> warehouse networks. In the <b>pre-positioning</b> strategy, critical relief inventories are located near the regions at which they will be needed in advance of the onset of the disaster. Therefore, <b>pre-positioning</b> reduces the response time by totally or partially eliminating the procurement phase and increasing the availability of relief items just after the disaster strikes. Once the <b>pre-positioning</b> warehouse locations are decided and warehouses on those locations become operational, they will be in use for a long time. Therefore, the chosen locations should be robust enough to enable extensions, and to cope with changing trends in disaster types, locations and magnitudes. In this study, we analyze the effects of natural disaster trends on the expansion plan of <b>pre-positioning</b> warehouse network implemented by CARE International. We utilize a facility location model to identify the additional warehouse location(s) for relief items to be stored {{as an extension of the}} current warehouse network operated by CARE International, considering changing natural disaster trends observed over the past three decades...|$|R
