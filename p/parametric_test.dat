40|$|We {{describe}} a general framework for weighted <b>parametric</b> multiple <b>test</b> procedures {{based on the}} closure principle. We utilize general weighting strategies that can reflect complex study objectives and include many procedures in the literature as special cases. The proposed weighted <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> {{bridge the gap between}} rejection rules using either adjusted significance levels or adjusted p-values. This connection is possible by allowing intersection hypotheses to be tested at level smaller than α, which may be needed for certain study considerations. For such cases we introduce a subclass of exact α-level <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> which satisfy the consonance property. When only subsets of test statistics are correlated, a new procedure is proposed to fully utilize the parametric assumptions within each subset. We illustrate the proposed weighted <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> using a clinical trial example. Comment: 10 pages, 1 figure...|$|R

We consider both <b>parametric</b> and semiparametric <b>testing</b> procedures. We establish the large sample properties of both approaches. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that the <b>parametric</b> <b>tests,</b> when correctly specified, perform well but are sensitive to mis-specification of the marginal distributions. The semiparametric tests provide satisfactory overall performance, which is comparable to and sometimes superior to that of correctly-specified <b>parametric</b> <b>tests.</b> Our tests are distribution free and provide guidance on alternative copula specifications when the null hypothesis is rejected.

50|$|The wider {{applicability}} {{and increased}} robustness of non-parametric tests {{comes at a}} cost: in cases where a <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> would be appropriate, non-parametric tests have less power.

50|$|The <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> is {{accomplished}} by undertaking separate least squares analyses on two subsets of the original dataset: these subsets are specified so that the observations for which the pre-identified explanatory variable takes the lowest values are in one subset, with higher values in the other. The subsets needs not be of equal size, nor contain all the observations between them. The <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> assumes that the errors have a normal distribution. There is an additional assumption here, that the design matrices for the two subsets of data are both of full rank. The test statistic used is {{the ratio of the}} mean square residual errors for the regressions on the two subsets. This test statistic corresponds to an F-test of equality of variances, and a one- or two-sided test may be appropriate depending on whether or not the direction of the supposed relation of the error variance to the explanatory variable is known.|$|E

50|$|Permutation tests {{exist in}} many {{situations}} where parametric tests do not (e.g., when deriving an optimal test when losses are proportional {{to the size of}} an error rather than its square). All simple and many relatively complex parametric tests have a corresponding permutation test version that is defined by using the same test statistic as the <b>parametric</b> <b>test,</b> but obtains the p-value from the sample-specific permutation distribution of that statistic, rather than from the theoretical distribution derived from the parametric assumption. For example, it is possible in this manner to construct a permutation t-test, a permutation χ2 test of association, a permutation version of Aly's test for comparing variances and so on.|$|E

50|$|So {{when the}} result of a {{statistical}} analysis is said to be an “exact test” or an “exact p-value”, it ought to imply that the test is defined without parametric assumptions and evaluated without using approximate algorithms. In principle however it could also mean that a <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> has been employed in a situation where all parametric assumptions are fully met, but it is in most cases impossible to prove this completely in a real world situation. Exceptions when it is certain that parametric tests are exact include tests based on the binomial or Poisson distributions. Sometimes permutation test is used as a synonym for exact test, but although all permutation tests are exact tests, not all exact tests are permutation tests.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parametric}} Goldfeld-Quandt test {{offers a}} simple and intuitive diagnostic for heteroskedastic errors in a univariate or multivariate regression model. However some disadvantages arise under certain specifications or in comparison to other diagnostics, namely the Breusch-Pagan test, as the Goldfeld-Quandt test is somewhat of an ad hoc test. [...] Primarily, the Goldfeld-Quandt test requires that data be ordered along a known explanatory variable. The <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> orders along this explanatory variable from lowest to highest. If the error structure depends on an unknown variable or an unobserved variable the Goldfeld-Quandt test provides little guidance. Also, error variance must be a monotonic function of the specified explanatory variable. For example, {{when faced with a}} quadratic function mapping the explanatory variable to error variance the Goldfeld-Quandt test may improperly accept the null hypothesis of homoskedastic errors.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{high cost}} of testing certain analog, mixed-signal, and RF {{circuits}} has driven {{in the recent years}} the development of alternative low-cost tests to replace the most costly or even all standard specification tests. However, {{there is a lack of}} solutions for evaluating the <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> error, that is, the test error for circuits with process variations, resulting from this replacement. For this reason, test engineers are often reluctant to adopt alternative tests since it is not guaranteed that test cost reduction is not achieved at the expense of sacrificing test quality. In this paper, we present a technique to estimate the <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> error fast and reliably with parts per million accuracy. The technique is based on extreme value theory and statistical blockade.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} Granger causal {{relationship}} between government revenues and expenditures in Korea {{over the period}} 1964 to 1992. With due consideration of stationarity of the variables; selection criteria of optimal lag length; and assumptions of error structure such as normality, homoscedasticity and independence, both parametric and nonparametric tests are performed. The multiple rank F test is employed as a nonparametric test. We find {{that in order for}} the nonparametric test to be superior to the <b>parametric</b> <b>test,</b> {{at least one of the}} error structure assumptions should be violated in the <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> and at the same time all those assumptions must be satisfied in the nonparametric test.

40|$|A {{previous}} {{study indicated that}} the Wilcoxon W test showed a power advantage over the student’s t-test when they were calculated on samples drawn from a common mixed-normal distribution. The present study investigates the effect of correcting for outliers in the mixed-normal samples. The {{results indicate that the}} t-test corrected for outliers shows a superior power curve to the Wilcoxon W. Researchers and statisticians have been concerned about theconsequences of carrying out <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> on data from nonnormal populations. Mathematically, the assumption of underlying population normality is necessary for the calculated statistics to be distributed according to available tables. Concern over the effects of obvious nonnormality encountered in typical data sets has lead some researchers to use nonparametric tests that have less stringent assump-tions (Bradley, 1968). Numerous computer simulation studies, however, have shown that <b>parametric</b> <b>tests,</b> such as the F and t tests, are robust to moderate assumption violation (see Glass et al., 1972, for review). Although some researchers (Bradley, 1978, for example) have challenged their robustness, <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> continue to be used in place of nonparametric alternatives. This {{is due in part to}} the fact that <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> have been shown to be more powerful than their nonparametric counterparts (Boneau, 1962). In a recent study in this journal (Blair and Higgins, 1980), however, the nonparametric Wilcoxon W was shown to have a large power advantage over the parametric student’s t-test when they were calculated on samples drawn from a common nonnormal distribution.
