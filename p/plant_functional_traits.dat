50|$|The {{concept of}} plant {{strategies}} started gaining {{attention in the}} 1960s and 1970s. At this time, strategies were often associated with genotypic changes, such that plants could respond to their environment by changing their “genotypic programme” (i.e., strategy). Around this same time, the r/K selection theory was introduced, which classifies plants by life history strategies, particularly reproductive strategies. In general, plants alter their reproductive strategies (i.e., number of offspring) and their growth rate to respond to their ecological niche. The theory is still popular {{in the 21st century}} and frequently taught in science curricula. However, plant strategies really gained notoriety in 1977 with the introduction of Grime’s C-S-R Triangle, which categorizes plants according to how they respond under varying levels of stress and competition. According to Grime, plants develop strategies that demonstrate resource trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and maintenance. The association between genotypic change and strategies was also still present in Grime’s theories, as he noted that the “genotypes of the majority of plants appear to represent compromises between the conflicting selection pressures” that generally classify plants into three strategy types. The C-S-R Triangle remained the dominant plant strategy for several decades. However, in the early 1980s David Tilman introduced the R* theory, which focused on resource partitioning as strategies to deal with competition. More recently, additional strategies have been introduced. In 1998, the L-H-S strategy scheme was introduced as an alternative to Grime’s C-S-R scheme. The L-H-S strategy focuses on leaf and seed mass traits to classify plant strategies, noting that these traits can be measured and compared between species, which cannot easily be done with Grime’s abstract categories. The goal of the L-H-S scheme was to develop an international network that could provide quantifiable comparisons between plant strategies. This started a movement towards incorporating functional traits in plant strategies, and understanding how <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> and environmental factors are related. While Grime’s C-S-R Triangle is still frequently referenced in plant ecology, new strategies are being introduced and gaining momentum in the 21st century.|$|E
40|$|Variation in <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> and {{demographic}} behaviour in populations of widely distributed species on geographic gradients may be {{key to understanding}} their geographic range limits. Oryza rufipogon, a wild progenitor of rice, occurs in discrete wetland populations over a wide latitudinal range in China. We examined correlations between <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits,</b> latitude, longitude and climatic variables in 34 populations of O. rufipogon across its northern range limit. We also investigated the responses of individuals from all populations after transplantation to two experimental gardens: one north of its range {{and the other in}} the extreme south. Seed mass in the field was positively correlated with latitude and longitude, whereas flag-leaf area was negatively correlated with latitude; both effects could be explained largely as a response to temperature. Transplantation revealed that both plasticity and population differentiation contributed to geographic variation. All populations reproduced and overwintered in the southern garden, but in the northern garden, only populations from the northern range were able to reproduce (65 %) and survive the winter (58 %). Synthesis: Environmentally determined variation in <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> is complex, with both plastic trade-offs between traits and genetic differentiation between populations contributing to the location of the northern limit of Oryza rufipogon...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the patterns of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>trait</b> variation in relation to geomorphology, disturbance and a suite of other environmental factors in the riparian margin of the Upper Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. Vegetation was surveyed on three geomorphic surfaces (point bar, bench and bank) along a 5. 5 -km stretch of the Upper Hunter River. <b>Functional</b> <b>traits</b> relating to <b>plant</b> growth and reproduction were collected for the identified species. anova and principal components analysis were {{used to compare the}} trait assemblages of species associated with each geomorphic unit. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to investigate trait variation with respect to environmental variables. There were clear differences in the <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>trait</b> assemblages associated with the three geomorphic units. Generally the point bar was associated with species that were herbaceous, with small seed mass, a short stature and a high specific leaf area (SLA). Conversely, the bench was associated with grasses that had unassisted seed dispersal and intermediate seed mass and SLA, while species on the bank had tall stature, large seed mass, a high SLA and a perennial life cycle. Variation along the primary gradient of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>trait</b> composition was most strongly related to disturbance frequency {{and to a lesser extent}} soil nutrients and the proportion of clay and silt, while variation along the secondary gradient was associated with variation in substrate texture as well as soil nutrients. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Predicting {{climate change}} impact on {{ecosystem}} structure and services {{is one of}} the most important challenges in ecology. Until now, plant species response to climate change has been described at the level of fixed plant functional types, an approach limited by its inflexibility as there is much interspecific functional variation within plant functional types. Considering a plant species as a set of functional traits greatly increases our possibilities for analysis of ecosystem functioning and carbon and nutrient fluxes associated therewith. Moreover, recently assembled large-scale databases hold comprehensive per-species data on <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits,</b> allowing a detailed functional description of many plant communities on Earth. Here, we show that <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> can be used as predictors of vegetation response to climate warming, accounting in our test ecosystem (the species-rich alpine belt of Caucasus mountains, Russia) for 59 % of variability in the per-species abundance relation to temperature. In this mountain belt, traits that promote conservative leaf water economy (higher leaf mass per area, thicker leaves) and large investments in belowground reserves to support next year's shoot buds (root carbon content) were the best predictors of the species increase in abundance along with temperature increase. This finding demonstrates that <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> constitute a highly useful concept for forecasting changes in plant communities, and their associated ecosystem services, in response to climate change...|$|E

In this study, we fitted statistical models to explain landscape-scale variation in soil microbial community composition using data from 180 sites covering a broad range of grassland types, soil and climatic conditions in England. We found that variation in soil microbial communities was explained by abiotic factors like climate, pH and soil properties. Biotic factors, namely community- weighted means (CWM) of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits,</b> also explained variation in soil microbial communities.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of plant species and functional traits in alpine and arctic environments {{are determined by}} abiotic conditions, but also by biotic interactions. In this thesis, I investigate interactions among plants and herbivory effects on plant community composition and <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> in three different regions: Swedish Lapland, Beringia (USA/Russia) and Finnmark (Norway). Reindeer grazing {{was found to be}} extensive in southern Lapland and had limited effects on plant community composition and seedling germination. However, reindeer presence was found to influence <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits,</b> particularly in the subalpine birch forest. Tall herbs were lower and had lower SLA when reindeer were present, while small herbs showed an opposite pattern. The contrasting effects on the two herb groups are probably explained by a competitive release for small herbs when the tall herbs are suppressed by reindeer. Rodents had the largest relative impact on plant community composition in southern Lapland and {{this is consistent with the}} study from Finnmark, where rodents heavily affected dwarf shrubs on predator-free islands. With no predators present, vole densities increased profoundly and almost depleted some dwarf shrub species. These results support the idea that small mammals in arctic and alpine tundra are controlled by predators (i. e. top-down). However, a decrease in the nutritional quality in a sedge after defoliation gives support for the idea that small mammals are regulated by plant quality (i. e. bottom-up). In Beringia, small and large herbivores differed in the relation to plant community composition, since large herbivores were related to species richness and small herbivores were related to plant abundance. <b>Plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> were related only to large herbivores and standing crop of vascular plants...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in our understanding}} of the linkages between plant physiological and morphological traits suggest a new means by which to define <b>Plant</b> <b>Functional</b> Types (Φ) for use in conceptual and mathematical models of vegetation dynamics. In this study we used data from the RAINFOR-network database, aiming to numerically derive Φ for tropical forest trees by jointly analysing an Amazon-wide dataset of (409) species abundance, species <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> (10) and site edaphic and climatic conditions across 53 plots. We followed a stepwise procedure of numerical Φ definition with increasing complexity, starting from a simple PCA on species <b>functional</b> <b>traits.</b> We subsequently applied a three-table (RLQ) multivariate ordination method in two ways: with and without spatial autocorrelation between plots being taken into account. In all cases the environmental contribution to trait variation had been partialled out. Thus our results link species-specific "inherent" trait values with associated species abundances along environmental gradients. Our final classification of Amazonian tree species based on foliar dry leaf mass per area (MA), leaf concentrations of C, N, P, Ca, K, Mg, carbon isotopic discrimination (Δ), branch xylem density (ρX) and maximum tree height (Hmax) yielded four discrete Φ. These Φ were found to represent distinct life-history strategies and can be aligned with previous empirical definitions of tropical tree guilds. In particular, two ecological dimensions are identified: (1) a leaf deployment dimension which co-varies with soil fertility and (2) a stem deployment dimension which co-varies with soil texture. By analysing diameter growth rates of the same trees used to define the four Φ we found each Φ to have a different overall growth pattern. Furthermore, from a Basin-wide forest survey, differences in the relative abundance of the four Φ were related to stand level basal area growth and/or turnover rate variations. These new derived Φ should enhance our ability to better understand and model the dynamics of the Amazon forest, with the general procedure for <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>trait</b> definition described here potentially applicable to many other ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Mapping the {{distribution}} and diversity of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> is critical for projecting future changes to vegetation under global change. Maps of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits,</b> however, are scarce due very sparse global trait data matrices. A potential solution to this data limitation is to utilize the known levels of phylogenetic signal in trait data to predict missing values. Here we aim to test existing phylogenetic comparative methods for imputing missing trait data {{for the purpose of}} producing continental-scale maps of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits.</b> Location: North America and Europe. Methods: Phylogenetic imputation models and trait data from one continent were used to predict the trait values for tree species on the other continent and to produce trait maps. Predicted maps of trait means, variances and functional diversity were compared with known maps to quantify the degree to which predicted trait values could estimate spatial patterns of trait distributions and diversity. Results: We show that the phylogenetic signal in plant functional trait data can be used to provide robust predictions of the geographical distribution of tree functional diversity. However, predictions for traits with little phylogenetic signal, such as maximum height, are error prone. Lastly, trait imputation methods based on phylogenetic generalized least squares tended to outperform those based on phylogenetic eigenvectors. Main conclusions: It is possible to predict patterns of functional diversity across continental settings with novel species assemblages for most of the traits studied for which we have no direct trait information, thereby offering an effective method for overcoming a key data limitation in global change biology, macroecology and ecosystem modelling.

We located populations of the trees naturally occurring in different habitat suitability regimes (from highly suitable to poorly suitable) and evaluated them for their regeneration ability and genetic diversity. We also evaluated them for two <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits,</b> fluctuating asymmetry [...] an index of genetic homeostasis, and specific leaf weight [...] an index of primary productivity, often assumed to be good surrogates of fitness.

The over-arching conclusion of this symposium is that species composition and foraging ecology of neotropical birds have important consequences (e. g., moving seeds long distances and/or to favorable microsites seeding establishment, equalizing the abundance of common and rare seeds in seed rain, increasing genetic heterogeneity of seedling populations), which in turn are likely to shape the initial template of genetic structure among seedlings, local densities of adult <b>plants,</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> of <b>plant</b> species, and even patterns of community assembly...|$|R
40|$|Aim In {{recent years}} {{evidence}} has accumulated that plant species are differentially sorted from regional assemblages into local assemblages along local-scale environmental gradients {{on the basis}} of their function and abiotic filtering. The favourability hypothesis in biogeography proposes that in climatically difficult regions abiotic filtering should produce a regional assemblage that is less functionally diverse than that expected given the species richness and the global pool of traits. Thus it seems likely that differential filtering of plant traits along local-scale gradients may scale up to explain the distribution, diversity and filtering of plant traits in regional-scale assemblages across continents. The present work aims to address this prediction. Location North and South America. Methods We combine a dataset comprising over 5. 5 million georeferenced plant occurrence records with several large <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>trait</b> databases in order to: (1) quantify how several critical traits associated with plant performance and ecology vary across environmental gradients; and (2) provide the first test of whether the woody plants found within 1 ° and 5 ° map grid cells are more or less functionally diverse than expected, given their species richness, across broad gradients. Results The results show that, for many of the traits studied, the overall distribution of <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> in tropical regions often exceeds the expectations of random sampling given the species richness. Conversely, temperate regions often had narrower <b>functional</b> <b>trait</b> distributions than their smaller species pools would suggest.

At the establishment stage, stress-tolerance related physiology and propagation traits exert important influences. At the explosion stage, clonal characters and physiological traits related to competitive ability largely contribute to invasion success.

40|$|Aim: <b>Functional</b> <b>traits</b> {{of organisms}} {{are key to}} {{understanding}} and predicting biodiversity and ecological change, which motivates continuous collection of traits and their integration into global databases. Such trait matrices are inherently sparse, severely limiting their usefulness for further analyses. On the other hand, traits are characterized by the phylogenetic trait signal, trait–trait correlations and environmental constraints, all of which provide information {{that could be used}} to statistically fill gaps. We propose the application of probabilistic models which, for the first time, utilize all three characteristics to fill gaps in trait databases and predict trait values at larger spatial scales. Innovation For this purpose we introduce BHPMF, a hierarchical Bayesian extension of probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). PMF is a machine learning technique which exploits the correlation structure of sparse matrices to impute missing entries. BHPMF additionally utilizes the taxonomic hierarchy for trait prediction and provides uncertainty estimates for each imputation. In combination with multiple regression against environmental information, BHPMF allows for extrapolation frompoint measurements to larger spatial scales. We demonstrate the applicability of BHPMF in ecological contexts, using different <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>trait</b> datasets, also comparing results to taking the species mean and PMF. Main conclusions Sensitivity analyses validate the robustness and accuracy of BHPMF: our method captures the correlation structure of the trait matrix as well as the phylogenetic trait signal – also for extremely sparse trait matrices – and provides a robust measure of confidence in prediction accuracy for each missing entry. The combination of BHPMF with environmental constraints provides a promising concept to extrapolate traits beyond sampled regions, accounting for intraspecific trait variability. We conclude that BHPMF and its derivatives have a high potential to support future trait-based research in macroecology and functional biogeography...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Vegetation {{provides}} {{a suite of}} ecosystem functions (e. g., carbon storage) which are partially determined by the forest structure. In urbanizing regions, homeowners {{play a key role}} in shaping the structure of the urban forest because residential land is the dominant land use. As cities expand, the influence of single-family residents' land management on urban forest structure and function will increase because most new urban development is in this land use. Yet, we know little about the structure, functions, and dynamics of highly managed residential parcels. I focus on the Seattle Metropolitan Region to examine the patterns of urban forest that emerge from the interactions between biophysical factors and backyard land management attitudes of homeowners and the implications for current and future carbon storage. I use urban gradient analysis and <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>trait</b> classification systems to (1) characterize the forest structure on single-family residential lots in urban and suburban areas, (2) investigate factors associated with decisions to plant or remove trees and how these management actions have altered and will continue to transform the forest structure over time, and (3) estimate the current and future carbon storage benefits based on reported management actions and considerations. I use two <b>functional</b> <b>plant</b> <b>traits</b> [...] height potential at maturity and leaf senescence [...] selected based on their sensitivity to management decisions and for their role in controlling ecological functions (e. g., carbon cycling). Suburban parcels had more trees than those in the urban area. However, after accounting for parcel size there was no significant difference in tree densities. Compared to suburban residences, urban residential landscapes have significantly fewer trees with large size potential and more deciduous trees with small size potential. Trees with large size potential contribute the majority of the carbon storage benefits, consequently urban residential landscapes store less carbon (as aboveground plant biomass). Surprisingly, the tree planting and removal activities of residents during their tenure resulted in no significant change in tree density. However, increase in total carbon storage in suburban lots will be insignificant from the expected increase in small deciduous trees...|$|R
40|$|The biodiversity-productivity {{relationship}} {{is still under}} debate for alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. We know little about direct and indirect effects of biotic and abiotic drivers on this relationship, especially in regard to plant functional trait diversity. Here, we examine how aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) respond to climate, soil and community structure across alpine grasslands on the Northern Tibetan Plateau. We found that both ANPP and PUE showed nonlinear patterns along water availability and site altitude variation, which together accounted for 80. 3 % and 68. 8 % of variation in ANPP and PUE, respectively, by optimal generalized additive models. Functional trait divergence (FTD) and community weighted mean (CWM) of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> were as important as plant species diversity (PSD) for explaining the nonlinear productivity-climate relationship. These findings were confirmed by results from principal component analyses and structural equation models. We also found that FTD was negatively correlated with PSD across different alpine grasslands. Our results implicate: first, the combinatorial influences of temperature and precipitation gradients are important for predicting alpine grassland dynamics; second, the convergence and divergence of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> may {{have the potential to}} elucidate the effect of plant diversity on ecosystem functionality...|$|E
40|$|Premise of study: <b>Plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> are {{commonly}} used as proxies for plant responses to environmental challenges, yet few studies have explored how functional trait distributions differ across gradients of land-use change. By comparing trait distributions in intact forests with those across land-use change gradients, we can improve {{our understanding of the}} ways land-use change alters the diversity and functioning of plant communities. Methods: We examined how the variation and distribution of trait values for seven <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> differ between reference natural forest and three types of land-use conversion (pasture, old-field, or "legacy" sites-regrowth following logging), landscape productivity (NPP) and vegetation strata (tree or non-tree "understory"), in a meta-analysis of studies from 15 landscapes across five continents. Key results: Although trait variation often differed between land-uses within a landscape, these patterns were rarely consistent across landscapes. The variance and distribution of traits were more likely to differ consistently between natural forest and land-use conversion categories for understory (non-tree) plants than for trees. Landscape productivity did not significantly alter the difference in trait variance between natural forest and land-use conversion categories for any trait except dispersal. Conclusions: Our results suggest that even for traits well linked to plant environmental response strategies, broad classes of land-use change and landscape productivity are not generally useful indicators of the mechanisms driving compositional changes in human-modified forest systems...|$|E
40|$|Question: Does grazing {{by large}} herbivores affect species {{composition}} or community-wide variation in <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits?</b> Location: Dune grasslands at the Belgian coast. Methods: Plant cover and soil {{data were collected}} in 146 plots that were randomly selected at 26 grazed and ungrazed grassland sites. Plant community composition was assessed by Detrended Correspondence Analysis and mean values of plant trait categories were calculated across the plots. Results: Differentiation of plant composition and community-wide plant trait characteristics was largely determined by grazing, soil acidity and their interaction. In ungrazed situa-tions, a clear floristic distinction appears between acidic (non-calcareous) and alkaline (calcareous) grasslands. In grazed situations, these floristic differences largely disappeared, indicating that grazing results in a decrease of natural variation in species composition. At higher soil pH, a larger difference in plant community composition and community-wide plant traits was observed between grazed and ungrazed plots. In ungrazed situations, shifts in <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits</b> along the acidity gradient were observed. Conclusions: Grazing is responsible for shifts in plant com-munity composition, and hence a decrease in plant diversity among grasslands at opposing acidity conditions in coastal dune grasslands. Therefore, care should be taken when introducing grazing as a system approach for nature conservation in dune grasslands as it may eliminate {{part of the natural}} variation in plant diversity along existing abiotic gradients...|$|E
40|$|Summary <b>Plant</b> <b>functional</b> {{diversity}} and soil microbial community composition are tightly coupled. Changes in these interactions may influence ecosystem functioning. Links between <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> diversity, soil microbial communities and ecosystem functioning {{have been demonstrated}} in experiments using plant monocultures and mixtures, using broad <b>plant</b> and microbial <b>functional</b> groups, but have not been examined in diverse natural plant communities. We quantified the relative effects of <b>plant</b> and microbial <b>functional</b> properties on key ecosystem functions. We measured <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> diversity, soil microbial community composition and parameters associated with nitrogen (N) cycling and key nutrient cycling processes at three grassland sites {{in different parts of}} Europe. Because plant structure and function strongly influence soil microbial communities, we determined relationships between ecosystem properties, plant traits and soil community characteristics following a sequential approach in which plant traits were fitted first, followed by the additional effects of soil micro-organisms. We identified a continuum from standing green biomass and standing litter, linked mostly with plant traits, to potential N mineralization and potential leaching of soil inorganic N, linked mostly with microbial properties. <b>Plant</b> and microbial <b>functional</b> parameters were equally important in explaining % organic matter content in soil. A parallel continuum ran from plant height, linked with above-ground biomass, to plant quality effects captured by the leaf economics spectrum, which were linked with the recycling of carbon (C) and N. More exploitative species (higher specific leaf area, leaf N concentrations and lower leaf dry matter content) and taller swards, along with soil microbial communities dominated by bacteria, with rapid microbial activities, were linked with greater fodder production, but poor C and N retention. Conversely, dominance by conservative species (with opposite traits) and soil microbial communities dominated by fungi, and bacteria with slow activities, were usually linked with low production, but greater soil C storage and N retention.

40|$|Galapagos is {{a natural}} {{laboratory}} offering {{a great opportunity to}} study <b>plants</b> <b>functional</b> <b>traits.</b> This study characterises morphological and ecophysiological responses of Croton scouleri, an endemic tree that habits from humid and upper elevations to semiarid lowlands, throughout an altitudinal gradient and in a manipulative experiment. Croton scouleri trees were gradually smaller with less total leaf area due to a gradual reduction in mean leaf size, and they folded their leaves at lower elevations. These results were also recorded after cutting every deep root. Two physiological traits that allowed Croton scouleri to avoid damages to the photosynthetic apparatus were detected between 30 and 150 m a. s. l. Lower variable fluorescence (Fv) and basal fluorescence (F 0) keeping constant maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) denoted a drop in chlorophyll concentration. Concomitantly, the recorded increase in the Quantum efficiency of PSII (PSII) with similar Fv/Fm means that Croton scouleri could be using cyclic electron transport as photoprotective mechanism. On the other hand, a deep root system to reach the water table allowed Croton scouleri to behave as a drought-avoider, which was reflected in: (1) unvarying water status Leaf Water Content and Relative Water Content were always higher than 69 and 58 %, respectively; (2) stable and low photoinhibition levels; and (3) unvarying leaf area index. However, Croton scouleri was not able to avoid drought at altitudes lower 30 m a. s. l. where similar responses to those recorded after root cutting were recorded. Junta de Andalucía AI 60 / 0...|$|R
