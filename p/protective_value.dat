Methods: In an experimental study, 32 rabbits were randomly designated into four diet groups: normal diet, high cholesterol diet (1 %), high cholesterol diet plus 5 % (w/w) dill powder and high cholesterol diet plus lovastatin (10 mg/kg, bw). The concentrations of glucose, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoproteins-cholesterol (LDL-C), alanine aminotransferase (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), fibrinogen, factor VII, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), nitrite and nitrate were measured in blood samples following 15 h of fasting and 3 h after feeding. Results: Concurrent use of A. graveolens powder or lovastatin significantly decreased ALT, TC, glucose, fibrinogen and LDL-C values in comparison with hypercholesterolemic diet group (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Themes such as “effectiveness” and “evidence-based practice” {{dominate}} current {{debates about}} {{and within the}} professional field of youth care. The field seems to focus almost solely {{on the effectiveness of}} interventions and policy measures and {{there appears to be a}} general consensus on the objectivity and neutrality of interventions, policy measures and of the effectiveness research that follows from it. However, child rearing—including the professional re-education of children— entails more than encouraging desired behavior and correcting inappropriate behavior. It also includes normative ideas about this desired behavior and about issues like “good parenting” and “healthy development”. Although no one would argue that effectiveness issues are a mere detail, the assessment and evaluation of interventions and policy measures on effectiveness only, leaves these normative matters undiscussed. The research presented in this dissertation aims at unraveling this “hidden curriculum” of both youth care interventions and youth policy measures, by analyzing and clarifying the role values may play in this specific professional field. Five case studies have been conducted, each consisting of content analysis of relevant documents (i. e. articles about an intervention, policy reports), and of interviews and observations. The results of these case studies show that values are indeed expressed in youth care interventions and in youth policy measures. In contrast to the claims of objectivity and neutrality, interventions and policy measures convey specific value perspectives. In general <b>protective</b> <b>values,</b> such as security or achievement, are expressed in all of the five case studies. Some interventions combine these <b>protective</b> <b>values</b> with growth-oriented values, for instance self-direction or hedonistic values. Others combine them with values such as conformity, indicating a conservative value perspective. Differences were found between the values expressed in the theory of an intervention and the values expressed in the actual practice of an intervention. This may indicate that personal, professional or institutional values may play a role in executing an intervention. The results also seem to imply that cultural values may have some influence on the execution of an intervention. For youth policy, differences in values are mainly found between the social groups the policy measures intent to target. Overall, the results are indicative of values aimed at socialization and integration of children and families in existing social structures and norms. The results have important implications for the professional field of youth care and the research conducted in it. Differences between values in the theory and in the practice of an intervention imply that it may serve effectiveness research to pay attention to the subject of values: Professionals may struggle with the implicit values of an intervention and may adapt the intervention to better suit the values they believe are important. Likewise, fall out of clients during treatment may be explained by a discrepancy between the implicit values of an intervention and the personal values of parents and children. Moreover, the results of this research may foster a debate about the position of the professional field of youth care and the role they foresee for themselves within society...|$|R

Normal and one week acute diabetic rats were either exposed to 60 (H 60) and 180 (H 180) min of hyperoxia or exposed to normal atmospheric air (21 % O 2). Then hearts were isolated immediately and subjected to 30 min of regional ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Infarct size, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, enzymes release and ischemia induced arrhythmias were determined. Heart of diabetic control rats had less infarct size and decreased LDH and CK-MB release compared to normal hearts. 60 and 180 min of hyperoxia reduced myocardial infarct size and enzymes release in normal hearts. 180 min of hyperoxia also decreased cardiomyocytes apoptosis in normal state.

With antipneumococcus rabbit serum evidence of marked differences in the specifically reactive antibodies is not so evident. Although the results of these experiments were quite definite it seemed desirable to confirm the findings by some independent procedure. The most convincing confirmation would, of course, be the actual isolation of these various antibody substances. The present paper reports the results of attempts to isolate the specific antibodies of Type I antipneumococcus sera.

Thus, we addressed the question in the mouse model how the Th 1 /Th 2 bias of primed immune responses by a DNA vaccine influences hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance.

This study was aimed at assessing the long term efficacy and safety of a double-boosted protease inhibitor combination, fosamprenavir (fAVP) and atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) in a cohort of HIV-infected children and adolescents who had failed with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Methods Seven vertically infected children and adolescents who had previously failed {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} and were resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, received a dual protease inhibitor (PI) regimen including fAVP plus ATV/r for 42 months. The patients were assessed at baseline, every month for the first 24 weeks of therapy and every 3 months until month 32. Physical examination, CD 4 + cell count, HIV-RNA viral load, lipid profile and hepatic function were assessed throughout the follow up. Results During the study no serious adverse events were reported. CD 4 absolute number increased over-time in all subjects. At baseline the median HIV-RNA was 6562 cp/mL (ranging 1048 - 102772 cp/mL) and rapidly decreased below the limit of detection (50 cp/mL) after 2 months of the new treatment and remained undetectable in all cases through the entire study period. At the beginning of the study all cases showed a normal lipid profile. During the study period, 4 / 7 subjects showed total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels > 97 th cent. le for the males and 94 th cent. le for the females. HDL cholesterol showed <b>protective</b> <b>values.</b> Hepatic enzymes remained stable during the entire observation, whereas total bilirubin showed toxicity II/III grade in 6 / 7 subjects.
