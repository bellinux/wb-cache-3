50|$|A devil's claw {{is often}} used on {{merchant}} ships because it is lighter and easier to manage than other types of chain stoppers, such as a <b>pelican</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>pelican</b> <b>hook</b> is a {{piece of}} {{nautical}} rigging hardware composed of a hinged link held closed by a circumferential link capable of being released under load. Small examples are held closed by hand while the retaining link is displaced while larger examples are hit with a hammer or sledge hammer to release. The asymmetric appearance of the two hinged pieces is similar in appearance to a pelican's beak. It is frequently used to secure ships' anchors and life raft canisters but has many other applications.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1965, she was {{assigned}} to the [...] "Market Time" [...] operation along the coast of Vietnam, that was designed to interdict enemy infiltration and coastwise logistics operations. A South Vietnamese Navy patrol boat, RVNS PC-04, had caught an enemy [...] "trawler" [...] unloading weapons at Vung Ro, South Vietnam and there was growing concern with enemy coastal traffic. In July 1965, Tillamook entered Vung Ro about midnight based on reports from her Vietnamese liaison that a RVN outpost had been captured by the VC, the idea being to use Tillmook's 3 inch 50 single gun to attack the outpost. After slinking quietly in the cove, the Captain ordered the First Lieutenant to anchor, whereupon the First lieutenant opened the wrong <b>pelican</b> <b>hook,</b> sending the spare anchor splashing into the sea. With that, Tillamoook departed the cove without firing.|$|E
