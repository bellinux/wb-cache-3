50|$|FK Sarajevo is a {{registered}} Private company limited by guarantee and corporate personhood that, unlike football clubs that are registered as limited companies, does not issue shares by which individuals or corporations can buy majority or minority ownership. Instead, the club's members act as guarantors by buying non-ownership based management stakes {{in the form of}} contributions, earning in return managing and voting rights. The guarantors give an undertaking to contribute a nominal amount in the event of the winding up of the company. It is often believed that such a company cannot distribute its profits to its members but, depending on the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>articles,</b> {{as is the case with}} FK Sarajevo, it very well may. Managing rights imply the right to form and control the club assembly, steering committee and Supervisory Board, by which the largest contributor de jure takes full control of the club. Furthermore, the fact that the largest contributor may negotiate profit provisions between himself and the club opens the possibility for large-scale financial investment that exceeds charitable and non-profit contributions that are usually the cornerstone of companies limited by guarantee.|$|E

For answers to these questions, many international tribunals now rely on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties [VCLT]. This paper discusses a fundamental question about the structure of the VCLT, a question that, remarkably, has received virtually no explicit attention. What is the rationale of the distinction between Article 31 (“General rule of interpretation”) and Article 32 (“Supplementary means of interpretation”) ? Why are there are two separate Articles here, and how do they differ? As we shall see, the two Articles contemplate very different uses for the materials they identify, and that is the key to deciding which materials come under which Article. Understanding the rationale for the distinction between the Articles is essential to understanding particular <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles,</b> such as 31. 3 (c).
