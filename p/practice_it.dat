5|$|After the {{graduation}} of running backs Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with Morgan Green for the starting position. At {{the conclusion of}} spring <b>practice,</b> <b>it</b> appeared they would share the duties, as they had complementary running styles: Scott had breakaway speed, while Green was a hard runner for short-yardage gains. However, Green suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} used system for classifying the severity of croup is the Westley score. It is primarily used for research purposes rather than in clinical <b>practice.</b> <b>It</b> {{is the sum of}} points assigned for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis, stridor, air entry, and retractions. The points given for each factor is listed in the adjacent table, and the final score ranges from 0 to 17.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation that rejected Papal authority and {{many aspects of}} Catholic theology and <b>practice.</b> <b>It</b> created a predominately Calvinist national church, known as the kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy and would be important in establishing and funding schools. There was also a shift from emphasis on ritual to one on the word, making the Bible, {{and the ability to}} read the Bible, fundamental to Scottish religion.|$|E

5|$|Marks of cadency are {{generally}} not used with crests, {{though it is not}} incorrect to do so, and the British royal family continue this <b>practice.</b> <b>It</b> is, however, widely observed in England that no two families may use the same crest. This is in contrast to Scottish practice, in which crests are less significant, and are often borne in the same form by a great many unrelated people. As a result of this lack of need for differentiation, Scottish crests tend to be less ornamental than their English counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Number 88 Squadron was a {{new unit}} {{and part of the}} {{expansion}} schemes of the late 1930s designed {{to increase the number of}} aircraft in response to the threat of the German Luftwaffe. He joined the squadron on 6 December 1937 and it was re-equipped with the Fairey Battle. He flew the aircraft for the first time on 30 December. On 1 March 1938 his commission as pilot officer was confirmed and in May 1938 he joined the No. 7 Armament Training Station in Northumberland to engage in formation flying, aerial gunnery and bombing <b>practice.</b> <b>It</b> also practiced mock attacks on the British Army 2nd Infantry Division. By the time war broke out in September 1939, MacLachlan had two years of experience of flying the machine.|$|E
5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in <b>practice</b> <b>it</b> {{is unlikely that}} an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{accession}} of Tiberius, Drusus {{had been}} systematically groomed as the successor of his father, successfully commanding legions in Illyricum in AD 18, and sharing the consulship with Tiberius in AD 21. In <b>practice</b> <b>it</b> was still Sejanus {{who was the}} second man in the empire and he was ambitious to further expand his power. As early as AD 20, Sejanus had sought to solidify his connection with the imperial family, by betrothing his daughter Junilla to the son of Claudius, Claudius Drusus. At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage was prevented, when the boy accidentally died {{a few days later}} of asphyxiation.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during <b>practice.</b> <b>It</b> employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E
5|$|The first updated Mk. V sets {{arrived in}} April 1942 and were fitted to the de Havilland Mosquito as they became available. A Mk. V {{equipped}} Mosquito claimed its first kill on 24/25 June, when a Mosquito NF.II from No. 151 Squadron shot down a Dornier Do 217E-4 over the North Sea. In <b>practice</b> <b>it</b> {{was found that}} pilots had considerable difficulty {{looking up from the}} display at the last minute, and the system was used only experimentally. By this time the microwave units had started to arrive in small numbers, so Mk. V production was repeatedly delayed pending their arrival, and eventually cancelled.|$|E

5|$|The launch, which {{occurred}} in pre-dawn darkness, {{was the first}} American night launch since Apollo 17, and was watched by several thousand spectators. The unusual launching time was due to tracking requirements for the primary payload, INSAT-1B; the program would not have another night launch until STS-61-B in 1985. The crew had attempted to prepare for it by training in darkened simulators so as to keep their night vision, but in <b>practice</b> <b>it</b> was discovered that {{the light of the}} solid-fuel rocket boosters made the immediate area around the launchpad virtually as bright as a day launch.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In <b>practice,</b> <b>it</b> would seem that the side sheets made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|E
5|$|The sejm {{comprised}} two chambers, {{with varying}} numbers of deputies. After the 1569 Union of Lublin, the Kingdom of Poland {{was transformed into}} the federation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the numbers of sejm participants were significantly increased with {{the inclusion of the}} deputies from Lithuanian sejmiks. The deputies had no set term of office, although in <b>practice</b> <b>it</b> was about four months long, from their election at a regional sejmik, to their report on the next sejmik dedicated to hearing and discussing the previous sejm's proceedings (those sejmiks were known as relational or debriefing). Deputies had parliamentary immunity and any crimes against them were classified as lèse-majesté.|$|E

5|$|The sticky {{bomb was}} a glass flask filled with {{nitroglycerin}} and given an adhesive coating {{allowing it to}} be glued to a passing vehicle. In theory, it could be thrown, but in <b>practice</b> <b>it</b> would most likely need to be placed—thumped against the target with sufficient force to stick—requiring courage and good fortune to be used effectively. An order for one million sticky bombs was placed in June 1940, but various problems delayed their distribution in large numbers until early 1941, {{and it is likely}} that fewer than 250,000 were produced.|$|E
5|$|Veltmann {{scored a}} {{victory at the}} {{beginning}} of his defense: he moved and was granted that each officer's testimony could only be applied to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work. In principle, this ruling was favorable, but in <b>practice</b> <b>it</b> would only benefit the men if the court had been attentively keeping notes for each accused man. Instead, reporters observed the court to be drowsy at times, with one particular judge regularly nodding off.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in <b>practice</b> <b>it</b> has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E

5|$|A third recension was {{probably}} compiled {{during the reign}} of HenryI and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a book of German liturgy compiled in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental <b>practice.</b> <b>It</b> remained in use until the coronation of EdwardII in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ordo focussed on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings. One manuscript of this recension is the Liber Regalis at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.|$|E
