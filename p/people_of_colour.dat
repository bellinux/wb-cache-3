5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour.</b> He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Black Lives Matter was {{selected}} by Pride Toronto as the honoured group in that year's Pride parade, during which they staged a sit-in to block the parade from moving forward for approximately half an hour. They issued a number of demands for Pride to adjust its relationship with LGBTQ <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> including stable funding and a suitable venue for the established Blockrama event, improved diversity in the organization's staff and volunteer base, and most famously that Toronto Police officers be banned from marching in the parade in uniform. Pride executive director Mathieu Chantelois signed BLM's statement of demand, but later asserted that he had signed it only to end the sit-in and get the parade moving, and had not agreed to honour the demands.|$|E

25|$|Louis XIV's Code Noir {{regulated}} {{the slave}} trade and institution in the colonies. It gave unparalleled rights to slaves. It includes the right to marry, gather publicly, or take Sundays off. Although the Code Noir authorized and codified cruel corporal punishment against slaves under certain conditions, it forbade slave owners to torture them or to separate families. It also forced the owners to instruct them in the Catholic faith, implying that Africans were human beings endowed with a soul, a fact that was not seen as evident until then. It resulted in a far higher percentage of blacks being free in 1830 (13.2% in Louisiana compared to 0.8% in Mississippi). They were on average exceptionally literate, with {{a significant number of}} them owning businesses, properties, and even slaves. Other free <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> such as Julien Raimond, spoke out against slavery.|$|E
25|$|Between 1780–1867, over 780 000 {{slaves were}} brought to Cuba. This was {{more than all the}} rest of Spanish America combined. Slavery was leaned upon heavily by the owners of the highly {{profitable}} sugar plantations. By 1886, <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> – the majority being ex-slaves – made up 1/3 of the population of Cuba. The issue of integration was a complex and highly contentious issue. Rights were hard to come by for many former slaves and also for those who lived and worked in rural communities. Emancipation was a slow process that started in 1868 and continued until 1886. As a preliminary step, the Moret Law of 1870 granted freedom to children and those over the age of sixty but offered little else. As the skirmishes continued and losses compounded during the 10 Years’ War, the anti-colonial forces spoke more openly about the idea of a free Cuban citizen. Even though there was still a strong racial divide, many slaves joined up with the revolutionaries. Although this initial rebellion did not force any significant changes, the participation of slaves did not go unnoticed. By the early 1890s, Spain was willing to offer fairly considerable civil rights and voting rights to many former slaves in a vain attempt to weaken another attempt at rebellion. Prior to the 1890s, suffrage had been granted uniquely to taxpayers (it was further expanded in 1895 and again in 1898 when all links between property and suffrage were severed). This back-fired, however, as it only provoked white elites who intensified their criticism directed at colonial policies.|$|E

500|$|The {{widespread}} {{interest in}} women's writing {{is related to}} a general reassessment and expansion of the literary canon. Interest in post-colonial literatures, gay and lesbian literature, writing by <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups {{has resulted in a}} whole scale expansion of what is considered [...] "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as [...] "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.

500|$|Using {{techniques}} of the genre of alternative history, Clarke creates events and characters {{that would have been}} impossible in the early nineteenth century. She also explores the [...] "silencing" [...] of under-represented groups: women, <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> and poor whites. Both Strange and Norrell suppress the voices of these groups in their rise to power. Mr Norrell, for example, attempts to buy up all the books of magic in England to keep anyone else from acquiring their knowledge. He also barters away half of Emma Wintertowne's (Lady Pole's) life for political influence, a deal about which, due to an enchantment, she cannot speak coherently.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{explores the}} limits of [...] "English" [...] magic through the {{characters}} of Stephen Black and Vinculus. As Clarke explains, [...] "If you put a fairy next {{to a person who}} is also outside English society...suddenly {{the fact that there is}} this alien race seems more believable, because you've got another alien and the two of them can talk about the English in this very natural way." [...] The gentleman with the thistle-down hair sees Stephen as a noble savage and enslaves him—like Lady Pole, Stephen is silenced. Both [...] "suffer under a silencing spell that mimics gaps in the historical record". Furthermore, the gentleman's desire to acquire Stephen for his dancing hall is reminiscent of the English objectification of black slaves. Stephen vows to hate all white Englishmen after he discovers that they enslaved his mother, but when the gentleman shows him the hanging of the white Vinculus, he weeps. Both Strange and Norrell see the essence of Englishness in the Raven King, a character who was raised by fairies and could not speak English. As Elizabeth Hoiem explains, [...] "The most English of all Englishmen, then, is both king and slave, in many ways indistinguishable from Stephen Black. This paradox is what ultimately resolves the plot. When Strange and Norrell summon 'the nameless slave', the Raven King's powerful alliances with nature are transferred to Stephen Black, allowing Stephen to kill the Gentleman and free himself from slavery." [...] In the end, it is Strange and Norrell who are trapped in everlasting darkness while the silenced women, <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> and poor whites defeat the antagonist.|$|E

40|$|It is my {{contention}} that notions of privilege {{as well as}} issues of oppression must be explored if we take the idea of antiracism education seriously. In other words, with my students—most of whom are ‘white’—I endeavour to invert the gaze and to explore the profound social consequences that the construction of whiteness holds for Indigenous <b>peoples</b> and <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour.</b> However, given that whiteness is more than about skin colour and is, moreover, socially, politically and culturally located, how does whiteness manifest itself within different cultural contexts? What are the differences? Where are the similarities? What do they mean? What are the implications for pedagogy? These questions and others have concerned me {{for some time and}} form the basis of on-going research with various groups of Teacher Education students, both in Australia and Germany. My findings within these contexts indicate that education has a crucial role to play in anti-racism education but that {{it is not enough to}} simply discuss white race privilege and hope for the best. In fact, based on my research I would suggest that such an approach can be counter-productive and lead to ‘guilt, fear and alienation’.
