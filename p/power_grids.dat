25|$|Rapid City's {{location}} on the boundary of the Western and Eastern <b>power</b> <b>grids,</b> together with the hydroelectric plants of the Mainstem Dams on the Missouri River and the large coal fields and power plants of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming make {{it one of the}} points where the two national <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> connect with each other, allowing switching of electrical power from east to west and vice versa. Rapid City previously had its own coal-fired power plant before Federal regulations forced it and many other coal plants in the area such as power stations near Gillette, Wyoming, to shut down. The Ben French power station located within city boundaries shut down September 2012, more than 2 years ahead of its scheduled shut down. Rapid City now obtains much of its power from both the Missouri dams and importing it from elsewhere. Electrical rates used to be considered relatively low until the shut down of the coal plants, so have progressively climbed the last several years as a lack of local power sources means massive expenses to import it from greater distances.|$|E
25|$|Some {{economic}} {{experts have}} argued that the development gap between China and other emerging economies such as Brazil, Argentina and India can be attributed to a large extent to China's early focus on ambitious infrastructure projects: while China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most emerging economies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks (poor transportation networks, aging <b>power</b> <b>grids,</b> mediocre schools...).|$|E

Existing preconditioned iterative methods that require in-complete matrix factorizations can not be effectively accel-erated on GPU due to its limited hardware resource as well as data parallel computing. This work presents an efficient GPU-based multigrid preconditioning algorithm for robust <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> analysis. An ELL-like sparse matrix data struc-ture is adopted and implemented specifically for <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> analysis to assure coalesced GPU device memory access and high arithmetic intensity. By combining the fast geometrical multigrid solver with the robust Krylov-subspace iterative solver, <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> DC and transient analysis can be per-formed efficiently on GPU without loss of accuracy (largest errors < 0. 5 mV). Unlike previous GPU-based algorithms that rely on good <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> regularities, the proposed algo-rithm can be applied for more general <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> structures.
