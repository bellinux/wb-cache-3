Common design denominator of all projects regardless of scale is the impetus to emphasize components and hardware of each designed product by careful application of color, innovative detailing {{and use of}} ordinary materials. At first look, every designed product - an urban design project, a small-size, renovated interior space or storage unit - displays its prominent parts. Details of an industrial plant with hundreds of squaremeters of area or aluminum <b>plate,</b> <b>bolt,</b> washer and nut holding doors of a small storage unit all brought together meticulously.|$|E
50|$|The M1919A6 {{first saw}} combat {{service in the}} fall of 1943. It had a metal {{buttstock}} assembly that clamped to the backplate of the gun, and a front barrel bearing that incorporated both a muzzle booster and a bipod similar to that used on the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). A lighter barrel than that of the M1919A4 was fitted, and a carry handle was attached to the barrel jacket {{to make it easier to}} carry. Previous designs could change the barrel, but it required field stripping the gun - the pistol grip back <b>plate,</b> <b>bolt</b> group and the trigger group all had to be removed before the barrel could finally be replaced, and this put the gun out of action for minutes, and risked losing and damaging parts in the field. The M1919A6 muzzle device allowed the gun crew to replace the barrel from the front, an improvement, but still an awkward procedure compared to other machine guns of the day.The M1919A6 was a heavy (32 lb) and awkward weapon in comparison with the MG34 (26 lb) and MG42 (25 lb) and was eventually replaced in US service by the M60 machine gun in the 1960s.|$|E
40|$|A {{validated}} Von-Mises stress-based {{model is}} presented for multi-axial fatigue evaluation of clamped sheet metal joints that {{are subjected to}} a cyclic bending stress additional to the compressive bearing stress in the bolted joint. Joint material, bolt preload level, and the amplitude level of the cyclic bending moment are studied for their effect on the fatigue life of the clamped sheet metal <b>plate.</b> <b>Bolt</b> tightening to a precise preload level is accomplished by using an ultrasonic instrument that has been mechanically pre-calibrated to convert the time delay of longitudinal ultrasonic wave reflection to a bolt elongation and corresponding preload value. Fatigue data is generated using an MTS fatigue testing system. Experimental and FEA results are fitted into a multi-axial model for predicting the fatigue behavior of the bolted joint. Discussion and data analysis are provided...|$|E

40|$|Aiming to {{effectively}} recognize train center <b>plate</b> <b>bolt</b> loss faults, {{this paper presents}} an improved fault detection method. A multi-scale local binary pattern operator containing the local texture information of different radii is designed to extract more efficient discrimination information. An improved teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm is established to optimize the classification results in the decision level. Two new phases including the worst recombination phase and the cuckoo search phase are incorporated to improve {{the diversity of the}} population and enhance the exploration. In the worst recombination phase, the worst solution is updated by a crossover recombination operation to prevent the premature convergence. The cuckoo search phase is adopted to escape the local optima. Experimental results indicate that the recognition accuracy is up to 98. 9 % which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed detection method...|$|E

40|$|Public Power District was {{not able}} to fully inspect 50 % of the core <b>plate</b> rim {{hold-down}} <b>bolts</b> at Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) in accordance with BWRVIP- 25 (Reference). BWRVIP- 25 requires that 50 % of the core <b>plate</b> rim hold-down <b>bolts</b> of BWR/ 2 - 5 plants without repair wedges be examined by enhanced VT- 1 from below the core plate (or by UT from above core plate once the technique is developed). However, it was determined that the bolts cannot be inspected by UT due to configuration issues and it has recently been concluded that an EVT- 1 exam does not provide meaningful results. Accordingly, a technical justification for deviation from the BWRVIP guidance was developed. The technical justification demonstrates that the core <b>plate</b> <b>bolts</b> have a relatively low susceptibility to cracking based on field experience and fabrication practices. In addition, should cracking occur in some bolts, the consequences are mitigated by redundancy in the bolting and associated alignment hardware. Finally, even with the extremely conservative assumptions of failures of both the bolting and the redundant hardware, the Standby Liquid Control system could be used to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown. The BWRVIP is currently working on developing revised guidance for the core <b>plate</b> <b>bolts</b> an...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{system of}} a steel <b>plate</b> <b>bolted</b> to a Reinforced Concrete (RC) shear wall {{goes by the}} name of a ‘Composite Steel Plate Shear Wall’ (CSPSW), which is used as the lateral {{resisting}} system in tall buildings. In this system, the steel plate buckles under medium-strong earthquakes, which may lead to instability. However, the buckling load of steel plates is usually a limited criterion for the design of CSPSW. This paper reports a series of experiments on CSPSW. The experiments were used to investigate the buckling load of a steel <b>plate</b> <b>bolted</b> to one side of a high strength reinforced concrete panel. Furthermore, theoretical modeling, based on energy methods, was used to obtain the elastic buckling coefficients of steel plates with various aspect ratios under shear loading. The results were presented in graphical and tabular forms showing good agreement of theoretical modeling with experimental results. The elastic buckling coefficients can be used for determination of the number of bolts or the spacing between the bolts...|$|R
