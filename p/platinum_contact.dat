For parallel photo-conductivity measurements, the Si-ncs/P 3 HT blend was coated on interdigitated <b>platinum</b> <b>contact</b> evaporated on glass [5]. For perpendicular measurements, the Si-ncs/P 3 HT blend was incorporated into the TiO 2 nanotubes and covered on top by a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrode, which was spin-coated with poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), to form TCO/PEDOT:PSS/(Si-ncs/P 3 HT)/TiO 2 -NTs device.

40|$|AbstractPlasma {{electrochemical}} oxidation (PEO) of titanium foils {{is the key}} step {{in the production of}} platinum/TiO 2 /Ti sandwich structures that can be used as hydrogen sensors. If a voltage is applied between the <b>platinum</b> <b>contact</b> and the supporting Ti foil, the structures indicate current–voltage curves that depend on the H 2 concentration in air. The sensing mechanism, based on catalytic oxidation of H 2 and hydrogen doping of TiO 2, is fast and reversible in a broad temperature regime. Particularly the devices can operate at room-temperature and hence do not require an additional heating. A suitable porosity enables a high surface area combined with a good accessibility of the reacting H 2 and O 2. Thermal stability is mandatory because catalytic heat is released during sensor operation at higher concentrations of hydrogen. Another important feature of the sandwich structures concerns the mechanical and electrical stability of the oxide film since the operation voltages are typically in a range of ± 10 V. Our structural study serves as an important contribution towards an understanding of the interplay between process parameters and sensor properties...|$|E

40|$|While {{the use of}} {{iridium oxide}} {{electrodes}} for neuronal stimulation and pH sensing is con-tinuously increasing, ruthenium oxide is a material less familiar in biomedicine. However, ruthenium oxide deposited by reactive sputtering glass or ceramic substrate with a <b>platinum</b> <b>contact</b> layer is shown to yield sensors well suitable for a extracellular recording of cell-mediated pH changes in cell culture media. Ruthenium oxide was directly grown with MCF 7 and L 929 cells and is fully biocompatible. The pH sensitivity ranges between 52 and 58 mV/pH, it is approximately linear between pH 5. 5 and pH 11. The drift typically ranges between 1 and 2 mV h 1. With increasing thickness of the ruthenium oxide layer, drift decreases and response time increases. A practicable tradeoff is a thickness of 12 µm. A pronounced redox cross-sensitivity of ruthenium oxide is a limiting factor in situations where concentration of dissolved oxygen is not constant or cannot be determined indepen-dently.

More precisely, each detector array is a hybrid of a CdZnTe photodetector array and an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) containing an array of amplifiers in the same pixel pattern {{as that of the}} detectors. The array is fabricated on a single crystal of CdZnTe having dimensions of 23. 6 by 12. 9 by 2 mm. The detector-array cathode is a monolithic <b>platinum</b> <b>contact.</b> On the anode plane, the contact metal is patterned into the aforementioned pixel array, surrounded by a guard ring that is 1 mm wide on three sides and is 0. 1 mm wide on the fourth side so that two such detector arrays can be placed side-by-side to form a roughly square sensor area with minimal dead area between them. Figure 1 shows two anode patterns. One pattern features larger pixel anode contacts, with a 30 -m gap between them. The other pattern features smaller pixel anode contacts plus a contact for a shaping electrode {{in the form of a}} grid that separates all the pixels. In operation, the grid is held at a potential intermediate between the cathode and anode potentials to steer electric charges toward the anode in order to reduce the loss of charges in the inter-anode gaps. The CdZnTe photodetector array is mechanically and electrically connected to the ASIC (see Figure 2), either by use of indium bump bonds or by use of conductive epoxy bumps on the CdZnTe array joined to gold bumps on the ASIC.

30|$|Porous silicon layers were {{obtained}} by electrochemical anodization of p-type boron-doped crystalline silicon wafers, with an orientation of (100) and resistivity of 10 to 20 Ω cm, in a hydrofluoric acid 50 % and N,N dimethylformamide electrolyte solution in proportions of 1 : 9 in volume. The galvanostatic process was carried out for 1, 800 s using a 10 -mA/cm 2 current density in darkness. A Teflon®anodization cell with <b>platinum</b> <b>contact</b> as the cathode and the silicon wafer as the anode was used. Aluminium 99.99 % was evaporated as a backside contact of the Si wafer to improve {{the distribution of the}} current density in the anodization stage and to achieve an ohmic contact on the backside of the silicon substrate. Prior to the FTO deposition, some samples were oxidized in a rapid thermal annealing furnace. This oxidation was carried out at atmospheric pressure using a two-step process: (1) 450 °C for 10 min followed by (2) 550 °C for 30 min. The FTO, the n-type region in our devices, was fabricated starting from a synthesized precursor in order to get tin oxide by the sol-gel method [26]. Subsequently, with this precursor, we proceeded with the deposition of a layer of SnO 2 :F using a spray pyrolysis method [27]. The deposition temperature was set at 380 °C, and it was controlled within ± 2 °C. The deposited thickness was about 900 nm with 20 min deposition. In this way, two types of heterojunctions were fabricated: Al/c-Si/PS/SnO 2 :F (abbreviated in the following as PS/FTO) and Al/c-Si/PS/SiOx/SnO 2 :F (abbreviated as PS/Ox/FTO). The J-V measurements were performed in a sandwich configuration using a Keithley 6487 digital picoammeter/voltage source (Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA). The voltage was applied between the top FTO contact and the ohmic back contact. For forward bias, the ohmic back contact was grounded, and the FTO contact was biased negatively. The photoresponse of the device was measured by illuminating the sample with a halogen MR 16 lamp with a light intensity of 110 mW/cm 2. A set of optical density (OD) filters was used to obtain different illumination intensities from 110 mW/cm 2 (OD = 0) to 1.10 × 10 − 1 mW/cm 2 (OD = 3). These measurements were made at 300 K. All layers were characterized by SEM in a JEOL J 5 M- 35 C microscope (JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan).|$|E

We have also developed an approximate treatment that both simplifies the calculations dramatically and allows for transparent interpretations of the results. The inelastic conductance is calculated using the Self Consistent Born Approximation (SCBA) in conjunction with the NEGF method. Since the emission/absorption of phonons couple the density of states (DOS) at energies separated by a phonon energy, the solution of the NEGF equations becomes computationally difficult and the results non-transparent.

40|$|Introduction: Brain {{injuries}} {{are a major}} source of difficult-to-treat deficits and human disability. Brain lesion cavities are seen in stroke, brain trauma, congenital brain disorders and after successful resection of brain tumors and abscesses. Brain computer interfaces offer an exciting new approach to address deficits resulting from brain lesions. The idea is to implant mechanically flexible implants that adopt the shape of the lesion cavity wall and that are covered with electrode contacts for recording neuronal signals and electrical stimulation. This should enable us to interact with the residual intact brain tissue and partially restore functionality by interacting with pathological circuits. Aim: The aim of this research is to design and develop a highly-flexible, biocompatible electrode array {{that can be used for}} long-term recording of neuronal signals. Methods: Using soft lithography, thin-film (7 micron), net-shaped 4 x 4 electrode arrays were produced. <b>Platinum</b> electrode <b>contacts</b> were separately embedded in 0. 4 mm wide square islands that were connected by 0. 2 mm long spring-like structures. This design guarantees flexibility and optimal adhesion to curved surfaces (cortical gyri and sulci) and lesion cavities. <b>Platinum</b> <b>contacts</b> were 92 micron in diameter and were placed at a pitch of 675 micron. These electrode arrays were implanted on the sensorimotor cortex of healthy rats for histological assessment of biocompatibility (n= 3,) and for recording evoked potentials (EP, n= 4, repeated measurements up to 4 months after implantation). EP recording was performed with peripheral stimulation of fore- and hindlimbs, both ipsi- and contralateral to the electrode array implant. Results: The electrode arrays adopted the surface of the sensorimotor cortex in rat and chronic implantation induced no overt discomfort. Tissue damage due to the implantation procedure was seen around 300 micron deep, but was comparable to sham implantation procedures. Preliminary data demonstrate that electrophysiological EP responses could be recorded over the 4 month follow-up period. Conclusion: The design of this electrode array allowed implantation on curved surfaces and can be used for chronic electrophysiological measurements. One of the possible applications is interaction with the lesion cavity wall, in order to restore function. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Organic {{semiconductors}} (OSCs) and graphene are {{two classes}} of conjugated materials that hold promise to create flexible electronic displays, high speed transistors, and low-cost solar cells. Crucial to understanding the behavior of these materials is understanding the effects metallic contacts have on the local charge environment. Additionally, characterizing the charge carrier transport behavior within these materials sheds light on the physical mechanisms behind transport. The {{first part of this}} thesis examines the origin of the low-temperature, high electric field transport behavior of OSCs. Two chemically distinct OSCs are used, poly- 3 (hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and 6, 13 - bis(triisopropyl-silylethynyl) (TIPS) pentacene. Several models explaining the low-temperature behavior are presented, with one using the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) insulator-to-metal transition model and one using a field-emission hopping model. While the TLL model is only valid for 1 -dimensional systems, it is shown to work for both P 3 HT (1 D) and TIPS-pentacene (2 D), suggesting the TLL model is not an appropriate description of these systems. Instead, a cross-over from thermally-activated hopping to field-emission hopping is shown to explain the data well. The second part of this thesis focuses on the interaction between gold and <b>platinum</b> <b>contacts</b> and graphene using suspended graphene over sub- 100 nanometer channels. Contacts to graphene can strongly dominate charge transport and mobility as well as significantly modify the charge environment local to the <b>contacts.</b> <b>Platinum</b> electrodes are discovered to be strong dopants to graphene at short length scales while gold electrodes {{do not have the same}} effect. By increasing the separation distance between the electrodes, this discrepancy is shown to disappear, suggesting an upper limit on charge diffusion from the contacts. Finally, this thesis will discuss a novel technique to observe the high-frequency behavior in OSCs using two microwave sources and an organic transistor as a mixer. A theoretical model motivating this technique is presented which suggests the possibility of retrieving gigahertz charge transport phenomena at kilohertz detection frequencies.

Methods: Polyimide cuff electrodes with 12 Pt {{sites in the}} spiral cuff were acutely implanted around the sciatic nerve of rats. Stimulation was applied through {{each one of the}} four tripoles of the cuff as single pulses of 10 µsec duration of increasing intensity The motor responses were monitored from EMG recordings of gastrocnemius medialis (GM; innervated by the tibial nerve) and tibialis anterior (TA; innervated by the peroneal nerve) muscles. The torque developed in tbc ankle was simultaneously measured by means of a purposely designed apparatus. Recruitment curves were constructed for the CMAP of the GM and TA muscles and for the torque. Results: In all nerves evaluated stimulation through {{one or two of the}} tripoles initially evoked a dorsiflexion with parallel recruitment of the TA muscle at low stimulation intensity; at higher stimulation amplitude activation of the tibial innervated muscles prevailed and led to predominant plantarflexion. On the other hand, stimulating through the other two or three tripoles evoked plantarflexion from the beginning, with increasing force from low to high stimulus intensity. The effectiveness of selective stimulation was mildly increased by applying a simultaneous transverse steering current. The threshold for torque dorsiflexion decreased and the dynamic range of stimulation that resulted in a net dorsiflexion expanded. The effects of steering currents were more noticeable with pulses of 80 % than 40 % of threshold value, and when applied from an opposite than from an adjacent anode. Conclusions: Despite the relative small size of the rat sciatic nerve and the close apposition of tibial and peroneal fascicles, we proved the feasibility of using multipolar polyimide cuff electrodes to produce selective fascicular nerve stimulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} dual-gated $p$-type field-effect transistors (FETs) {{based on}} few-layer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_ 2 $) using high work-function <b>platinum</b> source/drain <b>contacts,</b> and a hexagonal boron nitride top-gate dielectric. A device topology with contacts underneath the WSe$_ 2 $ results in $p$-FETs with $I_{ON}$/$I_{OFF}$ ratios exceeding 10 $^ 7 $, and contacts that remain Ohmic down to cryogenic temperatures. The output characteristics show current saturation and gate tunable negative differential resistance. The devices show intrinsic hole mobilities around 140 cm$^ 2 $/Vs at room temperature, and approaching 4, 000 cm$^ 2 $/Vs at 2 K. Temperature-dependent transport measurements show a metal-insulator transition, with an insulating phase at low densities, and a metallic phase at high densities. The mobility shows a strong temperature dependence consistent with phonon scattering, and saturates at low temperatures, possibly limited by Coulomb scattering, or defects.

40|$|Abstract Keyword(s) : {{deep brain}} stimulation, LFP, {{pathologic}} brain cavity, motor cortex 1. 1 	Introduction Pathologic brain cavities, often caused by e. g. stroke, {{are associated with}} disrupted neural circuitries. Symptoms are caused {{not only by the}} loss of neurons, but also by the disruption of neural networks. Since deep brain stimulation (DBS) emerged as a last-resort treatment for patients with Parkinson’s disease [1], it has been implemented for many indications [2 - 4]. We now propose an entirely new and unexplored application where electrode contacts are implanted directly against the wall of a pathologic brain cavity. This approach allows us to interact directly with the neurons of the disrupted circuitries by listening to their electrical activity (by recording local field potentials, LFPs) and by electrically stimulating them 1. 2 	Methods We developed miniature thin-film electrode arrays consisting of a matrix of 16 or 38 <b>platinum</b> <b>contacts,</b> designed to be flexible enough to conform to the pathological brain cavity wall. We implanted these electrodes against the wall of a pathologic brain cavity in the primary motor cortex of 20 rats. We recorded LFPs with all electrode contacts from the cavity wall while rats were performing behavioral tests. In a second stage, we electrically stimulated the cavity wall thereby aiming to improve the motor symptoms. Rats were tested with several sets of stimulation parameters (cathodic biphasic stimulation with all contacts, 100 Hz, 210 µs) in a randomized and blinded crossover experiment. 1. 3 	Results Based on spectral feature exploration, we obtained strong evidence that the theta power band (6 - 10 Hz) and the gamma band (45 - 90 Hz) are correlated to an active, engaged movement state. In all animals, electrical stimulation of the cavity wall at supra-optimal amplitudes induced visible side effects, such as clonic behavior and seizures. Furthermore, this behavior was often limited to the lesioned limb only. No improvement of motor function at the optimal amplitude was observed. 1. 4 	Conclusion Some frequency bands were correlated to movement of the rat, confirming results in healthy rats and other studies exploring the sensorimotor cortex and hippocampus. In the future, we aim to use LFPs to guide us to the best place for stimulation, or for driving a closed-loop stimulation algorithm. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Achieving a {{cheap and}} ultrafast metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) {{photodetector}} (PD) for very high-speed communications is ever-demanding. We report {{the influence of}} anodization current density variation on the response of nanoporous silicon (NPSi) based MSM PD with <b>platinum</b> (Pt) <b>contact</b> electrodes. Such NPSi samples are grown from n-type Si (100) wafer using photoelectrochemical etching with three different anodization current densities. FESEM images of as-prepared samples revealed the existence of discrete pores with spherical and square-like shapes. XRD pattern displayed the growth of nanocrystals with (311) lattice orientation. The nanocrystallite sizes obtained using Scherrer formula {{are found to be}} between 20. 8 [*]nm and 28. 6 [*]nm. The observed rectifying behavior in the I-V characteristics is ascribed to the Pt/PSi/n-Si Schottky barrier formation, where the barrier height at the Pt/PSi interface is estimated to be 0. 69 [*]eV. Furthermore, this Pt/PSi/Pt MSM PD achieved maximum responsivity of 0. 17 [*]A/W and quantum efficiency as much as 39. 3 %. The photoresponse of this NPSi based MSM PD demonstrated excellent repeatability, fast response, and enhanced saturation current with increasing anodization current density...|$|R
