40|$|In many {{families}} around the world, older children, partic-ularly sisters, look after their younger siblings {{to help their}} parents, who may be busy with household chores or out-side work. In such families, an older child can be an im-portant role model for younger siblings during their early years of life and, thus, influence their behavior. As the younger children grow up, however, and begin {{to spend more time}} with their peers and become exposed to exter-nal pressures, siblings have less influence on their attitudes and behavior. But does that influence disappear totally?

These results are consistent with our hypothesis that sea kraits move well in their respective <b>primary</b> <b>environments.</b> With respect to the highly aquatic L. semifasciata, its laterally compressed body form, large body size, and large area of compressed tail are considered to be beneficial to swimming in an aquatic environment.|$|R

40|$|Adolescence is {{a period}} in which first romantic {{relationships}} are being formed. Those are important for the development of an adolescent in many areas - for example their identity, family relationships and relationships with friends. In the presence of this phenomenon in adolescent population, research shows that a considerable percentage of people has an experience with a romantic relationship as early adolescent individuals and it's occurrence and length increases with aging. Of course differences appear between adolescent individuals, depending on their ethnocultural nationality. As for the development of romantic relationships in adolescence, most theories emphasize the peer group of an individual as a <b>primary</b> <b>environment</b> for their formation. The relationships' quality also changes with increasing age with no more influence from the peer group. In general they direct to greater physical and emotional intimacy between partners who explore care, devotion and future prospect for the couple.
