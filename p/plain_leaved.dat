50|$|During the wet season, the savanna turns green, the {{wildlife}} spreads out, the bird life returns, and the streams flood into adjacent lands {{turning them into}} swamps. The flood <b>plains</b> <b>leave</b> behind silt when they gradually dry up during the wet season.|$|R
50|$|The hill slopes {{were covered}} with vines in the early 20th century but the rural exodus and the {{consequent}} reduction in population led the remaining farmers to focus their activity on livestock grazing and mixed farming in the <b>plains,</b> <b>leaving</b> the hills area mostly fallow.|$|R

6000|$|... § X. One {{other form}} of the {{dogtooth}} is of great importance in northern architecture, that produced by oblique cuts slightly curved, as in the margin, Fig. LVI. It is susceptible of the most fantastic and endless decoration; each of the resulting leaves being, in the early porches of Rouen and Lisieux, hollowed out and worked into branching tracery: and at Bourges, for distant effect, worked into <b>plain</b> <b>leaves,</b> or bold bony processes with knobs at the points, and near the spectator, into crouching demons and broad winged owls, and other fancies and intricacies, innumerable and inexpressible.|$|R

The Tidal Basin and the Washington Channel {{are part of this}} wider section of the river. Much of the National Mall was marsh in the early Nineteenth century; as the capital city grew, the marsh was filled in and reclaimed.|$|R
50|$|In October 1904, Garvin was in Plainfield, New Jersey, to file {{a lawsuit}} against the Plainfield Athletic Club over salary that he felt he was owed. Garvin {{attempted}} to start a conversation with another guest at the hotel, New York insurance salesman R. N. Sheffey. When the man continued to read his newspaper instead of talking to Garvin, the hot-headed pitcher beat Sheffey about the face, resulting in a broken nose. After the incident, Garvin took a trolley car to Scotch <b>Plains,</b> <b>leaving</b> his wife behind at the hotel. By the next day, Garvin agreed to return to Plainfield, to apologize to Sheffey, and to pay Sheffey $50.|$|R
50|$|The Comanche {{maintained}} an ambiguous relationship with Europeans and later settlers attempting to colonize their territory. The Comanche were valued as trading partners since 1786 via the Comancheros out of New Mexico, but were feared for their raids against settlers in Texas. Similarly, they were, {{at one time}} or another, at war with virtually every other Native American group living on the South <b>Plains</b> <b>leaving</b> opportunities for political maneuvering by European colonial powers and the United States. At one point, Sam Houston, president of the newly created Republic of Texas, almost succeeded in reaching a peace treaty with the Comanche in the 1844 Treaty of Tehuacana Creek. His efforts were thwarted in 1845 when the Texas legislature refused to create an official boundary between Texas and the Comancheria.|$|R
60|$|The leaves {{which are}} used in fig. 13, it will be observed, have lost the Corinthian volute, and are now pure and <b>plain</b> <b>leaves,</b> such as {{were used in the}} Lombardic Gothic of the early thirteenth century all over Italy. Now in a round-arched gateway at Verona, {{certainly}} not later than 1300; the pointed leaves of this pure form are used in one portion of the mouldings, and in another are enriched by having their surfaces carved each into a beautiful ribbed and pointed leaf. The capital, fig. 6, Plate II., is nothing more than fig. 13 so enriched; and the two conditions are quite contemporary, fig. 13 being from a beautiful series of fourth order windows in Campo Sta. M^a. Mater Domini, already drawn in my folio work.|$|R

60|$|As soon as {{it became}} {{possible}} to carry a light, Bailey went to the barn and brought the team to the door. Rivers helped Blanche to {{a seat in the}} wagon and drove off across the <b>plain,</b> <b>leaving</b> Bailey alone in the water-soaked store-room. After a half-hour's work he, too, set out on a tour of exploration. The moon was shining on the plain as serenely as if only a dew had fallen. Water stood in shallow basins here and there, but the land was unmarked of the passion of lightning and of wind. Bailey walked across the level waste, straining his eyes ahead to see if the homes of his neighbors were still standing. He saw lights gleaming here and there like warning lamps of distant schooners, and when the infrequent, silent lightning flamed over the level waste, he caught glimpses of familiar shanties standing on the low swells.|$|R

500|$|The 4th Cavalry Division {{following}} the 5th Division, rode up the Plain of Sharon {{as far as}} Nahr el Mefjir. Here the division attacked and captured an entrenched Ottoman defensive position, which stretched from Jelameh, through El Mejdel and Liktera to the sea {{near the mouth of}} the Nahr el Mefjir. Afterwards, the 2nd Lancers (10th Cavalry Brigade) led by the 11th Light Armoured Motor Battery, entered the Musmus Pass and crossed the Mount Carmel Range to El Lejjun during the night of 19/20 September. They continued their advance in the early morning of 20 September, to capture Afulah, {{in the center of the}} <b>Plain.</b> <b>Leaving</b> the 5th Cavalry Division to garrison Afulah, the 4th Cavalry Division continued their advance eastwards in the afternoon to capture Beisan, having ridden [...] in 36 hours. The 19th Lancers (12th Cavalry Brigade) advanced directly from Afulah to the north east to capture the Jisr Mejamieh bridge across the Jordan River to the north of Beisan.|$|R
60|$|Forging at last {{through a}} narrow strip of dense jungle {{vegetation}} the man-thing broke through into an almost treeless area of considerable extent. For an instant he hesitated, glancing quickly behind him and then up at {{the security of the}} branches of the great trees waving overhead, but some greater urge than fear or caution influenced his decision apparently, for he moved off again across the little <b>plain</b> <b>leaving</b> the safety of the trees behind him. At greater or less intervals leafy sanctuaries dotted the grassy expanse ahead of him and the route he took, leading from one to another, indicated that he had not entirely cast discretion to the winds. But after the second tree had been left behind the distance to the next was considerable, and it was then that Numa walked from the concealing cover of the jungle and, seeing his quarry apparently helpless before him, raised his tail stiffly erect and charged.|$|R

Now it makes a slight curve south to Anderten. In Lehrte it connects with several other key routes, including the Berlin-Lehrte railway, including the Hanover-Berlin high-speed line. It then turns southeast to Peine and proceeds further to the southeast and takes in Groß Gleidingen, where it connects with the Hildesheim-Brunswick railway. It then turns to the east, reaching Brunswick from the southwest.|$|R
5000|$|Searches for {{pastoral}} land extended {{north in}} the early 1840s after the Moreton Bay region was opened for selection following {{the closure of the}} penal colony. Initial leases were taken up in the Moreton Bay, Darling Downs and Brisbane Valley regions, but by 1842 squatters were looking further north for suitable land. In May 1842, Russell joined an expedition to search the Wide Bay area for grazing country and in November of the same year, with Sydenham and William Glover, made another expedition to the Wide Bay area. They chose land that they named Burrandowan, said to mean [...] "big wind" [...] in the local Aboriginal dialect. This area was outside the area officially designated for pastoral settlement, however, and so the run was not registered. After a second visit to the area, Russell returned to Cecil <b>Plains,</b> <b>leaving</b> Sydenham and Glover in charge and the new run was stocked with sheep from Cecil Plains in May 1843. Relationships with the local Aboriginal people at Burrandowan were, and continued to be, hostile and shepherds were reluctant to work there. Sydenham and Glover soon became dispirited and left, Sydenham being back in England by 1844. Russell returned to manage the property until he sold it to Captain G.S.N. Living in the same year.|$|R
