The computation of these risk measures is performed by the north?south quantile <b>points</b> of <b>bivariate</b> <b>distributions.</b> The Farlie?Gumbel?Morgenstern (FGM) copula model is chosen to express dependence of bivariate risks. The behaviors of VaR and CVaR are examined by varying dependence parameter values of the copula model and probability levels of the risk measures. The findings are interpreted from the view point of portfolio risk management...|$|R

40|$|In {{our recent}} works, we {{developed}} a probabilistic framework for structural analysis in undirected networks. The key idea of that framework is to sample a network by a symmetric <b>bivariate</b> <b>distribution</b> and then use that <b>bivariate</b> <b>distribution</b> to formerly define various notions, including centrality, relative centrality, community, and modularity. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to extend the probabilistic framework to directed networks, where the sampling <b>bivariate</b> <b>distributions</b> could be asymmetric. Our main finding is that we can relax the assumption from symmetric <b>bivariate</b> <b>distributions</b> to <b>bivariate</b> <b>distributions</b> that have the same marginal distributions. By using such a weaker assumption, we show that various notions for structural analysis in directed networks can also be defined in the same manner as before. However, since the <b>bivariate</b> <b>distribution</b> could be asymmetric, the community detection algorithms proposed in our previous work cannot be directly applied. For this, we show that one can construct another sampled graph with a symmetric <b>bivariate</b> <b>distribution</b> so that for any partition of the network, the modularity index remains the same as that of the original sampled graph. Based on this, we propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm that returns a partition of communities when the algorithm converges...|$|R
