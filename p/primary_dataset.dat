Understanding how brain death is perceived by family members approached about organ donation, its significance to them, and if it is accepted by them, are, therefore, important issues to explore as biomedicine expands the range of end of life technologies that blur the demarcation between life and death. To explore the concept of brain stem death and its meaning to family members the following research questions were posed: (i) what does the diagnosis of death based on brain stem testing mean to bereaved family members who have been approached and asked to consider a donation from a deceased relative, and (ii) how do family members understand the concept of brain stem death? To address these research questions, a secondary analysis of 28 interviews sorted from two <b>primary</b> <b>datasets</b> was carried out. The <b>primary</b> <b>datasets</b> contained longitudinal and crosssectional interviews carried out in the UK with family members who had been approached about organ donation and agreed to donate their relatives’ organs.

Current mapping methods do not fully utilise monitored data, and as such {{the objective of this}} project was to apply new techniques based on both modelled and measured data. This was achieved through geostatistical estimation and simulation techniques. Measured N 02 from automatic and diffusion tube monitoring was the <b>primary</b> <b>dataset.</b> The secondary dataset consisted of dispersion modelled NOx data at a lkm 2 scale for the UK. NOx is useful for informing N 02 prediction, given that N 02 is a constituent pollutant of NOx• The key geostatistical estimation techniques investigated were simple kriging (SKL ordinary kriging (OK) and simple kriging with a locally varying mean (SKim). The geostatistical simulation analysis applied Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGSIM). SK and OK can only utilise a single dataset. SKim differs from in that additional data can be inputted to inform prediction, and hence potentially reduce uncertainty. Supplementary secondary data can be highly beneficial, particularly when the <b>primary</b> <b>dataset</b> is not evenly spatially distributed. The secondary data (NOx dispersion modelled data) were used to define the locally varying mean in SKim, for both the geostatistical and simulation analyses, using two regression approaches: (i) global regression (GR) and (ii) geographically weighted regression (GWR). SKim with GWR defined locally varying means was further investigated through examination of various parameters. Throughout, the effects of other variables that may affect prediction were also discussed. The integration of the local model into the geostatistical algorithm produced an increase in estimation accuracy (measured through a reduction in uncertainty), in comparison to other techniques. SKim with GWR defined locally varying means, produced the most accurate predicted and simulated outputs of all approaches tested in this research.
