40|$|Firms {{interested}} in servicing foreign markets face {{a difficult decision}} {{with regards to the}} choice <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>entry</b> mode. The options available to a firm include exporting, licensing, joint venture and sole venture.

These factors can be classified into three categories: ownership advantages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firm, location advantages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> market, and internalization advantages of integrating transactions. This study examines the independent and joint influences of these factors on the choice <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>entry</b> mode.
