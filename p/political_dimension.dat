5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British were unwilling to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been unwilling to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a <b>political</b> <b>dimension,</b> as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been unwilling to do.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} <b>political</b> <b>dimension.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{accounting}} for historical changes, David Lempert's {{work in the}} early 1980s introduced a time dimension and a <b>political</b> <b>dimension</b> to the curve, showing how population and politics interact with economic inequality over time, leading either to long-term stability or to collapse. This neo-Malthusian model incorporating Kuznets' work, yields a helix model of the relationships over time rather than just a plane curve.|$|E
25|$|Brooke was {{particularly}} annoyed by Churchill's idea of capturing {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. But {{in some cases}} Brooke did not see the <b>political</b> <b>dimension</b> of strategy as the Prime Minister did. The CIGS was sceptical about the British intervention in the Greek Civil War in late 1944 (during the Dekemvriana), believing this was an operation which would drain troops from the central front in Germany. But at this stage the war was practically won and Churchill saw the possibility of preventing Greece from becoming a communist state.|$|E

25|$|Tipu is {{considered}} to be anti-Christian by several historians. While Alan Machado in his book 'Slaves of Sultans', argues that by expelling Christian priests, Tipu was only following precedent set by European rivals. Historian J. B. Prashant More in his paper 'Tipu Sultan and the Christians' argues that Tipu's encounters and dealings with the Christians of both European and Indian origin were in accordance with the spirit of his times and also had a <b>political</b> <b>dimension.</b> The captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam, which began on 24 February 1784 and ended on 4 May 1799, remains the most disconsolate memory in their history.|$|E
25|$|In 1603 he {{was called}} back to Leiden University to teach theology. This came about after almost {{simultaneous}} deaths in 1602 of two faculty members, Franciscus Junius and Lucas Trelcatius the elder, in an outbreak of plague. Lucas Trelcatius the younger and Arminius (despite Plancius' protest) were appointed, the decision resting largely with Franciscus Gomarus, the surviving faculty member. While Gomarus cautiously approved Arminius, whose views were already suspected of unorthodoxy, his arrival opened a period of debate rather than closed it. The appointment had also a <b>political</b> <b>dimension,</b> being backed by both Johannes Wtenbogaert at The Hague and Johan van Oldenbarnevelt.|$|E
25|$|On 28 February 1870 the twenty-year-old {{struggle}} between Greeks and Bulgarians {{for the control}} of the Orthodox Church in Bulgaria culminated when the Ottoman Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz created an independent Bulgarian ecclesiastical organization, known as the Bulgarian Exarchate. The Orthodox Church in Bulgaria had now become independent of the Greek-dominated Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Bulgarian Exarch, who resided in Constantinople, became the most famous bearer of the title of exarch; his adherents throughout region were called exarchists, as opposed to the Greek patriarchists.The ensuing struggle, waged especially in Macedonia, was not only religious but had a conspicuous <b>political</b> <b>dimension</b> of a contention between competing Greek and Bulgarian national aims.

25|$|The pirate {{stations}} campaigned {{against the}} Act {{during the early}} months of 1967. Radio 270 was prominent in this campaign and its contributions to the campaign took on an overtly <b>political</b> <b>dimension.</b> A group of Conservative MPs and activists became involved with Radio 270. These included the MP for Beverley, Patrick Wall. The station gave airtime to a number of political causes including a broadcast by Wall in which he advocated British recognition of the white minority UDI regime in Rhodesia. Radio 270 broadcast advertisements supporting Conservative party candidates in the Scarborough municipal elections of 1967. Harvey Proctor, then Chairman of the University of York Conservative Society, made regular half hour current affairs broadcasts. Proctor went on to have a controversial career as a Conservative MP and prominent member of the Conservative Monday Club.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Basel, however, it was the {{increasing}} need for space in the Haus zur Mücke that prompted deliberations regarding {{construction of a new}} building. The discussion concerning the right location for the public collection took on a <b>political</b> <b>dimension</b> following the division of the canton into city and regional sections. The University Act (Universitätsgesetz) of 1818 had made the corporatively autonomous university a cantonal educational establishment, with the university holdings thus owned indirectly by the state. According to the arbitral decision governing the cantonal split, two-thirds of the university’s collection belonged to the regional canton and had to be purchased by the city canton. The ensuing consternation in the city led to the Administration and Use of University Holdings Act (Gesetz über Verwaltung und Verwendung des Universitätsgutes) of 1836 that such goods were indissolubly tied to the locality of the city of Basel for the purposes of education. This provision has remained in effect to the present day.|$|E

Mainstream press reviews have praised the immersive {{qualities of the}} game and its <b>political</b> <b>dimension.</b> The Boston Globe described it as [...] "a beautiful, brutal, and disquieting computer game... {{one of the best in}} years", and compared the game to Whittaker Chambers' 1957 riposte to Atlas Shrugged, Big Sister Is Watching You. Wired also mentioned the Ayn Rand connection (a partial anagram of Andrew Ryan) in a report on the game which featured a brief interview with Levine. The Chicago Sun-Times review said [...] "I never once thought anyone would be able to create an engaging and entertaining video game around the fiction and philosophy of Ayn Rand, but that is essentially what 2K Games has done... the rare, mature video game that succeeds in making you think while you play".|$|E
500|$|According to Wilkinson, Runciman's dismissive phrase [...] "kindled the town". Under {{the general}} {{leadership}} of its chairman, David Riley, the town council began preparations for a demonstration {{in the form}} of a march to London to present a petition to the government. Marches of the unemployed, generally termed [...] "hunger marches", had been taking place since the early 1920s, often under the auspices of the communist-led National Unemployed Workers' Movement. This <b>political</b> <b>dimension</b> had associated such marches in the public mind with far-left propaganda. The Jarrow council determined to organise its march free of political connotations, and with the backing of every section of the town. This did not prevent Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham, from denouncing it as [...] "revolutionary mob pressure" [...] and condemning the action of James Gordon, the Bishop of Jarrow, who gave the march his blessing. Even within the Labour Party, Wilkinson found the leadership's attitude lukewarm, fearful of possible association with revolutionary socialism.|$|E
500|$|The leadership's stance {{contributed to}} the {{relatively}} moderate <b>political</b> <b>dimension</b> of social protest in October. Also crucial were the impacts of nationalism and nationalist emotions. They spurred social protest in June but dampened it in October, when the threat of Soviet invasion against Gomułka and his supporters transformed the social image of Polish communists. In June, they were still treated as the puppets and servants of alien, anti-Polish interests and excluded from the national community. In October, they {{became a part of}} the nation opposing Soviet domination. Gomułka was enthusiastically supported by the great majority of society, not primarily as a communist leader, but as a leader of a nation who, by resisting Soviet demands, embodied a national longing for independence and sovereignty. His name was chanted, along with anti-Soviet slogans, at thousands of meetings: [...] "Go home Rokossovsky", [...] "Down with the Russians," [...] "Long live Gomułka," [...] "We want a free Poland".|$|E

500|$|... “I {{am writing}} {{this story about}} a detective who turns into a tree” was what writer Troy Kennedy Martin told his colleagues when asked what {{he was working on}} during the early 1980s. Kennedy Martin had become {{frustrated}} that “at the BBC there was no <b>political</b> <b>dimension</b> to their drama whatsoever” but had chosen to write a political story anyway, not really believing it would ever get made. The election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan as President of the United States had brought about a major shift in the global political landscape and Kennedy Martin was motivated to write out of concern arising from such issues as the Greenham Common protests, the Falklands War, unrest among the miners and, arising out of the escalation of the Cold War, the fear that “born-again Christians and Cold War warriors appeared to be running the United States”.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{existing}} tradition of a black actor playing Caliban opposite a white Prospero, colonial interpretations of the play did not find their way onto the stage until the 1970s. Performances in England directed by Jonathan Miller and by Clifford Williams explicitly portrayed Prospero as coloniser. Miller's production was described, by David Hirst, as depicting [...] "the tragic and inevitable disintegration of a more primitive culture {{as the result of}} European invasion and colonisation". Miller developed this approach in his 1988 production at the Old Vic in London, starring Max von Sydow as Prospero. This used a mixed cast made up of white actors as the humans and black actors playing the spirits and creatures of the island. According to Michael Billington, [...] "von Sydow's Prospero became a white overlord manipulating a mutinous black Caliban and a collaborative Ariel keenly mimicking the gestures of the island's invaders. The colonial metaphor was pushed through to its logical conclusion so that finally Ariel gathered up the pieces of Prospero's abandoned staff and, watched by awe-struck tribesmen, fitted them back together to hold his wand of office aloft before an immobilised Caliban. The Tempest suddenly acquired a new <b>political</b> <b>dimension</b> unforeseen by Shakespeare." ...|$|E
