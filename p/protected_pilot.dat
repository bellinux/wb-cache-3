50|$|The {{first modern}} {{production}} technology for armour plating {{was used by}} navies {{in the construction of}} the Ironclad warship, reaching its pinnacle of development with the battleship. The first tanks were produced during World War I. Aerial armour has been used to <b>protect</b> <b>pilots</b> and aircraft systems since the First World War.|$|R
5000|$|However, as speed {{continued}} to increase, it became necessary to enclose cockpits - and this, in turn, streamlined aircraft {{so that they}} were faster. Increased [...] "G-loading" [...] during maneuvers forced pilots to wear tight, restrictive shoulder harnesses, and armor plating began to be installed to <b>protect</b> <b>pilots</b> from projectiles coming from behind.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} days of {{aviation}} the leather helmets used in motor-racing were adopted by pilots as head protection. The initial design of early leather flying helmets was adapted during the 1930s to become the type B helmet which enabled the external attachment of radio earphones oxygen masks and removable goggles to <b>protect</b> <b>pilots</b> eyes from the elements.|$|R

5000|$|Assault Version Ki-51B. The assault version had armor plating <b>protecting</b> the <b>pilot</b> and oil tanks, and bomb racks {{to carry}} 441 lbs of bombs. This version could be {{modified}} {{in the field}} to carry an aerial camera.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{landing gear}} is suspended using fibreglass axles. The tailwheel is steerable. The controls are conventional three-axis and include full-span ailerons. The large, flat-plate triangular windshield <b>protects</b> the <b>pilot</b> from the propeller blast and has distinctive cut-outs for the rudder pedals.|$|R
50|$|Bulletproof glass <b>protects</b> the <b>pilot's</b> {{cockpit and}} weapons officer station, {{internal}} avionics have been revamped {{with the addition}} of a GPS and receiver in the nose, and a warning radar attached to the rear, with four antennae providing 360 degrees coverage and all electronics systems integrated.|$|R
50|$|To reduce {{drift of}} the sprayed materials, {{agricultural}} pilots attempt to fly {{just above the}} crops being treated. Fields are often surrounded by obstacles such as trees, telephone lines, and farm buildings. Purpose-built agricultural airplanes have strengthened cockpits to <b>protect</b> the <b>pilot</b> if an accident occurs.|$|R
50|$|Full-scale {{sailplanes}} are {{operated by}} the Associated Glider Clubs of Southern California (AGCSC), only during special permit windows between February and April, while models, hang gliders, and paragliders fly any time the wind permits. The local Flight Director and Concessionaire maintains and enforces safety rules to <b>protect</b> both <b>pilots</b> and spectators.|$|R
50|$|The Sopwith Salamander was {{developed}} {{as the first}} dedicated ground attack fighter. Based on the Sopwith Snipe it had 600 lb of armour in the front end to <b>protect</b> the <b>pilot</b> and fuel against ground fire. While 1,400 were ordered, only two were delivered to France before the Armistice. Production ceased at just 500 aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The Sopwith TF.2 Salamander was a British ground-attack {{aircraft}} of the First World War {{designed by}} the Sopwith Aviation Company which first flew in April 1918. It was a single-engined, single-seat biplane based on the Sopwith Snipe fighter but with an armoured forward fuselage to <b>protect</b> the <b>pilot</b> and fuel system from ground fire during low level operations.|$|R
5000|$|István Horthy died in Russia, {{shortly after}} his arrival, in a much publicized flying accident. He was then serving in Royal Hungarian Air Force (Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierő), MKHL, with the rank of 1/Lt, as a fighter pilot. His unit, 1/3 Fighter Squadron, was {{supporting}} the Hungarian Second Army against Soviet forces. He was flying his MÁVAG Héja ("Hawk"), V.421, a Hungarian fighter based on the Italian Reggiane Re.2000. During his 25th operational sortie, soon after takeoff from an air field near Ilovskoye, the other pilot, flying with him, asked Horthy to increase height. István pulled up rapidly. His aircraft (that had become much more prone to stalls, after a steel plate was added behind the cockpit of all Reggianes, to <b>protect</b> <b>pilots,</b> but so shifting the plane's center of gravity) stalled and crashed.It was 20 August 1942 (18 August, according to other authors [...] ).|$|R
500|$|As was {{traditional}} with Ilyushin's ground-attack aircraft the Il-20 used a load-bearing armored shell to <b>protect</b> the <b>pilot</b> and gunner {{as well as}} the engine, fuel, lubrication {{and cooling}} systems.

5000|$|Compass Airlines {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} a {{contract}} dispute between Northwest Airlines and its pilots' union, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). The Northwest Airlines pilot group was asked to give relief on a section of their collective bargaining agreement governing [...] "scope", which <b>protects</b> <b>pilot</b> jobs by ensuring that an airline's customers are flown by the employees of that airline. The pilots eventually agreed to a concession on the scope of their contract allowing a limited number of 76-seat aircraft to be flown by outsourced pilots working for a subcontractor regional airline. In exchange for their concession the Northwest Airlines pilots demanded in return that the pilots of these new aircraft would eventually [...] "flow-up" [...] into mainline pilot jobs at Northwest Airlines, and that Northwest Airlines pilots would retain the ability to [...] "flow-down" [...] into the newly subcontracted pilot jobs in the event that Northwest Airlines were to furlough the mainline pilots.|$|R

5000|$|The Federal Aviation Regulations, or FARs, {{are rules}} {{prescribed}} by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) governing all aviation {{activities in the}} United States. The FARs are part of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). A wide variety of activities are regulated, such as aircraft design and maintenance, typical airline flights, pilot training activities, hot-air ballooning, lighter-than-air aircraft, man-made structure heights, obstruction lighting and marking, and even model rocket launches, model aircraft operation, sUAS & Drone operation, and kite flying. The rules are designed to promote safe aviation, <b>protecting</b> <b>pilots,</b> flight attendants, passengers {{and the general public}} from unnecessary risk. Since 1958, these rules have typically been referred to as [...] "FARs", short for Federal Aviation Regulations. However, another set of regulations (Title 48) is titled [...] "Federal Acquisitions Regulations", and this has led to confusion {{with the use of the}} acronym [...] "FAR". Therefore, the FAA began to refer to specific regulations by the term [...] "14 CFR part XX".|$|R
50|$|As was {{traditional}} with Ilyushin's ground-attack aircraft the Il-20 used a load-bearing armored shell to <b>protect</b> the <b>pilot</b> and gunner {{as well as}} the engine, fuel, lubrication {{and cooling}} systems. The thickness of the armor varied between 6 to 15 mm and weighed a total of 1840 kg. The pilot's canopy used armored glass 100 mm thick for the main windshield and 65 mm for the quarterlights.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{pressure}} suits <b>protect</b> fighter <b>pilots</b> from hypoxia / altitude sickness, and g-suits {{from the}} adverse effects of acceleration (gravity-induced loss of consciousness, or G-LOC). The most extreme environmental suits are used by astronauts to protect them during ascent and while in the vacuum of space: space suits and space activity suits. Such suits are self-supporting, and include a supply of oxygen for the wearer.|$|R
2500|$|In 1999 the company's SOMAR {{division}} {{built its}} first tug, Tira Lani, [...] "from the stern up" [...] with azimuth stern drive and a structural steel frame that {{would support the}} exhaust pipes and <b>protect</b> the <b>pilot</b> house.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} analysis of foam materials. Open cell foam is investigated. Numerical simulations enable prediction of failure process and assessment of effective properties of the modeled foam structures [1]. Metal as well as polyurethane foams exhibit interesting properties. They are light, possess good acoustic and/or magnetic isolation, have ability to absorb energy of vibration and impacts [2]. They are used for sandwich panels, hit absorbers (i. e. as elements of buffer constructions in rail vehicles), fillers of construction parts, bodies of vehicles (i. e. floating combat vehicles), dividing walls on vessels and others. Specially prepared open cell foams demonstrate auxetic properties [3] and shape memory effect [4]. Such materials are very good for seats in aircrafts, which may <b>protect</b> <b>pilots</b> and passengers during crashes and restrict heavy backbone injuries. Foams are also applied for filtering purposes. Foams themselves or in combination with different types of fillers (i. e. elastomers) or ceramic reinforcement {{may be used for}} impact energy absorbing panels for military purposes (protection against explosion shock wave and splinters) ...|$|R

50|$|The cockpit {{was very}} similar to the earlier Yakovlev jets, though the Yak-25 was {{pressurized}} using an air-cycle system based on engine bleed. The single aft-sliding canopy was powered. The bulletproof front windscreen was 57 mm thick, while 8 mm of armor <b>protected</b> the <b>pilot</b> from behind. The ejection seat was an improvement over the Yak-19, with a longer stroke gun, and leg restraints. Armament was also improved, with three NR-23 cannon, each with 75 rounds.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, brown leather flight jackets were worn by aviators {{and members of}} the military. During the Second World War, they became known as [...] "bomber jackets" [...] and were heavily {{insulated}} and prized for their warmth.

50|$|The V.27 {{was little}} more than an {{enlarged}} V.26 (prototype for the D.VIII) with a 145 kW (195 hp) Benz Bz.IIIb liquid-cooled inline engine. Once again, Fokker pursued similar aircraft with both rotary and inline engines. Fokker submitted the V.27 at the second fighter competition at Adlershof in May/June 1918.The V.37 was a ground-attack variant of the V.27. It was fitted with extensive armor plating to <b>protect</b> the <b>pilot</b> and engine. Neither the V.27 nor the V.37 were placed in production.|$|R
50|$|Produced to make {{an attempt}} to win the 1910 Michelin Cup long-distance competition, this {{aircraft}} had the same basic configuration but differed in having 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) extensions on the upper wing, giving a total wing area of 70 m2 and a long nacelle to <b>protect</b> the <b>pilot</b> from the cold. Ailerons were fitted only on the upper wing, and fuel and oil tankage was increased to 230 lt and 80 lt respectively to give an endurance of 12 hours.|$|R
5000|$|Advantages; wide undercarriage, large twin-row {{radial engine}} which <b>protected</b> the <b>pilot</b> from the front, {{electric}} starter motor and electric trim system. Disadvantages; {{there was a}} danger of turning over when braking hard on soft or sandy ground. In combat against enemy fighters, more awkward because of the heavy armour plating. Strong at low altitude, inferior to the Bf 109 at higher altitude. In my opinion the Fw 190, in this version, was the best aircraft used in the formation against the Viermots.|$|R
50|$|The Avia BH-10 was a single-seat {{aerobatic}} sports plane {{built in}} Czechoslovakia in 1924, {{based on the}} Avia BH-9, which was in turn developed from the BH-5 and BH-1. It was easily visually distinguished from the BH-9 by the tall anti-roll pylon added behind the open cockpit in order to <b>protect</b> the <b>pilot</b> {{in the event that}} the aircraft flipped over or crashed while inverted. At least 20 examples were bought by the Czechoslovakian Army as a training aircraft and operated under the designation B.10.|$|R
