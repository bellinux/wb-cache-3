40|$|This {{final report}} is sundered into six parts. The {{introduction}} {{consists of the}} purpose, justification. delineations, limitations, and hypotheses for the study. Chapter II establishes some historical and philosophical framework for the study. Essentially, this section sets forth some ideological concomitants which {{gave rise to a}} dual system of public education in the State of Georgia. In Chapter III, some literature which concerns the theories of public school finance in America, and developmental phenomena of the discipline are reviewed. A review of recent school finance litigati·on is also presented. The methodology used in this report is outlined in Chapter IV. A description of the data and the collection of data are related to two concepts which are considered germane to the study. These are: (1) fiscal neutrality/equity, which is interpreted as including the neutrality of wealth, as well as neutrality of ethnic background; and (2) District <b>Power</b> <b>Equalizing,</b> which is viewed as an alternative fiscal strategy adopted by the Georgia General Assembly in an attempt to more fully equalize the distribution of educational funds throughout the State. Data which are related to fiscal equity in the State of Georgia are presented and interpreted in Chapter V. Several factors were examined in this regard for their possible correlation with the ethnic composition of local school districts. The wealth of local school districts was approached in terms of property, income, and the number of Title I students. Local effort was viewed as the relative degree to which local citizens assessed themselves for the fiscal support of public education. Educational resources were considered in terms of the yield of revenue from ad valorem taxes and state aid to local units of administration. Comparisons were made between per pupil expenditures for maintenance and operation under the current Minimum Foundation Program of Education in Georgia and the recently enacted District <b>Power</b> <b>Equalizing</b> legislation. Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to a surmnation;of findings, the statement of conclusions, and recommendations. These were centered around the 1972 - 73 per pupil fiscal support for local school districts which were significantly Black as correlated with those which enrolled a preponderance of Caucasian pupils. The Study The {{purpose of this study was}} to ascertain if relationships existed between fiscal support and the ethnic composition of local school districts in the State of Georgia. As such, the ethnic composition of city and county school systems in the State was correlated with: (1) the wealth of school districts; (2) local tax effort; and (3) educational resources. The following null-hypotheses were tested: H 01 -There is no measurable relationship existing between the levels of fiscal support of local school districts in the State of Georgia and the ethnic composition of those school districts. Ha 1 -There is a measurable relationship existing between the levels of fiscal support of local school districts in the State of Georgia and the ethnic composition of those school districts. H 02 -There are no disparities in the Georgia system of public school finance which are weighted against school districts which are significantly Black. Ha 2 -There are disparities in the Georgia system of public school finance which are weighted against school districts which are significantly Black. H 03 -District <b>Power</b> <b>Equalizing,</b> as adopted by the Georgia General Assembly, will not significantly affect the relative position of school districts which are significantly Black. Ha 3 -District <b>Power</b> <b>Equalizing,</b> as adopted by the Georgia General Assembly, will significantly affect the relative position of school districts which are significantly Black. The criteria for evaluation in this study was that of equity, rather than unqual ified fiscal neutral ity. Jhile the concept of fiscal neutrality requires that local wealth may not be the determinant of the level of a community 2 ̆ 7 s educational offerings, equity entails far more than this. The major elements of contemporary concepts of equity in public school finance were itemized. Conclusions An historical approach to fiscal relationships in the State of Georgia was undertaken in this study, attempting to assess the impact of these relationships on school districts which were significantly Black. The findings of this report substantiate the prevalence of fiscal disparities in Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s system of public school finance which were correlated with the ethnic composition of local school districts, as follows: 1. When property wealth, income wealth. and the number of Title I students are considered. there were disparities in the ability of local citizens to support public education in school districts which were significantly Black. 2. When ad valorem tax millage rates were considered. school districts which were significantly Black tended to exert greater tax effort than did local school districts which were low Black. 3. Although, basically, the MFPE program had an equalizing effect at the State level. grave disparities prevailed in the provision of enrichment funds throughout the State. 4. A disportionate number of Black students resided in urban school districts which are confronted with problems of municipal overburden, low income, and cost differentials. 5. Under simulation. state aid for District <b>Power</b> <b>Equalizing</b> was inversely related to the percentage of Black people living within a school district. 6. Under simulation, District <b>Power</b> <b>Equalizing</b> had a more favorable impact on county school districts than on independent school districts. 7. When simulated, District <b>Power</b> <b>Equalizing</b> had a more beneficial impact on non-SMSA school districts than on SMSA school districts...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades many US states have made large changes to their systems of {{financing}} K- 12 education with the explicit objective of providing more equitable educational opportunities. There has been relatively little accompanying analysis, however, examining how these changes might affect the total sum of resources dedicated to education and whether indeed increased equality is a likely outcome. We analyze five different education finance systems: local, State, foundation, <b>power</b> <b>equalizing</b> with recapture (PER) and <b>power</b> <b>equalizing</b> without recapture (PEN). We find that finance systems can have very large effects on both resources devoted to education and equity. Our calibration suggests that total spending on education may differ by as much as 25 % across systems. The trade-off between equity and resources, however, is not monotone. Although spending in a local system is typically greater than that in either the State system or PER, total spending is typically highest for the foundation and PEN systems, both of which reduce inequality of educational resources substantially relative to a local system. We also rank systems in welfare terms by carrying out an expected utility calculation. We find that PER consistently ranks best, though it provides fewer resources to education than the foundation and PEN systems, and falls well short of the state system in terms of equity. Additionally, we find that the PER system is remarkably popular among these alternative finance systems [...] we prove analytically that for an important subset of preferences PER will win in majority voting comparisons with each of the other systems. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{conditions of}} most contemporary surveillance systems {{run counter to}} principles of democratic governance. Because, at its core, surveillance is about control, it tends to produce conditions of constraint, wherein human and technical action is regulated and limited. The degree and kind of constraint {{vary according to the}} values and assumptions that are embedded in respective surveillance apparatuses and generated by surveillance practices. Today’s surveillance systems are inflected by and reproduce neoliberal rationalities of market-based solutions to social problems and disciplinary exclusions of marginalized populations. I develop this argument across three sections. First, I draw upon STS writings on democracy and technology to frame technology as political in its own right, apart from its use by government agencies, corporations, or others. Second, I analyze the dominant functions of surveillance today with regard to the differential treatment and automated control of populations, both of which are functions that produce identities of marginality and resist democratic participation or oversight. Finally, to avoid deterministic conclusions about surveillance, I explore several examples of democratically empowering surveillance systems that encourage openness, transparency, participation, and power equalization among social groups and institutions. Because surveillance societies appear to be here to stay, democratic ways of life may depend on tempering the growing hegemony of differential and automated control with alternative, <b>power</b> <b>equalizing</b> forms of surveillance...|$|E
40|$|In {{modern day}} {{communication}} systems, {{there is a}} constant demand for increase in transmission rates. This is however limited by the bandwidth limitation of the channel. Inter symbol interference (ISI) imposes a great threat to increasing data rates by degrading the signal quality. Equalizers are used at the receiver to compensate for the losses in the channel and thereby greatly mitigate ISI. Further, an adaptive equalizer is desired which can be used over a channel whose response is unknown or is time-varying. A low <b>power</b> <b>equalizing</b> solution in a moderately attenuated channel is an analog peaking filter which boosts the signal high frequency components. Such conventional continuous time linear equalizers (CTLE) provide a single degree of controllability over the high frequency boost. A more complex CTLE has been designed which has two degrees of freedom by controlling the high frequency boost as well as the range of frequencies over which the boost is applied. This extra degree of controllability over the equalizer response is desired to better adapt to the varying channel response and result in an equalized signal with a wider eye opening. A robust adaptation technique is necessary to tune the equalizer characteristics. Some of the commonly used techniques for adaptation of CTLEs are based on energy comparison criterion in the frequency domain. But the adaptation achieved using these techniques might not be optimal especially for an equalizer with two degrees of controllability. In such cases an eye opening monitor (EOM) could be used which evaluates the actual signal quality in time domain. The EOM gives an estimate on the signal quality by measuring the eye opening of the equalized signal in horizontal and vertical domain. In this thesis work a CTLE with two degrees of freedom with an EOM based adaptation system has been implemented...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} different funding methods for financing {{public education in}} order {{to solve the problems}} associated with large numbers of school districts and great disparities in property wealth without abandonment of property tax as the major revenue source. Using enrollment and State Property Tax Board data for the 1, 061 school districts in Texas in 1986 - 87, four alternative funding plans were studied to compare the equity and fiscal impact of each on public school finance in Texas. The state and local shares of the total cost of education were computed using a combination of three per-pupil expenditure levels and four funding formulas. The per-pupil expenditure levels used were 3, 850, 4, 200, and 4, 580. The formulas used were representative of a full state funding plan, a percentage equalization plan, a power equalization plan, and a foundation school program plan. Since each of the four plans used significantly higher per-pupil expenditure values, all required a greater monetary investment {{on the part of the}} state. However, all plans were found to be equalizing in nature if set per-pupil expenditure values were maintained and no local enrichment was permitted. In addition, each of the four plans, as studied, met the fiscal neutrality standard of the 1987 Edqewood v. Kirbv case. The percentage and power equalization plans required less monetary investment on the part of the state than either full state funding or the foundation school program. As a result of the study, it is recommended that the state consider a combination of plans. For example, the state could employ a full state funding model up to the 3, 850 per-pupil expenditure level with added permissible local millage being limited and <b>power</b> <b>equalized.</b> In addition, while each of the plans studied reduces inequity, the increased cost of an adequate public school education suggests that the state consider other sources of revenue to fund public education.

40|$|In his {{important}} and provocative Foreword, Professor Daryl Levinson criticizes American constitutional law {{for failing to}} attend sufficiently to questions of power, which he defines as “the ability to effect substantive policy outcomes by influencing what the government will or will not do. ” As Levinson details, structural constitutional law has focused on how power is distributed among governmental institutions. It has not consistently or adequately considered how power is — or should be — distributed among social groups. Ultimately, Levinson suggests that the narrow focus of separation of powers law and theory on “equalizing the power of government institutions” lacks normative force. <b>Equalizing</b> <b>power</b> among interests and groups in society is a more worthwhile project than checking, balancing, and <b>equalizing</b> <b>power</b> among governmental institutions. In the latter, he concludes, “it {{is hard to see}} any spark. ” One might protest, in light of current electoral politics, that the possibility of unchecked presidential power does indeed have alarming “spark. ” But I fundamentally agree with Levinson’s analysis. Like Levinson, I have argued that separation of powers theory does not sufficiently attend to how power is distributed in society and therefore how power is actually exercised in government. In particular, mounting empirical evidence demonstrates that economic elites exercise extraordinary power at every step of the political process. Traditional separation of powers mechanisms, whatever their other virtues, do little to check or balance elites’ concentrated power. Given this political economy, I have argued, public law ought to focus more on facilitating the countervailing power of ordinary citizens and their organizations in governance...|$|R

The combination of selfcalibration and modular control demonstrated in a two stage switch topology is believed to be scalable to more sophisticated multistage networks. As the concept does not require delay lines, it is believed that it will have advantages in facilitating the integration of controlled photonic circuits...|$|R
40|$|Employee {{ownership}} of enterprise {{has become a}} prominent focus of public policy and private action both in the United States and abroad. This is the result, in considerable part, of an unusual convergence of economic thought from {{opposite ends of the}} political spectrum. On the left, recent years have brought the sudden and virtually complete collapse of state socialism as an economic ideal in both the East and the West. In the resulting ideological void, 2 ̆ 2 workplace democracy 2 ̆ 2 has emerged as the principal institutional reform that today commands widespread support among critics of capitalism; worker control of enterprise, it is hoped, will succeed where state control has failed in <b>equalizing</b> <b>power</b> and wealth and in decreasing worker alienation and exploitation. Reformers on the right, in turn, have become increasingly discouraged with the efficiency of traditional forms of labor-management relations. For an alternative, many have turned to employee ownership, hoping that it will improve productivity and increase worker identification with the interests of capital...|$|R
