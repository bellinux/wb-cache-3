Phytosociological analyses {{have been carried out}} in order to contribute to knowledge of these grasslands syntaxonomy. The phytoclimatic outline of the area under study has been obtained by processing the thermal and rainfall data recorded at the weatherstations of Altamura, Castel del Monte (Alta Murgia) and Matera (Murge Materane) and computing bioclimatic indexes (according to the methods of Rivas Martinez and of Montero de Burgos and González Rebollar). The vegetation study has been performed through 31 phytosociological relevés. The matrix, relevés by species, has been analysed by classification and ordination multivariate techniques in order to highlight homogeneous groups. The <b>phytoclimate</b> of the area can be ascribed to the pluvioseasonal-oceanic type of the Mediterranean macrobioclimate, with a mesomediterranean thermotype and a continental tendency. Murge Materane <b>phytoclimate</b> results more thermo-xeric than Alta Murgia one. Phytosociological and statistical multivariate analyses have pointed out two main groups of relevés corresponding to two new associations: Acino suaveolentis-Stipetum austroitalicae e Chamaecytiso spinescentis-Stipetum austroitalicae. These latter have been framed in a new alliance (Hippocrepido glaucae-Stipion austroitalicae) of Scorzonero-Chrysopogonetalia, that gathers calcareous steppe grasslands of Festuco-Brometea, with accentuated Mediterranean characters. The results of this study show the affinity between S. austroitalica ssp. austroitalica grasslands of south-east of Italy and vegetation of trans-Adriatic and north-Adriatic Carso areas. Moreover, they contribute to define the westward part of Scorzonero-Chrysopogonetalia range, which thus would include also the inner part of central Apulia and eastern Basilicata...|$|E

The floristic and vegetation biological spectra of four study sites (Jaisalmer, Ajmer, Sariska and Mt. Abu) were compared. Analysis of life form spectra revealed the most striking feature of higher differentiation in proportions of therophytes along climatic gradient using vegetation spectrum. The proportion of therophytes and phanerophytes are highly variable across the sites indicate influence of climate. Biological spectrum of the four study sites has been compared with Raunkiaer’s normal spectrum to know the <b>phytoclimate</b> of that region. Jaisalmer, Ajmer and Sariska represents tropical arid climate, while Mt. Abu of tropical moist climate. The present study recommended to use vegetation biological spectrum because of proper representation of life forms of a given area. The disadvantage of floristic biological spectrum is underestimation of dominant vegetation expression and identical value to the rare species...|$|E
40|$|The natural {{vegetation}} in the State of Rio Grande do Sul {{was related to}} climatic availability through the climatic diagram of Walter and Lieth (1967). Values of mean monthly air temperature and rainfall from 41 meteorological stations during the period 1931 - 1960 were taken into account. For each meteorological station, a graph was plotted with months in the x axis and monthly air temperature and rainfall in the two y axis considering the y axis with rainfall two fold the y axis with air temperature. Results showed that Rio Grande do Sul as a whole fits in the zonobioma of warm humid temperate climate and forest vegetation. These results indicate the <b>phytoclimate</b> model of Walter and Lieth (1967) is not appropriate to represent the geographic distribution of the {{natural vegetation}} of the State, because this type of vegetation is not only that which covers the State that because it also parents praises...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} of life-forms of the Great Smoky Mountains flora {{is based on}} the system of Raunkiaer (1934). Realizing the {{difficulties}} involved in correlation of meteorological and climatological data with the natural occurrences of plants, Raunkiaer designed his life-form system as a means of defining what he called <b>phytoclimates.</b> The theoretical basis was a familiar one in plant geography (Cain, 1944) and may be expressed as follows: (1) Plants are limited in their capacity to endure different environmental complexes. (2) There is usually a correlation between the morphology (growth-form, life-form) of an organism and its environment, i. e., there is a morphological basis for adaptation in many if not all cases. (3) A plant, in its successful existence, represents what may be called an automatic physiological integration of all the factors of its environment. It follows, if these are general truths, that the life-forms of the plants of an area are a measure of the environmental conditions, especially climate. It remains only to find the key to the plant-climate interrelations...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} phytodiversity of Gujarat University campus and the {{surrounding}} region which forms an important green space in the urban environment of Ahmedabad city in Gujarat state, India. The extensive field surveys were {{carried out in the}} vast study area during 2004 to 2006 covering four different seasons viz. summer, winter, monsoon and spring to cover annual, biennial and perennial plants. A total of 451 species of flowering plants belonging to 338 genera and 101 families were recorded in the study area. Along with these three pteridophytes, two gymnosperms and the algae and fungi group appearing mostly in the monsoon season were also recorded in the study. Among the flowering plants, the herbs were found to be dominant, indicating they favored the climatic factors like less rainfall and high temperature in the study area. Raunkier’s biological life forms revealed the dominance of therophytes and phanerophytes, indicating ‘Thero-Phanerophytic’ <b>phytoclimate</b> in the region. The urban green spaces with such rich plant diversity need to be conserved, especially {{with the help of the}} local population, in order to maintain a good environment and biodiversity, thereby improving the overall quality of life...|$|E
40|$|We used Raunkiaer's {{system to}} {{classify}} in life-forms the vascular plants present in 12 random 25 m² quadrats of a cerrado site. The study area {{is covered by}} cerrado sensu stricto and {{is located in the}} Valério fragment, at about 22 º 13 'S and 47 º 51 'W, 760 m above sea level, in the Itirapina Ecological and Experimental Station, São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. The floristic spectrum considers the life-form of each species, while in the frequency spectrum, each species is weighted by its frequency. The vegetation spectrum does not consider the species at all, but only the individuals in each life-form class. In the floristic spectrum, the most represented life-forms were the phanerophytes and the hemicryptophytes, as in other cerrado sites. This spectrum differed significantly from Raunkiaer's normal spectrum, mainly due to under-representation of therophytes and over-representation of phanerophytes. The floristic and frequency spectra were similar, but both differed from the vegetation spectrum. We recommend the floristic spectrum when working at larger scales and a description of the <b>phytoclimate</b> is wanted. The vegetation spectrum is preferable when working at smaller scales and wanting a quantitative description of the physiognomy. The frequency spectrum is not recommended at all...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{growth and}} {{development}} directly depend on several physical variables, such as light, temperature or humidity and also indirectly through the action of pests (pathogens, insects) or pollutants. This dependency results from biological processes such as photosynthesis, mineral root absorption, stomatal opening, or disease development, responding to these physical variables. These responses are often non linear and vary accordingly to the plant organ (age, type, state). They have been introduced into function-structure plant models (FSPM) {{to be able to}} take into account make the plant environment. As FSPMs work at the organ scale, they need a description of physical variables at this organ scale, what is being called the <b>phytoclimate.</b> A characteristic of the microclimate is its spatial and temporal high heterogeneity at small scale, typically at the organ scale. This variability comes from sun and cloud movements, light penetration within the canopy (creating sun-flecks and shade-flecks), turbulent airflow and plant movements. Thus, the high variability of leaf irradiances and temperatures, mainly explained by the complex penetration of light within a canopy, have been established by several studies [1 - 3]. Figure 1 and 2 illustrate the spatial variability of these variables within a maize canopy. Figure 1 shows how sunflecks may generate high spatial variability of instantaneous measurements along a leaf. Fro...|$|E
40|$|Badlands	 are	 a	 group	 of	 landforms	 with	 some	 common	 features	 but	 diverse	 dynamics,	 depending	 mainly	 on	 climatic	and	lithological	drivers.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a floristic survey carried out in the Castelli Romani Regional Park (Rome, Central Italy) during the years 2003 - 2008, {{supplemented}} with data derived from recent literature. The Park includes part of Colli Albani, four SCIs and a SPA. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the actual floristic value of an area close to the city of Rome, yet still at medium floristic knowledge. The area has peculiar features in terms of lithomorphology (volcanic rocks, volcanic lakes), soils (andisoils, brown soils), and <b>phytoclimate</b> (Mediterranean Transitional Region, Temperate Region). The floristic list is composed of 796 units belonging to 783 species, 420 genera, and 102 families. One species, Sechium edule (Jacq.) Sw., is new to Lazio Region. The woody flora reaches 12. 06 %, while, as for the herbaceous flora, Hemicryptophytes slightly prevail over Therophytes. As regards chorotypes, together with a considerable number of Mediterranean s. l. and of European species, there are many species with wide distribution area, testifying a longlasting and deep urban impact which started many decades ago. The flora of the Park is similar enough, both in structural and geographical terms, to the flora of the volcanic district of Vico (northern Lazio Region); a detailed comparison concerning aquatic and hygrophilous flora between the two areas pointed out similar sets of rhizophyte species, whereas in the lakes of Albano and Nemi helophyte belt and wet meadows are lacking. Quite few species that are rare or extremely rare to Lazio Region or included in the Regional Red Lists of the Italian Plants were recorded. Nevertheless, some of them have a high biogeographical value (e. g., Vicia sativa subsp. incisa, Adenocarpus samniticus) or are typical of rare environments (Potamogeton sp. pl.). A test study limited to Lycopodiophyta, Ferns and allies, and Orchidaceae was carried out on ancient herbarium specimens kept in the Herbarium RO, showing that 21 units are today no longer recorded...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} the author’s {{attention}} is focused on the role and position of the phytocenosis in the ecosystem and the importance of phytoceno- logical investigations for the ecological, zoocenological and microbioceno- logical researches, and for the complex (teamwork) research of the ecosystem. The vegetable kingdom, as the only transformator of solar energy and the only of organic matter on the earth, constitutes a primarly, basic component not only of the biosphere, but also of every concrete biogeocenosis (ecosystem) on the earth. All the components of biosphere and particular ecosystems are, however, linked together with interrelations of conditionality and constant dependence (phyto-, zoo- and microbiocenosis and the biotope) in the unique process of matter and energy circulation. Thanks to this circulation, the survival and permanent regeneration of the ecosysten as a unique whole and of each of its components are made possible. Therefore, the true and complete ecological reality on the earth are only the biosphere and biogeocenosis (ecosystem), and not the phytosphere, phytocenosis and other components. When the position and role of one of the ecosystem components is separately determined, {{this does not mean that}} other components are underrated or that this is done by a conscious phylosophical or practical (research) dismemberment of the ecosystem, but that this is a methodically justified and necessary analysis of the significance of each of individual components for other components and the ecosystem as a whole. This may undoubtedly be useful not only in specialized (phytocenological, zoocenological, microbio- cenological) investigations, but also in complex investigations of the ecosystem. In addition to its basic and primary role in the metabolism of the ecosystem, the phytocenosis also represents a structurally most organized, most complex, most stable and most durable component of the ecosystem. As such, it constitutes its basis not only as regards the metabolism and structure but also the dynamics and succession. The vertical and horizontal differentiation of the ecosystem is to a large measure determined by the differentiation of the phytomass and the whole structure of the phytocenosis. Thus, for instance, the phytocenosis strata constitute the basis of biogeocenotic synusiae (Sukachev), that is, the basic structural parts of the ecosystem. But these may by further differentiated into biogeocenotic horizonts on the basis of animal and microbic species, groups and communities (Bjalovic). The time (seasonal and many-year) structure of phytocenosis and their historical successive development represent the basis for the dynamic and succession of zoo- and microbiocenoses and biotope, despite the phytocenosis dependence on other ecosystem components which obey their own laws of development and variability. As indicators of general climate, microclimate, <b>phytoclimate</b> and soil climate, and of other conditions of the biotope, the plant species, their cenotic groups (synusiae, micro- and macrocenotic complexes) and whole phytocenoses, may help analyze and differentiate the biocenosis and biotope. The bounderies of phyto-, zoo- and microbiocenoses often do not coincide, because the animal species and microorganisms and their communities are more variable and dynamic and with different manners of life and different reaction norms than the plant species and communities. In spite of this, a phytocenosis, (association) may serve as a basis for singling out, analyzing and classifying biogeocenoses, and provided that a teamwork system is employed in biocenotical investigations of concrete biogeocenoses, each particular case by itself may be solved, and in this way unique biogeocenotic types may gradually be formed. Investigations made no for by the local and foreign researches are eharakterized, on the one hand, by a very limited utilization of the results of phytocenological investigations, and on the other, by an insufficient collaboration of ecologists of different specialities in the complex study of ecosystem. And this is the task of the contemporary biocenology...|$|E
