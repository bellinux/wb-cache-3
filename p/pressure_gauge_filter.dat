40|$|Semiconductor {{devices are}} {{manufactured}} from Silicon wafers via diverse processes and application-specific equipment that requires supply of various gases. The gas supply system consists of <b>pressure</b> regulators, <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges,</b> <b>filters,</b> flow controllers, valves, fittings etc. The valves {{in this system}} are important parts for controlling and stopping the flow of gases. A wide variety of valves are used throughout the industrial world, but those used for semiconductor manufacturing require special features such as external leak-free, particle-free and dead space-free, because the extremely fine patterns formed on the high grade wafers are made with ultrapure process gases. In addition to these features, the valves must be durable enough to operate several {{tens of millions of}} cycles because of faster processing requirements with ALD applications. This research work was done to develop a highly durable diaphragm valve and to verify its durability performance via stress analysis...|$|R
40|$|Two {{proposed}} quartz fibrous filters with dissimilar {{solid volume}} fractions and thicknesses are investigated for their efficiency in removing soot aerosol particles from air. Soot particles are sourced from a candle burning in a chamber, and the tests involve 1. 5 h of continuous loading of particles at three different flow rates: 4. 5, 8. 15 and 9. 55 l/min. The fractional efficiency, morphology and pressure drop of both clean and loaded filters are studied using a scanning mobility particle sizer, scanning electron miroscope and differential <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> Both <b>filters</b> have relatively similar levels of efficiency 93...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The 11 March 2011 (Mw = 9. 0) Tohoku tsunami was {{recorded}} by a temporary array of seafloor <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> deployed {{off the coast}} of Southern California, demonstrating how dense array data can illustrate and empirically validate predictions of linear tsunami wave propagation characteristics. A noise cross-correlation method was used to first correct for the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> instrument phase response. Phase and group travel times were then measured for the first arrival in the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> tsunami waveforms <b>filtered</b> in narrow bands around 30 periods between 200 and 3000 s. For each period, phase velocities were estimated across the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> array based on the phase travel time gradient using eikonal tomography. Clear correlation was observed between the phase velocity and long-wavelength bathymetry variations where fast and slow velocities occurred for deep and shallow water regions, respectively. In particular, velocity gradients are pronounced at the Patton Escarpment and near island plateaus due to the abrupt bathymetry change. In the deep open ocean area, clear phase velocity dispersion is observed. Comparison with numerically calculated tsunami waveforms validates the approach and provides an independent measure of the finite-frequency effect on phase velocities at long periods. 1...|$|R

40|$|The valve and the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> {{of a gas}} {{ion laser}} were {{electrically}} insulated from the laser discharge path by connecting them in series with the cathode of the laser. The laser cathode can be grounded and preferably is a cold cathode although a hot cathode may be used instead. The cold cathode was provided with a central aperture to which was connected both the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> and the gas pressure reservoir through the valve.

40|$|Abstract. Vacuum system set-up is {{presented}} {{and used for}} calibration of <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> {{in the region of}} rough vacuum, from 103 mbar to 10 - 1 mbar, with dry air. The capacitance manometer is used for the calibration of piezoresistant manometer, oil, mercury and mercury micrometers U manometers. The applicability of the experimental set-up and obtained results for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> calibration in the medium and high vacuum region is approved. It was shown how calibration of some cheaper <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> might be performed and reliable measurements of the pressure may be made in the region that is of interest for atomic and molecular collision physics and low-pressure gas discharges. It was also shown that mentioned calibration procedure could be used for calibration of different U manometer types in order to renormalize older atomic and molecular collision data.

40|$|Abstract. For {{a case of}} constant-rate liquid {{production}} from a single well centered in a horizontal, homogeneous-acting, isopachous, and infinite reservoir, based on fundamentals of fluid flow in porous media the bottom hole flowing pressure never stabilize. In the process of field well testing, however, pressure values measured by the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> which has a definite resolution value will not change after a period, so the bottom hole flowing pressure can {{be considered to be}} stabilized. According to this situation, through theoretical derivation, a stabilized time formula is firstly proposed, by which the time after which the bottom hole flowing pressure measured with a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> will be stabilized can be calculated, and the stabilized time for a given <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is in direct proportion to the liquid producing rate, but in inverse proportion to the resolution ratio of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> Applied the stabilized time formula, a new formula of detectable radius can be derived, by which the effect of resolution of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> can be considered. Secondly, the time after which the value of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> measured in the bottom hole of the observation well starts to change during interference testing is obtained, and the time is related to the fluid flow rate and the distance between the producing well and the observation well. The conclusion can be applied as a reference in the design process of working system during well testing...|$|R
