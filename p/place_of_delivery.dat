25|$|Most {{truck drivers}} are {{employed}} as over-the-road drivers, meaning they are hired to drive long distances {{from the place}} of pickup to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> During the short times while they are in heavily polluted urban areas, being inside the cab of the truck contributes much to avoiding the inhalation of toxic emissions, and on {{the majority of the}} trip, while they are passing through vast rural areas where there is little air pollution, truck drivers in general enjoy less exposure to toxic emissions in the air than the inhabitants of large cities, where there is an increased exposure to emissions from engines, factories, etc., which may increase the risk of cancer and can aggravate certain lung diseases, such as asthma in the general public who inhabit these cities. However, the few drivers who are hired to drive only within urban areas do not have this advantage of spending more time away from toxic emissions that is enjoyed by over-the-road drivers. Other conditions affecting the health of truck drivers are for example vibration, noise, long periods of sitting, work stress and exhaustion. For drivers in developing countries there are additional risks because roads are in appalling conditions and accidents occur more frequently. Truck drivers are even a high-risk group for HIV-infection in those countries.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to understand how judges and other governmental entities decide what speech to limit in regards to time, place, and manner. As previously stated, in order for the Supreme Court and other governmental entities to impose time, place, and manner restrictions, they must decide that the restrictions are content neutral, narrowly tailored, serve a significant governmental interest, and allow other alternative methods of communication. If the restrictions can pass these four requirements, they will align with the First Amendment restriction provisions. Of course, these restrictions will vary from case to case. Ideally, suppressing speech is considered wrong, but in some cases, it is necessary to restrict speech for the greater good of society. It must be decided that the speech is a nuisance in regards to its time, <b>place,</b> or manner <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> such as creating a clear and present danger.

40|$|Background: Antenatal {{care is a}} very {{important}} component of maternal health services. It provides the opportunity to learn about risks associated with pregnancy and guides to plan the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> thereby preventing maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. In ‘Pakistan’ antenatal services to rural population are being provided through a network of primary health care facilities designated as 2 ̆ 7 Basic Health Units and Rural Health Centers. Pakistan is a developing country, consisting of four provinces and federally administered areas. Each province is administratively subdivided in to ‘Divisions’ and ‘Districts’. By population ‘Punjab’ is the largest province of Pakistan having 36 districts. This study was conducted to assess the coverage and quality antenatal care in the primary health care facilities in ‘Punjab’ province of ‘Pakistan’. Methods: Quantitative and Qualitative methods were used to collect data. Using multistage sampling technique nine out of thirty six districts were selected and 19 primary health care facilities of public sector (seventeen Basic Health Units and two Rural Health Centers were randomly selected from each district.

To assess knowledge about danger signs of obstetric complications and associated factors among postnatal mothers at Mechekel district health centers, East Gojjam zone, Northwest Ethiopia, 2014. Methods. An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from August to October, 2014, in Mechekel district health centers. Systematic random sampling was used to select four hundred eleven study participants. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were entered to Epi Info version 3. 5. 3 and exported to SPSS 20. 0 for further analysis. Descriptive and summary statistics were done. Logistic regression analyses were used to see the association of different variables. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence interval were computed to determine the presence and strength of association. Results. According to this study, 55. 1 % participants were knowledgeable about danger signs of obstetric complications. Maternal and husband educational level ((AOR = 1. 977, 95 % CI: 1. 052, 3. 716) and (AOR = 3. 163, 95 % CI: 1. 860, 5. 3770), resp.), family monthly income ≥ 1500 (AOR = 2. 954, 95 % CI: 1. 289, 6. 770), being multipara (AOR = 7. 463, 95 % CI: 1. 301, 12. 800), ANC follow-up during last pregnancy (AOR = 2. 184, 95 % CI: 1. 137, 4. 196), and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> last <b>delivery</b> (AOR = 1. 955, 95 % CI: 1. 214, 3. 150) were variables found to be significantly associated with women’s knowledge on danger signs of obstetric complications.

40|$|As in {{the rest}} of Europe, the supply of {{maternity}} hospitals has progressively decreased {{over the past few decades}} in France. An understanding of user choice criteria is important to help health planners reorganize obstetrical services and to predict changes in utilization patterns in response to supply changes. The objectives were to understand the criteria that women use to select their maternity hospital in France and to analyse the relation to individual and community characteristics. A survey of 536 recently delivered women with low-risk pregnancies explored the factors motivating user choice in three territories with distinct geographical and health service supply characteristics: four districts in Burgundy, two districts in Pays de la Loire, and the district of Seine-Saint-Denis in Ile-de-France. Women were asked to select a principal choice criterion. Their responses were grouped into categories: Accessibility/proximity, reputation of the establishment among users, advice of treating physician, technical quality and cost. Accessibility and proximity were the most selected criteria (33 %), followed by the reputation of the maternity (29 %), technical quality (15 %) and advice of treating physician (13 %). Age, parity and education influenced choice criteria. After controlling for individual determinants, region of residence was highly related to choice criteria; women living in Burgundy were more likely to select an establishment based on proximity, in Seine-Saint-Denis women were more likely to follow the advice of their physician, and in Pays de la Loire, more likely to base their decisions on the reputation of the establishment. The association between choice criteria and community characteristics could explain the failure of previous models to predict behaviour in different contexts. It is important to carry out local surveys of user perceptions before restructuring in order to take into consideration women's opinions on their future <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> and to refine geographic models.

40|$|In {{this study}} we explore the views of NHS {{stakeholders}} on providing paediatric ‘care closer to home’ (CCTH), in community-based outpatient clinics delivered by consultants. Design: Semi-structured interviews and thematic framework analysis. Setting: UK specialist children's hospital and surrounding primary care trusts. Participants: 37 NHS stakeholders including healthcare professionals, managers, commissioners and executive team members. Results: Participants acknowledged that outreach clinics would involve a change in traditional ways of working and that the physical setting of the clinic would influence aspects of professional practice. Different models of CCTH were discussed, as were alternatives for improving access to specialist care. Participants supported CCTH as a good principle for paediatric outpatient services; however the challenges of setting up and maintaining community clinics meant they questioned how far it could be achieved in practice. Conclusions: The <b>place</b> <b>of</b> service <b>delivery</b> is both an issue of physical location and professional identity.
