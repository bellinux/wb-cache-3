5000|$|In 1836:"this theatre, {{planned and}} erected by Mr William Washburn, is 120 by 76 ft, {{exclusive}} of the saloons, refreshment rooms, &c., which {{are contained in}} an adjoining building, 20 by 60 ft, fronting on Traverse Street, and communicating with the lobbies. The leading architectural features are Doric presenting brood pilasters with slight projections on the front which support an.unbroken entablature and a pediment, 18 ft high at each end. The roof is covered with slate and zinc, and is surmounted by an octagonal lantern, 12 ft in diameter and 18 ft high, having a window on each of its sides. The structure is covered on the exterior walls with cement, in imitation' of granite, which gives a uniform and beautiful appearance. The interior comprises a pit, with 600 seats, three tiers of boxes, with 336 seats each, and a gallery with 200 seats. The saloons, lobbies, refreshment rooms, &c. are spacious, convenient and well ventilated by large windows on the two streets and in rear. The boxes have five rows of seats each, and are accessible from both streets, affording, in case of fire or other cause of alarm, ready egress from the house. The main roof is supported by 18 hard pine pillars, 36 ft high and 10 inches square, which also support {{a portion of the}} boxes, and divide them from the lobbies. The remaining boxes are supported by 2 octagonal pillars of the same material, 9 inches in diameter. The main ceiling is a single arch, of 55 ft span, rising within 9 ft of the ridge. The gallery is entirely above the level cornice of the building, having an arched ceiling which rises five feet higher than the main ceiling, and is ventilated by a large round window placed in the centre of the tympanum. The <b>proscenium</b> presents an <b>opening</b> 40 ft wide and 33 ft high. It is composed of pilasters, having ornamented capitals and bases, which support a beautifully enriched arch, crowned with the American eagle. The depth of the stage is 61 ft. The circle of boxes is so arranged, that in every part of the house a full view is had of the stage. The decorations are in good taste. The lower tier of boxes is adorned with paintings of the battles of the United States Navy; the second tier bears the arms of the States, and the upper parts have appropriate scenes from the Iliads." ...|$|R
50|$|It had a {{capacity}} of 1,892 seats divided as follows: 799 orchestra (floor) seats, 537 balcony seats, 478 gallery seats and 78 box seats. The stage had a <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> of 34x28 ft. and a 4 ft. apron. The theatre was equipped with 110 A.C. electricity and the backstage area featured 12 dressing rooms.|$|E
50|$|In theatre, a box set is a {{set with}} a {{proscenium}} arch stage and three walls. The <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> is the fourth wall. Box sets {{create the illusion of}} an interior room on the stage, and are contrasted with earlier forms of sets in which sliding flats with gaps between them created an illusion of perspective.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, it is a {{requirement}} that a safety curtain must be fully down within the <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> within 30 seconds of being released. In 1794 the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane became the first theatre to feature an iron safety curtain. Several other serious fires, notably that at the Theatre Royal, Exeter in 1887, led {{to the introduction of}} safety curtains on a wider scale.|$|E
50|$|Light ladder battens are {{a special}} type of {{electric}} batten oriented perpendicular to {{and beyond the}} <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening,</b> at the stage wings. They suspend light ladders (pipe frames) to which lighting fixtures may be attached. When provided, light ladder battens are usually of the truss type and may be fitted with heavy-duty track to permit repositioning of the light ladders up and down stage.|$|E
50|$|Line sets often suspend theater drapes {{and stage}} {{curtains}} such as travelers, teasers (a.k.a. borders), legs, cycs, scrim and tabs, {{as well as}} associated tracks, in order to mask and frame the stage and provide backdrops. Line sets are sometimes dedicated to particular draperies, such as the main (grand) curtain and main border (valance) that mask the <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening,</b> but drapery locations can often vary.|$|E
50|$|Drapes {{that hang}} {{at the sides}} of the stage {{perpendicular}} to the <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> to mask the wings are known as Tabs (outside of the UK), as shown in the drawing {{at the top of this}} page. In the UK (where Tabs refers to a different type of drape), these curtains have other names, often Up & Downers (as unlike most drapery that runs across stage, these run from upstage to downstage).|$|E
50|$|James K. Polk Theater is amazingly {{intimate}} for its size, with a {{seating capacity}} of 1,075 seats, including 44 pit seats. The stage {{is more than}} 87 feet by 50 feet, with a <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> of nearly 47 feet by 30 feet. The theater features spacious wings and expansive fly space. Up to 86 performers can be accommodated in 10 dressing rooms, including one quick change room and two high-capacity choral spaces.|$|E
50|$|Originally seating 1,598 {{people in}} a single auditorium, the cinema was {{subdivided}} into three auditoria in 1982, when {{the interior of the}} building was refurbished. The new Cinema Screen 1 consisted of the original circle area, with a brand new screen, which now sat an extra 482. Cinema Screen 2 had 208 seats in the old front stalls and used the original <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening.</b> Cinema Screen 3 had 90 seats in the old rear stalls.|$|E
50|$|The Main Stage is {{the largest}} of the theatres in the complex with a {{capacity}} of 1014 seats. (759 Orchestra and 255 Balcony). The theatre is outfitted with state-of-the-art sound and lighting systems. The theatre is accessible on the ground and second level atrium lobbies and via elevator. The stage is 45 ft deep by 100 ft wide, with a 48 ft <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening.</b> There is room for a total of 30 wheelchairs and 31 companion seats.|$|E
50|$|Built as a {{flexible}} and versatile performance space the Bank of America Theatre seats between 230 and 400 people, {{depending on the}} configuration. The venue features a full working stage house of 55 ft., a <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> of 36 ft. wide, and 1914 sq ft. of stage space. The space can also be converted to a thrust or full round performance venue by extending the stage {{into the middle of}} the audience chamber. In addition, an exposed catwalk system allows lighting from all angles.|$|E
5000|$|Andrew Jackson Hall is {{the largest}} of TPAC's {{multi-purpose}} theaters with a seating capacity of 2,472 seats, including 47 pit seats. The stage is more than 130 feet wide by 53 feet deep. The stage has a <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> of more than 57 feet by 36 feet. Up to 112 performers can be accommodated in 14 dressing rooms, including a star suite, two onstage quick change rooms, and high-capacity choral spaces. Expansive wings, fly space, rigging and catwalks provide for productions of every kind - from Broadway's biggest tours to award shows, stylish television specials, and major concerts.|$|E
5000|$|The theater's {{auditorium}} {{design was}} progressive for its day and was reminiscent of Louis H. Sullivan's 1891 Schiller Theatre in Chicago. From the <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening,</b> {{a series of}} concentric arches dotted with incandescent electric lights radiate into the house, resulting in superior lighting and excellent acoustics. Built to be self-sufficient, the theater, {{one of the first}} commercial buildings in Columbus to use electricity, generated its own power. Additionally, the building had three wells in the basement, from which it produced its own water supply. The theatre currently seats 933 and is an intimate [...] "jewel box" [...] type theater with two balconies.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{the demise}} of the Astor Opera House that spurred New York's elite to build a new opera house in what was then the more genteel {{neighborhood}} of Union Square, led by Moses H.

50|$|This new theatre {{was very}} small on a small site and could only seat 881 in total, with 197 in the stalls, 220 in the pit, 84 in the Dress Circle, and 350 in the gallery {{at the rear of}} the dress circle with its own {{entrance}} from Gordon Road. There were two boxes which seated 30 in total on each side at Dress Circle level, with elaborate plasterwork on the dress circle and box fronts. The <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> was 24 feet wide and 26 feet deep with the flies 32 feet high. In addition there were eight dressing rooms, a manager's office and a band room with the stalls, pit and circle each having its own licensed bar.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{new sound}} films (nicknamed [...] "talkies"), plans to include a stage for {{vaudeville}} and stage shows were abandoned. Instead, a small [...] "sound stage" [...] was built {{to the back of}} the <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> to house the screen and [...] "newfangled" [...] speakers. If the [...] "talkies" [...] were just a fad, the sound stage could easily be replaced with a full stage house with the usual complement of dressing rooms, proper rooms, fly space for the scenery and the like. The talking pictures soon became the norm, and, in 1932, all motion picture studios stopped making silent pictures, thus sounding the death knell for vaudeville and stage shows.|$|E

5000|$|The Margaret and Al Hill Performance Hall is a 1,563-seat venue, and {{is noted}} {{as one of}} the largest stage areas in the DFW Metroplex. The {{construction}} of this hall was designed to meet the production needs for any performing arts group producing dance, opera, musical theatre as well as other events. By featuring a full working stage house, an adjustable <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening,</b> orchestra pit and lift, customized Wenger orchestra shell, 4815 sq ft. of stage space, wood sprung floor and a full lighting and sound package, the Hill Performance Hall can accommodate most any production. The audience chamber was built with acoustically sculpted natural wood-clad walls which assist in diminishing sound vibrations for symphonic music, dance, theatre, opear and a wide range of concerts and other events.|$|E

The auditorium will be lighted during the showing of the picture, and the screen placed back on a thoroughly darkened stage about 18 feet from the <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening.</b> The throw will be made through the auditorium onto the screen, a distance of about 70 feet. It is my understanding that the best light effect is produced where the amperage is high and the voltage low, or the reverse. Will you be good enough to tell me just what voltage and amperage of direct current will be the very best? I can use up to 220 volts, and any amperage I like. I have no desire to economize on the light. I want the best effect, that is all." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo or the Main Theater is {{the largest}} {{performance}} venue inside the Tanghalang Pambansa. It can accommodate up to 1,815 people in four levels: Orchestra, Boxes and two Balconies. The stage is 25 m from the main curtain line to the back wall and 38.8 m from the left wall to the right. The <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> has a height of 9 m and width of 18 m. A 5.6388 m deep orchestra pit contains two elevators that can accommodate up to 62 musicians. The stage floor, unwaxed and painted matte-black (originally not stained), is made from a species of Philippine Mahogany. The main stage curtain is patterned after the painting Genesis, a work of National Artist Hernando Ocampo. A variable acoustics hall designed by Bolt, Beranek and Newman, the Main Theater was planned for flexibility. It was built to accommodate sound requirements of various types of presentations, and can typically hold opera and orchestra performances without further amplification. New York Times critic Howard Taubman praised the theater's acoustical flexibility in his review of the center's opening night, writing that the architect and his team seem to have built a venue [...] "that will be equally congenial for drama, instrumental and vocal music and dance." ...|$|E
50|$|Hockney's first opera designs, for Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in England in 1975 and The Magic Flute (1978) {{were painted}} drops. In 1981, {{he agreed to}} design sets and costumes for three 20th-century French works at the Metropolitan Opera House with the title Parade. The works were Parade, a ballet with music by Erik Satie; Les mamelles de Tirésias, an opera with {{libretto}} by Guillaume Apollinaire and music by Francis Poulenc, and L'enfant et les sortilèges, an opera with libretto by Colette and music by Maurice Ravel. The set for L'enfant et les sortilèges is a permanent installation at the Spalding House branch of the Honolulu Museum of Art. He designed sets for Puccini's Turandot in 1991 at the Chicago Lyric Opera and a Richard Strauss Die Frau ohne Schatten in 1992 at the Royal Opera House in London. In 1994, he designed costumes and scenery for twelve opera arias for the TV broadcast of Plácido Domingo's Operalia in Mexico City. Technical advances allowed him to become increasingly complex in model-making. At his studio he had a <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> 6 ft by 4 ft in which he built sets in 1:8 scale. He also used a computerised setup that let him punch in and program lighting cues at will and synchronise them to a soundtrack of the music.|$|E
50|$|The {{campus is}} home to several museums {{containing}} exhibits from many different fields of study. BYU's Museum of Art, for example, {{is one of the}} largest and most attended art museums in the Mountain West. This Museum aids in academic pursuits of students at BYU via research and study of the artworks in its collection. The Museum is also open to the general public and provides educational programming. The Museum of Peoples and Cultures is a museum of archaeology and ethnology. It focuses on native cultures and artifacts of the Great Basin, American Southwest, Mesoamerica, Peru, and Polynesia. Home to more than 40,000 artifacts and 50,000 photographs, it documents BYU's archaeological research. The Museum of Paleontology was built in 1976 to display the many fossils found by BYU's Dr. James A. Jensen. It holds many artifacts from the Jurassic Period (210-140 million years ago), and is one of the top five collections in the world of fossils from that time period. It has been featured in magazines, newspapers, and on television internationally. The museum receives about 25,000 visitors every year. The Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum was formed in 1978. It features several forms of plant and animal life on display and available for research by students and scholars. The campus also houses several performing arts facilities, several of which are found in the Franklin S. Harris Fine Arts Center.

40|$|In {{an opera}} house {{the main hall}} and the stagehouse can be {{regarded}} as a typical example of acoustically coupled volumes. In this case the coupling is regulated by the <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening.</b> As a consequence the modifications in the stagehouse can have an significant impact on the hall. In particular an excess of reverberation is to be expected if the stage set is particularly acoustically light or, even worse, if the volume of the tower is increased for some reason. In this respect several technical and logistic requirements imply an increase of the stagehouse volume when theatres are refurbished. This seldom happens {{especially in the case of}} historical opera houses to optimize the change and storage of modern settings. In order to study the coupled the gathering of suitable experimental data for arranging a reliable calculation model requires special efforts.

40|$|A {{prescriptive}} and performance-based {{fire and}} life safety evaluation for Christopher Cohan Center is performed. The results and {{findings of the}} evaluations are conveyed in this report. Christopher Cohan Center was built in accordance with California Building Code (1992 Edition) and California Fire Code (1992 Edition). The current version (2015) of International Building Code is consulted for prescriptive evaluation. The protection requirements set forth in IBC are intended to limit the threat from stage fires to an audience, to {{reduce the likelihood of}} a large fire in the stage area and to reduce the possibility of irrational mass response. These objectives have been identified as primary parameters to evaluate the fire and life safety systems of the building. Christopher Cohan Center was constructed of Type IB construction with a sprinkler system throughout the building. Legitimate stage is completely separated from seating by a proscenium wall of 2 -hour fire-rated construction with the main <b>proscenium</b> <b>opening</b> protected by an automatic closing fire protection curtain in accordance with IBC 410. 3. 5. A wet pipe, hydraulically calculated automatic sprinkler system is provided throughout the building. A hydraulic calculation was performed in accordance with NFPA 13, which shows that, the city water supply is not adequate for the sprinkler system and hose stream demands. The main exit of the Sydney Harman Hall accommodates a total occupant load of 1, 440, which is more than the total occupant load of the hall, 1, 289. This arrangement complies with IBC section 1029. 2. In addition to having access to a main exit, Christopher Cohan Center is provided with additional exits from the balcony level, gallery level, orchestra stage, and entry lobby. These exits provide an egress capacity of 5, 280 persons from orchestra stage and entry lobby levels and 960 persons from balcony and gallery levels, which are more than the total occupant loads served by an individual level. In the event of an alarm, Christopher Cohan Center Ushers are required to assist in the evacuation process. A fast-growing fire is modeled in FDS, which shows activation of gravity vents between 349 and 436 seconds, fire protection curtain activation at 440 s, and first sprinkler activation at 498 second after ignition. The tenability criterion is established to be the smoke layer descend within 2 m. above any means of egress. This criterion is predicted to occur at 210 s. in the zone model. FDS model does not predict smoke layer to descend within 2 m. above any means of egress, within the simulation time (570 s.). FDS model also shows that, the proscenium structure can contain the smoke until 300 s. FDS predicts the smoke detector will activate at 274 second. The notification of the fire event is expected to be triggered by the rapid descend of smoke layer, possibly shading or obscuring lighting effects dropped from the grid-iron, or by occupants, present in the fly gallery, sensing the presence of smoke, can initiate the notification of the fire event by activating manual fire alarm, long before the automatic detection devices detect the fire cues and initiate activation of the fire alarm. Based on the evaluation of the building and stage construction, the stage construction and fire separation play key-role in limiting the threat from a stage-fire to the audience due to its containment of smoke long enough for the audience to evacuate the hall. It can also be confirmed that the installed systems will not perform to meet the performance criteria. The building would be relying on human actions to detect fire, to annunciate, and to suppress the fire. To reduce the likelihood of a large fire in the stage area human intervention would be a crucial factor. Also, the collective effort of the egress system and human-assistance {{play a crucial role in}} evacuation process, which contributes to ensure minimal exposure to the fire environment. Due to effective evacuation and egress system, the possibility of irrational mass response is expected to be minimal. Recommendations include the incorporation of a fire pump based on the hydraulic demand for the most challenging design area. Proper inspection, testing and maintenance of the suppression systems is required, in accordance with specified standards. Additional requirements specified in the fire safety management plan must be included in the ‘Emergency Management Plan’ for Christopher Cohan Center. This includes engaging dedicated fire watch personnel and crowd managers during events, and incorporating specified employee training and response procedures along with all the emergency management procedures that are currently in place...|$|E
