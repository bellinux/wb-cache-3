5|$|The {{story begins}} with a quiet, {{sensitive}} 15-year-old boy named Charlie writing letters about his life to an unknown recipient. Charlie chooses that <b>person</b> <b>because</b> {{he said that he}} heard the person was nice and thought that this person would not be judgmental. He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.|$|E
5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased <b>person</b> <b>because</b> {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

5000|$|In English {{and other}} European languages, the {{principal}} means of distinguishing between multiple third-person referents is using gender or (lack of) reflexive. Thus, in [...] "she saw him," [...] {{it is clear}} that there are two third <b>persons</b> <b>because</b> they are of different genders. In [...] "she saw her," [...] {{it is clear that}} there are two third <b>persons</b> <b>because</b> otherwise, one would say [...] "she saw herself." [...] However, [...] "she saw her mother" [...] is ambiguous: it could mean that she saw her own mother or that she saw someone else's mother.|$|R

This is often conveyed {{to the children of}} military personnel. Two brats whose parents have a subordinate-supervisory relationship can cause problems for both their parents.|$|E

Xiang Yu was slightly taller than eight chi (approximately 1.85 metres, about 6' 1") and possessed unusual physical strength as he could lift a ding (an ancient Chinese vessel resembling a giant cauldron on tripods).|$|E

25|$|There {{simply is}} no such thing among us as a {{doctrine}} of blood atonement that grants a remission of sins or confers any other benefit upon a <b>person</b> <b>because</b> his own blood is shed for sins.

25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy <b>person</b> <b>because</b> he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not have to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E
25|$|In Redemption Ark, Skade and Clavain {{independently}} encounter technology {{captured by}} the Mademoiselle, that permits the alteration of a ship's inertial mass in order to permit high-g acceleration for interstellar travel. It works by suppressing fluctuations and turmoil in quantum foam that supposedly causes momentum and inertia (similar {{to the concept of}} Higgs Bosons). It is also mentioned in that the technology may have been linked to the alien tower (in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days). Skade tries to modify the technology with the help of Exordium to allow faster than light travel, via a state transition from tardyonic to tachyonic, but her efforts are spectacularly unsuccessful, and the technology itself has the side effect of removing individuals caught in the transition bubbles from all recent history, as well as crippling her ship. Only those very close to the area of effect remember a person who is erased or unravelled backwards in time and recorded history indicates a much earlier death of that <b>person.</b> <b>Because</b> the victims (the deleted and nearby observers) are the only thing that remain from the time line where the victims began, people suddenly panicking and searching for a 'colleague' who died years before (in the new timeframe) can be the only sign of an accident. This happens at least twice in the novels. The Inhibitors make reference to a similar effect erasing entire species from history. As such, neither they nor any other species in the galaxy with the technology to build inertia suppressing drives ever use them to travel faster than light.|$|E

500|$|Through {{the final}} storyline of the film, set in 2012, Kohli wanted to {{demonstrate}} a modern romance, which mostly happens through SMS, instant messaging apps, and Internet chat. Kohli described it by saying, [...] "Today people flirt, communicate and connect through smses and you get that feeling of being with somebody even when you are not with that <b>person</b> <b>because</b> that person is telling you everything that is happening in their life.
