5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or <b>phenylpropanolamine.</b> It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Urinary incontinence* is leakage of urine, usually due to {{incompetence}} of the urethral sphincter {{in adult}} dogs and ectopic ureter (a congenital {{condition in which}} the ureter enters the urinary tract posterior to the urethral sphincter) in puppies. In adult dogs it is most commonly seen in large spayed females. The lack of estrogens in spayed dogs {{has been linked to}} development of incontinence. Replacement of estrogens, <b>phenylpropanolamine,</b> and surgery have all been used for treatment.|$|E
25|$|Certain drugs {{increase}} the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated {{in the cause of}} déjà vu. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs amantadine and <b>phenylpropanolamine</b> together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.|$|E
2500|$|Congress {{passed the}} Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 ("CMEA") as an {{amendment}} to the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act. Signed into law by president George W.

The law mandated two phases, the first needing to be implemented by April 8, 2006, and the second to be completed by September 30, 2006. The first phase dealt primarily with implementing the new buying restrictions based on amount, while the second phase encompassed the requirements of storage, employee training, and record keeping.

Substances that may cause this toxidrome include salbutamol, amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine (Ma Huang), methamphetamine, <b>phenylpropanolamine</b> (PPA's), and pseudoephedrine. It may appear {{very similar to the}} anticholinergic toxidrome, but is distinguished by hyperactive bowel sounds and sweating.|$|E
50|$|Ephedrine is a {{sympathomimetic}} amine and substituted amphetamine. It {{is similar}} in molecular structure to <b>phenylpropanolamine,</b> methamphetamine, and epinephrine (adrenaline). Chemically, it is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). It works mainly by increasing the activity of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on adrenergic receptors. It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt.|$|E
