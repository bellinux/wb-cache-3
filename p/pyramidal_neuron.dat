25|$|A place cell {{is a type}} of <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neuron</b> {{within the}} {{hippocampus}} that becomes active when an animal enters a particular place in its environment; this place is known as the place field. A given place cell will have only one, or a few, place fields in a typical small laboratory environment, but more in a larger region. There is no apparent topography to the pattern of place fields, unlike other brain areas such as visual cortex—neighboring place cells are as likely to have nearby fields as distant ones. In a different environment, typically about half the place cells will still have place fields, but these will be in new places unrelated to their former locations.|$|E
2500|$|Representation of the {{networks}} own output structures, by which represents its own information message, is Orpwood's explanation that grounds the manifestation of qualia via neurobiological mechanisms. These mechanisms are particular to [...] networks of pyramidal neurons. Although computational neuroscience still has much to investigate regarding pyramidal neurons, their complex circuitry is relatively unique. Research shows that the complexity of <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neuron</b> networks {{is directly related to}} the increase in the functional capabilities of a species. When human pyramidal networks are compared with other primate species and species with less intricate behavioral and social interactions, the complexity of these neural networks drastically decline. The complexity of these networks are also increased in frontal brain regions. These regions are often associated with conscious assessment and modification of one's immediate environment; often referred to as executive functions. Sensory input is necessary to gain information from the environment, and perception of that input is necessary for navigating and modifying interactions with the environment. This suggests that frontal regions containing more complex pyramidal networks are associated with an increased perceptive capacity. As perception is necessary for conscious thought to occur, and since the experience of qualia is derived from consciously recognizing some perception, qualia may indeed be specific to the functional capacity of pyramidal networks. This derives Orpwood's notion that the mechanisms of re-entrant feedback may not only create qualia, but also be the foundation to consciousness.|$|E

We have previously shown that the spiking {{patterns of}} layer 5 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> change with temperature, probably because temperature modulates the electrical coupling between somatic and dendritic compartments. Here we determine whether temperature has similar effects on the spiking patterns of layer 2 / 3 and layer 6 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> in acute slices of mouse primary motor cortex. In both cell types, decreasing temperature led to more irregular spiking patterns. Our results indicate that a decrease in spiking regularity with decreasing temperature, probably mediated by increased electrical coupling between soma and dendrites, is common to all <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> in motor cortex...|$|R

40|$|In <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> such as hippocampal area CA 1 and basolateral amygdala, a slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) {{follows a}} burst of action potentials, which is a {{powerful}} regulator of neuronal excitability. The sAHP amplitude increases with aging and may underlie age related memory decline. The sAHP {{is due to a}} Ca 2 +-dependent, voltage-independent K+ conductance, the molecular identity of which has remained elusive until a recent report suggested the Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel, IK 1 (KCNN 4) as the sAHP channel in CA 1 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> The signature pharmacology of IK 1, blockade by TRAM- 34, was reported for the sAHP and underlying current. We have examined the sAHP and find no evidence that TRAM- 34 affects either the current underling the sAHP or excitability of CA 1 or basolateral amygdala <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> In addition, CA 1 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> from IK 1 null mice exhibit a characteristic sAHP current.

40|$|The {{postnatal}} development and lifespan alterations in basal dendrites of large layer IIIC and layer V <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> were quantitatively studied. Both classes of neurons {{were characterized by}} rapid dendritic growth during the first postnatal months. At birth, layer V <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> had larger and more complex dendritic trees than those of layer IIIC; however, at 1 postnatal month both classes of neurons displayed a similar extent of dendritic outgrowth. In addition, after a more than year-long "dormant" period of only fine dendritic rearrangement, layer IIIC <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> displayed a second period of dendritic growth, starting {{at the end of}} the second year and continuing in the third year. During that period, the dendritic tree of layer IIIC <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> became more extensive than that of layer V <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> Thus, layer IIIC <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> appear to show a biphasic pattern of postnatal dendritic development. Furthermore, the childhood period was characterized by transient increase in size of pyramidal cell somata, which was more pronounced for neurons in layer IIIC. These structural changes occurred during both the period of rapid cognitive development in preschool children and the period of protracted cognitive maturation during the childhood, puberty, and adolescence. © The Author 2007.

5000|$|... #Caption: Hypothesized Propagation of Activity in Human Neocortex: An action {{potential}} in a <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neuron</b> (cell 1) elicits {{a spike in}} a chandelier cell (2) via a strong connection, in turn evoking a third-order spike in a downstream pyramidal cell (3). This spike results in a trisynaptic EPSP being recorded in a postsynaptic pyramidal cell (cell 4, event A). At the same time, cell 3 drives both a basket cell (5) and chandelier cell (6) to threshold. The basket cell evokes a hyperpolarizing IPSP on the postsynaptically recorded pyramidal cell (cell 4, event B), four synapses removed from the original spike. The spiking chandelier cell (6) triggers yet another <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neuron</b> to fire (7), which produces an EPSP on the recorded neuron (cell 4, event C), five synapses away from the original spike. The result seen in the postsynaptic <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neuron</b> (cell 4) is a delayed EPSP-IPSP-EPSP sequence (events A, B, and C), traveling through three, four, and five synapses respectively. Molnár et al. propose that polysynaptic pathways similar to this one can be activated by a single {{action potential}} in a cortical pyramidal cell.|$|E
40|$|Serotonin exerts a {{powerful}} influence on neuronal excitability. In this study, we investigated {{the effects of}} serotonin on different neuronal populations in prefrontal cortex (PFC), a major area controlling emotion and cognition. Using whole-cell recordings in PFC slices, we found that bath application of 5 -HT dose-dependently increased the firing of FS (fast spiking) interneurons, and decreased the firing of <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> The enhancing effect of 5 -HT in FS interneurons was mediated by 5 -HT 2 receptors, while the reducing effect of 5 -HT in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> was mediated by 5 -HT 1 receptors. Fluoxetine, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, also induced a concentration-dependent increase in the excitability of FS interneurons, but {{had little effect on}} <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> In rats with chronic fluoxetine treatment, the excitability of FS interneurons was significantly increased, while <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> remained unchanged. Fluoxetine injection largely occluded the enhancing effect of 5 -HT in FS interneurons, but did not alter the reducing effect of 5 -HT in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> These data suggest that the excitability of PFC interneurons and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> is regulated by exogenous 5 -HT in an opposing manner, and FS interneurons are the major target of Fluoxetine. It provides a framework for understanding the action of 5 -HT and antidepressants in altering PFC network activity...|$|R

Knocking down Zfp 312 with small interfering RNAs dramatically {{reduced the number of}} subcortical axonal projections from deep-layer <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> and altered their dendritic morphology. In contrast, misexpression of Zfp 312 in cortically projecting <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> of layers II and III induced the expression of Tbr 1, a transcription factor enriched in deep-layer neurons, and the formation of ectopic subcortical axonal projections. Thus, our results indicate that transcription factor Zfp 312 plays a critical role in layer- and neuronal subtype-specific patterning of cortical axonal projections and dendritic morphologies...|$|R

40|$|In CA 1 and neocortical <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons,</b> Ih {{is present}} {{primarily}} in the dendrites. We asked if all <b>neurons</b> of a <b>pyramidal</b> morphology have a similar density of Ih. We characterized a novel class of hippocampal <b>neurons</b> with <b>pyramidal</b> morphology found in the stratum radiatum, which we termed the ‘pyramidal-like principal’ (PLP) neuron. Morphological similarities to <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> were verified by filling the neurons with biocytin. PLPs did not stain for markers associated with interneurons, and projected to both the septum and olfactory bulb. By using cell-attached patch-clamp recordings, we found that these neurons expressed a high density of Ih in the soma that declined to a lower density in the dendrites, a pattern that is reversed compared to <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> The voltage-dependent activation and activation time constants of Ih in the PLPs were similar to <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the soma and dendrites of PLP neurons showed {{no significant differences in}} input resistance and local temporal summation between the two locations. Blockade of Ih by ZD 7288 increased the input resistance and temporal summation of simulated EPSPs, as in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> When NMDA receptors were blocked, temporal summation at the soma of distal synaptic potentials was similar to that seen with current injections at the soma, suggesting a ‘normalization’ of temporal summation similar to that observed in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> Thus, we have characterized a principal neuronal subtype in the hippocampus with a similar morphology but reversed Ih somatodendritic gradient to that previously observed in CA 1 hippocampal and neocortical <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the {{mammalian}} {{central nervous}} system, signal transmission {{is carried out}} by interconnected networks of nerve cells, or neurons.

50|$|Moreover, Schaffer {{collateral}} axons develop excitatory synapses {{that are}} {{scattered over the}} dendritic arborization of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. In the early stage of long-term potentiation, Schaffer collaterals release glutamate that binds to AMPA receptors of CA1-dendrites. The process of developing a network of CA3-to-CA1 recurrent excitatory glutamatergic synapses alters the frequency of spontaneous action potentials in Schaffer collaterals. By adulthood, CA3 recurrent network activity is reduced, the frequency of spontaneous action potentials is decreased in Schaffer collaterals, and a single release locus synapse with one dendritic spine on a given CA1 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neuron</b> can be developed by Schaffer collateral axons.|$|E

40|$|A new {{strategy}} for visualizing neuronal cell morphology of mouse brain based on Cre/loxP recombination-activated gene expression is described. A "reporter" transgenic line was generated which expressed a fusion gene encoding a dendrite-targeted {{green fluorescent protein}} (MAP 2 -GFP) upon deletion of a transcription/translation STOP (transcription and translation stop signal) cassette. Cre transgenic "deleter" lines were established that activated reporter gene expression at various frequencies in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> in the forebrain. A deleter line was identified which activated a MAP 2 -GFP reporter gene at very low frequency (less than 0. 1 % of <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons)</b> and allowed the visualization of dendritic structures of individual neocortical and hippocampal <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons.</b> In addition, vertical "columns" of <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> in the neocortex were labeled in these mice.

40|$|During {{cortical}} development, synaptic competition {{regulates the}} formation and adjustment of neuronal connectivity. It is unknown whether synaptic competition remains active in the adult brain and how inhibitory neurons participate in this process. Using morphological and electrophysiological measurements, we show that expressing a dominant-negative form of the TrkB receptor (TrkB. T 1) {{in the majority of}} <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> in the adult visual cortex does not affect excitatory synapse densities. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} previously reported loss of excitatory input which occurs if the exact same transgene is expressed in sparse neurons at the same age. This indicates that synaptic competition remains active in adulthood. Additionally, we show that interneurons not expressing the TrkB. T 1 transgene may have a competitive advantage and obtain more excitatory synapses when most neighboring <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> do express the transgene. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibitory synapses onto <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> are reduced when TrkB signaling is interfered with in most <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> but not when few <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> have this deficit. This adjustment of inhibitory innervation is therefore not a cell-autonomous consequence of decreased TrkB signaling but more likely a homeostatic mechanism compensating for activity changes at the population level...|$|R

50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that unmasking persistent sodium current in presence of Calcium channel blocker has been well established. It is likely that calcium channel blocker will block voltage and ligand gated Calcium channel, thereby affecting calcium-activated potassium channel in invertebrate model system. The initiation of PDS without blocking any channel are much more prevalent in mammalian neurons, for example, thalamocortical neuron, CA3 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neuron,</b> and some hypothalamic neurons. The possibility of spontaneous bursting in these neurons are implicated in regulating hormonal secretion. The significance of PDS may increase the signal-to-noise ratio, plays vital role in information processing, synaptic plasticity and among others. In contrast, the PDSs could be generated by electrical or chemical stimulation to single neurons.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, Donald Hebb {{postulated}} that synaptic efficiency will increase through repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell by a presynaptic cell. This is often informally summarized as [...] "cells that fire together, wire together". The theory was validated {{in part by}} the discovery of long-term potentiation. Studies of LTP on multiple presynaptic cells stimulating a postsynaptic cell uncovered the property of associativity. A weak neuronal stimulation onto a <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neuron</b> may not induce long-term potentiation. However, this same stimulation paired with a simultaneous strong stimulation from another neuron will strengthen both synapses. This process suggests that two neuronal pathways converging on the same cell may both strengthen if stimulated coincidentally.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{involvement}} of deep cortical layer neurons in processing callosal information in the rat. We observed with electron microscopy that both parvalbumin (PV) -labeled profiles and unlabeled dendritic spines of deep cortical layer neurons receive synapses from the contralateral hemisphere. Stimulation of callosal fibers elicited monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents in both layer VI <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> and g-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons immunopositive for the vesicular GABA transporter and PV. Pyramidal cells had intrinsic electrophysiological properties and synaptic responses with slow kinetics and a robust N-metyhl-D-aspartate (NMDA) component. In contrast, GABAergic interneurons had intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic responses with faster kinetics and a less pronounced NMDA component. Consistent with these results, the temporal integration of callosal input was effective over a significantly longer time window in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> compared with GABAergic interneurons. Interestingly, callosal stimulation did not evoke feedforward inhibition in all GABAergic interneurons and {{in the majority of}} <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> tested. Furthermore, retrogradely labeled layer VI <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> of the contralateral cortex responded monosynaptically to callosal stimulation, suggesting interconnectivity between callosally projecting neurons.

40|$|The neuromodulator {{adenosine}} {{is widely}} {{considered to be a}} key regulator of sleep homeostasis and an indicator of sleep need. Although the effect of adenosine on subcortical areas has been previously described, the effects on cortical neurons have not been addressed systematically to date. To that purpose, we performed in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and biocytin staining of <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> and interneurons throughout all layers of rat prefrontal and somatosensory cortex, followed by morphological analysis. We found that adenosine, via the A 1 receptor, exerts differential effects depending on neuronal cell type and laminar location. Interneurons and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> in layer 2 and a subpopulation of layer 3 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>neurons</b> that displayed regular spiking were insensitive to adenosine application, whereas other pyramidal cells in layers 3 – 6 were hyperpolarized (range 1. 2 – 10. 8 mV).
