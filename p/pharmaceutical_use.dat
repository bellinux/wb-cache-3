5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is {{an organic}} base. As a base, {{it is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>use</b> as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E

25|$|By November 2006, {{the use of}} lindane {{had been}} banned in 52 {{countries}} and restricted in 33 others. Seventeen countries, including the US and Canada, allowed either limited agricultural or <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>use.</b> In 2009, an international ban {{on the use of}} lindane in agriculture was implemented under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. A specific exemption allows for it to continue to be used in second-line treatments for the head lice and scabies for five more years. The production of the lindane isomers α- and β-hexachlorocyclohexane was also banned. Although the US has not ratified the Convention, it has similarly banned agricultural uses while still allowing its use a second-line lice and scabies treatment.|$|E

2500|$|The Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants {{considers}} {{the use of}} lindane in agriculture as largely redundant, with other, less toxic and less persistent pesticides. [...] In the case of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>use,</b> the committee noted, [...] "alternatives for pharmaceutical uses have often failed for scabies and lice treatment {{and the number of}} available alternative products for this use is scarce. For this particular case, a reasonable alternative would be to use lindane as a second-line treatment when other treatments fail, while potential new treatments are assessed." ...|$|E
2500|$|A typical study {{might involve}} how two {{proteins}} {{interact with each}} other, possibly {{with a view to}} developing small molecules {{that can be used to}} probe the normal biology of the interaction ("chemical biology") or to provide possible leads for <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>use</b> (drug development). Frequently, the interacting pair of proteins may have been identified by studies of human genetics, indicating the interaction can be disrupted by unfavorable mutations, or they may play a key role in the normal biology of a [...] "model" [...] organism like the fruit fly, yeast, the worm C. elegans, or mice. To prepare a sample, methods of molecular biology are typically used to make quantities by bacterial fermentation. This also permits changing the isotopic composition of the molecule, which is desirable because the isotopes behave differently and provide methods for identifying overlapping NMR signals.|$|E
