40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying pathologically synchronized neural oscillations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and generalized epilepsies are {{explored in}} parallel via a physiologically-based neural field {{model of the}} corticothalamic-basal ganglia (CTBG) system. The basal ganglia (BG) are approximated as a single effective population and their roles in the modulation of oscillatory dynamics of the corticothalamic (CT) system and vice versa are analyzed. In addition to normal EEG rhythms, enhanced activity around 4 Hz and 20 Hz exists in the model, consistent with the characteristic frequencies observed in PD. These rhythms result from resonances in loops formed between the BG and CT populations, analogous to those that underlie epileptic oscillations in a previous CT model, and which are still present in the combined CTBG system. Dopamine depletion is argued to weaken the dampening of these loop resonances in PD, and network connections then explain the significant coherence observed between BG, thalamic, and cortical population activity around 4 – 8 Hz and 20 Hz. Parallels between the afferent and efferent connection sites of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and BG predict low dopamine to correspond to a reduced likelihood of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures, which agrees with experimental findings. Furthermore, the model predicts an increased likelihood of absence (<b>petit</b> <b>mal)</b> <b>seizure</b> resulting from pathologically low dopamine levels in accordance with experimental observations. Suppression of absence seizure activity is demonstrated when afferent and efferent BG connections to the CT system are strengthened, {{which is consistent with}} other CTBG modeling studies. The BG are demonstrated to have a suppressive effect on activity of the CTBG system near tonic-clonic seizure states, which provides insight into the reported efficacy of current treatments in BG circuits. Sleep states of the TRN are also found to suppress pathological PD activity in accordance with observations. Overall, the findings demonstrate strong parallels between coherent oscillations in generalized epilepsies and PD, and provide insights into possible comorbidities...|$|E

40|$|Primary objective: Early {{treatment}} of epilepsy is warranted to avoid possible severe consequences. This study aimed {{to assess the}} value of treatment in a patient who developed epilepsy after major brain surgery. Design: Case description. A 51 years-old man {{had a history of}} putative <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> <b>seizures</b> since adolescence and left frontotemporal lobectomy after a major traffic accident at age 17. He subsequently developed quickly generalizing partial complex seizures, associated with severe behavioural alterations and personality changes; the condition was left untreated. A further seizure-related loss of consciousness led to another traffic accident at age 47. Methods and procedures: The patient was administered 200 mg/day topiramate, 600 mg/day quetiapine, 1000 mg/day valproate, 1200 mg/day gabapentin and 800 mg/day carbamazepine. Main outcomes and results: The instituted anti-epileptic treatment reduced seizure frequency and severity, but did not affect psychiatric symptomatology, which even worsened. An association between anti-epileptic drugs with mood stabilizing properties and an atypical anti-psychotic dramatically improved psychiatric symptoms, but did not prevent the patient from needing long-term healthcare.

40|$|Background: Absence {{seizures}}, {{which are}} also known as <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> <b>seizures,</b> {{are the most common}} type of seizures in pediatric epilepsy. They appear in several types of epilepsy and are characterized by impaired consciousness and 3 -Hz spike-and-slow-wave complexes in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) is the result of a very delicate weighting, which leads to a trade-off between the side effects the drugs are causing and the disapperance of the seizures. the company Hypo-Safe A/S is currently developing a device, which hopefully will permit to reduce the number of EEG examinations needed to achieve the optimal medication. Objective: The project has two biomedical signal processing objectives: seizure on- set detection and automatic topographic seizure distribution description by means of statistical measures. Seizure onset detection is directly relevant for the user of the sub- cutaneously implanted Hypo-Safe EEG apparatus and for medical monitoring purposes. Automatic topographic distribution description by means of statistical measures is relevant for decision concerning placement of the apparatus.

40|$|Abstract: A shy serial murderer, {{a social}} loner with past head {{injuries}} and previous <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> <b>seizures,</b> surrendered voluntarily after 25 years. All his homicides had been unplanned, motiveless, and committed with flat affect and during a fleeting psychosis. Both onset and cessation of the symptomatology were sudden and had progressed in three phases, implicating seizures. After recognizing the fatal meaning of his “premonition signs ” (his visual aura), {{he was able}} to flee immediately and permanently from two poten-tial further victims. His flight had also removed the impact of his individualized external trigger stimuli (demands for closeness), which previously had revived past similar stresses. Because such external stimuli are necessary for seizure kindling, the apparent seizure-aborting effect of their removed impact supports a hypothesis of seizure kindling. Previ-ously, 16 similar homicidal cases had been proposed as limbic psychotic trigger reaction. Furthermore, the volitional abortion of a seizure was not followed by an alternative psycho-sis or forced normalization. Keywords:homicide, limbic psychotic trigger reaction, partial seizures, kindling, volition. 1 THEORETICAL AND RESEARCH BASIS To act volitionally is one of the personally and legally most essential abilities, even at times bolstered by exaggerated beliefs in free will in every respect and at all times. In certain neuropsychiatric disturbances, however, the ability to act volitionally is annulled or temporarily suspended, such as during partial, that is, behavioral, seizures of various duration, up to several days (as at times in temporal lobe epilepsy). All such seizures, however, still enable a patient to perform certain activities that can readily be mistake...|$|R
5000|$|History of {{generalized}} epilepsy with absence seizures are {{dated to}} the eighteenth century, however {{the inventor of}} the electroencephalogram (EEG), Hans Berger, recorded the first EEG of an absence seizure in the 1920s, which led the way for the general notion of spike-and-wave electrophysiology. His first recording of a human EEG was made in 1924 using a galvanometer, but his results were very crude and showed small, undefined oscillations. He continued to refine his technique and increase the sensitivity to the galvanometer, in which he accumulated many EEGs of individuals with and without a brain malfunction or disorder. Among those tested were patients with epilepsy, dementia, and brain tumors. [...] Hans Berger published his findings in 1933, however his results did not give a definitive characterization of the general EEG pattern seen during an epileptic seizure. In 1935, F.A. Gibbs, H.

Psychomotor automatisms are a form of focal seizure. Primidone (Mysoline), in doses of 125 - 250 mg. two to three times a day, is a very useful anticonvulsant in patients with myoclonic features, psychomotor automatisms and grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures.</b> Primidone should be started in small doses. Drug reactions, especially cerebellar ataxia in the case of diphenylhydantoin and blood dyscrasias in the case of some drugs, should be recognized.

40|$|WE have {{recently}} {{had the opportunity}} of investigating 4 patients with myoclonic epilepsy, children of a marriage between first cousins, once removed. One sibling had died in convulsions {{at the age of}} 2 and another not seen by us, is said to be completely normal. As 3 of our 4 patients showed signs of cerebellar disturbance, they fell into a category described by Ramsay Hunt (1921), and it became of interest to explore the confused field of myoclonus in an attempt to determine the relationship of the "Ramsay Hunt syndrome " to progressive myoclonic epilepsy {{on the one hand and}} the familial cerebellar ataxias on the other. Myoclonus may be defined in clinical terms as "a disturbance of neuronal activity characterized by very sudden involuntary jerks, which are arrhythmic and asynergic, involving portions of muscles, whole muscles or muscle groups " (Bradshaw, 1954). Individual jerks are provoked by change in posture, and it is probable that muscle stretch is the essential stimulus (Dawson, 1947). The onset of drowsiness commonly releases a tendency to myoclonic jerks in normal people (Symonds, 1953), and photic or auditory stimulation may initiate myoclonus in susceptible subjects. Patients with idiopathic epilepsy often experience isolated myoclonic jerks, particularly in the mornings, and the. intensification of these attacks preceding a grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizure</b> is well known. It is not remarkable that lapses of awareness in <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> epilepsy may also be associated with myoclonus, and indeed myoclonus has been in-voked as an explanation for the third component of the <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> triad, the falling attack.

Thus, we considered the possible anticonvulsant effects of carbenoxolone in animal seizure models. Results ED 50 values of diazepam and carbenoxolone in the pentylenetetrazole model were 1. 13 mg/kg and 283. 3 mg/kg, respectively. In this model, carbenoxolone in doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg prolonged the onset time of seizure and decreased the duration of seizures. In the maximal electroshock model, carbenoxolone in a dose of 400 mg/kg decreased the duration of seizure producing protection against seizure but failing to protect against mortality in comparison with diazepam. In the potentiation of pentobarbitone sleep test, carbenoxolone significantly increased sleeping time and decreased latency in doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg in mice dose dependently. In the traction test, carbenoxolone (400 mg/kg) showed muscle relaxant activity and in the accelerated rotarod test, carbenoxolone in doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg showed a decline in motor coordination.
