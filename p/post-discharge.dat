50|$|The {{exclusions}} under Section 108 {{are justified}} under various rationales. First, {{it is difficult}} to collect tax from insolvent taxpayers. The bankruptcy and the insolvency provisions defer the tax to a time when taxpayer is able to pay.

The student loan exclusion for those who do certain types of work is designed to maximize that benefit.

Discharge plans and the various patient care plans are carefully considered by providers and are designed to provide patients with the standard of care to meet their acute or chronic healthcare needs.

Teachback was developed and deployed to ensure that patients can repeat back information on their plan.

50|$|Early in Barker’s {{career in}} the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society {{programs}} necessitated tremendous increases {{in the numbers of}} social service and mental health workers. The National Association of Social Workers was awarded grants from government agencies to help find ways to remedy these shortages.10 Barker and Thomas Briggs were employed to conduct and administer these studies. They observed numerous state and federal institutions and experimented with different ways staff members could help hospitalized clients and their families. The Barker-Briggs model of using teams to provide these services was later used as a template for case management approaches is still used by the U.S. Veteran’s Administration and many state mental hospital staffing patterns.11 As originated, the model replaced the primary one-on-one relationship between client and helping professional with a team approach.12 The leader of the team, usually a professional social worker or registered nurse assigned specific tasks to a staff of several ancillary workers. The ancillary workers were experts in their own right at providing for the specific needs of the client. For example, one worker could specialize in helping clients get jobs, or helping clients access <b>post-discharge</b> resources in the community. The implication was that such clients needed help not only with psychotherapy or counseling but with life-skills problems, and when met, the client’s psychotherapy goals were achieved more efficiently and effectively.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Mortality {{following}} hospital discharge is {{an important}} and under-recognized contributor to overall child mortality in developing countries. The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify all studies reporting <b>post-discharge</b> mortality in children, estimate likelihood of death, and determine the most important risk factors for death. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched using MeSH terms and keywords from the inception date to October, 2012. Key word searches using Google Scholar™ and hand searching of references of retrieved articles was also performed. Studies from developing countries reporting mortality following hospital discharge among a pediatric population were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Thirteen studies that reported mortality rates following discharge were identified. Studies varied significantly according to design, underlying characteristics of study population and duration of follow-up. Mortality rates following discharge varied significantly between studies (1 %- 18 %). When reported, <b>post-discharge</b> mortality rates often exceeded in-hospital mortality rates. The most important baseline variables associated with <b>post-discharge</b> mortality were young age, malnutrition, multiple previous hospitalizations, HIV infection and pneumonia. Most <b>post-discharge</b> deaths occurred early during the <b>post-discharge</b> period. Follow-up care was examined in only one study examining malaria prophylaxis in children discharged following an admission secondary to malaria, which showed no significant benefit on <b>post-discharge</b> mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The months following hospital discharge carry significant risk for morbidity and mortality. While several characteristics are strongly associated with <b>post-discharge</b> mortality, no validated tools are available to aid health workers or policy makers in the systematic identification of children {{at high risk of}} <b>post-discharge</b> mortality. Future research must focus on both the creation of tools to aid in defining groups of children most likely to benefit from <b>post-discharge</b> interventions, and formal assessment of the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing morbidity and mortality in the first few months following hospital discharge...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} staff {{compliance with}} discharge planning clinical guideline recommendations in an acute stroke unit, {{and its relationship}} with <b>post-discharge</b> experiences of stroke patients and their carers. Subjects: Fifty acute stroke patients were systematically recruited for a retrospective patient record audit of staff compliance with clinical guideline recommendations related to discharge planning. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted over six months <b>post-discharge</b> on patients’ actual community support needs and experiences. Audit and patient experience data were integrated to seek evidence of 1) characteristics of patients receiving guideline-compliant care, 2) relationships between staff compliance with discharge planning recommendations and patient’s <b>post-discharge</b> experiences, and 3) whether patient’s <b>post-discharge</b> experiences of shortfalls in support related to hospital discharge planning. Results: Not all patients received guideline-based care. There was a trend that patients with more complex strokes received guideline-compliant care than other patients. Compliance with providing an occupational therapy (OT) home assessment {{was significantly related to}} discharge directly home from hospital. There was a shortfall with 40 % of patients between community supports predicted by hospital staff and actual <b>post-discharge</b> support requirements. Community support requirements increased over time for 32 % of patients, whose six-month <b>post-discharge</b> needs were actually greater than their needs at six weeks. Conclusions: Staff compliance with discharge planning recommendations was variable and did not always relate to improved <b>post-discharge</b> patient experiences. The <b>post-discharge</b> experiences of many stroke patients could not have been predicted whilst they were in hospital.

40|$|IntroductionRecognition and {{alleviation}} of pain {{should be}} a priority when treating ill and injured children in the Emergency Department (ED). Optimising analgesia in paediatric patients <b>post-discharge</b> remains a challenge. The increasing accessibility of mobile phone technology worldwide offers new opportunities to communicate with families <b>post-discharge.</b> This study investigates whether text message reminders improve pain management in children <b>post-discharge</b> from the ED. MethodThis was a prospective study of 50 children (aged 1 – 16 years) with fractures, discharged from the ED. An online automated service was used to send text messages to parents at 6 h and 30 h <b>post-discharge.</b> These served as reminders to administer analgesia. 25 parents received text message reminders and 25 parents received no messages. All parents were telephoned 48 hours <b>post-discharge</b> to ascertain the number of analgesia doses administered {{and the frequency of}} reported pain. ResultsThe mean number of analgesia doses administered to the text message group was 7. 6 vs. 4. 9 in the control group, p=< 0. 05. In the text message group 0 children complained of pain frequently or constantly vs. 5 in the control group. 100 % of parents in the text message group felt text messages were an effective reminder. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that sending text message reminders <b>post-discharge</b> significantly increases the number of analgesia doses administered, reduces the frequency of patients reporting pain and is an effective method of communicating with parents.
