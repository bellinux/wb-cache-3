5|$|The {{analysis}} of the debris at the 10-megaton Ivy Mike nuclear test {{was a part of}} long-term project, {{one of the goals of}} which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities of the order 1023 neutrons/cm2 within a microsecond, i.e. about 1029 neutrons/(cm2·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5 neutrons/(cm2·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary {{analysis of}} debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with <b>paper</b> <b>filters</b> which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.|$|E

50|$|The AeroPress is {{a device}} for brewing coffee. It {{was invented in}} 2005 by Aerobie {{president}} Alan Adler. Coffee is steeped for 10-50 seconds (depending on grind and preferred strength) and then forced through a filter by pressing the plunger through the tube. The filters used are either the AeroPress <b>paper</b> <b>filters</b> or disc shaped thin metal filters. The maker describes the result as an espresso strength concentration of coffee, but its most frequent use is more in the filter brew strength.|$|E

5000|$|Pleated {{paper filter}} {{elements}} are the nearly exclusive choice for automobile engine air cleaners, {{because they are}} efficient, easy to service, and cost-effective. The [...] "paper" [...] term is somewhat misleading, as the filter media are considerably different from papers used for writing or packaging, etc. There is a persistent belief amongst tuners, fomented by advertising for aftermarket non-paper replacement filters, that <b>paper</b> <b>filters</b> flow poorly and thus restrict engine performance. In fact, {{as long as a}} pleated-paper filter is sized appropriately for the airflow volumes encountered in a particular application, such filters present only trivial restriction to flow until the filter has become significantly clogged with dirt. Construction equipment engines also use this.|$|E

40|$|Measurement of {{soil suction}} is {{important}} as soil suction {{is one of}} the two stress-state variables that control both the hydro and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils. One of the soil suction measurement techniques is the <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> method. Even though the <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> technique has been standardized, the experimental procedure can still be improved {{in order to reduce the}} inconsistencies that are often reported with the <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> technique. This paper explores usage of both initially dry and initially moist Whatman No. 42 <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> for matric and total suction measurements. Residual soils from the Bukit Timah Granite in Singapore were compacted at various water contents from dry to wet of optimum using standard Proctor energies and their suctions were measured using both contact and non-contact <b>filter</b> <b>papers.</b> Results of the suction measurements showed hysteresis between the initially dry and the initially moist <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> for both the contact and non-contact methods. Suction measurement by the contact <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> method is more consistent than suction measurement by the non-contact <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> method. Condensation causes the non-contact <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> to have higher water contents. The results showed that the non-contact initially dry <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> follows the total suction curve but the non-contact initially moist <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> may follow the matric suction curve instead...|$|R
50|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is highly}} soluble in water. The solution used in saturating {{the paper was}} 70 Baume in density (1.93 specific gravity) and about 110°F. This is roughly a 70% percent zinc chloride solution. Zinc chloride is a mild lewis acid with a solution pH of about 4. Zinc chloride can dissolve cellulose, starch, and silk. The zinc chloride used in making vulcanized fibre swelled and gelatinized the cellulose. The fibre swelling explains why <b>paper</b> <b>filters</b> cannot be used to filter zinc chloride solutions. It is also the reason why a number of paper plies were used to build up to the desired vulcanized fibre thickness, rather treating a single paperboard thickness. For instance, the practice was to use 8 paper plies of 4 mm thickness each, {{as opposed to a}} single paperboard ply of 32 mm.|$|E
5000|$|Parliament is a {{brand of}} {{cigarettes}} marketed by the company Philip Morris. The brand was introduced in 1931 and is distinctive for its recessed <b>paper</b> <b>filters.</b> It was originally used as an advertising gimmick when cigarettes did not have filters. The first commercial cigarette filters came into use in 1935. [...] Cigarette filters became common in most cigarettes in the 1950s. In the 1940s and 1950s, the brand was marketed for its unique filters, with advertisements reading, [...] "Only the flavor touches your lips", and [...] "Tobacco tastes best when the filter's recessed". The brand also claimed that the recessed filter prevented tar from making contact with the smoker's mouth, unlike standard filters. The Parliament brand holds a strong market position in Georgia, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Argentina, Armenia, Israel, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Russia, Montenegro, Ukraine and United States.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, the United Kingdom {{and most}} Commonwealth nations, {{the term is}} often used more {{specifically}} {{to refer to a}} short tube, commonly torn from a pack of rolling papers, that may be present in the unlit end of a joint.

The Steel roach was invented to fill the gap of reusable product category and it also does not have as much Crystal deposits like <b>paper</b> <b>filters.</b> It is commonly set in position during the rolling process, or may be inserted later. When the use of a roach is employed, a joint can still be held securely after it has burnt down to a short length; thus, the entire length of the joint may be smoked, without the aid of a roach clip.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{the coffee}} grounds remain in {{direct contact with}} the brewing water and the grounds are {{filtered}} from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter, coffee brewed with the French press captures more of the coffee's flavour and essential oils, which would become trapped in a traditional drip brew machine's <b>paper</b> <b>filters.</b> [...] As with drip-brewed coffee, French pressed coffee can be brewed to any strength by adjusting the amount of ground coffee which is brewed. If the used grounds remain in the drink after brewing, French pressed coffee left to stand can become [...] "bitter", though this is an effect that many users of French press consider beneficial. For a 1/2 L French press, the contents are considered spoiled, by some reports, after around 20 minutes. Other approaches consider a brew period that may extend to hours as a method of superior production.|$|E
50|$|Paper coffee filters {{were invented}} in Germany by Melitta Bentz in 1908 and are {{commonly}} used for drip brew all over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by Gottlob Widmann, was patented in Germany being the first electrical drip brewer. Drip brew coffee makers replaced the coffee percolator in the 1970s due to the percolators' tendency to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of <b>paper</b> <b>filters</b> is that the used grounds and the filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter. Permanent filters are now also common, made of thin perforated metal sheets or fine plastic mesh that restrain the grounds but allow the coffee to pass, thus eliminating {{the need to have}} to purchase separate filters which sometimes cannot be found {{in some parts of the}} world. These add to the maintenance of the machine, but reduce overall cost and produce less waste.|$|E
