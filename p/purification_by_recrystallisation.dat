40|$|The {{volume of}} birch plywood {{production}} in Latvia {{is illustrated by}} the 208 000 m 3 of plywood sold in 2011 and about 562 000 m 3 of processed birch veneer blocks. Wood residues such as bark, veneer shorts, cut off ends and others are used as a fuel. It would be more expedient to increase the birch wood utilisation degree by involving also birch outer bark in the processing cycle. It makes up 2 % of the veneer blocks’ mass. At the J. S. C. “Latvijas Finieris”, about 6000 t per year of graded and milled outer birch bark could be produced for further processing. Birch outer bark consists of triterpenes, suberine, lignin and sugars, the content of which is ~ 35 %, ~ 45 %, ~ 9 % and ~ 6 %, respectively. The content of lupane type pentacyclic triterpenes in Latvian silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) outer bark is among the highest ones for the species. The main components of the triterpene mixture are betulin, lupeol and betulinic acid (Figure 1), which are characterised by a poor solubility in organic solvents. Birch outer bark and its extracts have been used in folk medicine for ages. Nowadays, interest in triterpene derivatives, especially those of betulin, is increasing, since they are promising biologically active substances for treatment of cancer, HIV, obesity, the herpes virus and other diseases. In the most popular methods for triterpene extraction from outer birch bark, polar solvents such as ethanol and isopropanol or acetone are used. Unfortunately, these solvents, along with triterpenes, dissolve polyphenols, tannins, carbohydrates and other components of outer birch bark. The subsequent <b>purification</b> of extractives <b>by</b> <b>recrystallisation</b> is connected with the additional consumption of the solvent and losses of both the end product and the solvent. These operations are also labour-consuming...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis dealt with single crystals of thallium bromide grown for gamma-ray detector applications. The crystals were used to fabricate room temperature gamma-ray detectors. Routinely produced TlBr detectors often are poor quality. Therefore, this study concentrated on developing the manufacturing processes for TlBr detectors and methods of characterisation {{that can be used}} for optimisation of TlBr purity and crystal quality. The processes under concern were TlBr raw material purification, crystal growth, annealing and detector fabrication. The study focused on single crystals of TlBr grown from material purified <b>by</b> a hydrothermal <b>recrystallisation</b> method. In addition, hydrothermal conditions for synthesis, recrystallisation, crystal growth and annealing of TlBr crystals were examined. The final manufacturing process presented in this thesis deals with TlBr material purified by the Bridgman method. Then, material is hydrothermally recrystallised in pure water. A travelling molten zone (TMZ) method is used for additional purification of the recrystallised product and then for the final crystal growth. Subsequent processing is similar to that described in the literature. In this thesis, literature on improving quality of TlBr material/crystal and detector performance is reviewed. Aging aspects as well as the influence of different factors (temperature, time, electrode material and so on) on detector stability are considered and examined. The results of the process development are summarised and discussed. This thesis shows the considerable improvement in the charge carrier properties of a detector due to additional <b>purification</b> <b>by</b> hydrothermal <b>recrystallisation.</b> As an example, a thick (4 mm) TlBr detector produced by the process was fabricated and found to operate successfully in gamma-ray detection, confirming the validity of the proposed purification and technological steps. However, for the complete improvement of detector performance, further developments in crystal growth are required. The detector manufacturing process was optimized by characterisation of material and crystals using methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarisation microscopy, high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass (HR-ICPM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet and visual (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), current-voltage (I-V) and capacity voltage (CV) characterisation, and photoconductivity, as well direct detector examination. Väitöskirjatutkimus keskittyy talliumbromidikiteisiin, joita hyödynnetään gammasäteiden havainnoimisessa. Kiteistä valmistettiin huoneenlämmössä toimivia gammadetektoreita. Tavanomaisilla menetelmillä valmistetut T 1 Br detektorit ovat usein huononlaatuisia. Väitöskirjan aiheena on TIBr raaka-aineen, kiteiden sekä detektorin suorituskyvyn parantaminen. Yhteenveto-osassa arvioitiin uudelleen aiheeseen liittyvää kirjallisuutta. Erityisesti tarkasteltiin detektoreiden stabiiliutta ja vanhenemista, sekä niihin vaikuttavia tekijöitä kuten lämpötilaa, aikaa ja elektrodimateriaaleja. Väitöskirjatyön kokeellisessa osassa kehitettiin kaikkia prosessin vaiheita: raaka-aineiden puhdistusta, kiteiden kasvatusta ja detektoreiden valmistusta. Hydrotermistä uudelleen kiteyttämistä käyttämällä kyettiin parantamaan huomattavasti detektoreiden varauksen kuljetusominaisuuksia. Kehitetyllä prosessilla aikaansaatu paksu (4 mm) detektori osoittautui toimivan käytännössä menestyksekkäästi gammadetektorina. Työssä kehitetyt puhdistusmenetelmät ja teknologiset toimenpiteet olivat siis oikeansuuntaisia ja hyödyllisiä. On kuitenkin huomioitavaa, että detektoreissa on vielä parantamisen varaa ja lisä tutkimus- ja kehitystyötä tarvitaan erityisesti kiteiden kasvatuksessa...|$|R
40|$|Most metal {{production}} involves changes in microstructure <b>by</b> <b>recrystallisation</b> and grain growth but these events cannot normally be recorded in real time.

This paper describes the application of LUS for studying microstructures in steels in both static experiments and in dynamic situations during elevated temperature tests including hot working. In some cases such as austenitic stainless steel, the wave velocity varies linearly with the fraction recrystallised but the situation is more complex in low carbon ferritic steels. Grain size measurements are presented for static and dynamic annealing experiments and also in connection with hot deformation of an HSLA steel...|$|R
