40|$|Purpose: Punching process {{currently}} {{plays an}} important role in industrial mass production. The current study focuses on increasing accuracy, performance and extending service life of punches and dies. Optimizing the design of the punch and die has been a common topic for scholars. Design/methodology/approach: The input parameters (punching times, clearance) and output results (wear) were used to construct a training database. The abductive network formulation established a relationship between input parameters and output results. By using the abductive modeling technique, the complicated and uncertain relationships between the input and output variables can be formulated into a useful mathematical model. Once the abductive network model was constructed, the relationships between input and output parameters variables became available. A simulated annealing algorithm (SA) with a performance index was established to optimize this process and find the best result as compared with the actual experiment values. Findings: This study aims to establish the relationship between punching times, clearance and wear of micro punches using the abductive network, and to find relational model involving input parameters and output result of <b>punching</b> <b>die</b> in composite blanking processes. This model can be used to estimate wear between punch and die for industrial applications. Research limitations/implications: Setting up the relational expression of punching times, clearance and wear requires a well-established database covering sufficient relevant parameters and data. In training the database, it is helpful to establish a good relational model among punching parameters. Incorrect data will cause abnormal wear. As a result, the mathematics model is difficult to converge and the neural network will inaccurately predict wear. In addition, the <b>punching</b> <b>die</b> may be changed prematurely, which increases production costs. Delay in replacing a worn <b>punching</b> <b>die</b> can result in poor quality of products. Originality/value: As electronic production becomes increasingly smaller, the opportunity to use micro punches and dies will expand accordingly. This study established the relational expression of input and output, which can be used to correctly estimate any wear condition. This result is based on an abductive network and SA method...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper {{is focused on the}} optimal clearance design of micro-punching die by abductive network and SA method. Design/methodology/approach: The punching data (input) and wear size (output) were collected for a training database. In order to select proper clearance to evaluate the wear of die, the abductive network was used to establish an efficient relationship between input parameters and output result. This can help to predict wear size under any degree of clearance and hence to replace worn <b>punches</b> and <b>dies</b> at the right time. A simulated annealing (SA) optimization algorithm with a performance index is then applied to the neural network for searching the optimal clearance parameters, and obtains rather satisfactory result as compared with the corresponding experiment verification. Findings: This study aims to identify the relationship between clearance and service life of micro punches using the Neural Network, and to find relational data involving the service life of punches and punching parameters in non-metal blanking processes. The result can be used to estimate optimal clearance between <b>punch</b> and <b>die</b> for industrial applications. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the practical punching processes with different punching conditions were carried out for a set of training data. A trained model exhibited a relationship between service life and clearance of micro <b>punch</b> and <b>die</b> through an abductive network system. The predicted value of wear by abductive network is very close to the actual experimental value, with an error of less than 8 %. This result satisfies the required standard for IC factory production.
