40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for controlling {{the pressure of}} a molten metal when using {{a new type of}} iron casting method called sand mold press casting to realize high productivity and obtain high-quality products. The past test results using this method showed a casting yield of 90 % to 95 %, while conventional methods only show a casting yield of 60 % to 70 %. Although the press casting method does not require a sprue cup or runner channel casting defects such as metal penetration are often caused by the high pressure in the high-velocity <b>pressing</b> <b>part</b> of this casting process. Therefore, we proposed a pressure control method with a mathematical model of molten metal pressure, and with it we achieved experimental confirmation of the successful production of brake drums at different pressing temperatures. Results show that the proposed pressing control method can realize sound, penetration-free casting production. However, the theoretical analysis and design of this pressing process had not previously been studied sufficiently, and therefore this paper presents the theoretical design algorithm for the process as well as its experimental confirmation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{bad quality}} of {{machining}} surfaces {{caused by the}} micro wear of <b>pressing</b> <b>parts</b> {{has been a very}} big trouble for the engineers over the past decades. In order to decrease the surface wear, the technology of heat treatment is used popular. Many papers about the heat treatment technology had been proposed. Especially, the deep cryogenic treatment has been used widely for the purpose of wear-resistance in the industry. Moreover, the method of using variations of surface magnetization to monitor the dynamic tribological properties between the metal pairs has been applied successfully by the author. Therefore, this paper is base on the above statements to further investigate the tribological properties of the tool steel by deep cryogenic treatment. It can be clarified for effects of different deep cryogenic treatment temperatures on wear-resistance of the tool steel DC 53. Besides, the purpose of better quality and faster product speed of the pressing process can then be obtained...|$|R

The Schuler SMG hydraulic stamping press {{line is the}} largest in North America and the 6th largest in the world. The presses use up to 11,000 ton-force to form the body panels; the upper section applies 1400 tonnes of downward force and the lower section 130 tonnes. The blank aluminium sheet is stretched over the lower draw die and openings are cut with robots transferring the panels between processes. The workers then inspect each panel to ensure correct <b>pressing.</b> The <b>parts</b> are then stacked in frames and stored. The machines press one part every 6 seconds and create 5,000 parts per day.|$|R

50|$|When used in {{a sexual}} context, groping is {{touching}} or fondling another person in an unwelcome sexual way using the hands. The term generally has a negative connotation in many societies, and may be considered sexual assault, and terms such as frotteurism (or toucherism) may describe the practice of a person rubbing up against another person, typically using their sexual parts. Touching a consenting person's body during sexual activity, massage, or medical examination is not usually considered groping, though the term is sometimes used to include clumsy, selfish, or inappropriate sexual touching. Areas of the body most frequently groped include the buttocks, breasts, vulva and thighs on a woman, and the penis, testicles and buttocks on a man. Gropers might use their hands, but <b>pressing</b> any <b>part</b> of their body against another person can be considered groping.|$|R

60|$|And the First is an Observation that is {{very obvious}} even in these very drops, to wit, {{that they are all}} of them {{terminated}} with an unequal or irregular Surface, especially about the smaller part of the drop, and the whole length of the stem; as about D, and from thence to A, the whole Surface, which would have been round if the drop had cool'd leisurely, is, by being quenched hastily, very irregularly flatted and pitted; which I suppose proceeds partly from the Waters unequally cooling and <b>pressing</b> the <b>parts</b> of the drop, and partly from the self-contracting or subsiding quality of the substance of the Glass: For the vehemency of the heat of the drop causes such hidden motions and bubbles in the cold Water, that some parts of the Water bear more forcibly against one part then against another, and consequently do more suddenly cool those parts to which they are contiguous.|$|R

5000|$|Halfwound strings, ground wound strings, or {{pressure}} wound strings are a {{cross between}} roundwound and flatwound. Such strings are usually made by winding round wire around a round or hex core first, then polishing, grinding (thus the name, ground wound) or <b>pressing</b> the exterior <b>part</b> of the winding until it is practically flat. This results in the flat, comfortable playing feel of flatwounds, along with less squeaking, with a brightness generally between roundwounds and flatwounds. The polishing process removes {{almost half of the}} winding wire's mass; thus, to compensate for it, manufacturers use winding wire of a heavier gauge. Because of the extra manufacturing process involved they are normally more expensive than roundwounds, but less than flatwounds.|$|R
