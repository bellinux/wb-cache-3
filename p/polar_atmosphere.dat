We adopt the 5 ° zonal annual-mean ozone profile dataset to study the statistical characters between the ozone dataset and the Ap, F 10. 7 indices. Multiple regression analysis shows that the contributions of geomagnetic activity are not negligible and are of a similar order of magnitude as the solar UV radiation in the <b>polar</b> upper <b>atmosphere</b> (above 10 [*]hPa).

50|$|Unlike most Antarctic glaciers, the Taylor glacier is {{not frozen}} to the bedrock, {{probably}} {{because of the presence}} of salts concentrated by the crystallization of the ancient seawater imprisoned below it. Salt cryo-concentration occurred in the deep relict seawater when pure ice crystallised and expelled its dissolved salts as it cooled down because of the heat exchange of the captive liquid seawater with the enormous ice mass of the glacier. As a consequence, the trapped seawater was concentrated in brines with a salinity two to three times that of the mean ocean water. A second mechanism sometimes also explaining the formation of hypersaline brines is the water evaporation of surface lakes directly exposed to the very dry <b>polar</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The analyses of stable isotopes of water allow, in principle, to distinguish between both processes as long as there is no mixing between differently formed brines.|$|E

30|$|The ionized {{component}} in the <b>polar</b> upper <b>atmosphere</b> (i.e., ionosphere) couples with both the magnetosphere and the thermosphere/mesosphere. One of the manifestations of the <b>polar</b> upper <b>atmosphere</b> is the three-dimensional (3 D) current system: The magnetospheric currents, which occasionally flow along the earth’s magnetic field lines into (or out of) the ionosphere, are connected to ionospheric currents in the ionospheric conducting layer (i.e., E region); consequently, the thermosphere is heated by Joule heating. Furthermore, thermospheric wind is affected by ion motion through collisions between ions and neutrals (i.e., ion drag). Modeling of the physical interaction between the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere therefore requires reliable realistic spatial and temporal distributions of the electric field, the energy of particle precipitation, and ionospheric conductivities. In particular, it is of vital importance to obtain the electrical properties of the ionosphere characterized by the Hall and Pedersen conductivities, because they affect the 3 D current system, Joule heating, and so on.|$|R

Detailed views of the <b>polar</b> <b>atmosphere</b> are {{essential}} for understanding the global role of {{the atmosphere in the}} Earth system. Due to the remote location of the polar regions large parts of their atmosphere are usually not within reach for ground- or airborne measurements. Only spaceborne remote sensing can provide almost permanent access.

40|$|This {{research}} was partially {{supported by a}} NASA grant from the Mars Fundamental Research Program (NNX 14 AG 53 G). The Martian <b>polar</b> <b>atmosphere</b> {{is known to have}} a persistent local minimum in potential vorticity (PV) near the winter pole, with a region of high PV encircling it. This finding is surprising since an isolated band of PV is barotropically unstable, a result going back to Rayleigh. Here we investigate the stability of a Mars-like annular vortex using numerical integrations of the rotating shallow water equations. We show how the mode of instability and its growth rate depends upon the latitude and width of the annulus. By introducing thermal relaxation towards an annular equilibrium profile with a time scale {{similar to that of the}} instability, we are able to simulate a persistent annular vortex with similar characteristics as that observed in the Martian atmosphere. This time scale, typically 0. 5 - 2 sols, is similar to radiative relaxation time scales for Mars’ <b>polar</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> We also demonstrate that the persistence of an annular vortex is robust to topographic forcing, as long as it is below a certain amplitude. We hence propose that the persistence of this barotropically unstable annular vortex is permitted due to the combination of short radiative relaxation time scales and relatively weak topographic forcing in the Martian <b>polar</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E

Currents driven by Earth’s rotation, like a dynamo, spread {{the magnetic field}} far into the surrounding space.

The highly energetic charged plasma flowing out from the Sun and charging past the Earth’s magnetic field act as a gigantic natural generator whose power continually drives the auroral currents. Sometimes the enormous energy pump runs in low gear (quiet aurora); sometimes it will rev up with heightened solar activity, thereby increasing the flow of plasma out of the plasmasheet and driving the auroral discharge more powerfully.
