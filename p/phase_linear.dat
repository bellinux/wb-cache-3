Pioneer added a high end cassette-tape deck {{designed}} in house and CD players designed by Kyocera to the <b>Phase</b> <b>Linear</b> line. By that time the company was in decline due to the increasing cost of research and development, and the departure of Carver. In 1982 <b>Phase</b> <b>Linear</b> was sold to Jensen Inc. which also owned the AR and Advent brands. Recoton later acquired the Jensen brands. Bob Carver went on to form Carver Corporation.

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} to designing approximately <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> infinite-impulse-response (IIR) digital filters in the passband region is introduced. The proposed approach yields digital IIR filters whose numerators represent <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters.

The range and high-frequency sup-pression {{of the proposed}} low-pass differentiators are comparable to those obtained by higher order FIR low-pass differentiators.

40|$|The {{identity}} of a <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> of aluminum (Al) uptake in Triticum aestivum was investigated by analysis of the kinetics of Al uptake by excised roots and purified cell wall fractions. Classical interpretation of kinetic data suggests that a <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> of uptake with time reflects uptake across the plasma membrane; however, in studies with Al {{the possibility that the}} <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> of uptake includes accumulation of Al in both the symplasm and the apoplasm has not been discounted. In our experiments, we observed a <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> of Al uptake at both ambient and low temperatures, although the rate of uptake at 0 °C was 53 to 72 % less than at 23 °C, depending on cultivars. This nonsaturable phase of uptake at low temperature suggests that a portion of the <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> of Al uptake is nonmetabolic. Furthermore, analysis of Al in cell wall fractions isolated from excised roots pretreated with Al suggests that the <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> of uptake includes a cell wall component. When excised roots were pretreated with Al, accumulation of Al in purified cell wall material included a <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> that could not be desorbed with a 30 minute wash in citrate. The rates of linear-phase accumulation of Al by cell wall material and cell contents were similar. In contrast, the <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> of in vitro uptake of Al by purified cell wall material was completely desorbed by a 30 minute wash with citrate. These results suggest that the <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> of Al uptake observed in excised roots of T. aestivum included metabolism-dependent binding of Al in apoplasm...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} OFDM peak {{to average}} power ratio (PAPR) reduction method using <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> variation is proposed. Applying <b>linear</b> <b>phase</b> variations to subblocks of subcarriers {{is equal to}} cyclic shifting the corresponding time signals and thus can prevent “peak collisions”. This method differs from conventional partial transmit sequence (PTS) techniques in that PTS applies constant phase variations to subblocks.
