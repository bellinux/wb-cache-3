5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily <b>peeled</b> off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like {{the skin of the}} cap, they can be readily <b>peeled</b> away from the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, baby carrots or mini-carrots (carrots {{that have been}} <b>peeled</b> and cut into uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food {{available}} in many supermarkets. Carrots are puréed and used as baby food, dehydrated to make chips, flakes, and powder, and thinly sliced and deep-fried, like potato chips.|$|E

40|$|International audienceElastomer based {{pressure}} sensitive adhesives used in various <b>peeling</b> applications are viscoelastic {{and expected to}} be rate sensitive. The effects of varying <b>peel</b> velocity on adhesion energy and its dependence on the <b>peel</b> angle and rate of <b>peeling</b> are investigated. Experiments are conducted on an adhesive tape using a displacement-controlled <b>peel</b> test configuration. By adjusting the <b>peel</b> arm length, the <b>peel</b> velocity can be continuously varied though the extremity {{of the film is}} displaced at a constant rate, which results in nonsteady <b>peeling.</b> Constant <b>peel</b> rate tests are performed over a wide range of <b>peeling</b> rates for a fixed <b>peeling</b> angle, which results in steady state <b>peeling.</b> Based upon the experimental data, a power law relation for the adhesive energy of a packaging tape and its dependence on the rate of <b>peeling</b> is presented. The applicability of the rate dependent law for adhesion energy based upon the steady state experiments to the nonsteady <b>peeling</b> process is critically examined...|$|R

5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be <b>peeled</b> or unpeeled, and the use of <b>peeled</b> carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E

He sees the Castro brothers alone at the bow of the ship; Fidel is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara hands a <b>peeled</b> orange to one of his comrades and returns his gaze to the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.|$|E
5|$|A typical 100-g parsnip {{contains}} 75 Calories (230 kJ) of energy. Most parsnip cultivars {{consist of}} about 80% water, 5% sugar, 1% protein, 0.3% fat, and 5% dietary fiber. The parsnip {{is rich in}} vitamins and minerals, and is particularly rich in potassium with 375mg per 100g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since most of the vitamins and minerals are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is finely <b>peeled</b> or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch is converted to sugar and the root tastes sweeter.|$|E

5|$|Clementine cake is a cake {{prepared}} with clementine fruit {{as a primary}} ingredient and other typical cake ingredients. Additional ingredients can be used, and some preparation variations exist. It can be prepared using whole or <b>peeled</b> clementines that have been manually-seeded, or seedless fruit may be used. It may provide significant amounts of Vitamin D. It can be topped with a sweet glaze or sauce, powdered sugar, honey and clementines or candied clementines. Its origin may be roughly based upon an orange cake developed by the Sephardi Jews. In popular culture, the cake played a minor part in {{the plot of the}} 2013 film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.|$|E
5|$|English cookery has {{developed}} over many centuries {{since at least}} the time of The Forme of Cury, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, <b>peeled,</b> dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are described. It was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.|$|E
5|$|The cake can be {{prepared}} with clementines and/or clementine zest mixed in the batter, with them atop the cake, such as in slices, and in both ways. The seeds and membrane of the clementine can be removed {{as part of the}} preparation process, or seedless clementines can be used. Whole, sliced clementines including the peel, or <b>peeled</b> clementines can be used, and the clementines can be cooked before being used in the cake batter. The fruit can be chopped or blended using a food processor. Candied clementines can be used atop the cake or as a garnish. The almonds used can be toasted or blanched.|$|E

50|$|The {{nutritional}} value of banana <b>peel</b> {{depends on the}} stage of maturity and the cultivar; for example plantain <b>peels</b> contain less fibre than dessert banana <b>peels,</b> and lignin content increases with ripening (from 7 to 15% dry matter). On average, banana <b>peels</b> contain 6-9% dry matter of protein and 20-30% fibre (measured as NDF). Green plantain <b>peels</b> contain 40% starch that is transformed into sugars after ripening. Green banana <b>peels</b> contain much less starch (about 15%) when green than plantain <b>peels,</b> while ripe banana <b>peels</b> contain up to 30% free sugars.|$|R

Old photographs and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details. They <b>peeled</b> away decades of paint layers and fabric to find the original interior and exterior colors. One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring the neon accents. While historical photographs showed where neon existed, {{they had all been}} taken during the daytime when the neon lights were off, making it difficult to determine what color the lights originally were.|$|E
5|$|Two {{to three}} tablespoons of ReaLemon lemon juice has the {{equivalent}} of the juice from one average-sized lemon. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime are used as ingredients in various recipes, such as in baking, grilling, and as an ingredient in marinades and salad dressings. ReaLemon can be used as an ingredient in hot tea, lemonade and hot lemonade, and in various cooked dishes and baked goods such as pies. ReaLemon and other lemon juices can be used to prevent browning discoloration from occurring in <b>peeled</b> or sliced potatoes. This is performed by soaking the sliced potatoes in a mixture of the lemon juice and water. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime must be refrigerated after the bottles are opened.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and <b>peeled</b> them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E

5|$|The Gaza Strip's cooking {{style is}} similar to culinary styles adopted {{by the rest of}} the Levant countries, and is also {{influenced}} by the Mediterranean coast. The staple food for the majority of the inhabitants in the area is fish. Gaza has a major fishing industry and fish is often served either grilled or fried after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, red peppers and cumin and marinated in a mix of coriander, red peppers, cumin, and chopped lemons. Besides fish, as well as other types of seafood, Zibdieh, is a clay pot dish that consists of shrimp baked in a stew of olive oil, garlic, hot peppers, and <b>peeled</b> tomatoes. Crabs are cooked and then stuffed with a red hot pepper paste called shatta.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} of Category 3 {{and higher}} {{are described as}} major hurricanes in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific basins. These storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor curtain wall failures. Buildings that lack a solid foundation, such as mobile homes, are usually destroyed, and gable-end roofs are <b>peeled</b> off. Manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, while larger structures are struck by floating debris. A large number of trees are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. Additionally, terrain may be flooded well inland. Near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks and water will likely also be lost or contaminated.|$|E
5|$|When {{viewed in}} mass, such {{as with a}} spore print, the spores appear to be white. Viewed with a light microscope, the basidiospores are 8–10.5 by 4.5–5.5µm, , smooth, and {{yellowish}} in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored and measure 48–65 long by 6–8µm thick. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (specialized cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent in this species. The pileipellis (cap cuticle) is made of a broad (175–350µm) gelatinous zone, composed of loosely interwoven, slender (1.5–4µm) hyphae; the surface hyphae are a —a dark brownish-gray color. This hyphal arrangement is called an , in which the hyphal walls swell up and gelatinize, giving a translucence to the layer that stands out {{in contrast to the}} underlying flesh. The layer of gelatizined hyphae is tenacious, and may be <b>peeled</b> off the cap as a film. Although clamp connections are found on the hyphae that make up the flesh of the gill, none are found in the cap flesh nor in the pileipellis.|$|E

5|$|Dating Lindow Man is {{problematic}} as {{samples from the}} body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing Lindow Man has been radiocarbon dated to about 300BC, Lindow Man himself has a different date. Early tests at different laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body; later tests suggested a date between 2BC and 119AD. There has been a tendency to ascribe the body to the Iron Age period rather than Roman due to the interpretation that Lindow Man's death {{may have been a}} ritual sacrifice or execution. Explanations for why the peat in which he was found is much older have been sought. Archaeologist P.C.Buckland suggests that as the stratigraphy of the peat appears undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been deposited into a pool that was already some 300years old. Geographer K.E.Barber has argued against this hypothesis, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been too shallow, and suggests that the peat may have been <b>peeled</b> back to allow the burial and then replaced, leaving the stratigraphy apparently undisturbed.|$|E
5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were <b>peeled</b> off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats <b>peeled</b> away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E

A model was developed to predict <b>peel</b> losses and heat ring (HR) development during steam <b>peeling.</b> Based on this model it was shown that creating a homogeneous <b>peel</b> removal effect with minimum HR development should be the main approach to decrease unwanted losses during steam <b>peeling</b> in the future.
