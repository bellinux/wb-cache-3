40|$|Abstract. Sliding {{experiments}} lubricated with hydroxyl silicate magnesium particles as additive {{were performed}} under ambient condition and different loads {{by using an}} AMSLER friction and wear tester. The surface topographies and compositions of worn surface of 45 steel rings were analyzed by SEM and EDAX. The experimental {{results show that the}} friction load had great effect on generation of the frictionally-formed <b>protective</b> <b>coating.</b> No <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> formed on the worn steel surface under lower friction load. However, a smooth and continuous <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> can be developed on the worn surface of the steel when the friction load is high enough. The chemical composition of the <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> is roughly the same as the additive. The additive can be fractured, stretched and flowed along the sliding direction under high contacting stress and instantaneous flash temperature, which result in coating being formed...|$|R

40|$|The {{role of a}} <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> is to {{diminish}} the steel surface scaling during the reheating for hot rolling. The <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> consists of several components, {{and the effect of}} the coating is based on the formation of the modification of Al 2 O 3, amorphous SiO 2 and FeO×Al 2 O 3, which all exhibit low permeability to oxygen at temperature up to 1200 °C. The silica sand powder from the cyclone is a waste product in the separation of silica sand. Tests confirmed that waste cyclone powder could replace the silica flour as one of the ingredients in the <b>protective</b> <b>coating.</b> The results of the efficiency of the <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> after the advanced application of waste cyclone powder on AISI 1059 and AISI 6150 steels are presented.

40|$|A <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> is used {{to protect}} surface of a {{material}} from various deterioration factors. When cracks form and propagate in the coating, water, chloride ion, and carbon dioxide would penetrate through the cracks. This results in {{the deterioration of the}} material, leading to reduction in its serviceability. If the <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> has selfhealing ability, it would effectively protect the materials from the deterioration. In this work a capsule-type self-healing <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> has been developed using vegetable oils as healing agent. Healing-agent-loaded microcapsules are embedded in a coating matrix to obtain a self-healing <b>protective</b> <b>coating.</b> Upon damage-induced cracking, the microcapsules are ruptured by the propagating crack fronts, resulting in release of the healing agent into the crack by capillary action. A healing reaction occurs by atmospheric oxygen, generating a viscoelastic substance. The self-healing coating was evaluated as <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> for steel, and it was demonstrated that our system has good self-healing capability. In conventional capsule-type self-healing systems, healing reactions generally produce hard solids, so the systems are considered to be vulnerable to regeneration of cracks in the healed region. Furthermore, the regenerated cracks can not be healed because healing agent is consumed in the first healing process. It should be noted that our new system can effectively prevent the coating from regeneration of cracks in the healed region...|$|R

40|$|RIM {{encapsulated}} modular {{windows are}} now being used on several vehicles and growth in their use can be predicted. Advantages in glass handling, inven-tory control, assembly and appearance propell this growth. One disadvantage that retards this growth, however, is the old problem of weatherability of urethanes, {{even if they are}} pigmented. This has necessitated the use of either an in-mold-coating or a post paint as a <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> for the urethane, adding to the cost of the process. This paper describes a new class of stabilized RIM polyurethanes, designed to meet the automotive specifications for exterior use without a <b>protective</b> <b>coating,</b> particularly for use in encapsulation of glass for modular windows.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the Trapist cheese production trials in the “Mlekoprodukt” Dairy in Zrenjanin, Serbia. The cheese-making milk was produced on the “Agroklek” Dairy Farm, and Trapist cheese was manufactured using Trapist technology. In the trials {{two types of}} mesophilic starter culture and two types of rennet (animal and microbial) were used. The obtained cheese underwent two different ripening processes: with applied <b>protective</b> <b>coating,</b> and in a vacuum foil. The cheese chemical composition was analysed after 60 and 90 days of ripening. After that its sensory characteristics were also evaluated. The cheese analysis established that dry matter content - fat, ash, protein, total nitrogen, soluble and insoluble nitrogen, pH value, and coefficient of ripening in cheese with <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> were higher {{when compared with the}} cheese packed in a vacuum foil during ripening. The analysis also established that the content of fat in dry matter in cheese, and the contents of water in fat-free matter, sodium-chloride, calcium, and acid based titration for the cheese with the applied <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> were lower when compared with the relevant contents in cheeses in a vacuum foil during ripening. Trapist cheese manufactured using the FD-DVS CH-N 11 (CHR HANSEN, Denmark) starter culture, and Caglificio Clerici (Italy) animal rennet, achieved the highest quality grade. The cheeses with the applied <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> had better sensory properties when compared with cheeses packed in a vacuum foil...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{structures}} {{take the}} advantages of good stability, good ductility, low construction cost, fast construction and hence high flexibility in shape with high utilization rate. With the rapid economic growth, steel structures are popularly used in modern architecture, particularly in supertall buildings of height over 300 m in China. However, the fire behaviour of steel structures should be watched because the mechanical strength of steel reduces when temperature increases. In this paper, fire protective coatings commonly used in China for steel structures were studied by full-scale fire tests. Three types of ultra-thin, one type of thin and one type of thick coatings were evaluated. Test samples were prepared by applying the coatings on the typical H-type steel load bearing beams following standard fire resistance test. Different sets of fire protective coatings were applied {{on the surface of}} the sample as in the actual construction process. The coating thickness for the steel structural members met the Chinese regulation with ultra-thin fire <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> of 2. 00 mm ± 0. 02 mm, thin fire <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> of 5. 0 mm ± 0. 5 mm and thick fire <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> of 25 mm ± 2 mm. Experiments were carried out in the large-scale testing facilities at Sichuan Fire Research Institute, Dujiangyan, Sichuan, China. The transient temperatures at different positions inside and outside the steel structure, and structural distortion of the steel structural members with different fire protective coatings under the testing condition were measured. Results on the measured temperatures, middle flexibility change values and corresponding time parameters on related parts of the test samples were then studied. A mathematical model was used for analyzing the result. The associated variables and correlation expressions among different variables were studied. Results can be taken as a reference for drafting new standards on evaluating the fire protective coatings for load bearing steel structures. For example, for the fire test of ultra-thin fire <b>protective</b> <b>coating,</b> it is possible to analyze and generalize the acquired data on temperature-time curve. For the thick-type steel structure fire <b>protective</b> <b>coating,</b> when the maximum temperature of the steel structure approaches 500 oC and there is a high rate of temperature change, the fire resistance period of the structural members with <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> can be predicted...|$|R
