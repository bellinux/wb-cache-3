6000|$|In {{all these}} Examples it is evident, {{that there is}} an {{extraordinary}} and adventitious force, by which the globular Figure of the contained heterogeneous fluid is altered; neither can it be imagined, how it should otherwise be of any other Figure then Globular: For being by the heterogeneous fluid equally protruded every way, whatsoever part is protuberant, will be thereby deprest. From this cause it is, that in its effects it does very much resemble a round Spring (such as a Hoop.) For as in a round Spring there is required an additional pressure against two opposite sides, to reduce it into an Oval Form, or to force it in between the sides of a Hole, whose Diameter is less then that of the Spring, there must be a considerable force or <b>protusion</b> against the concave or inner side of the Spring; So to alter this spherical constitution of an included fluid body, there is required more pressure against opposite sides to reduce it into an Oval; and, to press it into an Hole less in Diameter then it self, it requires a greater protrusion against all the other sides, What degrees of force are requisite to reduce them into longer and longer Ovals, or to press them into less and less holes, I have not yet experimentally calculated; but thus much by experiment I find in general, that there is alwayes required a greater pressure to close them into longer Ovals, or protude them into smaller holes. The necessity and reason of this, were it requisite, I could easily explain: but being not so necessary, and requiring more room and time then I have for it at present, I shall here omit it; and proceed to shew, that this may be presently found true, if Experiment be made with a round Spring (the way of making which trials is obvious enough.) And with the fluid bodies of Mercury, Air, &c, the way of trying which, will be somewhat more difficult; and therefore I shall in brief describe it.

The difference in dentition was not visible in mice due to the radically different structure of mice teeth from human teeth, but it is considered reasonable that that difference also is due to the mutation.

BBS {{is caused by}} mutations in > 20 genes, a subset of which form the so-called BBSome. The BBSome is a complex that coats intracellular vesicles and interacts with key proteins, such as small GTPases, that regulate the trafficking of these vesicles {{to the base of}} cilia. Cilia are microtubular <b>protusions</b> present on the surface of most cells that are defective in a key group of disorders known as ciliopathies, of which BBS is one. BBSome components particularly localize to the basal body of cilia, and also centrosomes, where they interact with pericentriolar material proteins that regulate their function. The BBSome also facilitates the transport of key cargo within cilia by acting as an adaptor protein for intraflagellar transport complexes, and as such BBS mutations lead to a variety of functional defects in cilia in a tissue- and cell-type-specific manner. This might include defects in photoreceptor trafficking linked to the connecting cilium, abnormal hedgehog signaling within bone, and aberrant calcium signaling in response to fluid flow along renal tubules, although the precise mechanisms are still not completely understood. Taken together, the BBSome is an important complex that may be targeted for treatment of a variety of common and important disorders, and understanding the precise function of the BBSome will be essential to capitalize on this translationally.

40|$|Resumo de comunicação apresentada em " 16 th Evergreen Phage Biology Meeting, Olympia", WA, EUA, 7 - 12 Agosto 2005. Biofilms are {{frequently}} in many industrial environments and {{are responsible for}} severe negative impacts such as equipment damage, loss in product quality and in economics. For instance in pulp and paper industry, microorganisms together with their exudates and the entangled fibres and filler materials form massive and slimy <b>protusions</b> hanging out from the material surfaces, which interfere with the paper-making process in various steps. Also, in dairy industry, biofilm presence {{may be responsible for}} pathogen cross-contamination, product defects such as package bloating, decreased shelf life, and off flavours, odours and textures. The eradication of these biofilms, as reported by several authors, is very difficult {{due to the nature of}} biofilm structure and the physiological attributes of biofilm organisms which confer an inherent resistance to biocides. The application of biological agents such as phages as an alternative to the chemical products is an interesting approach that should be studied in more detail. This work aimed the isolation of bacteria and the respective bacteriophages from a pulp and paper mill and from a dairy industry. The focus was given to EPS producing bacteria such as P. fluorescens, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Staphylococcus sciuri, and Klebsiella oxytoca. Phages were isolated from the industrial effluents and also nearby waste water treatment plants. After phage isolation from each industrial sector, the selection was based on the wider broad of lytic activity and time of bacterial elimination. For each type of industry, a 5 phage cocktail is being developed to be tested in the control the most prevalent biofilm producing bacteria...|$|R
