25|$|The {{pavilion}} can {{be divided}} into the clubhouse in the centre with the Governor's Pavilion and the Maharaja of Patiala Pavilion on either side and is a three-story art deco nautical structure with rounded pediments, flagpoles and <b>port-hole</b> windows. The pavilion boasts of dark wood wall panelling and decorative marble floors. The walls of the pavilion are adorned with portraits of past and present cricketers and photographs of famous cricket matches.|$|E
2500|$|This chamber tomb is a dolmen, {{the most}} common form of megalithic {{structure}} in Europe. It stands at the eastern end of a flat topped, [...] long, [...] wide earthen mound, forming part of a chambered long barrow. It is one of the Severn-Cotswold type, and consists of a cove of three upright stones (orthostats), supporting a large, flat, capstone. All the stones are mudstone, which, as with those used at Tinkinswood, were probably available locally. The capstone, which slopes downwards from south east to north west (the left side of the entrance towards the back, right), measures four metres (13ft) long, three metres (10ft) wide, and [...] thick. The insides of the two facing, rectangular, uprights have been smoothed off and there is a <b>port-hole</b> at the top of the triangular, rear stone, similar to some other dolmens, such as at Trethevy Quoit, in Cornwall. The burial chamber has a minimum internal height of [...] and is in an east/west alignment, with the entrance facing east.|$|E
60|$|A PEEP THROUGH A <b>PORT-HOLE</b> AT THE SUBTERRANEAN PARTS OF A MAN-OF-WAR.|$|E
5000|$|Blazoning: [...] "Argent, above a red bridge crenellé, a red tower crenellé, two <b>port-holes</b> argent, {{between two}} spruce trees vert, in base a trout gules." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{talking now}} dropped off, as the frontiersman {{said it would}} be best to remain silent and keep on guard at the various <b>port-holes</b> in the shutters.|$|R
2500|$|.....a strong work, of {{considerable}} size, with a projection on each square, furnished with <b>port-holes,</b> and calculated to stand a siege by an enemy provided with small arms only.|$|R
60|$|I {{opened the}} <b>port-hole</b> {{as far as}} it would go, and lit a cigarette.|$|E
60|$|Legget ran to him, {{and acting}} upon a {{motion of the}} Indian's hand, looked out through the little <b>port-hole.</b>|$|E
60|$|Legget {{remained}} immovable. One of the savages {{peered out}} through a little <b>port-hole</b> {{at the rear of}} the hut. The others continued their meal.|$|E
6000|$|... “Muster the crew, sir,” Lord Cochrane said briefly. The crew silently assembled. The <b>port-holes</b> of the O’Higgins {{were all}} opened, {{and the men}} could be seen {{standing}} at the guns.|$|R
60|$|Down, down we {{continued}} to sink until the heavy glass of the <b>port-holes</b> became noticeably warm from {{the heat of the}} water without. Evidently we were very far beneath the surface crust of Mars.|$|R
60|$|Through the <b>port-holes</b> I beheld an unruffled, sun-smitten horizon. The {{horizon of}} a windless day. But its {{spaciousness}} alone {{was enough to}} give me a sense of a fortunate escape, a momentary exultation of freedom.|$|R
60|$|Shane {{crouched}} {{back to his}} <b>port-hole,</b> {{with his}} bloody bandaged face and his bloody hands. And just then the train stopped with a rattling crash.|$|E
60|$|We {{could hear}} the men working on the broken propellers, and from the <b>port-hole</b> we {{could see that the}} vessel was {{drifting}} lazily toward the south.|$|E
60|$|Presently the plash of oars {{were heard}} near the vessel, and next moment a boat approached, {{but not from}} such a quarter as to be visible from the <b>port-hole.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not clever {{enough or}} slow enough for their Z-Z fashions," [...] said he. [...] "We got {{alongside}} and slapped it in through their <b>port-holes</b> until they struck their colours. But {{where have you}} been, Sir Cuthbert?" ...|$|R
60|$|Presently the {{sensation}} of sinking became very apparent. We were going down swiftly. Now {{we could hear the}} water rushing past the <b>port-holes,</b> and in the dim light that filtered through them to the water beyond the swirling eddies were plainly visible.|$|R
60|$|On our left, Porpheero's {{southwest}} point, {{a mighty}} rock, long tiers of galleries within, deck on deck; and flag-staffs, like an admiral's masts: a line-of-battle-ship, all purple stone, and {{anchored in the}} sea. Here Bello's lion crouched; and, through a thousand <b>port-holes,</b> eyed the world.|$|R
60|$|Dan {{was at one}} <b>port-hole</b> and Ralph at another, and {{now both}} fired simultaneously. Whether the shots were {{effective}} they could not tell. Certainly none of the Indians dropped.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a good}} shot, and {{the crew}} cheered as they saw the {{splinters}} fly {{at the edge of}} the <b>port-hole.</b> Shot after shot was fired with varying success.|$|E
60|$|She fished again, and {{was rewarded}} with a silver-mounted whisky flask. She held it to {{the light of a}} <b>port-hole,</b> and the liquor showed a quarter of the {{distance}} from the bottom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{but they}} had no cannon in those days," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "They had only bows and arrows, spears, javelins, and such sort of weapons, so that they did not require any <b>port-holes.</b> The men could shoot their weapons {{from the top of the}} wall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "While High was {{examining}} some hieroglyphics on {{the wall}} that the stone-masons must have made when their tools slipped, I stepped into the front room. That was at least thirty by fifty feet, stone floor, six little windows like square <b>port-holes</b> that didn't let much light in.|$|R
60|$|The archers {{prepared}} their {{bows and}} arrows, and {{stood behind the}} <b>port-holes</b> in readiness to pour a volley into the enemy; the men-at-arms grasped their pikes and swords; while above, the sailors moved hither and thither as if making preparations for defence, but in reality preparing the grapnels and ropes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lor'! Misser Fid," [...] {{cried the}} black, [...] "here masser Harry, wid a {{head out of}} <b>port-hole,</b> up dereaway in a light-house, singing-out like a marine in a boat wid a plug out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 188 The {{distance}} judged for shot {{of every}} size, [...] The linstocks touch, the ponderous ball expires: [...] The vigorous seaman every <b>port-hole</b> plies, [...] And adds {{his heart to}} every gun he fires! ...|$|E
60|$|Phaidor and I {{were taken}} below decks, where, still fast bound, we were {{thrown into a}} small {{compartment}} which contained a single <b>port-hole.</b> As our escort left us they barred the door behind them.|$|E
6000|$|... "If it weren't {{for that}} {{threatening}} fort one could imagine this little hamlet, nestling under the great bluff, as quiet and secure {{as it is}} beautiful," [...] said Helen. [...] "But that charred stockade fence with its scarred bastions and these lowering <b>port-holes,</b> always keep me alive to the reality." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{petition}} {{was granted}} and the proprietors {{of the new}} township began recruiting 60 families to settle in the town. John Burke, Samuel Connable, Lieut. Ebenezer Sheldon, and Deacon Sheldon, built the first four houses, in 1738. They were of hewn logs, with <b>port-holes</b> in the walls for defence against the Indians.|$|R
6000|$|Thus a {{man-of-war}} is {{a floating}} house with six stories--the poop being the garret, and the orlop-deck the cellars. The upper decks are lighted by sky-lights; those farther down by <b>port-holes</b> (or gun-holes) and windows; {{the lowest of}} all by candles or lamps, daylight being for ever banished from those gloomy submarine regions! ...|$|R
60|$|Whether {{conscience}} was inoperative at {{that moment}} we know not, but Brown acted on the suggestion, and briskly amalgamated the butter with the coffee, while {{the crowd at the}} <b>port-hole</b> politely but continuously demanded more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tompkins," [...] {{said the}} Captain as the bosun's mate entered, [...] "be {{good enough to}} stand on the locker and stick your head through the stern <b>port-hole,</b> {{and tell me what you}} think of the weather." ...|$|E
60|$|And his {{was genuine}} surprise, on {{entering}} the steward's room, to behold Michael just rousing from his curled-up {{sleep on the}} floor. But when he left, his surprise would have been shocking could he have seen through the closed door what immediately began to take place. Out through the open <b>port-hole,</b> in a steady stream, Daughtry was passing {{the contents of the}} room. Everything went that belonged to him, including the turtle- shell and the photographs and calendars on the wall. Michael, with the command of silence laid upon him, went last. Remained only a sea-chest and two suit-cases, themselves too large for the <b>port-hole</b> but bare of contents.|$|E
60|$|The further {{extremity}} of the cuddy, overhanging the ship's stern, was {{pierced with}} three openings, windows or <b>port-holes,</b> according as men or cannon might peer, socially or unsocially, out of them. At present neither men nor cannon were seen, though huge ring-bolts and other rusty iron fixtures of the wood-work hinted of twenty-four-pounders.|$|R
60|$|If {{most men}} {{were like a}} fellow I saw on the Yarmouth boat one day, I {{could account for the}} seeming enigma easily enough. It was just off Southend Pier, I recollect, and he was leaning out through one of the <b>port-holes</b> in a very {{dangerous}} position. I went up to him to try and save him.|$|R
60|$|The {{cabin in}} which we found {{ourselves}} extended entirely across the ship, having <b>port-holes</b> on either side below the water line. No sooner were all below than a number of commands were given, in accordance with which the hatch was closed and secured, and the vessel commenced to vibrate to the rhythmic purr of its machinery.|$|R
