5|$|Negative {{oxidation}} {{states can}} occur as Zintl phases, as either free lead anions, as in Ba2Pb, with lead formally being lead(−IV), or in oxygen-sensitive ring-shaped or <b>polyhedral</b> cluster ions {{such as the}} trigonal bipyramidal Pb52− ion, where two lead atoms are lead(−I) and three are lead(0). In such anions, each atom is at a <b>polyhedral</b> vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp3 hybrid orbitals, the other two being an external lone pair. They may be made in liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium.|$|E

5|$|A uniform {{honeycomb}} in hyperbolic {{space is}} a uniform tessellation of uniform <b>polyhedral</b> cells.

5|$|Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance {{printmaker}} {{who made}} important contributions to <b>polyhedral</b> literature in his 1525 book, Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement), meant {{to teach the}} subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples of perspective in Underweysung der Messung are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of <b>polyhedral</b> nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing. Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion) in 1528.|$|E
5|$|Escher's {{later work}} Four Regular Solids (Stereometric Figure) {{returned}} {{to the theme of}} <b>polyhedral</b> compounds, depicting a more explicitly Keplerian form in which the compound of the cube and octahedron is nested within the compound of the dodecahedron and icosahedron.|$|E
5|$|The print {{depicts a}} hollowed-out {{compound}} of three octahedra, a <b>polyhedral</b> compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space. Numerous other polyhedra and <b>polyhedral</b> compounds {{float in the}} background; the four largest are, on the upper left, the compound of cube and octahedron; on the upper right, the stella octangula; on the lower left, a compound of two cubes; and on the lower right, a solid {{version of the same}} octahedron 3-compound. The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} woodcut, Study for Stars, {{completed}} in August 1948, depicts wireframe versions {{of several of}} the same polyhedra and <b>polyhedral</b> compounds, floating in black within a square composition, but without the chameleons. The largest polyhedron shown in Study for Stars, a stellated rhombic dodecahedron, is also one of two polyhedra depicted prominently in Escher's 1961 print Waterfall.|$|E
5|$|Boranes are {{chemical}} compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BxHy. These compounds {{do not occur}} in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are <b>polyhedral,</b> some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 {{are based on the}} fusion of two 10-atom clusters.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and <b>polyhedral</b> structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Stars was likely {{influenced}} by Escher's own interest in both geometry and astronomy, {{by a long}} history of using geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by Leonardo da Vinci. Commentators have interpreted the cage's compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy, or to twinned crystals in crystallography. The image contrasts the celestial order of its <b>polyhedral</b> shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology.|$|E
5|$|The only items {{required}} {{to play the}} game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of <b>polyhedral</b> dice. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage. Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures and various campaign settings.|$|E
5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the <b>polyhedral</b> graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and {{therefore}} also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyhedral</b> cones play {{a central}} role in the {{representation}} theory of polyhedra. For instance, the decomposition theorem for polyhedra states that every polyhedron can be written as the Minkowski sum of a convex polytope and a <b>polyhedral</b> cone. <b>Polyhedral</b> cones also play an important part in proving the related Finite Basis Theorem for polytopes which shows that every polytope is a polyhedron and every bounded polyhedron is a polytope.|$|E
25|$|The Koebe–Andreev–Thurston circle packing theorem can be {{interpreted}} as providing another strengthening of Steinitz's theorem, that every 3-connected planar graph may be represented as a convex polyhedron {{in such a way that}} all of its edges are tangent to the same unit sphere. By performing a carefully chosen Möbius transformation of a circle packing before transforming it into a polyhedron, it is possible to find a <b>polyhedral</b> realization that realizes all the symmetries of the underlying graph, in the sense that every graph automorphism is a symmetry of the <b>polyhedral</b> realization. More generally, if G is a <b>polyhedral</b> graph and K is any smooth three-dimensional convex body, it is possible to find a <b>polyhedral</b> representation of G in which all edges are tangent to K.|$|E
25|$|If a <b>polyhedral</b> graph {{does not}} contain a {{triangular}} face, its dual graph does contain a triangle and is also <b>polyhedral,</b> so one can realize the dual in this way and then realize the original graph as the polar polyhedron of the dual realization. It is also possible to realize any <b>polyhedral</b> graph directly by choosing the outer face to be any face with at most five vertices (something that exists in all <b>polyhedral</b> graphs) and choosing more carefully the fixed shape of this face {{in such a way}} that the Tutte embedding can be lifted, or by using an incremental method instead of Tutte's method to find a liftable planar drawing that does not have equal weights for all the interior edges.|$|E

25|$|Another {{strengthening}} of Steinitz's theorem, by Barnette and Grünbaum, states that for any <b>polyhedral</b> graph, any {{face of the}} graph, and any convex polygon representing that face, {{it is possible to}} find a <b>polyhedral</b> realization of the whole graph that has the specified shape for the designated face. This is related to a theorem of Tutte, that any <b>polyhedral</b> graph can be drawn in the plane with all faces convex and any specified shape for its outer face. However, the planar graph drawings produced by Tutte's method do not necessarily lift to convex polyhedra. Instead, Barnette and Grünbaum prove this result using an inductive method It is also always possible, given a <b>polyhedral</b> graph G and an arbitrary cycle C, to find a realization such that C forms the silhouette of the realization under parallel projection.|$|E

25|$|The Maxwell–Cremona {{correspondence}} {{has been}} used to obtain <b>polyhedral</b> realizations of <b>polyhedral</b> graphs by combining it with a planar graph drawing method of W. T. Tutte, the Tutte embedding. Tutte's method begins by fixing one face of a <b>polyhedral</b> graph into convex position in the plane. This face will become the outer face of a drawing of a graph. The method continues by setting up a system of linear equations in the vertex coordinates, according to which each remaining vertex should be placed at the average of its neighbors. Then as Tutte showed, this system of equations will have a unique solution in which each face of the graph is drawn as a convex polygon. The result is almost an equilibrium stress: if one assigns weight one to each interior edge, then each interior vertex of the drawing is in equilibrium. However, it is not always possible to assign negative numbers to the exterior edges so that they, too, are in equilibrium.|$|E
