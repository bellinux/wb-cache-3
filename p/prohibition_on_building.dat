2500|$|In June 2010, Greenpeace anti-nuclear activists invaded Forsmark {{nuclear power}} plant to protest the then-plan to remove the {{government}} <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> new {{nuclear power plant}}s. [...] In October 2012, 20 Greenpeace activists scaled the outer perimeter fence of the Ringhals nuclear plant, {{and there was also}} an incursion of 50 activists at the Forsmark plant. Greenpeace said that its non-violent actions were protests against the continuing operation of these reactors, which it says are unsafe in European stress tests, and to emphasise that stress tests did nothing to prepare against threats from outside the plant. A report by the Swedish nuclear regulator said that [...] "the current overall level of protection against sabotage is insufficient". Although Swedish nuclear power plants have security guards, the police are responsible for emergency response. The report criticised the level of cooperation between nuclear site staff and police in the case of sabotage or attack.|$|E

25|$|Several {{planning}} {{decisions have}} {{played an important}} role in the development of Ottawa and its architecture. One long standing rule that had a great effect on the downtown core, was a <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>buildings</b> being taller than the 92 meter tall Peace Tower. It was instituted to prevent the Parliament Buildings from being dwarfed by more modern structures. While today there are a number of taller buildings, Ottawa's central business district still does not have the towering buildings found in most other North American cities, instead having a considerable number of mid-sized towers.|$|R
5000|$|Since a {{windmill}} in a heerlijkheid {{was primarily}} {{the property of}} the lord (although leased out to a miller), wind rights were one way for a lord to discourage competition. In consideration for payment of this tax, the lord ensured that there were no wind obstructions around the mill by imposing a <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>buildings</b> and high trees in the area. Another obligation imposed on residents was the [...] "mill obligation" [...] (molendwang), which required them to have their grain ground at the lord's mill. To a certain extent, this was another way for a lord to safeguard the income received from the mill.|$|R
50|$|The area in and {{surrounding}} New River State Park was largely free of development until 1965 when the Appalachian Power Company {{applied for a}} license to build a dam across the New River for hydro-electric power. Local opposition to the project {{led to the formation}} of New River State Park in 1975. The North Carolina General Assembly declared that the New River from the confluence of Dog Creek to the Virginia state line was a State Scenic River. The same section of the river was named a National Wild and Scenic River by the United States Department of the Interior in 1976. The legislation of the North Carolina house and the United States Congress have preserved the river a natural state with <b>prohibitions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>building</b> of dams and reservoirs.|$|R

5000|$|The English Volunteer Force {{is a small}} right-wing street protest {{movement}} {{based in}} the United Kingdom, which Joe Mulhall considers to be an English Defence League splinter group. Created by John Sheridan and Jason Lock in July 2012, the group calls for the halting of all Muslim immigration, <b>prohibitions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>building</b> of mosques and the sale of halal meat, the rejection of multiculturalism, and a rejection of what they term the 'Islamification' of Great Britain. The group plans to [...] "Unite the Right". The group held its first demonstration in Birmingham in January 2013 which passed peacefully. On 9 March 2013 the EVF held a demonstration in Stanmore, London, against the radical preacher Abu Qatada's continued presence in Great Britain. The group also conducted an online interview with a blog called [...] "Terrorscope".|$|R

Otherwise, it is prohibited to use {{an elevator}} on Shabbat because pressing the button to operate the elevator closes a circuit, which violates the <b>prohibition</b> of <b>building</b> <b>on</b> Shabbat, and may also indirectly lead to [...] "writing" [...] of the new floor number in the display.|$|R
