5|$|Having {{just nine}} turns, the fewest on the Formula One calendar, the circuit offers very few {{low-speed}} sections and gave teams {{an opportunity to}} push their <b>power</b> <b>units</b> to their potential. As in the previous year's event, and {{for the third straight}} event overall, the yellow-banded soft compound tyre were the prime dry selection while the red-banded supersoft compound were the option dry selection. Pirelli also supplied two wet weather compounds: the green-banded intermediate compound and the blue-banded full wet compound.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and <b>power</b> <b>units.</b>|$|E
40|$|High {{reliability}} {{and security of}} <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> are basic requirements when the <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> maneuvering mode operation. The reactor stability under disturbances both at steady load and maneuvering load embodies the guarantees of <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> safe and reliable operation. A quantitative measure of the reactor stability is assessed by the axial offset representing the technological characteristics of energy release uniformity, therefore the axial offset minimum deviation is WWER- 1000 operation efficiency measure. The <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> capacity automated control systems’ influence on axial offset under maneuvering mode is investigated. Considered is the <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> compromise-combined control program, which maintains a constant axial offset value when <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> switching from one power level to another...|$|R

5|$|Fernando Alonso {{began the}} weekend's event knowing {{he would start}} {{from the back of}} the grid due to a number of {{penalties}} incurred for changing engine parts. Honda provided him with an upgraded internal combustion engine, which had been designed using the team's last four in-season development tokens. Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only had one of the upgraded <b>power</b> <b>units</b> available. However, Alonso used the new power unit only in the first practice session before switching back to the older unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E
5|$|The 1900 season {{revealed}} grave {{problems with}} Rostislavs boilers. Black smoke from burning oil was more conspicuous than coal smoke. Uneven distribution of heat inside the boilers caused severe local overheating, buckling of fireboxes and sudden backdrafts. For {{three and a}} half months the boilers failed one by one, starting with small auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>units</b> and ending with the main boilers. Oil delivered by the Rothschild-controlled Russian Standard Oil was not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the Baltic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} part of {{qualifying}} (Q1), Mercedes was able to refrain from using the faster super-soft tyres, nevertheless setting times below 1:16. Fastest in the session was Romain Grosjean, who was narrowly quicker than the Mercedes drivers, but on the softer tyre compound. With Button not participating, four drivers were left to be eliminated. The two Manor drivers once more did not make the cut and took 18th and 19th on the grid, with Roberto Merhi out-qualifying his teammate Will Stevens {{for the first time in}} a qualifying that both drivers participated in. Joining them on the sidelines were two more prominent drivers: both Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa suffered from problems with their <b>power</b> <b>units,</b> finishing 16th and 17th respectively.|$|E
50|$|McLaren, {{who were}} {{expected}} {{to benefit from the}} start changes, were set to start the race {{from the back of the}} grid. After they had already been allowed to use one additional <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> in the 2015 season, the team had used their sixth <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> for the Hungarian Grand Prix, and now equipped both cars with a seventh, heavily revised version of their <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> for Belgium on Friday. McLaren made another <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> change on Saturday, since a mid-season change in regulations meant that penalties could no longer result in in-race time penalties. The cumulated 105-place grid penalty set a new record in Formula One.|$|R
50|$|A {{fuel cell}} {{auxiliary}} <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> (FC-APU) is {{a fuel cell}} based auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> on a vehicle that provides energy for functions other than propulsion. They are mainly used in trucking, aviation, marine and recreational vehicles.|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{technical}} developments, Ferrari upgraded their engine for their home race by using {{three of their}} development tokens while Mercedes spent all seven of their remaining engine tokens. As a result of this, Mercedes became the first team in 2015 to use all their tokens, with both Honda and Ferrari having four tokens remaining and Renault having twelve tokens left for later in the season. Because of these changes both Mercedes cars were on their third powerplants, whilst both Ferrari cars were on their fourth <b>power</b> <b>units.</b> Additionally, Toro Rosso, Red Bull and McLaren received grid penalties for exceeding their parts usage, forcing them {{to start at the}} back of the grid. McLaren went back to using their snub nose design, which they had replaced earlier in the season ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, in order to achieve better aerodynamics and lower drag for the high-speed Monza circuit.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special <b>power</b> <b>units</b> that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
