5|$|During the 18–19th centuries, {{the study}} of the three body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert led to more {{accurate}} <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> the motions of the Moon and planets.

5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{observation}} {{of a total}} solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, helped to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity. By comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation Taurus, with and without the Sun between them, Arthur Eddington stated that the theoretical <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> gravitational lenses were confirmed. The observation with the Sun between the stars was only possible during totality since the stars are then visible. Though Eddington's observations were near the experimental limits of accuracy at the time, work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results.|$|E

We then examine the empirical relevance of the hypotheses for Jewish and Moslem population groups in Israel. The empirical analysis is more detailed than previous studies by, for example, splitting the sample according to the wife's labour market status. The evidence supports the Becker-Keeley <b>prediction</b> <b>about</b> {{the effects of the}} spouses' wage rates, the Bergstrom-Bagnoli <b>prediction</b> <b>about</b> the effect of the husband's wage rate in a traditional society, and the various hypotheses we propose.

25|$|Gemma edited his father's {{posthumous work}} De astrolabo catholica (1556). In 1560, he began {{publishing}} {{his own work}} in the annual series Ephemerides meteorologicae, printed by Joannes Withagen. The Ephemerides is the earliest known astrological work from the Low Countries to carry an official notice of approval from the Roman Catholic Church. Gemma moved away from judicial astrology and renounced astrological <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> political events, and seems to have gradually confined himself to <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> astronomical phenomena and meteorological astrology. His predictions for 1561, for example, provided detailed information on every lunar phase, and most planetary aspects and phases of fixed stars {{in relation to the}} sun, with a thoroughness that surpassed the predictions of his contemporaries. He remained committed to astrologic medicine, however, and believed that predictable atmospheric conditions, extending to astral conjunctions, generated disease.|$|E

But a theory of lineup memory would make a specific <b>prediction</b> <b>about</b> the first latent variable (the distribution of memory signals) without necessarily making any <b>prediction</b> <b>about</b> the second (criterion variability). In parametric ROC analysis, the effects of those latent variables are purposefully conflated because the only goal is to obtain a “best guess” as to the likely empirical trajectory of the ROC curve (had those empirical ROC data been collected). To test the predictions of a theory of memory, a statistical model like that must {{give way to a}} model of memory signals that can measure the latent variables of interest. We turn to that issue next.|$|R

However, as in the example below, this requirement does not always seem to work.|$|E

However, the passive context is not necessarily exactly correlated with active context measurements due to the time delay between measurements and also the fact that actual channel rate cannot be measured by passive means alone (i.e. incomplete information). Therefore, the benefit of using passive context is that it has wider applicability for other terminals in the vicinity and can provide a certain <b>prediction</b> <b>about</b> likely performance without the need for any transmissions or probing on alternative channels (which would also incur extra delay).
