5000|$|The {{development}} of bio-based packaging {{has been an}} important goal for <b>packaging</b> <b>producers.</b> On June 3, 2015, Coca-Cola presented their version of a 100% recyclable PET bottle, called PlantBottle™ which in fact was the first of its kind. In contrast to usual PET, PlantBottle™ does not rely on fossil-based material. For the production of its bottle, Coca-Cola is supplied by the Brazilian petrochemical and biopolymers company Braskem, who produce polyethylene that is based in its entirety on sugarcane ethanol. Furthermore, Tetra Pak announced the launch of a 100% renewable package for their dairy products. This innovative packaging concept won Tetra Pak the [...] "Best carton or pouch" [...] and [...] "Best manufacturing or processing innovation" [...] prizes at the World Beverage Innovation Awards 2015 as well as a Gold Award at the Pro2Pac Excellence Awards in the UK for [...] "being the world’s first carton made entirely from plant-based, renewable packaging materials". For the production of its sustainable packaging solution Tetra Pak also uses sugar cane bioplastics provided by Braskem.|$|E
50|$|For {{the period}} between 2011 and 2016, Brazil shows an {{estimated}} median growth of 6.2%, realizing a sales value of US$34 billion in 2016, leaving behind Canada and being on a level with France. The constant growth of the Brazilian packaging market is not a unique phenomenon. The global packaging market is on the rise, {{which is due to}} a combination of various factors like the growing urbanization, investments in the construction sector and the expansion of the health sector. The demand for environmentally friendly packaging types has also been increasing steadily since the 2000s and the resulting growth from innovation contributes to this trend. Additionally, the rapid growth of the so-called BRIC states {{over the course of the}} 2000s as well as the early post-crisis period plays a major role in the growth trend of the global packaging market. Despite the 2015 economic slowdowns - especially in China and Brazil - the highest growth rates for the 2011-2016 period can be observed in these states, with China, India, Brazil and Russia showing growth rates of 7.9%, 7.7%, 6.2% and 4.9%, respectively. The high growth rates in these countries can be explained by rising personal incomes, resulting in higher demand for a broad product range, which in turn creates growth for the <b>packaging</b> <b>producers</b> of these respective products. Despite its good CAGR, it was projected that due to the Brazilian recession the 2014 sales equaling US$35 billion would have decreased by 2.9% in 2016, to reach US$34 billion.|$|E

While all products need packaging in different stages in the supply network, <b>packaging</b> <b>producers</b> deliver into a “core ” network. Thus they are seldom an integrated actor of the core supply network. Consequently, the more the package and product development can be functionally combined, and integrated to the supply chain system, the greater the possibility of being competitive. This is accepted theoretically, however, industrial consequences are not yet highlighted since empirical knowledge about packaging effects on the entire production and supply network is limited...|$|E

30|$|The {{development}} {{also means}} that the Chinese packaging suppliers are starting to compete in international and European markets. To stay and become more competitive, <b>packaging</b> <b>producers</b> need to help customers by providing lean solutions, more services and value. A cost saving effect can often be achieved as an outcome of concrete challenging targets for materials reduction {{in the context of}} future limited material availability and high price. It was also concluded that materials research needs to progress even further and stretch the limits of what can be achieved. It was concluded that the sector should aim for lean and light packaging materials, but also that all packaging materials have to be recoverable. These results are in line with the findings of earlier studies [34], whereby more recent studies [13] broaden the environmental dimension to stress sustainability aspects, including social and financial dimensions. Sustainability aspects are most often closely linked to the materials used. Material development requires a lot of resources and foresight input was considered essential to get decisions right in the light of long lead times and large investments.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{uncertainty}} about the current state and maturity of green supply chains in South Africa’s fast-moving consumer goods sector. Although some frameworks exist, {{there appears to be}} a lack both of clear measurements and of an understanding of them; and this leaves companies unable to measure themselves against a standardised scale. Determine if there is a potential for green supply chains to function in South Africa. Questions that must be answered in order to determine the involvement of companies in green supply chain management include the following: • What environmentally-sustainable activities are they busy with? • What has worked in the past? (That is, what are their success stories?) • What accreditations are they looking at? • What are they measuring themselves against? • Are they aware of green supply chains and environmental issues? The focus of the project is on green supply chains and on how companies are applying them. Specifically, the focus is on the fast-moving consumer goods sector in South Africa. The areas of focus within the supply chain will be the suppliers, <b>packaging,</b> <b>producers,</b> retailers, and transport. This paper outlines the need for a quick assessment tool to map the maturity of a company’s green supply chain operations, investigates what is green supply chain management and its current maturity in the South African FMCG sector by presenting a ‘green supply chain maturity assessment questionnaire’ as a potential answer to this need. The experiences that the researchers have gained in the development of the questionnaire are summed up, as are the strengths and weaknesses of green supply chains in South Africa. Guidelines for a green supply chain procedure are presented, and a research agenda for further development is proposed. The surveys showed that in South African green supply chains there is a definite need for green supply chain management with a specific focus that has to be placed on the sourcing processes. The case studies demonstrate how successful ‘green’ focused retailers have gone about installing ‘green’ sourcing methods. There {{is a general}} lack in the awareness, some shortcomings in the transportation departments and a focus on money instead of environment. Thesis (B Eng.

40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) are a {{group of}} brominated compounds widely used as flame retardants. PBDEs are structurally similar to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and appear to act similarly in the environment. Due to their persistence and lipophilicity, PBDEs {{are found to be}} bioaccumulated and biomagnified in the food chain. Current research in PBDEs is focused on their occurrences, concentration, fate and transport in the environment, and the impact in the ecosystem and human health. Since PBDEs are not regulated in the USA, large amounts of these harmful chemicals are being dumped indiscriminately into the drainage system. As a result, these PBDEs still persist after wastewater treatment process. In addition, these PBDEs are then released into the aquifers. ^ In this research, an innovated and environmentally friendly sample preparation technique called Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction (SBSE) was used. This technique is coupled with thermal desorption, Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry for detection of organic compounds in several matrices. The methodology has the advantage of detecting PBDEs at low concentrations, i. e. ng/L (parts per trillion) range. The principal target compounds for this study are BDE # 47, BDE # 99, BDE # 100, which are commonly found in wastewater, and are the most concerned in terms of their toxicity to both the environment and health. ^ This research studied the contamination of PBDEs in our region. Specifically, the objectives of this study include: (1) Identify the most common PBDEs in wastewater and water bodies at the border region (El Paso, TX, US and Cd. Juarez, Mexico). (2) Evaluate profile, removal per plant and influence of seasonal temperature on PBDEs levels in wastewater and sewage sludge. (3) Establish the first baseline assessment for PBDEs presence in water, wastewater and sewage sludge, in the border region. (4) Identify the sources of pollution. ^ A total of 163 samples were collected and analyzed. Collection sites included six Waste Water treatment Plants (WWTPs), water and sediments from a wetland, and tap water. Wastewater and sewage sludge samples were studied by season. Statistical analysis were performed using Statistica™ version 9. 0. ^ The principal findings for this research are the following: (1) The most dominant PBDEs in wastewater treatment plants are BDE- 47, BDE- 99, and BDE- 100 (2) PBDEs concentrations in waste water and sludge were not significantly affected by seasonal changes. (3) Treatment processes at the WWTPs in the US (El Paso, TX) are more efficient than the implemented procedures at Mexico (Cd. Juarez, Chih.) WWTP in the border region studied. (4) Possible sources of PBDEs in El Paso, TX include effluents from hospitals, paperboard <b>packaging</b> <b>producers,</b> electric and electronic appliances manufacturers, and laundries discharging in the different WWTPs. ^ Results from this study will provide valuable information on water resources to El Paso Water Utilities, research community, environmental agencies and policy makers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper and}} {{packaging}} {{industry is a}} major and important industry in Sweden. The industry is capital intensive with a large investment base and long cycles for renewal and replenishment of machine platforms and other production equipment. Thus, the paper/packaging industry traditionally has a technical product oriented view and product development in the industry is partly made and understood in isolation from customer and consumer knowledge. In the packaging industry, paper material is the dominant but has lately experienced increased competition from plastics. In this prevailing situation, it has been hard to identify competitive advantages of paper material and <b>packaging</b> <b>producers</b> and converters {{have not been able}} to meet the changed market and customer requirements. The paper industry therefore needs to provide packaging materials and packaging solutions that provide competitive advantage and meet the needs and expectations of customers and consumers. Based on this background, the basic postulate proposed for investigation in this research is the need to turn toward a customer perspective, with increased customer understanding, in the development of packages and paper packaging material. The purpose of this research is to better understand the different factors that affect the transformation of perspectives, from a product perspective to a customer perspective, in paper/packaging producing organizations, with regard to product and service development. The understanding of the transformation of perspectives is interesting both from an expected customer outcome and from the viewpoint of the producing organization. The research aim is to highlight the perspective transformation in the organization on a system level as well as on an individual level, since the impact of individuals cannot be excluded when the aim is to understand such transformation. It is identified from research in service management that customer orientation is central in service management and that service development emanates from customer needs. Therefore, learning from the service industry, for knowledge transfer and for implementation in the paper/packaging industry is part of this research. The entire research is based on different studies in the paper/packaging industry and in the service industry. All studies are based on real-life case situations with qualitative, subjective and interpretive analysis. The results from these different cases are presented in five separate papers that are appended to this thesis. The thesis takes up a summary of the papers and the entire research. Based on the postulate that packaging development need to adopt a customer perspective, the research suggest for the packaging industry to align services to the core products for competitive advantage and increased customer value. The postulated customer perspective further proposes the package producer to regard oneself as part of the customers? and consumers? system. Models for working with the postulated perspective change as well as models for integration of individuals to the organizational systems are provided as a framework and theoretical contribution. The integration of the individuals to the organizational system concludes that the relations between employees and customers are pivotal for an increased understanding of customer needs. The interaction between product development employees and customers can therefore be enhanced through the trust of individuals within a system to transcend organizational boundaries into the entire system. It is further concluded in the research, that the transformation of perspectives is dependent on individuals and their learning. A daily desire to learn within an organization and individual courage to question the status quo, is necessary for the change to happen. One practical contribution of this research is the methods developed for such individual learning and for changing individuals? mindsets from a product/feature perspective to a customer value perspective in product and service development. In order to build knowledge about the transformation of perspectives, this research suggests action research as the preferred methodology for studying change processes. The main reason is the possibility to integrate human aspects into the change process and to get deep access to reality when studying the change of perspectives at the producer...|$|E
