40|$|The {{context for}} this thesis is {{the concern that}} people who {{practice}} physical activity {{are more susceptible to}} air pollution. For the studies presented here, three perspectives of physical activity were considered: in indoor, i) physical activity in fitness centers; in outdoor ii) the use of bicycle in cycle paths; and iii) active transportation. Knowing the effects that air pollution has in the respiratory function, the increased V? (Minute Ventilation) that practitioners experience during exercise, lead to higher inhaled doses of air pollutants. The primary aim of this thesis is to provide information that is needed to deal with air pollutants and to come to better and healthier choices while practice physical activity in indoor and outdoor environments. It is clear that the sport facilities have to be correctly designed, with the aim of reduction of risk exposure and enhancing the benefits of exercise. Chapter 1 summarizes the context for air quality and physical activity, clarifies their relations, and addresses the most relevant topics interpreted in this thesis. Chapter 2 evaluates the exposure of sport practitioners to air pollutants and their inhaled doses. To achieve this goal, IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) parameters and V? were assessed in eleven fitness centers in Lisbon. After that, the IAQ in three fitness centers was monitored during one week to recognize temporal variations of pollutants and identify pollution sources. The novelty introduced in this chapter was the estimation of the inhaled doses for the typical indoor air pollutants during an aerobic and a holistic fitness class. Chapter 3 assesses the exposure and the dose to air pollutants while using cycle paths. For this, three different cycle paths in Lisbon were chosen and two complementary techniques were used: the instrumental sampling to evaluate particles (PM: particulate matter) and biomonitoring with lichens to obtain the elemental concentrations along the cycle paths. <b>Pollutant</b> <b>maps</b> were created for particles and for the elemental concentrations in order to visualize spatial distribution of pollutants. Chapter 4 focuses on the alternative mode of active transportation in cities. A typical route of Lisbon was selected to assess five air pollutants in five periods of the day, to observe the variation of those pollutants during the day. The exposure and the inhaled doses during the use of bicycle were compared with the use of motorized modes of transport (car, moto, bus and metro). The <b>pollutant</b> <b>maps</b> were performed for bicycle concentrations to identify the hotspots along the route. Chapter 5 provides an overall discussion and main outcomes of the thesis. 140 With the integrated approach given on this thesis, new information on IAQ constrains in fitness centers, and data on V? during fitness classes was presented. New information on what contributes to personal exposure during cycling and the contrasts between travel modes in relation to active transportation during commuting are brought in this work.

The pollutants may intrude into the indoor environment, causing health {{risks to the}} occupants. Prediction of pollutant exposure therefore is of great importance for impact assessment and policy making related to environmentally sustainable transport. This study involved the selection of spatial interpolation methods {{that can be used}} for prediction of indoor air quality based on outdoor <b>pollutant</b> <b>mapping</b> without indoor measurement data. The research was undertaken in the densely populated area of Karees, Bandung, Indonesia. The air pollutant NO 2 was monitored in this area as a preliminary study. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations were measured by passive diffusion tube. Outdoor NO 2 concentrations were measured at 94 locations, consisting of 30 roadside and 64 outdoor locations. Residential indoor NO 2 concentrations were measured at 64 locations. To obtain a spatially continuous air quality map, the spatial interpolation methods of inverse distance weighting (IDW) and Kriging were applied. Selection of interpolation method was done based on the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) and standard deviation (SD). The most appropriate interpolation method for outdoor NO 2 concentration mapping was Kriging with an SD value of 5. 45 µg/m 3 and an RMSE value of 5. 45 µg/m 3, while for indoor NO 2 concentration mapping the IDW was best fitted with an RMSE value of 5. 92 µg/m 3 and an SD value of 5. 92 µg/m 3...|$|R

Air pollution is an important source of oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, which interact with DNA and lipids, leading to oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation, respectively. Objective: We measured the levels of malondialdehyde–deoxyguanosine (dG) adducts, a biomarker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, in petrochemical workers, nearby residents, and subjects living in a control district without proximity to industrial sources. De s i g n: We conducted a cross-sectional study to compare the prevalence of malondialdehyde-dG adducts in groups of subjects experiencing various degrees of air pollution. Res u l t s: The multivariate regression analysis shows that the adduct levels were associated with occupational and environmental exposures to air pollution. The highest adduct level was observed in the steel factory workers. In addition, the formation of DNA damage tended to be associated with tobacco smoking, but without reaching statistical significance. A nonsignificant increase in DNA adducts was observed after 4 – 6 years of employment among the petrochemical complexes. Co n c l u s i o n s: Air pollution emitted from the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate complexes was associated with increased adduct levels in petrochemical workers and nearby residents.

40|$|Abstract Background Toxic {{substances}} {{released into}} the environment (to both air and water) by many types of industries might be related with the occurrence of some malignant tumours and other diseases. The publication of the EPER (European Pollutant Emission Register) Spanish data allows to investigate the presence of geographical mortality patterns related to industrial pollution. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe industrial air and water pollution in Spain in 2001, broken down by activity group and specific pollutant, and to plot maps depicting emissions of carcinogenic substances. Methods All information on industrial pollution discharge in 2001 was drawn from EPER-Spain public records provided by the European Commission server. We described the distribution of the number of industries and amounts discharged for each pollutant, as well as emission by pollutant group and the industrial activities associated with each <b>pollutant.</b> <b>Maps</b> of Spain were drawn up, with UTM coordinates being used to plot pollutant foci, and circles with an area proportional to the emission to depict pollution emission values. Results The EPER-Spain contained information on 1, 437 industrial installations. The industrial plants that discharge pollutant substances into air and water above the pollutant-specific EPER threshold were mainly situated in the Autonomous Regions of Aragon, Andalusia and Catalonia and in Catalonia, the Basque Country and Andalusia respectively. Pollution released in 2001 into air approached 158 million Mt. Emissions into water were over 8 million Mt. Conclusion A few single industrial plants are responsible for the highest percentage of emissions, thus rendering monitoring of their possible health impact on the surrounding population that much simpler. Among European countries Spain is the leading polluter in almost one third of all EPER-registered pollutant substances {{released into the}} air and ranks among the top three leading polluters in two-thirds of all such substances. Information obtained through publication of EPER data means that the possible consequences of reported pollutant foci on the health of neighbouring populations can now be studied. </p...|$|R

We analysed the exposure to lead (Pb) in griffon vulture Gyps fulvus—an apex species valuable as biomonitoring sentinel.

We made yearlong spatially explicit predictions of the species risk of lead exposure. Our results highlight elevated lead exposure of griffon vultures (i. e. 44. 9 % of the studied population, approximately 15 % of the European, showed lead blood levels more than 200 ng ml) partly owing to environmental lead (e. g. geological sources).

The approach is robust towards {{the uncertainty of}} the parametric models used to map groundwater pollution. In particular, probability kriging (PK) estimates the probability that the true value of a pollutant exceeds a set of threshold values using a binary response variable (probability indicator). Such soft description of the pollutant can mitigate the uncertainty in <b>pollutant</b> concentration <b>mapping.</b> PK was used for assessing nitrate migration hazard across the Campania Plain groundwater (Southern Italy) as exceeding typical critical values set to 25 and 50 mg. L- 1. Cross-validation indicated that the PK is more suitable than ordinary kriging (OK), which yields large uncertainty in absolute values prediction of nitrate concentration. This means that spatial variability is critical for contaminant transport because critical contaminants concentration could be exceeded due to preferential flows allowing the pollutant to migrate rapidly through the caveats aquifer. Accordingly with PK application, about 250 km 2 (40 % of the total 600 km 2 of the Campania Plain) were classified as very sensitive areas (western zone) to maximum permissible concentration of nitrates (> 50 mg.

40|$|Mediterranean Basin ecosystems, {{their unique}} biodiversity, {{and the key}} {{services}} they provide are currently at risk due to air pollution and climate change, yet {{only a limited number}} of isolated and geographically-restricted studies have addressed this topic, often with contrasting results. Particularities of air pollution in this region include high O 3 levels due to high air temperatures and solar radiation, the stability of air masses, and dominance of dry over wet nitrogen deposition. Moreover, the unique abiotic and biotic factors (e. g., climate, vegetation type, relevance of Saharan dust inputs) modulating the response of Mediterranean ecosystems at various spatiotemporal scales make it difficult to understand, and thus predict, the consequences of human activities that cause air pollution in the Mediterranean Basin. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement coordinated research and experimental platforms along with wider environmental monitoring networks in the region. In particular, a robust deposition monitoring network in conjunction with modelling estimates is crucial, possibly including a set of common biomonitors (ideally cryptogams, an important component of the Mediterranean vegetation), to help refine <b>pollutant</b> deposition <b>maps.</b> Additionally, increased attention must be paid to functional diversity measures in future air pollution and climate change studies to establish the necessary link between biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services in Mediterranean ecosystems. Through a coordinated effort, the Mediterranean scientific community can fill the above-mentioned gaps and reach a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying the combined effects of air pollution and climate change in the Mediterranean Basin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince Summer 2003, the PREV'AIR {{system has}} been {{delivering}} through the Internet daily air quality forecasts over Europe. This is the visible part of a wider collaborative project - the PREV'AIR project - launched by the French Ministry for Ecology and Sustainable Development (MEDD), aiming at: (1) Providing technical support on atmospheric pollution management in Europe, {{in the framework of}} negotiations on trans-boundary air pollution. (2) Providing large scale national air quality information based on numerical simulations and observations. The PREV'AIR system is a complementary monitoring tool with respect to the local information delivered by the French qualified associations in charge of regional air quality monitoring (AASQA). PREV'AIR relies on a chain of numerical tools: air quality simulation models, modules ensuring the provision of meteorological and air quality input data to these models, modules enabling the extraction and use of the numerical data computed by the system. The outputs of the PREV'AIR system (secondary <b>pollutants</b> forecasts and <b>maps)</b> are archived to build up a large scale air quality simulation data base over Europe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} an increasing interest in assessing health risks caused {{by exposure to}} the contaminants present in soils, air, food and water. In this field, Geographic Information System (GIS) {{may be used to}} produce maps of exposure and disease to reveal spatial patterns. The SIGFRIED project aims to spatialize an environmental indicator concerning human health using risk assessment methods and mapping environmental disparities. The approach is performed by a risk screening tool which employs an integrated multimedia exposure model able to manage all the steps of the analysis in a georeferenced framework operating in a GIS environment. In this study, we performed a risk assessment of metal exposure (cadmium, lead, selenium, arsenic, chromium, mercury and nickel) with a resolution of 1 km. The modeling was performed on a region of France (Nord-Pas de Calais) characterized by a heavy industrial past. The exposure pathways considered include ingestion of soil, vegetation, meat, egg, milk, fish and drinking water. Concentrations of metals on local food were calculated using a soil pollutants geodatabase and bioaccumulation food-chain models. We used water quality data and distance from river as a proxy for fish consumption exposure. Exposure scenarios were defined for different reference groups (age groups, anatomical and dietary properties, fraction of food produced locally). The results showed that the 2 to 7 age group is always the most vulnerable class of receptor. A spatial pattern analysis was performed to highlight hot-spot areas with significantly elevated risk values. In these areas, arsenic (up to 43 % among metals) and vegetables (up to 31 % among considered pathways) are the principal determinants of the calculated risk. In a next step, the same methodology will be use, adding inhalation pathway and organic <b>pollutants,</b> to <b>map</b> environmental inequalities and to analyse geographic cancer disparities in France...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop an advanced screening model that can be used quickly to identify areas of high pollution. The thesis describes {{the development of a new}} dispersion simulation that uses results from parametric studies of an existing advanced dispersion model. The output from the PARAmetrically Derived dispersion Simulation (PARADIS) is in the form of a receptor grid. This information may then be used in a Geographical Information System to produce <b>pollutant</b> contour <b>maps.</b> The main objective of PARADIS was to assist Environmental Health Officers in their duty, under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995, in identifying areas that are likely to exceed Statutory Objectives for Air Quality within their area. PARADIS allows both manual and automated input through ESRI ArcMapRTM. These options permit the user to input data for each individual 'road-link' or import the data from a validated traffic model. The automated option vastly reduces the input time often required for dispersion models. PARADIS was further developed to include 3 additional tools that pinpoint locations where exceedences of the Air Quality Objectives are likely to occur. PARADIS was validated through comparison with monitored data from both diffusion tubes and real-time units. The model was then used in several case- studies to examine the behaviour of traffic related pollutants in a variety of settings and future scenarios. These investigations were completed far more quickly than the methodology currently adopted by local authorities and other investigators. Finally, some ideas to further develop PARADIS are presented. These included the identification of specific sensitive receptor locations, automated validation and links to external programs for transport planning and public knowledge. The reduction of air pollution levels within the UK is a long-term Governmental Objective. The research undertaken in this thesis has demonstrated the need for a faster approach to determining air quality within a local area, such as that proposed by PARADIS...|$|R
