50|$|The {{choice of}} a {{mechanical}} release aid versus a finger tab must be accounted for in a compound bow's tuning and sighting, as well as {{choice of a}}rrow rest, as finger-released arrows will group in a different spot when using a mechanical release aid versus a finger tab. Likewise, the choice of arrow rest for a compound bow depends on whether a finger release archery tab or mechanical release aid is used. For a finger-released arrow, a <b>plunger</b> <b>pin</b> is most commonly used as the arrow rest, to impart a tuned impulse laterally to the arrow {{at the moment of}} release to improve point-of-impact groupings. In contrast, for a release aid configuration, a Whisker-biscuit arrow rest is very commonly used with a compound bow.|$|E
50|$|Like most 3rd {{generation}} Smith & Wesson {{semi automatic}} pistols, the 4506 features a combination safety lever and decocker {{mounted on the}} slide, a <b>plunger</b> type firing <b>pin</b> safety, a magazine disconnect and a pin mounted, pivoting spring actuated external extractor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Solenoid {{operated}} electromagnetic {{control valve}} (ECV) playing {{an important role}} for car’s air conditioning control system. ECV is used in external variable displacement swash plate type compressor and controls the entire air conditioning system {{by means of a}} pulse width modulation (PWM) input signal supplying from an external source (controller). Complete form of ECV contains number of internal features like valve body, core, valve guide, <b>plunger,</b> guide <b>pin,</b> <b>plunger</b> spring, bellows etc. While designing the ECV; dimensions of different internal items must meet the standard requirements as it is quite challenging. In this research paper, especially the dimensioning of ECV body and its three pressure ports through which the air/refrigerant passes are considered. Here internal leakage test analysis of ECV body is being carried out from its discharge port (Pd) to crankcase port (Pc) when the guide valve is placed inside it. The experiments have made both in ordinary and digital system using different assumptions and thereafter compare the results. Keywords—Electromagnetic control valve (ECV), Leakage...|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} four playable characters, each {{armed with}} unique weapons and special moves. Zack is the nerd character and his special weapons are ax-type weapons. Andy is a skater who wields random {{objects such as}} a toilet <b>plunger</b> and rolling <b>pin.</b> Carrie is a goth girl who favors swords. Jennifer is a stuck-up cheerleader who wields dual batons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inventor}} Charles Morrill {{introduced a}} saw set with a plunger {{based on his}} patent. [...] This design, as well as improvements added to it, came into prolific use and in the United States are frequently found with woodworking tools. An image of a Morrill design saw set is found at {{the introduction of the}} article. The <b>plunger</b> (also, <b>pin)</b> pushes against the saw tooth when the handles are squeezed together. The other face of the saw tooth rests against an anvil and the whole saw blade is held at the desired angle to the anvil by a stop or rest. On most designs both the anvil and the rest are adjustable.|$|R
50|$|The 70mm rocket, {{like the}} 20 cm model, used a mortar fuze. There {{would be no}} set back when the rocket was fired to arm an {{artillery}} fuze. The Japanese mortar fuse for the 81mm and 90mm used a shear wire to make it bore safe. The wire went through the brass body and aluminum firing <b>pin</b> <b>plunger.</b> Upon impact the plunger was forced back, shearing the wire and freeing the plunger to strike the firing pin and detonate the round.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} reasons for its failure. Foremost was the Reising's complex design of many small <b>pins,</b> <b>plungers,</b> springs and levers. Dis{{assembly}} and assembly was difficult even under normal conditions. Simple maintenance was problematic as there was no bolt hold-open device. Chambering a cartridge was awkward as the action bar was hard to grasp in the forearm and could be obstructed by the sling. Worse, the safety/selector switch couldn't be sensed by feel at night if {{it was in the}} safe, semi, or automatic position.|$|R
