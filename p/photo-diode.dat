As with the pen type reader, a <b>photo-diode</b> is used to measure the intensity of the light reflected back from the bar code. In both pen readers and laser scanners, the light emitted by the reader is rapidly varied in brightness with a data pattern and the <b>photo-diode</b> receive circuitry is designed to detect only signals with the same modulated pattern.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronics}} {{inside the}} pistol {{consist of a}} light detector or <b>photo-diode</b> and a small amplifier and buffer. Lightcoming down the barrel is focused by a small plastic lens onto the <b>photo-diode,</b> and the device is sensitiveenough to detect the changes in intensity of the picture. Once boosted by the amplifier, the signal is clipped toprovide a digital pulse rather than an analogue waveform and is then fed to the computer via the switch. Thescreen position that is being scanned at that moment is the position the rifle is pointing at. As the computerreceives the pulse from the Light Rifle it compares {{the value of its}} scan registers with the screen position of thetarget and, if a match is found, the played has scored a direct hit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a prototype smart imager capable of adjusting the photo-integration time of multiple regions of interest concurrently, automatically and asynchronously {{with a single}} exposure period. The operation is supported by two intertwined <b>photo-diodes</b> at pixel level and two digital registers at {{the periphery of the}} pixel matrix. These registers divide the focal-plane into independent regions within which automatic concurrent adjustment of the integration time takes place. At pixel level, one of the <b>photo-diodes</b> senses the pixel value itself whereas the other, in collaboration with its counterparts in a particular ROI, senses the mean illumination of that ROI. Additional circuitry interconnecting both <b>photo-diodes</b> enables the asynchronous adjustment of the integration time for each ROI according to this sensed illumination. The sensor can be reconfigured on-the-fly according to the requirements of a vision algorithm. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

50|$|In the AFAM {{setup the}} sample is coupled to a {{piezoelectric}} transducer. This emits longitudinal acoustic waves into the sample, causing out-of-plane vibrations in the sample's surface. The vibrations are transmitted into the cantilever via the sensor tip. The cantilever vibrations are measured by a 4-section <b>photo-diode</b> and evaluated by a lock-in amplifier. This setup can be used either to acquire cantilever vibration spectra or to take acoustic images. The latter are maps of cantilever amplitudes on a fixed excitation frequency near the resonance. A contact-mode topography image is acquired simultaneously with the acoustic one.|$|E

The command data is a Manchester coded bitstream modulating a 36 kHz carrier. (Often the carrier used is 38 kHz or 40 kHz, apparently due to misinformation {{about the actual}} protocol.) The IR signal from the transmitter is detected by a specialized IC with an integral <b>photo-diode,</b> and is amplified, filtered, and demodulated so that the receiving device can act upon the received command.

These two components interfere in the detector and produce signals, which permit the detection of the bead's position in three dimensions. The precision is very good (as low as 0.1 nm) and the recording speed is very high (up to 1 MHz). Brownian motion deflects the bead from the resting position. A time sequence of measured positions allows one to derive the optical potential in which the particle is held.|$|E
50|$|An SSR {{based on}} a single MOSFET, or {{multiple}} MOSFETs in a paralleled array, can work well for DC loads. MOSFETs have an inherent substrate diode that conducts in the reverse direction, so a single MOSFET cannot block current in both directions. For AC (bi-directional) operation two MOSFETs are arranged back-to-back with their source pins tied together. Their drain pins are connected {{to either side of}} the output. The substrate diodes are alternately reverse biased to block current when the relay is off. When the relay is on, the common source is always riding on the instantaneous signal level and both gates are biased positive relative to the source by the <b>photo-diode.</b>|$|E

30|$|In silicon based {{solid-state}} sensor image acquisition, when a <b>photo-diode</b> receives too much radiant energy, {{the maximum number}} of electrons per pixel is reached [20]. This refers to saturation, and extra information is lost. In addition, the overloaded photo-site distributes charges into adjacent pixels, generating blooming (especially for CCD technology) [21, 22]. On the other hand, if a <b>photo-diode</b> does not receive sufficient photons, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the electrical signal generated is too low compared to the global noise level [23]. Thus, when integration time is fixed, the sensor performance is optimal only within a given range of intensities according to its sensitivity.
