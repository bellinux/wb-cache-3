A portion of this analysis draws on data from the empirical studies reviewed to the extent possible with appraisal data as well as transaction data based on properties sold by the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) members used for studies which do not report their data. Evidence is presented which links superior real estate investment performance to <b>positive</b> excess <b>skewness</b> in the return distribution. The study also shows that there is a greater likelihood that the return distributions having <b>positive</b> excess <b>skewness</b> are associated with returns computed on the basis of appraised values as opposed to transaction prices.

50|$|This {{parameter}} {{relates the}} location of the spectrum peak in respect to the mean spectrum value. Therefore, a <b>positive</b> <b>skewness</b> value indicates that the peak is located to the left with respect to the mean. A negative skewed spectrum has its peak on the right side with respect to the spectrum mean. A value around zero indicates a symmetric spectrum. In this way, the shape of a Doppler gives information on changes of cloud microphysics or of dynamical changes within the measured volume. The higher the elevation of the radar is, the higher are the dynamical influences on this parameter. Because wind shears lead to a broadening of the Doppler spectrum width, they can lead to rapid changes in skewness as well. To be able to relate the change in skewness of the Doppler spectrum, the Doppler width should be cross-checked as well.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLocated at {{the center}} of the western North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) is not only {{abundant}} in mesoscale eddies, but also exhibits prominent submesoscale eddy features. Output from a ° high-resolution OGCM simulation and a gridded satellite altimetry product are analyzed to contrast the seasonal STCC variability in the mesoscale versus submesoscale ranges. Resolving the eddy scales of > 150 km, the altimetry product reveals that the STCC eddy kinetic energy and rms vorticity have a seasonal maximum in May and April, respectively, a weak <b>positive</b> vorticity <b>skewness</b> without seasonal dependence, and an inverse (forward) kinetic energy cascade for wavelengths larger (shorter) than 250 km. In contrast, the submesoscale-resolving OGCM simulation detects that the STCC eddy kinetic energy and rms vorticity both appear in March, a large <b>positive</b> vorticity <b>skewness</b> with strong seasonality, and an intense inverse kinetic energy cascade whose short-wave cutoff migrates seasonally between the 35 - and 100 -km wavelengths. Using a 2. 5 -layer, reduced-gravity model with an embedded surface density gradient, the authors show that these differences are due to the seasonal evolution of two concurring baroclinic instabilities. Extracting its energy from the surface density gradient, the frontal instability has a growth time scale of O(7) days, a dominant wavelength of O(50) km, and is responsible for the surface-intensified submesoscale eddy signals. The interior baroclinic instability, on the other hand, extracts energy from the vertically sheared STCC system. It has a slow growth time scale of O(40) days, a dominant wavelength of O(250) km, and, together with the kinetic energy cascaded upscale from the submesoscales, determines the mesoscale eddy modulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{central issue}} {{of this study is}} the cost of {{skewness}} to investors who value <b>positive</b> <b>skewness</b> in their portfolio return distributions. Three-moment capital market theory is based on the proposition that investors who prefer <b>positive</b> <b>skewness</b> will trade some of their expected return to obtain the desired distribution asymmetry. The portfolio strategy of hedging with options enables investors to change the shape of the return probability distribution to create or increase <b>positive</b> <b>skewness.</b> The return-skewness tradeoff can be examined by grouping hedged and unhedged portfolio returns into risk classes. The difference in return between properly hedged and unhedged portfolios of the same risk is an estimate of the cost of skewness. ...|$|E

However, <b>positive</b> idiosyncratic <b>skewness</b> does increase following the imposition of short-sale constraints and decline following the relaxation of those constraints. Changes in idiosyncratic skewness are predicted by cumulative abnormal returns surrounding the effective date {{of the change in}} the short-sale regime. This evidence is more consistent with the hypothesis that shortsale constraints reduce capital costs than with the hypothesis that short-sale constraints lead to overvalued equities. These findings suggest either that traditional theories of short-sale constraints ignore or underweight important costs induced by short selling or that proxies for the information impact of short sales are not generall...|$|R

40|$|The objetive of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the relation between the rigidity and strength properties in static bending and specifie gravity of plywood manufactured from five veneer of Pinus elliotti Engelm, plantation from a 30 year-old. Linear simples, multiple and polynomial relations involving the modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), strees at proportional limit (TLP) and specifie gravity (Me) of the plywood were studied. The specifie gravity did not prove to be a very exact indicator of the rigidity and strength properties of the plywood. The MOE, MOR and TLP in static bending of the plywood showed low coefficients of correlations and determination adjusted for simple linear regression, indicating a little dependence of the specific gravity. The modulus of rupture in static bending on the principal directions (x and y) had a strong dependence of the modulus of elasticity and stress at proporcional limit. The coefficients of correlations of the best models of regression in the two directions varied from 0, 85 to 0, 91.

A sample of 65 teachers was used. Although {{the results of the study}} showed no correlations between Work-Family Conflict and both role salience and job level, this was attributed to the high data skewness, thereby reducing the chances of detecting correlations. The high <b>positive</b> data <b>skewness</b> was possibly caused by the floor effect, which was the situation that the sample consisted of only female teachers from a Collectivistic culture. The high negative data skewness was possibly caused by the ceiling effect, which is the situation that the women in this sample have a Collectivistic cultural orientation, and are therefore highly likely to consider their home role as more salient. Moreover, correlations between Work Family Conflict and Job demand have been found to be higher in Individualistic cultures compared to Collectivistic cultures. There also seems to be no differences in job control among teachers occupying different job levels, and hence, no correlations were detected. Further analyses depicted that the teachers within this sample considered their home role as more salient. Moreover, despite their commitment to both their home role and occupational role, the data indicated that the sample experienced low levels of Work Family conflict. South Afric...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are twofold. First, to {{investigate}} the accuracy of different option-implied trees in pricing European options {{in order to assess}} the power of implied trees in replicating the market information. Second, to compare deterministic volatility implied trees and stochastic implied volatility models (Bakshi et al. (2003)) in assessing the forecasting power of implied moments on subsequently realised moments, and ascertaining the existence, magnitude and sign of variance, skewness, and kurtosis risk-premia. The analysis is carried out using the Italian daily market data covering the period 2005 - 2014. This enables us to contrast the pricing performance of implied trees and to assess the magnitude and sign of risk premia in both a tranquil and a turmoil period. The findings are as follows. First, the pricing performance of the Enhanced Derman and Kani (EDK, Moriggia et al. 2009) model is superior to that of the Rubinstein (1994) model. This superiority is stronger especially in the high volatility period due to a better estimation of the left tail of the distribution describing bad market conditions. Second, the Bakshi et al. (2003) formula is the most accurate for forecasting skewness and kurtosis, while for variance it yields upwardly biased forecasts. All models agree on the signs of the risk premia: negative for variance and kurtosis, and <b>positive</b> for <b>skewness,</b> but differ in magnitude. Overall, the results suggest that selling (buying) variance and kurtosis (skewness) is profitable in both high and low volatility periods...|$|R
40|$|Supplemental {{information}} related to this paper {{is available at the}} Journals Online website: [URL] audienceRecent studies have pointed out an increased warming over the IndianOcean warmpool (the central-eastern Indian Ocean characterized by sea surface temperatures greater than 28. 08 C) during the past half-century, although the reasons behind this monotonous warming are still debated. The results here reveal a larger picture—namely, that the western tropical Indian Ocean has been warming for more than a century, at a rate faster than any other region of the tropical oceans, and {{turns out to be the}} largest contributor to the overall trend in the global mean sea surface temperature (SST). During 1901 – 2012, while the Indian Ocean warm pool went through an increase of 0. 78 C, the western Indian Ocean experienced anomalous warming of 1. 28 C in summer SSTs. The warming of the generally cool western Indian Ocean against the rest of the tropical warmpool region alters the zonal SST gradients, and has the potential to change the Asian monsoon circulation and rainfall, as well as alter the marine food webs in this biologically productive region. The current study using observations and global coupled ocean–atmosphere model simulations gives compelling evidence that, besides direct contribution from greenhouse warming, the long-term warming trend over the western Indian Ocean during summer is highly dependent on the asymmetry in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection, and the <b>positive</b> SST <b>skewness</b> associated with ENSO during recent decades...|$|R
