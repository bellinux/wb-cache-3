Around 15,000 Belgians served in two separate divisions of the Waffen-SS, divided along linguistic lines.

In 2004, international conservation organizations launched successful environmental propaganda campaigns in China against the Tibetan tiger skin trade. There was outrage in India, where many Tibetans live, and the 14th Dalai Lama was <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> take up the issue. Since then {{there has been a}} change of attitude, with some Tibetans publicly burning their chubas.|$|E

Worse for Cowdrey, he suffered a minor injury in a county match and was <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> step aside for the Fifth Test. He never played for England again.|$|E

The {{majority of the}} troops returned to Russia {{by the end of}} March 1918. In total 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian warmen supported the Finnish Reds, but around 4,000, in separate smaller units of 100–1,000 soldiers, could be <b>persuaded</b> <b>to</b> fight in the front line.|$|E

Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo.

Upon learning that Christian was beaten into telling Ken Shamrock the whereabouts of Stephanie McMahon, The Undertaker punished Christian by flogging him. More loyal to The Brood than to The Ministry, Edge and Gangrel betrayed The Undertaker and rescued Christian from sacrifice later on.|$|E

The troublesome south-eastern border with the Ottoman Empire was temporarily quelled by truces signed in July 1577 and April 1579.
