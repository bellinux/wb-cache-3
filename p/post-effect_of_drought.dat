40|$|The {{development}} and implementation <b>of</b> a <b>drought</b> policy is intended to alter a nation’s approach to drought management. A national drought policy should establish a clear set of principles or operating guidelines to govern the management <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> and its impacts. The policy should be consistent and equitable for all regions, population groups, and economic sectors and consistent {{with the goals of}} sustainable development. The overriding principle <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> policy should be an emphasis on risk management through the application of preparedness and mitigation measures. The policy must reflect regional differences in drought characteristics, vulnerability, and impacts. The goal of the policy is to reduce risk by developing better awareness and understanding <b>of</b> the <b>drought</b> hazard and the underlying causes of societal vulnerability. Climate change and projected changes in climate variability will likely increase the frequency and severity <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> and other extreme climatic events.

The persistence <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> impacts has received limited attention in the economics literature. The objectives of this study are two-fold: 1) to determine whether inter-year dynamics, in the form of agronomic constraints and financial flows, can cause persistence <b>of</b> a <b>drought's</b> impact in years subsequent to the drought, and 2) to determine whether the impact of one year <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> can alter the impact of a subsequent year <b>of</b> <b>drought.</b> A multi-year, dynamic and stochastic decision model is developed in a discrete stochastic programming framework and solved to address the objectives. The structure and parameters of the farm-level model are based on irrigated row crop farms in eastern Oregon, USA.

The drought events were characterized {{by means of the}} Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) applied to precipitation data at a temporal scale of 12 months. At the national scale, the results reveal a statistically significant decrease in the severity <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> over the 54 -year period, a pattern that is mostly attributed to a statistically significant decrease in the frequency <b>of</b> high intensity <b>drought</b> episodes (i. e., extreme and very extreme droughts), compared to moderate droughts. To assess the general patterns <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> evolution, a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the SPI series. PCA results indicate a high spatial heterogeneity in the SPI variations over the investigated period, with ten different spatially well-defined regions identified. These PCA components accounted for 72. 9 % of the total variance <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> in the region.

40|$|Drought {{characterization}} and forecasting {{are extremely}} {{important in the}} planning and {{management of water resources}} systems. In a transboundary region, especially, sustainable water use and water rights are major issues among communities and countries during droughts. For instance, the <b>drought</b> <b>of</b> the 1990 s in the Conchos River Basin in Mexico resulted in the severe reduction of its inflows into the Bravo/Grande River. Droughts in the Conchos River Basin affect many communities in the Lower Bravo/Grande River Basin, and become a controversial issue between the United States and Mexico. This research focuses on the application of nonparametric methods to characterize and forecast droughts using a drought index like the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Nonparametric methods allow more flexible approaches to hydrologic problems in practice by approximating a function of interest. Based on a nonparametric probability density function estimator, comprehensive approaches for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> characteristics at a site and over a region are proposed in this study. Using a kernel density estimator, a nonparametric methodology is proposed for the synthetic generation of hydrologic time series. Based on the synthetic data, a nonparametric approach is introduced for estimating the bivariate characteristics <b>of</b> <b>drought.</b> A kernel density estimator is useful in the estimation of the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function in two dimensions <b>of</b> <b>drought</b> properties. A methodology for the regional characterization <b>of</b> <b>droughts</b> is developed using the point drought properties.
