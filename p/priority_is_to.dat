5|$|Before his death, Dr. Butterfly drains {{the energy}} of the {{students}} at Kazuki's school to heal and revive Victor, a being superior to humans and homunculi. Victor is confronted by Kazuki, but Victor is not interested in fighting and leaves. During the battle, however, Kazuki's kakugane is revealed to be the same type as the Victor's—a black kakugane created by the Alchemist Army as a prototype to the philosopher's stone. The black kakugane absorbs human life forces; to prevent this from happening, Kazuki's death is ordered by the Alchemist Army. Captain Bravo tries to kill Kazuki, but Tokiko finds him alive. A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki's death, but Kazuki, Tokiko and Gouta Nakamura (an Alchemist Warrior and former protégé of Tokiko's) fight their way past the members of the Re-Extermination Squad. Later, Kazuki's death is postponed because, as the Alchemists' leader explains, their top <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> defeat Victor.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{wanted to}} make a game that was cinematic, yet {{distinguished}} from actual films. Takumi Kawagoe, who creates cutscenes for Nintendo, says that his top <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have the player feel in control of the action. To promote this instantaneous continuity of cinematic gameplay, the cutscenes in Ocarina of Time are completely generated with real-time computing on the Nintendo 64 console and do not use prerendered full-motion video. Miyamoto's vision required this real-time architecture for the total of more than 90 minutes of cutscenes, regardless of whether the console had a vast medium like CD-ROM on which to store prerendered versions. Toru Osawa created the scenario for the game, based on a story idea by Miyamoto and Yoshiaki Koizumi. He was given support by A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening script writer Kensuke Tanabe. Miyamoto said the real-time rendering engine allowed his small team of 3 to 7 cinematic developers to rapidly adjust the storyline and to focus on developing additional gameplay elements even up to the final few months of development, instead of waiting on a repeated prerendering process. The dungeons were designed by Eiji Aonuma.|$|E
25|$|Insurance {{bets are}} {{expected}} to lose money in the long run, because the dealer {{is likely to have}} blackjack less than one-third of the time. However the insurance outcome is strongly anti-correlated with that of the main wager, and if the player's <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reduce variation, they might choose to pay for this.|$|E
50|$|The king's <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} deepening {{the excellent}} relationship with India. The second <b>priority</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> diversify {{the relationship with}} other countries. He intended to strike close economic relationship with Bangladesh. Bhutan was the first nation after India to recognise the independence of Bangladesh.One key event his era <b>was</b> enabling Bhutan <b>to</b> join the United Nations in 1971, when it became its 125th member.|$|R

25|$|The {{military}} <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> breach the minefield {{quickly in}} order to create a safe path for troops or ships. Speed is vital, both for tactical reasons and because units attempting to breach the minefield may be under enemy fire. Both anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines must be removed, although only in the lanes through which troops or vehicles are planned to advance.|$|E
25|$|Critical habitat was {{designated}} for the subspecies in 1984, {{when it was}} first federally listed. Although its habitat is naturally fragmented, human disturbance does not help the situation. If the suitable habitat patches become too isolated, gene flow stops occurring, and the subspecies could be even more threatened. One conservation <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> maintain habitat between marsh patches in order to promote gene flow and preserve genetic diversity.|$|E
25|$|Uruguay is {{the only}} country in Latin America that has {{achieved}} quasi universal coverage of access to safe drinking water supply and adequate sanitation. Water service quality is considered good, with practically all localities in Uruguay receiving disinfected water on a continuous basis. 70% of wastewater collected by the national utility was treated. Given these achievements, the government's <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> improve the efficiency of services and to expand access to sewerage, where appropriate, in areas where on-site sanitation is used.|$|E

25|$|One {{research}} <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{determine the}} role and nature of malignant hyperthermia in FSS. Such knowledge would benefit possible surgical candidates and the anaesthesiology and surgical teams who would care for them. MH may also be triggered by stress in patients with muscular dystrophies. Much more research is warranted to evaluate this apparent relationship of idiopathic hyperpyrexia, MH, and stress. Further research is wanted to determine epidemiology of psychopathology in FSS and refine therapy protocols.|$|E
25|$|A dual <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> promote innovative, {{effective}} and accessible health systems. The government wishes to develop, in parallel, applied sciences {{and technology and}} social and human sciences. To complement the national research policy, the government has prepared a National Strategy to Popularize Technologies, Inventions and Innovations (2012) and a National Innovation Strategy (2014). Other policies also incorporate science and technology, such as that on Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research (2010), the National Policy on Food and Nutrition Security (2014) and the National Programme for the Rural Sector (2011).|$|E
25|$|Together {{with the}} Doctor, Jamie {{encounters}} Cybermen, Daleks, the Yeti in the London Underground, the Ice Warriors, {{and many other}} dangers. Jamie is particularly fond and protective of Victoria, {{due in part to}} her being an elegant Victorian lady. For example, in The Ice Warriors Jamie's first <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> rescue Victoria despite being injured {{to the point where he}} can't walk. Jamie is heartbroken when Victoria decides to stay with the Harris family at the end of Fury from the Deep, to the point of even being briefly angry with the Doctor for allowing her to leave (The Wheel in Space). Jamie initially finds Zoe's more modern attitudes and bossy nature irritating, but eventually adopts the same protective attitude disguised by the same bantering he engages in with the Doctor. Often Jamie's simple common sense beats Zoe's strict logic, such as in The Dominators where Jamie realises that the erupting volcano is going to threaten the TARDIS, while the Doctor and Zoe are still congratulating themselves on defeating their enemies.|$|E

25|$|Education is a {{critical}} input in human resource development and essential for the country's economic growth. It increases the productivity and efficiency of individuals, and it produces a skilled labor force {{that is capable of}} leading the economy towards sustainable growth and prosperity. The progress and wellbeing of a country largely depends on the education choices made available to its people. It {{can be one of the}} most powerful instruments of change. It can help a country to achieve its national goals via producing minds imbued with knowledge, skills, and competencies to shape its future destiny. The widespread recognition of this fact has created awareness on the need to focus upon literacy and elementary education, not simply as a matter of social justice but more to foster economic growth, social well-being, and social stability. Women's education is so inextricably linked with the other facets of human development that to make it a <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> also make change on a range of other fronts; from the health and status of women to early childhood care; from nutrition, water and sanitation to community empowerment; from the reduction of child labor and other forms of exploitation to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{acquisition}} of Sarawak first territory in the First Division, Brooke gained large quantity of antimony from mines around the area; although it was leased in 1846 as freedom of trade is guaranteed by a treaty of the territory with the local natives are freely to operate the mines. By {{the time of his}} arrival, a land tenure system known as the Native Customary Rights (NCR) have been practised by the indigenous communities. As Brooke's main <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> abolishing headhunting among the indigenous communities in the interior, the kingdom authorities conduct persistent raids to Sea Dayak villages and forcing them to practice horticultural modes as a new method to sustain their lives. This was done as most of the Sea Dayak at the time refused to abandon the culture and only agreed after been stopped through their major rebellion. Other Dayaks like the Land Dayak were also previously involved in headhunting, but most of them are peaceful people who abide by the laws and only attacking if attacked by other tribes; which subsequently became Brooke loyal followers as they agreed to leaving the former culture. Most Malays coastal villages were also raided as part of the kingdom's policy to combating piracy and slavery. These policy turned to be successful but the kingdom was plagued by high debt as a result from several major rebellions in response to the ongoing supression campaign especially with the stagnant economic situation at the time.|$|E
500|$|The ADF's current {{priorities}} are {{set out in}} the 2016 Defence White Paper, which identifies three main areas of focus. The first of these is to defend Australia from direct attack or coercion. The second <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the security of South East Asia and the South Pacific. The third <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> contribute to stability across the Indo-Pacific region and a [...] "rules-based global order which supports our interests". The white paper states that the government will place equal weight on the three priorities when developing the ADF's capabilities.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Harrah's Casino hired Pollack as its Vice President of Marketing. While he {{was officially}} {{responsible}} for Harrah’s sports ventures, which included boxing and motor sports, Pollack stated that, [...] "My top <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> grow {{the popularity of}} the World Series of Poker … It is already the No. 1 brand in poker, but we're going to make it even stronger through world-class media partnerships, strategic marketing alliances and superior customer service." [...] By most accounts, he succeeded doing just this. Pollack introduced a range of changes into the WSOP’s media relations, player relations, tournament structure and schedule, and expanded into international markets.|$|E
500|$|Clark's adoptive father. Snyder {{explained}} his {{reason for his}} casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: [...] "I think the thing you realize {{when you look at}} Diane and Kevin, in our decision to cast them so far, you sort of {{get a sense of how}} tonally we're looking at the movie, and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E
500|$|Faust and the {{production}} team have acknowledged some of the fandom and fan-created elements of the show and incorporated them into the animation. Though Hasbro's <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> deliver a child-friendly show, the writers and production staff, according to Linda Steiner, {{senior vice president of}} Hasbro Studios, [...] "We will certainly, for fun, do the 'bronie' check to see if this could pass with them, but our job is to deliver to the kids first." [...] Margaret Loesch, {{president and chief executive of}} Hub Network, said that they have kept their nods to the fandom to subtle hints. She added, [...] "We haven't driven this movement, the fans have, and we don't want to get ahead of that. We want to nourish this phenomenon, not manipulate it." [...] A writer for the show, Meghan McCarthy, said, [...] "Some pop culture-y things are thrown in, but we don't want to do anything that's too 'wink wink'. It detracts from the story that we're trying to tell". Many of the nods to the older audience are drawn in by the storyboard artists and animators, who are challenged to populate scripted scenes with background ponies; McCarthy points the example of ponies fashioned after the main characters from The Big Lebowski due to having to fill in space for scenes set in a bowling alley for the episode [...] "The Cutie Pox".|$|E
