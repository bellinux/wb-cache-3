5|$|After {{graduating from}} Leeds, Armstrong taught French in East Ham, Greater London for several years; she had {{success in this}} line of work, and was well {{on her way to}} {{becoming}} headmistress by the time she left this position in 1918. While she was Senior Assistant Mistress, she began studying <b>phonetics</b> in the evenings part-time at the University College <b>Phonetics</b> Department in order to improve her teaching of French pronunciation. In 1917, Armstrong received a Diploma with Distinction in French Phonetics; she got a Diploma with Distinction in English <b>phonetics</b> the following year.|$|E
5|$|Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet for speech {{pathology}} {{were created}} in 1990 and officially adopted by the International Clinical <b>Phonetics</b> and Linguistics Association in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} observe the {{movements}} of articulators has been of great importance {{to the study of}} <b>phonetics</b> {{in order to understand the}} way sounds are produced.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong first taught <b>phonetics</b> in 1917 in Daniel Jones's summer {{course for}} missionaries; even before then, Jones {{had planned to}} give Armstrong a {{full-time}} position at the University College <b>Phonetics</b> Department. Those plans were temporarily put on hold when London County Council decided against a budgetary increase for the department in October, but in November 1917, Jones nominated Armstrong to receive a temporary, part-time lectureship, which she started in February 1918. She {{was finally able to}} work full-time {{at the start of the}} 1918–1919 academic year, becoming the <b>Phonetics</b> Department's first full-time assistant. Armstrong became lecturer in 1920, senior lecturer in 1921, and reader in 1937. Her promotion to readership was announced in The Times and The Universities Review. Armstrong also occasionally taught at the School of Oriental Studies. When Jones had to take a leave of absence the first nine months of 1920, Armstrong became acting head of the department in his stead. During this time, she interviewed and admitted students into the department. Other positions she held at University College were Chairman of the Refectory Committee and Secretary of the Women Staff Common Room. Learned societies Armstrong belonged to included the International Phonetic Association, the Modern Language Association, and the International Congress of Phonetic Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta was {{employed}} as a linguistic informant for the <b>Phonetics</b> Department at University College London (UCL); his voice recordings of the Kikuyu language assisted Lilias Armstrong in her production of The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu. The book was posthumously published under Armstrong's name, although Kenyatta claimed {{that he should have}} been recognised as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a course in <b>phonetics</b> from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled {{by a grant from the}} International African Institute, he also took a social anthropology course under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white Europeans.|$|E
5|$|Lilias Eveline Armstrong (29 September 1882– 9 December 1937) was an English phonetician. She {{worked at}} University College London, where she {{attained}} {{the rank of}} reader. Armstrong is most known for her work on English intonation {{as well as the}} <b>phonetics</b> and tone of Somali and Kikuyu. Her book on English intonation, written with Ida C. Ward, was in print for fifty years. Armstrong also provided some of the first detailed descriptions of tone in Somali and Kikuyu.|$|E
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called <b>phonetics.</b> In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|Percy Shaw Jeffrey FRGS (14 March 1862 Cheltenham, England – 22 February 1952) was a {{respected}} English schoolmaster {{and author of}} several books on a range of topics, including significant contributions towards the teaching of <b>phonetics</b> in schools. Shaw Jeffrey taught at a variety of schools before spending sixteen years as headmaster at Colchester Royal Grammar School. With his wife, Alice, he retired first to South Africa, then to the town of Whitby, North Yorkshire, in 1916, where he spent his time between numerous trips to countries around the world.|$|E
5|$|After marriage, Boyanus had {{to return}} to the Soviet Union for eight years, while Armstrong had to stay in England. While away, Boyanus worked with Vladimir Müller to produce English–Russian and Russian–English dictionaries. Armstrong {{assisted}} with the phonetic transcription for the keywords in the English–Russian volume. She was able to visit Boyanus in Leningrad on two occasions, {{and he was able to}} briefly return to London in 1928. Boyanus was finally able to permanently move to England in January 1934, whereupon he became a lecturer in Russian and <b>Phonetics</b> at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London. While working at University College, Armstrong lived in Forest Gate and Church End, Finchley.|$|E
5|$|During his 16-year stay at CRGS, student numbers {{increased}} from 29 to 180 boys under his guidance, particularly through {{the introduction of}} day pupils. Shaw Jeffrey is also credited {{with the introduction of}} many changes at the school, including the introduction of purple blazers, the setting up of the Old Colcestrian Society for former boys (and quite often honoured former masters), a preparatory school, a cadet corps, an orchestra, a bugle band and a series of school entertainments and theatrical performances, and the acquisition of several buildings on behalf of the school. He was a national pioneer of the teaching of modern European languages through <b>phonetics,</b> employed language teachers from Germany and France, and set up arrangements for foreign study during holidays.|$|E
5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of <b>phonetics,</b> speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of <b>phonetics</b> and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|The dialect of the {{district}} of Palakkad in Kerala has {{a large number of}} Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax and also has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and <b>phonetics</b> are so different that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the Vaishnava paribasai, a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often possible to identify a person's caste by their speech. Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.|$|E

25|$|The grave/acute {{distinction}} {{has lost}} its relevance in modern <b>phonetics</b> (though it may still be relevant to other disciplines). It dates from relatively early {{in the days of}} acoustic <b>phonetics,</b> when some phonologists believed that one could categorize all speech sounds by means of a finite set of acoustically-defined distinctive features. These were supposed to correspond to auditory impressions of sounds. The pioneering publication for this was Jakobson, Fant and Halle (1951) Preliminaries to Speech Analysis (MIT). The feature(s) grave/acute were defined primarily in acoustic terms (with some reference to auditory qualities), but were given a secondary description (or gloss) in terms of their articulation. Features like grave/acute could be used to divide speech sounds into broad classes. For most phoneticians, the JF features had been superseded by 1968 by the articulatory features set out in Chomsky and Halle’s Sound Pattern of English and by competing articulatory features devised by Ladefoged in such publications as Preliminaries to Linguistic <b>Phonetics</b> (1971).|$|E

25|$|In <b>phonetics,</b> ingressive {{sounds are}} sounds {{by which the}} {{airstream}} flows inward through the mouth or nose.
