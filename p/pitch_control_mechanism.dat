40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to design and {{analysis}} of passive <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> Design a mechanics to control different revolution of blade's pitch angle. The use of small wind turbines gradually popularization, but how to overcome the low wind speed start-up and the operation under high wind speed, that is the difficult problems encountered by designers. In order to extend the use and the safe of wind speed, this design is required. This paper is focus on the mechanism design of the passive <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> for the small {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} (HAWT). When the wind speed is fast, the rotation speed is also faster and faster. The system uses centrifugal force to make Pulley disk driven the pitch angle of the blade. It can achieve the effect of passive <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> The <b>mechanism</b> is our laboratory's patent. Through the experiments in wind tunnel, it can be observed the variation of the performance curve when the pitch rotation.

40|$|The {{functional}} wing morphology of {{the wings}} of the scorpion fly Panorpa germanica L. was investigated using a combination of light microscopy, high-speed cinematography, wing manipulation and mechanical testing. In rising forward flight the wings are flapped 40 ° out of phase along a shallow stroke plane, the forewings leading. Aerodynamic analysis suggests that unsteady effects are important in flight. During the downstroke, both wings are straight and cambered, the chord being parallel to the body axis, which is angled 45 ° upwards from horizontal. Both wings are supinated at lower stroke reversal, the hindwing to a much greater extent, and flex ventrally halfway along their length {{for the first half of}} the upstroke. Flexion is parallel to the chord in the hindwing, but is oblique in the forewing, so distal forewing areas are supinated relative to proximal areas. The behaviour of the wings is related to their structure. Spars at the leading and trailing edges of both wings support the wing during the downstroke, and flexion during the upstroke is facilitated by buckling of the weak ventral thyridium region. The oblique flexion seen in the forewing is due to its relatively longer leading edge spar. The differences between the wings are, in turn, related to their <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The forewing has a well-developed clavus, like that of the forewing of a locust, and pitch is altered by relative movement of this and the leading edge, but only within a narrow range. Oblique flexion is necessary to invert the aerofoil. The weaker and less well-developed clavus of the hindwing, more similar to that of the Diptera, allows a greater degree of supination, effected largely by wing inertia. No oblique flexion is necessary...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims to have {{an impact}} towards a sustainable energy supply. In wind power generation losses occur at tip speed ratios which the rotor was not designed for. Since the ideal blade shape changes nonlinearly with rising wind speeds currently used <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can only approach the ideal blade deformation. However aeroelastic effects, which cause additional deformation, are almost unavoidable in flexible blade design and it is desirable to tailor these effects to our advantage by a controlled use of orthotropic material properties and a smart design of the blade structure. The idea of systematic aeroelastic tailoring is not new but research has not yet solved the design challenge partly {{due to the lack of}} accurate simulation tools. Passively adaptive rotor blades would enable systematic aeroelastic tailoring and have the potential to reduce the cost of energy by around 6 % [1]. Within this thesis a design procedure for passively adaptive rotor blades has been developed. It consists of an aerodynamic simulation and optimization code (based on Blade Element Momentum Theory), a structural simulation (based on Finite Element Analysis) and a fluid structure interaction correction loop (based on CFD and FEM). Using the developed design code passively adaptive rotor blades have been designed for the NREL phase VI test turbine. The results show that an ideal passively adaptive blade could improve the efficiency of the test turbine by 3 % to 6 %. (cont.) The proposed rotor designs can only approach these improvements. However they do improve the efficiency and since the design only requires a precisely calculated stacking of composite material layers, the cost for manufacturing will not increase significantly. This work is a contribution to solve the design challenge of passively adaptive rotor blades and further research may be based on it. by Christian Deilmann. Thesis (S. M.)

2500|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} arctic seas placed high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the propulsion machinery, especially for single-screw ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the robust propulsion system had several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ship's operational capability. Propulsion power was provided by two 14-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14ZV40/48 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, each with a maximum continuous output of [...] at 560 rpm. As a precaution against failure of the propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> the main engines were directly reversible. The main engines were connected to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear equipped with separate multi disc clutches and Voith fluid couplings. The hydrodynamic couplings that allowed over 100% slipping between {{input and output shafts}} were used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The fully locking mechanical clutches were used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship was operating in open water or light ice conditions. Because the power output per shaft of the SA-15 class freighters was at that time one of the highest among icebreaking ships, second only to the Arktika class nuclear icebreakers, the propeller of the ship was of extremely robust design. The four-bladed stainless steel controllable-pitch propeller was developed and manufactured by KaMeWa specially for the SA-15 project.|$|E

In fact, too high pressures can {{be responsible for the}} mechanism failure, then they should be always under examination by the ship automation. With regard to the traditional representation of the few spindle torque data reported in literature, in the proposed mathematical model the transportation inertial forces and the Coriolis inertial forces acting on the propeller blade are evaluated taking into account the yaw motion of the ship, the propeller speed (including shaft accelerations and decelerations) and the blade turning during the pitch change. On the basis of the introduced procedure, it is developed the CPP model which is part of an overall propulsion simulator, representing the dynamic behaviour of a twin-screw fast vessel. The aim of the work is to represent the ship propulsion dynamics by time domain simulation, on the ground of which the automation designers can develop and test several propulsion control options.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. A {{wind turbine}} {{needs to be}} {{controlled}} to ensure its safe and optimal operation, especially during high wind speeds. The most common control objectives are to limit the power and rotational speed of the wind turbine by using <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> Aero Energy is a company based in Potchefstroom, South Africa, that has been developing and manufacturing wind turbine blades since 2000. Their most popular product is the AE 1 kW blades. The blades {{have a tendency to}} over-speed in high wind speeds and the cut-in wind speed must be improved. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system for wind turbines. A prototype active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system had to be developed for the AE 1 kW blades. The objectives of the control system are to protect the wind turbine from over-speeding and to improve start-up performance. An accurate model was firstly developed to predict a wind turbine’s performance with active <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> The active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> was implemented by means of a two-stage centrifugal governor. The governor uses negative or stalling <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> The first linear stage uses a soft spring to provide improved start-up performance. The second non-linear stage uses a hard spring to provide over-speed protection. The governor was manufactured and then tested with the AE 1 kW blades. The governor achieved both the control objectives of over-speed protection and improved start-up performance. The models were validated by the results. It was established that the two-stage centrifugal governor concept can be implemented on any wind turbine, provided the blades and tower are strong enough to handle the thrust forces associated with negative <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> It was recommended that an active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system be developed that uses positive pitching for the over-speed protection, which will eliminate the large thrust forces.
