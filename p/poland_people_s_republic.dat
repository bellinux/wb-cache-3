40|$|China {{is joining}} {{the group of}} {{countries}} that have reasonably comprehensive systems of social protection in place. In 2010, the National <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Congress adopted the first national Social Insurance Law, representing {{the culmination of a}} process of radical social reform. The question this paper asks is: what kind of welfare regime is being built in the <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China? China has been politically unique. It is one of only five remaining communist states, the others being Cuba, Laos, the Democratic <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of Korea and Vietnam, and the only one (with some qualification for Vietnam) that has been economically successful. The characteristics of a communist state include centralized {{power in the hands of}} a party 9 lite and that this 9 lite is presumably motivated, to varying degrees, by some kind of socialist ideology of statism and social justice. While maintaining its political uniqueness, China has shed its economic uniqueness. With the reform and opening up that started in 1978, it turned its back on planned economy isolationism and has adopted an open socialist market economy. In considering what kind of welfare state is emerging in China, the paper looks at two hypotheses: is China producing a welfare state of its own kind, possibly a "socialist" welfare state? Or, if it is reproducing a conventional welfare state, what kind of previous experience elsewhere is it replicating...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} intracultural negotiation within three different cultures—the United States (US), the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China (PRC), and Japan. Within these cultures, {{we focus on}} the interactive effects of the self-concerns (operationalized as aspiration level) and other-concerns (operationalized as egoistic vs. prosocial motives) of negotiators in a dyadic setting (De Dreu, Weingart, 2 ̆ 6 Kwon, 2000; Pruitt 2 ̆ 6 Rubin, 1986). After allowing negotiators to set their own aspiration levels, we predicted that the positive effect on final individual profit of having a higher aspiration than one s opponent would be stronger among negotiators with an egoistic social motive orientation. We also hypothesized that egoistic negotiators with higher aspiration levels than their opponents would achieve greater profit in the PRCand Japan, relative to their counterparts in the US. We argue that this effect is due to ‘‘who you meet’’ as a negotiation opponent—there is a higher probability of encountering an egoistic negotiation opponent in the US, but a higher probability of encountering a prosocial negotiation opponent in the PRCand Japan. Our results supported these hypotheses. Implications for the literatures on negotiation and cross-cultural research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Technical change, {{technical}} efficiency, and multifactor productivity {{indices are}} reported for a multiple-output, multiple-input production technology using Chinese provincial {{data for the}} 1979 - 95 period. Results show significant variation in productivity change from year-to-year and province-to-province. Using panel methods, we regress the three production indices on several factors important in explaining productivity changes. Decollectivization in the early 1980 s accounts for a significant expansion of the frontier, while rural industrialization decreased agricultural productivity. Productivity is also sensitive to relative grain prices, to natural disasters such as flood and drought, and proximity of the provinces to coastal areas. 1. Chinese Agriculture under Economic Reform Almost two decades have passed since economic reform began to transform the Chinese countryside.

40|$|Chinese {{industrial}} sector energy-efficiency policy {{has gone through}} a number of distinct phases since the founding of the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> in 1949. An initial period of energy supply growth in the 1950 s, 1960 s, and 1970 s was followed by implementation of significant energy efficiency programs in the 1980 s. Many of these programs were dismantled in the 1990 s during the continuing move towards a market-based economy. In an effort to once again strengthen energy efficiency, the Chinese government passes the Energy Conservation Law in 1997 which provides broad guidance for the establishment of energy efficiency policies. Article 20 of the Energy Conservation Law requires substantial improvement in industrial energy efficiency in the key energy-consuming industrial facilities in China. This portion of the Law declares that "the State will enhance energy conservation management in key energy consuming entities. " In 1999, the {{industrial sector}} consumed nearly 30 EJ, or 76 percent of China's primary energy. Even though primary energy consumption has dropped dramatically in recent years, due mostly to a decline in coal consumption, the Chinese government is still actively developing an overall policy for energy efficiency in the industrial sector modeled after policies in a number of industrialized countries. This paper will describe recent Chinese government activities to develop industrial sector energy-efficiency targets as a "market-based" mechanism for improving the energy efficiency of key industrial facilities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to gain insight into the CCP s professed self-image by {{analyzing}} party speeches which have members as their primary audience. By utilizing Margaret Somers' concepts pertaining to narrative identity, I will show how the CCP party centre sets out to place the party, its members at large and itself into a historical and relational setting that attempts {{to make sense of}} the CCP s current position in China – and its envisioned role in the future. This paper will thus summarize the CCP party centre s view of history, along with its views of its own identity, that of its members, and how they fit into the network of relationships which constitute reality. My findings indicate that the envisioned role for the individual CCP member will be built up along these lines: As a leader and teacher of the Chinese people, they will take the lead in not only sharing but embodying the highest moral ideals as well as scientific knowledge. They will be enabled to do this by the instruction of their party elders, and the correct, scientific world-view enhanced by the most up-to-date developments of Chinese socialism. Armed with a proper framework in which to understand world events and their own role in them, they are encouraged to lose themselves in the project of leading and carrying out the great revival of the Chinese nation, enabling the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> to make headway in international competition...|$|R
40|$|Extract: Introduction: Within a statecraft-based approach, {{and with}} a {{concentration}} on great power statecraft, this chapter discusses relations between the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China (PRC or China) and the Republic of India (India). In an age broadly described as globalised (or globalising), the potential of operative relations between these states means, first, effective governance over {{a significant portion of}} humanity, and second, guidance and stabilisation of the globalising system through the prec¬ edent of their independent and combined great power statecraft. Inversely - and correspondingly - tribulations between China and India are inevitably global in their effect. Empirical data and predicted trends make plain the relative size and systemic impact of China and India. Approximately 36 per cent of the world 2 ̆ 7 s popula¬ tion is governed by these two great power states. 1 This relative population weight has significant implications for the global political economy (GPE). For example, nearly half of all increased demand for oil is predicted to be from China up to the year 2040, and demand from India will likely shadow that of China. 2 In addition, China and India — presently the second- and fourth-highest oil-consuming states — have a far lower per capita consumption than the leading consumer, the United States of America (US). 3 If oil is considered an example of the effect on all scarce and nonrenewable resources, when China and India reach per capita parity with the US, the supply and price implications will be immense...|$|R

His art evolved alongside the politics in China, and throughout the 20 th century he would draw history as it was unfolding. From the corruption and abuses of power in the Republic of China under the Guómíndǎng 国民党 (The Nationalist Party); the Japanese occupying the country; the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China under Máo Zédōng 毛泽东; and down to the opening and reformation after Máo s death – Liao was there to document it all with his pen and paint brush. In Reading Liao Bingxiong: Chinese Cartoonist of the 20 th century I present a selective study of the collected works of the cartoon artist, tracing his political cartoons and calligraphy through the 1900 s and early 2000 s. Liao was born poor and throughout his life took the side of the weakest in society; he was an artist of the people, and used his social mobility as an opportunity to comment on the condition of society, sometimes seemingly from a position outside any existing ideologies. In this thesis I argue that Liao Bingxiong s cartoons and calligraphy reflect not only the artist s own changing artistic, social and political sensibilities, but that they also can help one to understand the changing social structures in China in the 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|Conference Theme: Communication Research in the Public InterestWhen Britain and the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China {{negotiated}} Hong Kong s {{return to}} Chinese sovereignty, {{they agreed to}} a one country, two systems formula for governing life in the former British colony. The unusual deal gave autonomy to Hong Kong, allowing it to keep freedoms like the right of expression {{and the right of}} association, unfettered capitalism and a common law legal system. But the PRC insisted on a catch: at an unspecified future date, Hong Kong had to pass national security laws. In February 2003, the Hong Kong government released draft legislation for laws including sedition, treason, theft of state secrets and subversion. Journalists, in particular, feared the government s reaffirmation of draconian colonial laws under the shadow of mainland China, where more than 30 journalists remain in custody, mostly on charges of subversion and theft of state secrets. Journalists worried about how these crimes would be defined in Hong Kong. Would the legislation be able to establish a clear line between publishing comments of dissent and committing acts of sedition and subversion? Do journalists ''steal'' a state secret if they publish a leaked government document? Would there be a continued separation between Hong Kong and the PRC when two systems protect one country? These questions remain unanswered. After a massive rally on July 1 of 500, 000 Hong Kongers, including many journalists, the government rescinded the proposed legislation and postponed the process indefinitely. The government, however, vowed to complete its work. This paper examines the nature of the proposed legislation and the impact of the underlying issues on Hong Kong s famed freewheeling media...|$|R
40|$|Theme: AFTER CRITIQUE: What is Left of the Law & Society Paradigm?This {{year is the}} 60 th {{anniversary of}} the foundering of <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China. During past six decades, China s Communist Party has not only {{undertaken}} the task of nation building, but devising strategies of China s modernization. The social changes it brought are explosive vitality, as aggressive as it is vigorous. Chinese communist movement has been a sweeping popular movement, an elemental upsurge of the masses, and that the communist party rose to power by addressing itself to the immediate needs of China s peasant millions. It is our view that Communist success in China no less than Communist failure in other nations is often unplanned in advance. When witnessing the falling of almost all other communist countries in the world, the Chinese government {{has been able to}} implement its economical policy in large scale. What is the secret of its success? In spite of its seeming successes Marxism has in China undergone a slow but steady process of decomposition. Moreover, the current global crisis had brought the world s major market economies into a deep recession. But China s economy managed to have the sustained growth under huge pressure, by the estimated 8 % in 2009, and Chinese society remained confidence in the capacity of realizing its goal. More and more attentions are turning to China: Is the market economy invigorating the society? Or is it the Communism that dissolves the traditional barriers and lead to collective enthusiasm? Above all, why was China with Confucian traditions becoming a communist country?

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the Democratic <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of Korea (DPRK) {{is used as}} a case to explain the role {{credible}} deterrence plays in the 21 st century. The goal is to contribute {{to our understanding of the}} complex dynamics relating to nuclear weapons between the DPRK, the United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK). It also sheds light on factors that may increase or decrease North Korean deterrence credibility. The main objective is to understand DPRK s nuclear weapons program and explain North Korean deterrence credibility. This thesis does this by drawing upon literature and information provided by respondents through conducted elite interviews. The study uses the information provided to discuss to what extent DPRK s nuclear weapons deter the United States and the ROK. The analysis goes deeper into the relationship between the three states and their nuclear weapons. The aim is to describe the role of deterrence and explain its impact on the relationship between the DPRK, the United States and the ROK. It identifies North Korean nuclear abilities and its will to use nuclear weapons against another state, and it discusses to which degree the United States and the ROK feel threatened by North Korean nuclear weapons. The findings indicate that the United States and the ROK is partially disposed to DPRK s nuclear deterrence because the DPRK do not at this moment have a reliable capability to hit the continental United States with nuclear weapons, but the DPRK has the capability to hit targets in the ROK, and American vital interests outside of the United States. Even though the DPRK can hurt the United States and the ROK with nuclear weapons, it seems unlikely that the DPRK would use nuclear weapons against another state because it appears that the leadership is a rational actor and regime survival is of greatest importance. The thesis argues that the DPRK is unlike any other country, and this makes predicting what the DPRK will do in a given situation almost impossible...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{globalisation}} driving the <b>People.</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China to embrace its future, the local government has shown great enthusiasm promulgating {{one of the oldest}} industries. Foreign higher educational providers that operate in China through the mode of joint venture cooperatives between a Chinese and foreign institution of higher learning are becoming increasingly. knowledgeable-hungry. public or private universities and colleges. Such operations commonly known as Sino-foreign educational cooperatives (SFEC), are hotly spawned on the mainland, enrolling Chinese students through the division of responsibilities, roles and resources. The Chinese party is mostly responsible for the hardware support, supplying facilities and logistics as the part of the bargain, whereas the foreign party provides the intellectual software of academic programs. The locus of this qualitative study aims to present and investigate a distinct phenomenon of learning in SFEC through the theories of sociocultural perspective encumbered in a transitional context; Sino-foreign (SF) graduates to other workplace communities. Without common interests of social interaction, co-participation, and transformation, SFEC are often discredited due to various factors. The learning aims will feature participative and transformative themes that feature qualitative and interpretive methods. Thus, this research involves interviewing four relevant participants from the likes of two Chinese nationals and two non-Chinese, and how they view learning in SFEC applied to a transitional context, the workplace. My furtherance of analysis will generally stress learning, co-participation and transformative learning in activities that circumvents discriminatory elements of artifacts, identity profiling, relationships, commitment and workplace employment for the necessary transition. In the initial research phase, it did seem that putting learning into community practice in China was essential. In the closing stages, thoughts will flow to the legitimisation of participative and transformative learning, which forms the backdrop of this original theme of research gathered through previous works of similar purview. Prawatt and Floden (1994) remark that knowledge, and the belief that knowledge is the result of social interaction and language usage, and thus is a shared, rather than an individual, experience. Presumably, my chosen theories frame the interactive and shared communal nature of the Chinese society and learning systems. n...|$|R
40|$|The United States {{seeks to}} protect its {{security}} and foreign-policy interests, in part, by actively controlling the export of goods, technologies, and services that are or may be useful for military development in other nations. "Export" is defined not simply as the sending abroad of hardware but also as the communication of related technology and know-how to foreigners in the United States and overseas. The U. S. government mechanism for controlling dual-use items [...] items in commerce that have potential military use is the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the Department of Commerce; items defined in law as defense articles fall {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Department of State and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Because of the potential military implications of the export of defense articles, the ITAR regime imposes much greater burdens (on both the applicant and the government) than does the EAR regime during the process of applying for, and implementing the provisions of, licenses and technical-assistance agreements. Until the early 1990 s export control activity related to all space satellites (commercial and scientific) was handled under ITAR. Between 1992 and 1996 the George H. W. Bush and the Clinton administrations transferred jurisdiction over the licensing of civilian communications satellites to the Commerce Department under EAR. In 1999, however, in response to broad concerns about Chinese attempts to acquire U. S. high technology, the U. S. House of Representatives convened the Select Committee on U. S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China, also known as the Cox Committee. One of the many consequences of the Cox Committee's report was Congress's mandate that jurisdiction over export and licensing of satellites and related equipment and services, irrespective of military utility, be transferred from the Department of Commerce to the State Department and that such equipment and services be covered as defense articles under ITAR. Scientific satellites were explicitly included despite their use for decades in peaceful internationally conducted cooperative scientific research. It is widely recognized that the shift in regulatory regime from EAR to ITAR has had major deleterious effects on international scientific research activities that depend on satellites, spaceflight hardware, and other items that are now controlled by ITAR. Furthermore, contravening U. S. interests in attracting foreign students to U. S. universities, the capture of space technology by ITAR has caused serious problems in the teaching of university space science and engineering classes, virtually all of which include non-U. S. students. This report is a summary of a September 2007 workshop in which participants from the space research communities and the export-control administration and policy communities came together to discuss problems, effects, and potential solutions regarding the application of ITAR to space science. The principal themes and ideas that emerged from the discussions are summarized...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. This is a copyright-cleared {{version of}} the Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The main intentions of this thesis are to analyse and explain changes in the function and graphic components of Beijing s wayfinding systems and {{to explain how the}} systems construct multiple cultural and political identities at different historical periods and in changing local/global contexts. In the thesis, the oversimplified one-way theory of the global-local dichotomy, in which the global power of the West is overwhelming and constantly dominant, and the local system of non-Western countries is passive and fragile, is challenged. Instead, this thesis seeks to examine the interactivity and correlation of the local and the global from two perspectives: mobility and reversibility. Looking at mobility is to consider the local and global and their nexus as different interconnections and networks that are constantly and unevenly changing. Reversibility, with which this thesis is most concerned, deals primarily with the reversible relationship of the local and global, namely, that either the local or the global can be dominant. This point is well illustrated by the evolution of Beijing s graphic wayfinding systems function and appearance. Beijing, as the capital of China, has undergone a radical transformation from the fall of the last Empire Qing (1912) to the establishment of the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China (1949). The meaning of Beijing varies in accordance with the changes in its political and social structures. There have been five phases in Beijing s development: a well-planned imperial city; a capital city with a republican spirit; a totally industrialised but relatively isolated capital of a socialist country; an open and modernised Chinese-style socialist city; and a cosmopolitan city. In the course of this metamorphosis, what took place was a series of collisions, exchanges, fusions, and re-collisions between local power and global power. Along with the immense changes in Beijing, the role and appearance of the graphic wayfinding systems have also changed, especially those of road signs and doorplates, whose roles have been transformed from that of initial household register to orientation reference, to effective propaganda tool, and then on to the regeneration of a city. Finally, Beijing s graphic wayfinding design within its urban development has been reconfirmed as a useful instrument to support the new forms of visual narratives and consolidate the city brand of Beijing in the 21 st century. This study probes into the political and cultural significances behind the changes of the graphic wayfinding systems of Beijing, as well as the interaction between the local and the global as reflected in the formation of these findings. The mutable and reversible relationship between the local and the global is illustrated and clarified through analysis and comparison of various functions and visual elements between Beijing s present graphic wayfinding systems and its early wayfinding signs, as well as decoding the different mainstream political or cultural ideologies that have deeply affected the function and design of Beijing graphic wayfinding systems at different periods...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this study has been twofold, first to explore the {{potential}} for a security regime in the Asia Pacific region. Secondly to analyse the formation of the ASEAN Regional Forum as a possible candidate for becoming a multilateral construct that enables the Asian Pacific area to manage and control threats to regional security. Asia, although steeped in the same cold-war confrontation {{as the rest of the}} world, never saw the same tendency towards multilateralism and co-operative efforts after the end of the Second World War as in Europe. In this region a distinctly different pattern emerged with regards to both security and trade. A much stronger focus was put on bilateral agreements, and subsequently the region never developed a strong multilateral tradition. The end to the forty-year long conflict between the two superpowers radically changed the security environment in the Asia-Pacific. Although not locked into cold war as firmly as in Europe, the conflict dominated intra-regional politics for almost half a decade. The new environment opened up for contacts previously unthinkable, resulting, amongst other things, in Vietnam and Cambodia s entry into the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Soviet Union, now the Russian Federation, ceased to exist as a credible actor in the area, and new major powers stepped into the light. Foremost of these has been the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Republic</b> of China. After experiencing a long period of economic recovery and growth since Deng s coming to power in the 70 s, China now represents the new Great Power in the area, giving smaller neighbours concerns about its intentions in the future. In exploring the potential for the formation of a security regime in the Asia Pacific I have used Robert Jervis writing on conditions for forming a security regime as my point of departure. Based on these conditions I have formed hypotheses that specify expected findings in the region given that there is fertile ground for a regime. Based on these findings I move on to analyse the ASEAN Regional Forum in order to explore what role it plays, and can play in the region. I find that there is, according to Jervis conditions, still no solid basis on which to build a viable OSCE -like security regime in the Pacific. However, even though there is no basis for a highly institutionalised and legalistic structure in line with European traditions, there appears to be an understanding that development must be incremental. To appraise the ARF justly, one has to consider two vital elements: the region s historical context, and traditions related to state interaction. This is a region that has little or no experience with multilateralism. The formation of the ARF was in itself a quantum leap in this respect. The ARF is a construct that is adapted to the realities of the regional environment, taking into consideration the region s historical background, as well as being sensitive to the more cautious participants fears. The challenge for its further development will be to find a viable route that will satisfy the more active members in their demands for more concrete results on the one hand, and the more cautious on the other...|$|R
