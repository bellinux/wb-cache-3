5000|$|Auxotrophy (αὐξάνω [...] "to increase"; τροφή [...] "nourishment") is the {{inability}} of an organism to synthesize a particular organic compound required for its growth (as defined by IUPAC).

Auxotrophy {{is the opposite of}} <b>prototrophy,</b> which is characterized by the ability to synthesize all the compounds needed for growth.|$|E
50|$|Coprinopsis cinerea can be {{transformed}} with exogenous DNA by transformation when the fungus is a protoplast. It was found that disrupting (knockout or RNAi silencing) ku70 homologue can increase gene targeting via increased homologous recombination. Either protoplasts derived from oidia or vegetative mycelium can be used, however, gene targeting {{was found to be}} higher by 2% (based on phenotyping) when using vegetative mycelium. Otherwise, insertion of integrative vectors ectopically and with small homologous regions can be used, likely with low transformation efficiency. Earlier, REMI (restriction enzyme-mediated integration) could be used to insert exogenous DNA into the chromosome to produce mutant strains. This relies on inserting exogenous DNA and restriction enzymes into the protoplast cell, allowing for the enzymes to cut the chromosome at specific sites which match those sites used to produce linearized plasmid DNA with the gene of interest; subsequently, host enzymes ligate the cut sites and thus produce integrated heterologous, exogenous DNA. Although successful, undesirable mutations are likely. Chemical mutagenesis (also random) can also be done. Phenotype selection of the inability to fruit can indict that insertion led to disruption of vital genes. All in all, homologous recombination provides more specificity when creating a mutant strain. Depending on the mutant, auxotrophy markers (requires lost gene to be inserted) or <b>prototrophy</b> (when causing essential gene deletion) be used for selection.|$|E
50|$|Trichophyton verrucosum {{is thought}} to have evolved from a soil-dwelling {{ancestor}} that migrated to its contemporary cattle host, losing many features that it previously required for survival in soil habitats through genetic drift, such as vitamin <b>prototrophy,</b> urease activity, and the ability to perforate hair. Infection is characterized by 10-50 mm patches of hair loss, desquamation, and formation of thick crusts. Trichophyton verrucosum is endemic in cattle, and almost exclusively the fungus that is isolated from cattle with ringworm, with younger cattle being more prone to infection due to their skin having higher pH, and having weaker immune systems. Infection in cattle peaks in fall and winter due to the overcrowded, cramped facilities of cattle-housing facilities. Transmission can occur directly through contact between sick and healthy animals, and indirectly through fomites (T. verrucosum can be viable for up to 4 years). One study in Italy of 20 farms and 294 cattle found 100% of farms to contain infected cattle, with prevalence within farms ranging between 25-100%. In contrast, T. verrucosum has been eradicated from Eastern Germany due to immunization efforts. Rearing cattle together with ruminants, such as sheep, may increase prevalence of infection due to ruminants being able to roam free, spreading the infection. Trichophyton verrucosum is important economically, as it can spoil milk, meat, and leather quality of cattle.|$|E

Several modifications of Juni's original procedure were made to adapt it for use in a clinical diagnostic laboratory.

40|$|Two {{methionine}} biosynthetic {{genes in}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, metX and metW, were isolated, sequenced, and evaluated for {{their roles in}} methionine biosynthesis and bacterial fitness on leaf surfaces. The metXW locus was isolated on a 1. 8 -kb DNA fragment that was required for both methionine <b>prototrophy</b> and wild-type epiphytic fitness. Sequence analysis identified two consecutive open reading frames (ORFs), and in vitro transcription-translation experiments provided strong evidence that the ORFs encode proteins with the predicted molecular masses of 39 and 22. 5 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence of MetX (39 kDa) showed homology to several known and putative homoserine O-acetyltransferases. This enzyme is the first enzyme in the methionine biosynthetic pathway of fungi, gram-negative bacteria of the genus Leptospira, and several gram-positive bacterial genera. Both metX and metW were required for methionine biosynthesis, and transcription from both genes was not repressed by methionine. MetW (22. 5 kDa) did not show significant homology to any known protein, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic methionine biosynthetic enzymes. Several classes of methionine auxotrophs, including metX and metW mutants, exhibit reduced fitness on leaf surfaces, indicating a requirement for methionine <b>prototrophy</b> in wild-type epiphytic fitness.

Within either species the efficiencies of transformation for nutritional markers {{were found to}} be very similar to the values obtained for transformation to streptomycin resistance. The number of transformants in the interspecific N. perflava (donor) - - leads to N. gonorrhoeae (recipient) cross was 100 -fold lower than the number obtained in the intraspecific N. gonorrhoeae - - leads to N. gonorrhoeae cross for streptomycin resistance, as well as for several nutritional markers. In the reciprocal experiment the difference in the number of transformants in the interspecific N. gonorrhoeae - - leads to N. perflava cross and the number obtained in the intraspecific N. perflava - - leads to N. perflava cross varied from 600 to 1, 000 -fold for the streptomycin resistance marker. Of greater interest was the finding that N. perflava auxotrophs, although transformable to <b>prototrophy</b> with wild-type N. perflava DNA, were not transformed to nutritional independence by gnoncoccal DNA. These same mutants were transformable to streptomycin resistance using the heterologous gonococcal DNA. When the DNAs of N. meningitidis, N. flava, and N. lactamicus were used to transform N. gonorrhoeae to <b>prototrophy</b> or streptomycin resistance, the transformation frequencies obtained fell along a gradient that in general reflected taxonomic relationships. On the other hand, with N. perflava as the recipient for these same DNAs, only N. flava DNA could transform auxotrophs to <b>prototrophy,</b> although transformation to streptomycin resistance occurred in all cases.

When cells were plated on synthetic complete medium lacking only lysine, {{the numbers of}} Lys(+) revertant colonies accumulated in a time-dependent manner {{in the absence of}} any detectable increase in cell number. An examination of the distribution of the numbers of early appearing Lys(+) colonies from independent cultures suggests that the mutations to <b>prototrophy</b> occurred randomly during nonselective growth. In contrast, an examination of the distribution of late appearing Lys(+) colonies indicates that the underlying reversion events occurred after selective plating. No accumulation of Lys(+) revertants occurred when cells were starved for tryptophan, leucine or both lysine and tryptophan prior to plating selectively for Lys(+) revertants.

The beta-tubulin gene was cloned into a plasmid vector containing the pyr- 4 gene of Neurospora crassa, and transformants were selected either for uracil <b>prototrophy</b> or MBC resistance. Transformants selected for uracil <b>prototrophy</b> were of three phenotypic classes: sensitive, intermediate, and resistant to MBC. Transforming DNA appeared to integrate at several sites in the genome, with the more resistant phenotypes having more copies of the altered beta-tubulin gene than the sensitive and intermediate phenotypes. Transformants were also selected on medium containing MBC. The average frequency of transformation (1 to 3 transformants per micrograms of transforming DNA) was lower than that obtained by selection for uracil <b>prototrophy,</b> presumably because of failure to select transformants that contained few copies of the altered beta-tubulin gene. The sequence of the beta-tubulin gene was determined and compared with the published sequence of the benA gene of A. nidulans; the beta-tubulin gene {{was found to be}} highly conserved between the two Aspergillus species. Notable differences were that the beta-tubulin gene of A. flavus lacks intron 6 present in benA and has an additional leucine at position 148.

The rate of phenotypic reversion dut to freeze-drying in both E. coli RIMD 0509109 (uvr+ exr+) and RIMD 0509115 (uvr exr+) was almost the same, indicating that the phenomenon is independent of the uvr character.

This F' pro lac (P 22 dsupQ 394 newD) episome was transferred into S. typhimurium strains containing th leuD 798 -ara deletion; the resulting merodiploid strains had a Leu+ phenotype, indicating that supQ- newD+ is dominant over supQ+ newD+, and eliminating {{the possibility that the}} supQ gene codes for a repressor of the newD gene. Furthermore, transfer of the F' pro lac (P 22 dsupQ 39 newD) into E. coli leuD deletion strains restored leucine <b>prototrophy,</b> showing that the S. typhimurium newD gene can complment the E. coli leuC gene. Growth rates of the S. typhimurium-E coli hybrid strains indicated that the mutant isopropylmalate isomerase in these strains does not induce a leucine limitation, as it does in S. typhimurium leuD supQ mutants.

Here, two different methods were used to determine how rates of mutation to antibiotic resistance, auxotrophy, and <b>prototrophy</b> were influenced by carbon starvation on agar plates. The rate of mutation to rifampin resistance was increased by starvation as measured by fluctuation tests, similar to what has been reported previously for Escherichia coli. In contrast, the rates of mutation to various types of auxotrophy were unaffected or decreased as measured by both fluctuation tests and a repeated-streaking procedure. Similarly, the rates of reversion to <b>prototrophy</b> of his and lac nonsense and missense mutations were unaffected by starvation. Thus, mutation rates of different genetic targets can be affected differently by starvation and we conclude that carbon starvation is not generally mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium. Mutation rates in bacteria (i. e., Escherichia coli and Salmo-nella typhimurium) have been determined from, for example, the lacI gene (5, 22) or the his operon (5, 12, 14) or by the rates of point mutations resulting in antibiotic resistance (1, 13, 26).

40|$|The {{availability}} of a strain of Acinetobacter competent for transformation {{has made it possible}} to demonstrate the genetic relatedness of a large variety of gram-negative, oxidase-negative, nonmotile, and aerobic coccobacilli originally classified into eleven different genera. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) species from 265 such strains are capable of transforming stable auxotrophs of the competent Acinetobacter to <b>prototrophy.</b> The compositions of these DNA species vary from 40 to 46. 8 % guanine plus cytosine. Strains with widely differing phenotypic properties are also included in this collection of acinetobacters. DNA species from all oxidase-positive strains of Moraxella and from a variety of common bacteria are unable to transform the competent Acinetobacter. Although acinetobacters are usually considered to be unable to reduce nitrate to nitrite, six strains known to carry out this reduction {{have been shown to be}} authentic acinetobacters since their DNA species readily transform the competent Acinetobacter auxotrophs to <b>prototrophy.</b> In contrast to previous findings that acinetobacters rarely grow with glucose as a sole carbon source, the results of the present study show that 17 of the 265 strains grow readily in a glucosemineral medium, and 48 other strains can mutate spontaneously to grow in such a medium. A second competent strain of Acinetobacter, originally unable to use glucose, d-xylose, or d-ribose as carbon sources, has been transformed for ability to dissimilate these compounds using DNA species from strains that normally grow on these sugars. Although most of the 265 Acinetobacter strains studied were originally grown on complex media when isolated from human sources, only nine of these strains require growth factors in order to grow in a mineral medium containing a single carbon and energy source. A simple transformation assay has been devised for rapid examination of large numbers of strains to determine whether or not they are acinetobacters. This assay, which is suitable for routine diagnostic work, includes a procedure for preparation of crude transforming DNA from a small quantity of bacterial paste. Samples of DNA prepared from Acinetobacter cultures that had died on slants and plates were still able to effect transformation of the competent auxotrophs to <b>prototrophy...</b>|$|E

Insertions in one mutant group {{appeared to be}} in cysG. A second group of insertions, designated asr (anaerobic sulfite reduction), were located near map unit 53 on the S. typhimurium chromosome. They did not cause aerobic or anaerobic auxotrophy in a cys 1 + background but did prevent dissimilatory sulfite reduction. Plasmids containing asr DNA cloned from wild-type S. typhimurium conferred anaerobic <b>prototrophy</b> and the ability to produce hydrogen sulfide from sulfite on an Escherichia coli cys 1 mutant...|$|E
