Only platelet count was significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by xylazine treatment. Such effect {{may be due}} to haemodilution or increase spleen storage function caused by xylazine. ]]...|$|E
40|$|<b>Propionylpromazine</b> {{phosphate}} {{forms an}} yellowish-brown 1 : 1 complex (log k = 5. 25 Â± 0. 1) with Pt(IV) at room temp. (27 Â± 1 Â°) in H 3 PO 4 medium contg. Cu(II) as catalyst. The complex exhibits absorption max. at 512 - 516 nm. The {{sensitivity of the}} reaction is 0. 032 Î¼g/cm 2 and the molar absorptivity is 5. 95 Ã� 103 L mol- 1 cm- 1. Beer's law is valid for 0. 4 - 6. 8 ppm Pt. The reagent was used successfully for the spectrophotometric detn. of Pt in synthetic mixts. corresponding to Pt alloys used in thermocouples and Pt-Ru and Pt-Ir alloys used in jewelry.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method to evaluate <b>propionylpromazine</b> hydrochloride (PPZHCl) in tranquilizer formulations was developed using {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC). During analysis of aged quality-control samples, a previously unreported chromatographic response was observed at a shorter retention time than PPZHCl. Further investigation of formulations stored in trap tap devices at temperatures ranging from 5 to 40 ◦C during field trials at four different locations confirmed the degradation of the active ingredient. Further investigation using HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry revealed two to five degradates, with the major degradates being oxidation products of the active ingredient, PPZHCl. As PPZHCl formulations must be stable when stored at 5 to 40 ◦C for 6 to 12 months, reformulation with the anti-oxidant ascorbic acid was utilized to achieve the required PPZHCl stability.

40|$|The {{successful}} chemical immobilization of gemsbok Oryx gazella gazella {{with a new}} potent analgesic, R 33799 (Janssen Pharmaceutica), and {{the major}} sedative xylazine hydro-chloride (Rompun; Bayer) is described. Evidence, which is presented, show that the R 33799 - xylazine mixture is an improvement over previously used drug mixtures for the immobilization of gemsbok. The following optimal dosage rates and application are recommended: 10 - 20 ug R 33 799 per kg + 100 ug xylazine per kg deep intra-muscularly. It is concluded that {{with the use of}} the above-mentioned drug mixtures and deposition site, almost predictable short induction periods of about 5 minutes or less can be achieved. High dosage levels of xylazine was found to produce a delayed or persistent somnolent state which has the disadvantage of a long and hazardous recovery phase, especially in predator prone surroundings. Results show that the action of R 33799 could be effectively reversed with the usual morphine antagonists. <b>Propionylpromazine</b> (Combelen; Bayer) was found to be a useful post-capture tranquilizer. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{robustness}} {{of the sample}} preparation procedure for the determination of six tranquilizers (xylazine, azaperone, <b>propionylpromazine,</b> chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and azaperol) and a beta-blocker (carazolol) in animal muscle by LC/MS–MS was assessed through the experimental design methodology. A 2 III 7 − 4 fractional factorial design was performed to evaluate the influence of seven variables on the final concentration of the seven drugs in the samples, in accordance with what is laid down in Commission Decision No 2002 / 657 /EC. The variation considered for each of those seven factors {{is likely to happen}} when preparing the samples, being the values chosen as level − 1, the nominal operating conditions. The results of the experimentation were evaluated from different statistical strategies, such as hypothesis testing using an external variance previously estimated, Lenth's method, and Bayesian analysis. Both Lenth's and Bayes' approaches enabled to determine the effect of every variable even though no degrees of freedom were left to estimate the residual error. The same conclusion about {{the robustness}} of the extraction step was reached from the three methodologies, namely, none of the seven factors examined influenced on the method performance significantly, so the sample preparation procedure was considered to be robust.
