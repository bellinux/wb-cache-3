40|$|Introduction: Leptospirosis {{affects a}} wide range of mammals, humans, and even a few <b>poikilothermic</b> <b>animal</b> species. In Pakistan, {{serological}} studies of equine leptospirosis have reported a prevalence of over 40 %, but no study has ever been conducted towards molecular detection of Leptospira in horses. Material and Methods: Blood samples from 128 horses were screened using ELISA and 41 positive samples were examined for the presence of leptospiral DNA using specific primers for 16 S rRNA gene. Results: Out of 41 tested samples, 20 samples were found to be PCR-positive, revealing a fragment of 306 bp after gel electrophoresis. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of positive samples revealed circulation of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in Pakistani horses. No evidence of circulation of intermediate species was found in this study. Conclusion: This study reports the first molecular evidence of equine leptospirosis in Pakistan and lays ground for further research in this area. It also confirms the efficiency of 16 S rRNA for the diagnosis of equine leptospirosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{opinion that}} fat cells can sense {{and respond to}} {{temperature}} so as to provide a triglyceride mixture with a melting point just below the environmental temperature (Lands, 1965) is widely held. This view disregards {{the fact that the}} body fat of most marine animals, including homeotherms, is highly unsaturated and has melting points much below environmental temperatures, whereas the final melting point of beef tallow and lard may be considerably above body temperature. In the bat, brown adipose tissue fat is less saturated in the summer than during hibernation (Wells, Makita, Wells & Krutzsch, 1965). In hamsters, body fat becomes less saturated after cold exposure, but this effect may be only indirectly due to temperature, because the same effect results from semi-starvation or cortisone treatment at normal tempera-ture (Kodama & Pace, 1963). Furthermore, the fatty acid composition of the diet may greatly affect the body-fat composition and influence the results obtained by variation of temperature. In the present experiment the hypothesis that cold exposure stimulates the synthesis de novo of a more unsaturated depot fat in a hibernating <b>poikilothermic</b> <b>animal</b> was tested in the mosquito Culex pipiens, which overwinters in the adult stage in arctic regions...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Detection of both {{biological}} and chemical environmental toxicants is essential {{in the assessment of}} risk to human health. Cell-based biosensors are capable of activity- based detection of toxicity. Chromatophore cells, responsible for the pigmentation of <b>poikilothermic</b> <b>animal,</b> have shown immense potential as cell-based biosensors in the detection of a broad range of environmental toxicants. Chromatophore cells possess the motile pigment granules that intracellularly aggregate or disperse in response to external stimuli. Previous studies have assessed chromatophore cells isolated from red Betta splendens and grey Oncorhynchus tschawytscha fish for use as a biosensor. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe blue B. splendens chromatophore cells in tissue culture. Blue B. splendens chromatophore cells were assessed for their longevity in tissue culture and their responses to previously established control agents. Blue B. splendens chromatophore cells were exposed to select chemicals and pathogenic bacteria to assess their ability to respond to environmental toxicants. Three concentrations of mercuric chloride, methyl mercuric chloride, paraquat, sodium arsenite, sodium cyanide chemicals were tested. Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were tested. Red B. splendens chromatophore cells were subjected to the select chemical and bacterial toxicants, and observed for their responses. The data collected in this and previous studies were compiled to compare chromatophore cell responses to a broad range of environmental toxicants. Chromatophore cells isolated from both blue and red B. splendens were responsive to methyl mercuric chloride and sodium arsenite. Grey O. tschawytscha chromatophore cells have shown responsiveness to mercuric chloride and sodium arsenite. Blue and red B. splendens chromatophore cells were both responsive to B. cereus and both Salmonella serovars. Grey O. tschawytscha have previously been shown to respond to B. cereus as well. In conclusion, this study reports the chromatophore cells isolated from blue B. splendens in tissue culture and showed similar responsiveness to the selected chemical and bacterial environmental toxicants as chromatophore cells isolated from red and grey colored fish. This study provides compelling evidence that the chromatophore response is not dependent on fish color and that chromatophore cells used for a cell-based detection system may be isolated from different colored fish...|$|E

40|$|Introduction For cold-blooded or <b>poikilothermic</b> <b>animals,</b> winter {{presents}} {{challenges to}} survival. Since the body temperature (Tb) of poikilotherms is usually {{very close to}} that of their surrounding environment, {{the risk of death}} from freezing is very real when temperatures drop below 0 C. Food is also scare during the winter and some animals also have limited mobility because the cold can make muscle movements slow or even induce a cold coma. It is not surprising, then, that few <b>poikilothermic</b> <b>animals</b> are active during the winter but protective measures must be in place to allow survival of prolonged cold exposures over a hibernation season that may stretch as long as 9 - 10 months in polar and alpine regions.

50|$|This {{difference}} in energy requirement {{also means that}} a given food source can support a greater density of <b>poikilothermic</b> <b>animals</b> than homeothermic animals.

However, when homeotherms and poikilotherms have similar niches, and compete, the homeotherm can often drive poikilothermic competitors to extinction, because homeotherms can gather food for a greater fraction of each day.|$|R

40|$|Circadian rhythms are {{generally}} {{known to be}} entrained to light cycles, and in some <b>poikilothermic</b> <b>animals</b> living in terrestrial region also to temperature cycles. The entraining effect of temperature cycles may be attributable {{to the fact that}} the daily fluctuation of temperature on the land is rather clear and regular closely related to the natural light change. On the other hand, the daily fluctuation of temperature in the sea is not so clear as in the terrestrial region, being generally very small or perfectly null depending on the depth. So, it is interesting to examine the effect of temperature cycle on the circadian rhythm of marine organisms, to make it clear whether the effect of temperature cycle is dependent on species, or generally seen on the circadian rhythms of different species of <b>poikilothermic</b> <b>animals.</b> The author made an experiment concerning this problem in a series of experiments with using of the sea-pen, Cavernularia obesa, a marine colonial coelenterate living on the sand bottom of shallow water, and obtained data somewhat unclear with difference among colonies in behavior under the temperature cycle (Imafuku, 1973).

We investigate the performance of auditory receptor neurons and properties of the tympanal membrane of Locusta migratoria in response to temperature changes.

In mouse foot-pad infections, the optimal environmental temperature for infection was 20 C, and the generation time of the infecting bacilli at this environmental temperature was about 15 hr. Intravenously inoculated mice developed peripheral infections of nose, feet, and tail at environmental temperatures of 4 to 30 C. At these temperatures, they had severe pneumonic involvement, and the mice at lower temperatures tended to succumb most rapidly to systemic infection. At 34 C, the intravenously infected mice did not develop peripheral infections and there was no pulmonary involvement. Young opossums, whose deep body temperatures are only 34 to 36 C, were inoculated in the foot-pad and intravenously. Foot-pad infection developed without systemic involvement. Bats, which assume environmental temperature when at rest, were inoculated in the foot-pad. Foot-pad infections were observed but no systemic disease. The bats could be maintained for only short periods, however. <b>Poikilothermic</b> <b>animals</b> were studied. Deep body temperatures were found to be nearly identical with ambient temperature. A total of 50 species of reptiles, amphibians, and fish were infected intraperitoneally in a number of experiments, as animals were available. Susceptibility to M. marinum was found throughout these species. There was no tendency to peripheral involvement. In experiments to determine the optimal environmental temperature for infection, cricket frogs (Acris), American chameleons (Anolis), young garter snakes (Thamnophis), and the young of three species of turtles were inoculated intraperitoneally. The optimal temperature for infection was found to be 30 C in each case, and infections at 20 C were definitely slower. The generation time of M. marinum in American chameleons at 30 C was about 19 hr; at 20 C, it was about 46 hr; and, at 10 C, the bacilli did not apparently multiply. Transmission studies revealed instances where infected animals shed M. marinum into the waters in which they were kept, and where animals became infected from water containing M. marinum...|$|R
