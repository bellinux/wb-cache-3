25|$|In {{his later}} life Bolikango served as {{managing}} director of the Sogenco construction company and general delegate to the Société zaïroise de Matériaux and STK <b>parastatals.</b> During the same time he made frequent trips to Lisala, where he remained a popular figure. Rumors surfaced in the capital that Bolikango was planning to use his regional political esteem for subversive purposes, so the Mobutu regime closely monitored his activities. Bolikango joined the MPR's central committee in September 1980. He died from an illness on 17 February 1982 in Liège, Belgium.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a Project Management Maturity Measurement Model to evaluate project management efficiency in a large <b>Parastatal</b> such as Eskom Distribution. This model will identify areas of improvement to assist a large <b>Parastatal</b> in improving their project management performance. It will eventually assist the organisation to build a culture of project management excellence. The hypotheses for the study were that firstly, the <b>Parastatal</b> does implement project management practice processes as advocated by project management bodies of knowledge. Secondly, a Project Management Maturity Measurement Model can be successfully implemented at a large <b>Parastatal</b> and help the <b>Parastatal</b> to identify project management grey areas that require improvement. Thirdly, a Project Management Maturity Measurement Model could assist a large <b>Parastatal</b> with project management improvement as a result of areas of recommendations. The method used to collect the required data for analysis and interpretation was the descriptive survey method. A customised survey questionnaire was developed to obtain data from research sample. Data was analysed using appropriate statistical techniques. The research sample was defined as the people who are primarily responsible for project, programme and portfolio management at a large <b>Parastatal.</b> The results of the data analysed pin pointed project management process weaknesses and possible improvement opportunities. Three main areas of improvement have been identified, namely applying lessons learned from previous project into future project, performing benchmarking to improve performance and project control processes. The findings of this study support the abovementioned hypotheses, and the insights provided and recommendations made will be of great help to a large <b>Parastatal</b> on its road to continuous improvement and building a culture of project management excellence...|$|R

The report on Namibia Tourism Exit Survey 2012 - 2013, produced by the Millennium Challenge Corporation for the Namibian Directorate of Tourism, indicates that 56% of all tourists visiting Namibia during that time period, visited Windhoek. In addition hereto, many of Namibia's tourism related <b>parastatals</b> and governing bodies such as Namibia Wildlife Resorts, Air Namibia and the Namibia Tourism Board as well as Namibia's tourism related associations such as the Hospitality Association of Namibia are headquartered in Windhoek.

25|$|In May 2014, ZDI began {{buying and}} selling scrap metal from two other <b>parastatals,</b> Ziscosteel and Zimbabwe National Railways. This venture {{collapsed}} when it emerged {{that the company had}} failed to secure the relevant permits from the Ministry of Mines and Development. A second diversification attempt, aimed at supplying food for the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, also ended abruptly when the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority accused ZDI of importing its rations without paying duties. Both the Zimbabwe National Army and Zimbabwe Republic Police also defaulted on payments for ammunition due to lack of funds, and it was widely reported that ZDI could no longer pay its workers. Employees claimed they had not received their wages for seven months. In response, the company sent most of its staff on forced leave.|$|E
25|$|The airline ordered four Fokker F 27–500 {{turboprops}} in January 1981, {{however, the}} early 1980s saw the airline undergoing financial difficulties, {{and in order}} to ease pressure on the financial resources of the airline, one DC-8, one 737-200 and two F 27s were taken out of service. Due to the financial crisis, the airline also suspended all international flights, with the exception of those on the Kinshasa-Lagos-Brussels route. In September 1983, Mobutu announced an austerity program, which would see some forty-seven <b>parastatals,</b> including Air Zaïre, being liquidated or reorganised to operate upon a commercial basis. The government announced that staffing levels at the airline would be reduced by 6,500 to 2,500, and that a forty percent stake in the airline would be offered to prospective buyers. In early 1985, the government signed a deal with the Israeli Tamman Group, giving the foreign company a forty percent stake in the airline, in return for a US$400 million investment in Zaire's transport and pharmaceutical industries, however, the deal did not materialise.|$|E

The political ingredient of the SBC is discussed by focusing on two examples: 1) religious and military foundations in Iran; and 2) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It presents two main findings. First, the SBC of the <b>parastatal</b> sector {{can be understood as}} the political economy of a predator state or state’s rent-seeking activity. Second, the state sector is more prone to the SBC compared with a decentralized competitive market, but it might be subject to a harder budget constraint in comparison with the <b>parastatal</b> sector. ...|$|R
