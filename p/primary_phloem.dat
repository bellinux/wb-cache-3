50|$|The cambium present between {{primary xylem}} and <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> is called intrafasicular cambium. During {{secondary}} growth, cells of meduallary rays, {{in a line}} with intrafasicular cambium, become meristematic and form interfascicular cambium. Therefore, the intrafascicular and interfascicular cambia form a ring which separates the primary xylem and <b>primary</b> <b>phloem,</b> and is known as cambium ring. The vascular cambium produces secondary xylem {{on the inside of}} the ring, and secondary phloem on the outside, pushing the primary xylem and phloem apart.|$|E
50|$|In young stems, which lack what is {{commonly}} called bark, the tissues are, {{from the outside}} to the inside: epidermis, periderm, cortex, <b>primary</b> <b>phloem,</b> secondary phloem, vascular cambium, secondary xylem, and primary xylem. As the stem ages and grows, changes occur that transform {{the surface of the}} stem into the bark. The epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body, including the stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, that protects the plant from the outside world. In old stems the epidermal layer, cortex, and <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> become separated from the inner tissues by thicker formations of cork. Due to the thickening cork layer these cells die because they do not receive water and nutrients. This dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems.|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the bark of Agathis, Libocedrus, Dacrydium and Phyllocladus in New Zealand is described. Samples were {{collected}} from local areas in Canterbury, Buller and Northland, and examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In Libocedrus species, the sclerenchyma consists of thin and thick-walled fibres. In all other species, the sclerenchyma comprises fibres and sclereids. However, sclerenchyma is quite rare or sometimes absent in Dacrydium laxifolium. Crystals occur in the lumina {{and also in the}} wall (in the region of the middle lamella) of some phloem cells. Resin canals are present in the <b>phloem,</b> <b>primary</b> cortex and phelloderm of Agathis australis and in the primary cortex of all the three species of Phyllocladus. L and T-shaped parenchyma cells were found to be common in the phloem of Dacrydium cupressinum. These cells lie partly in the ray system and partly in the axial system, and are filled with tannin. Trabeculae were very common in the phloem in Libocedrus bidwillii. Phellem cells in Libocedrus species are very thin-walled and appear flimsy. In Agathis australis, the phellem cells are mostly thin-walled, with the outer 1 - 3 layers being thick-walled. Those in Dacrydium cupressinum, Phyllocladus glaucus and Phy. trichomanoides are all thin-walled. Phellem of the other six Dacrydium species consists of thin-walled cells and also cells with an inner tangential wall that is thicker than the outer tangential wall. In three species, this inner tangential wall is sclerified and in the other three species, it is non-polylamellate but possesses cone-shaped structures, protruding into the lumina. This latter feature is also shared by phellem cells in Phyllocladus alpinus. Minute crystals were found to be very abundant in the walls of phelloderm cells under lenticels, in most species...|$|R
40|$|Commonly, {{fibre hemp}} (Cannabis sativa) is not {{considered}} {{for the production of}} soft and easy-care textiles. However, initial tests in the textile industry have shown that certain processes allow improvement in the everyday-wear characteristics of hemp textiles. In the framework of the EU R&D project Hemp-sys [QLRT- 01 - 01363] the potential of hemp as a feedstock in textile processing is investigated. Therefore, a detailed study on the effects of agronomy and fibre extraction processing on fibre properties for textile processing has been carried out. To relate the crop growing conditions with fibre quality and productivity it is required that information is obtained on hemp bast fibre formation. At various stages of the plant development the fibre development has been monitored by microscopic techniques. The two distinct bast fibre types occurring in hemp-the so called primary and secondary fibres-show different and independent development. The primary fibres appear earlier in the development in the rapid growth stage and are formed from the primary meristem in the outer layers (<b>phloem).</b> <b>Primary</b> fibres are thick, extremely long and with compact cell walls and small lumen and are present from bottom to top of the plant. In contrast, the secondary fibres are formed in later stages during thickness growth from the secondary meristem. Secondary fibres are thinner, shorter and with higher lignin content than the primary fibres. In early developmental stages secondary fibres only occur {{at the bottom of the}} stem. Substantial secondary fibre formation is observed at the start of flowering or when the plants grow taller than 2. 25 m and/or thicker than approximately 1 cm. Based upon these observations a selection of conditions can be made for growing and harvesting of hemp to obtain the best quality fibre for textile processing. To produce a crop with maximum amount of primary fibres free from secondary fibres, the recommended practice is to grow hemp at high seed density to avoid thickness growth and to harvest the hemp stems around flowering of the plants...|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that auxin and gibberellic acid (GA 3) control the differentiation of <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> fibers is confirmed for {{the stem of}} Coleus blumei Benth. Indoleacetic acid (IAA) alone sufficed to cause the differentiation of a few <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> fibers. In long term experiments auxin induced {{a considerable number of}} fibers in mature internodes. GA 3 by itself did not exert any effect on fiber differentiation.

Although the combined effect of the two growth hormones diminished considerably with increasing distance from the source of induction, auxin with GA 3 or IAA alone induced fibers in a few internodes below the application site. When various combinations of both hormones were applied, high concentrations of IAA stimulated rapid differentiation of fibers with thick secondary walls, while high levels of GA 3 resulted in long fibers with thin walls. The size of the <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> fibers correlated with the dimensions of the differentiating internode, thereby providing evidence that both growth regulators figure in the control of stem extension.

In young soybean stems, HRGPs are expressed most heavily in cambium cells, in a few layers of cortex cells surrounding <b>primary</b> <b>phloem,</b> and in some parenchyma cells around the primary xylem, whereas GRPs are highly expressed in the primary xylem {{and also in the}} <b>primary</b> <b>phloem.</b> In older soybean stems, HRGP genes are expressed exclusively in cambium cells and GRP genes are most heavily expressed in newly differentiated secondary xylem cells. Similar expression patterns of HRGPs and of GRPs were found in soybean petioles, seedcoats, and young hypocotyls, and also in bean petioles and stems. HRGPs and GRPs become insolubilized in soybean stem cell walls. Three major HRGP mRNAs and two major GRP mRNAs accumulate in soybean stems. Soluble HRGPs are abundant in young hypocotyl apical regions and young root apical regions, whereas in hypocotyl and root mature regions, soluble HRGPs are found only in a few layers of cortex cells surrounding the vascular bundles. GRPs are specifically localized in primary xylem cell walls of young root. These results show that the gene expression of HRGPs and GRPs is developmentally regulated in a tissue-specific manner. In soybean tissues, HRGPs are most heavily expressed in meristematic cells and in some of those cells that may be under stress, whereas GRPs are expressed in all cells that are or are going to be lignified...|$|E

Sweet) {{at different stages of}} growth following the standard paraffin method of microtechnique. The basal part of the hypocotyl is root-like in structure while the middle and upper parts are stem-like. The transition of vascular tissues occurs in the basal part of the hypocotyl. The vascular bundles are collateral in arrangement in the middle and upper parts and radial in the basal part. There are two types of vascular bundles, small and large in the middle and upper parts. There are 1 - 2 small vascular bundles in between two large bundles. The large vascular bundle contains xylem and phloem but small bundle may or may not contain both xylem and phloem. There are several poles of <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> outside the primary xylem. In the basal part of the hypocotyl there are 4 strands of xylem alternating with phloem zones. Each xylem strand is divided into 2 xylem poles which are either connected or separated. There are several poles of phloem in the phloem region in between 2 xylem strands. The vessels in the xylem strands are found to be radially arranged as seen in the basal part of the hypocotyl. Lots of tanniniferous cells with or without content have been found in the <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> region. The pericycle is discontinuous.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that auxin (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA 3) control {{the formation of}} lignin is confirmed for the <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> fibers and for the secondary xylem in the stem of Coleus blumel Benth. Indoleacetic acid alone, {{or a combination of}} high IAA/low GA 3 (w/w), induced short phloem fibers with thick secondary walls, that contained lignin rich in syringyl units (high ratio of syringyl/guaiacyl). On the other hand, a combination of high GA 3 /low IAA (w/w), which promoted the differentiation of long phloem fibers with thin walls, decreased the relative content of the syringyl units (low syringyl/guaiacyl ratio). In the secondary xylem, these hormonal treatments yielded only slight changes in the noncondensed monomeric guaiacyl units, confirming the relative stability of the guaiacyl lignification pattern in this tissue.

On the syncytial wall adjoining vessels the cell wall ingrowths were formed, while the syncytial walls at interface of phloem were considerably thickened. They lacked of functional plasmodesmata and did not form any ingrowths. Using immunofluorescent-labelling and immunogold-labelling methods tomato expansin 5 protein was localized in nematode infected roots.

Arabinan, rather than galactan, and HGA with low degree of esterification were located in the cell walls of procambial, while HGA with a low degree of esterification was located in the tangential walls, and galactan was located in both the tangential and radial walls of procambial, yet nearly no arabinan was located in the tangential walls of the cambial cells. The changes in pectin distribution took place when periclinal divisions appeared within a procambial trace.

In addition, the density of gold particles differed significantly between the vacuoles and the protoplasm at the 0.05 significance level based on the Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. Consequently, the saikosaponins in the roots were mainly distributed in vacuoles of phloem cells. Shon et al.

This study characterized changes in cell wall concentration, composition, and degradability by rumen microbes resulting from alfalfa stem tissue proliferation and development during maturation. The seventh internode from the shoot base of three alfalfa clones was sampled after 12, 17, 21, 31, and 87 d of regrowth in 1996 and 21 and 31 d in 1997. Cross sections were examined by light microscopy for tissue development, and after 48 -h in vitro degradation. Cell wall concentration {{and composition of}} the internodes were determined by the Uppsala dietary fiber method, and cell wall degradability by rumen microbes was measured after 12 and 96 h. All stem tissues were pectin-rich and nonlignified at the two youngest maturities in 1996, except for primary xylem vessels which had lignified and thickened walls, and the internode was actively elongating. Primary xylem was the only tissue not degraded from immature stems. The 21 -d-old internodes had completed elongation and begun secondary xylem proliferation. Secondary xylem lignified immediately, and lignification of <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> and pith parenchyma began when elongation ended. As tissues lignified, their cell walls became undegradable. Maturation increased stem proportion consisting of undegradable secondary xylem, and cell wall polysaccharide composition shifted from predominantly pectin toward cellulose.

40|$|We {{examined}} 62 {{species in}} 45 genera of the cactus subfamily Cactoideae; all had collateral cortical bundles that permeated the broad, water-storing inner cortex and {{extended to the}} base of the outer, photosynthetic palisade cortex. Mean distance between cortical bundles was 0. 75 mm, similar to the mean spacing (0. 74 mm) of veins in leaves of Pereskia, a genus of relict leaf-bearing cacti. In 16 species, both young and extremely old stem cortex was available for study: in all of these, older bundles had larger amounts of phloem than did younger bundles, indicating that phloem had been produced for many years. In ten species, older bundles also had more xylem than younger bundles. In two genera (Rhipsalis and Selenicereus) there were caps of <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> fibres, and in a single species (Pilosocereus mortensenii) cortical bundle xylem contained libriform fibres. All cortical bundle tracheary elements were narrow (radius range, 0. 91 – 8. 2 μm; mode, 1. 8 – 2. 7 μm), similar to Pereskia leaf vein elements (radius range, 1. 8 – 2. 7 μm); this was much narrower than stem wood vessels (radius range, 10 – 42 um; mode, 23 – 28 μm). Longitudinal conduction of water and nutrients probably occurs predominantly in stem wood, with cortical bundles maintaining the broad, voluminous cortex, the outer part of which is the plant's photosynthetic tissue and the inner part of which stores water and starch.

40|$|The {{process of}} retting (the {{dissociation}} of the fibre bundles {{from the central}} stele {{by the action of}} microbes) in two varieties of flax (Linum usitatissimum; cvs. Laura and Escalina) was investigated by studying the morphology and mechanics of plants after treatment with a translocated herbicide, glyphosate. The mechanical changes in the stems were measured on a weekly basis, by carrying out a series of mechanical peel and tear tests on the stem tissue of mature plants. There was a pronounced drop in the moisture content of the stem 14 days after application of the herbicide, from a moisture content of ~ 60 to 10 %. This was consistent with the onset of senescence and subsequent dehydration of the plant tissues. The dehydration of the stem tissues corresponded with an increase in the work required to peel the fibre bundles from the secondary phloem tissue, from 212 ± 7. 9 to 539 ± 22 J m− 2 (P< 0. 001). However, 27 days after application of the herbicide there was a more gradual but significant drop in the work required to peel the stem, by ~ 45 % to a mean work to peel of 297 ± 19. 8 J m− 2. This is thought to be a result of the retting process. This study indicates that peel tests can be used to measure mechanical changes in the interface between the fibre bundles (<b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> tissue) and the secondary phloem tissue.

Non-lignified epidermis, collenchyma, chlorenchyma, cambium and primary xylem parenchyma were rapidly and completely degraded within the first 8 h of fermentation. Rates of degradation ranged from 0. 04 micro m h- 1 for thin-walled (0. 29 micro m) primary xylem parenchyma tissue to 0. 11 micro m h- 1 for thick-walled (0. 90 micro m) collenchyma tissue. The non-lignified secondary wall (1. 70 micro m) of the <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> fibres required 24 h for complete degradation. Cell walls of some lignified tissues (e. g. pith parenchyma and secondary xylem fibres) were only partially degradable (9. 1 - 65. 5 %) even after 96 h of fermentation. The primary and secondary xylem vessels appeared to be completely nondegradable. The observed rates of cell-wall degradation for nonlignified lucerne stem tissues were two to five times faster than previously estimated for nonlignified grass mesophyll tissue. However, extent of degradation for the lignified tissues of lucerne stems was less than reported for lignified grass stem sclerenchyma. These differences in cell-wall degradation characteristics among tissues within lucerne and compared to grasses are probably related to cell-wall lignification and polysaccharide composition of individual tissues...|$|E

Thin sections (100 μm) were incubated with rumen fluid in vitro for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The degradation of tissue cell walls was evaluated for each fermentation time interval against a nondegraded mirror control section by light microscopy. Cell-wall thickness of alfalfa stem tissues was measured using scanning electron microscopy for both control and fermented sections. Rate and extent of cell-wall degradation were calculated from these measurements. Non-lignified epidermis, collenchyma, chlorenchyma, cambium and primary xylem parenchyma were rapidly and completely degraded within the first 8 h of fermentation.

The secondary cellulose of the fibres was not labelled preferentially when a pulse of 14 CO 2 was given. Conversely, the D-[U- 14 C]glucose was well incorporated into the fibre secondary cellulose, whatever {{the day of the}} pulse. The glucose was, first incorporated into storage polysaccharides (probably starch) and used when needed, for secondary cellulose deposits. Key words: Cellulose — Linum usitatissimum — Polysaccharides — Starch. The species Linum is well known to produce cellulosic fibres, originating from <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> cells (Esau 1945). More and less fibres are differentiating according to both the variety and the growth conditions. Linseed plants, orienting preferentially their photosynthesis toward a lipid metabolism, might differentiate less fibres (Sinha et al. 1973). Besides, a relation was shown between the produc-tion of cellulosic fibres and water supply and/or light inten-sity (Milthorpe 1945, Menoux-Boyer 1980, Sebanek and Vitkova 1982). It has been also suggested (Robert and Roland 1989) that during the intrusive growth of flax fibres, enzymes digested the cell-walls of the neighbour cells, the products being in turn used as substrates for the fibre cell-walls. Question is then raised about the metabolic path-way^) of the secondary cellulose of flax fibres. Is it directly linked to photosynthesis and/or to other sources of sub-strate? In this paper, we reported some pulse-chase experi-ments, run at different days of the flax (Linum usitatis-simum L.) development, using either 14 CO 2 or [l 4 C]glucose.

40|$|Anatomical {{investigation}} {{has been made}} on the stem of country bean (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet) {{at different stages of}} growth following the standard paraffin method of microtechnique. The epidermis is single layered with multicellular hairs and glandular trichomes. Beneath the epidermis there are 5 - 10 layers of cortical cells. The primary vascular tissue appears after the elongation of the first internode of the stem. The vascular bundles are collateral and arranged in a ring. There are two types of vascular bundles, large and small. There are one or more small vascular bundles in between two large bundles. The large vascular bundle contains xylem and phloem but small bundle may or may not contain both xylem and phloem. There are several poles of <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> outside the primary xylem. The pericycle is discontinuous. Two adjacent groups of sclerenchyma are connected by one or two layers of sclerenchymatous cells. The cambium initiates in the primary vascular bundle between xylem and phloem at the basal part of the stem of 4 days old plant. Gradually it extends towards the upper part. The cambium is at first confined to the fascicular region. Subsequently it extends into the interfascicular region forming a complete cambial ring. After the formation of the fascicular cambium it gives rise to the secondary xylem adaxially and secondary phloem abaxially. In the mature stem, most of the vessels are multiple, some are paired while the others are solitary. Most of the fibre cells in the phloem region are found in groups. The fibre cells are arranged {{in such a way that}} the structure looks like a pyramid. Tannin cells are present in the phloem region of younger and mature stem. The secretory cells devoid of tanniniferous contents have been observed in the secondary phloem region of the mature stem. The phellogen appears in the deeper cortex and produces periderm with lenticel. The periderm consists of 3 - 5 layers of cork cells abaxially and 2 - 3 layers of phelloderm adaxially...|$|E

A estrutura anatômica da estaca pode interferir no processo de enraizamento de algumas espécies, todavia em videira não há informações a respeito. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a capacidade de enraizamento de estacas de {{cultivar}}es de Vitis, com ênfase aos aspectos anatômicos. Os quatro cultivares estudados foram: Vitis labrusca L. cv. Bordô, V. rotundifolia Michx. cv. Topsail e os porta-enxertos híbridos entre V. berlandieri Planch. × V. riparia Michx., 'Kobber 5 BB' e 'SO 4 '. Destes cultivares apenas 'Topsail' apresentou dificuldade de enraizamento. Após 77 dias do plantio das estacas, foi observada uma baixa capacidade de enraizamento do cv. Topsail em relação aos outros três cultivares analisados. Também observou-se uma alta porcentagem de estacas vivas, porém não enraizadas, e a ausência de calos neste cultivar. Esses dados podem indicar a existência de fatores endógenos do cv. Topsail que dificultam o enraizamento das estacas. As características anatômicas da base das estacas do cv. Topsail diferiram das demais por manter as calotas de fibras no floema primário, pela presença de floema secundário reduzido com faixas radiais de fibras. Desse modo, a dificuldade de enraizamento desse cultivar pode estar relacionada a barreiras anatômicas. Cutting is {{the most}} common method of vegetative propagation. A critical step in this process is the initial development of a functional root system. The anatomical structure of the cutting has been shown to affect the rooting ability of some species, but for grapevines this has not yet been investigated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the rooting ability of Vitis cuttings, with emphasis on the anatomical aspects. The four cultivars studied were: Vitis labrusca L. cv. Bordô, V. rotundifolia Michx. cv. Topsail and hybrid rootstocks of V. berlandieri Planch. × V. riparia Michx., 'Kobber 5 BB' and 'SO 4 '. Of these cultivars, only 'Topsail' showed poor rooting ability; 77 days after planting the cuttings, poor rooting ability of cv. Topsail was observed in relation to the other three cultivars. A high percentage of live cuttings was observed, but they did not take root. There were no calluses on this cultivar. These data may indicate the presence of endogenous factors in cv. Topsail that make it difficult for cuttings to take root. The anatomical features of the base of the cv. Topsail cutting were {{different from those of the}} other cultivars in that they retained the fiber bundles of the <b>primary</b> <b>phloem,</b> and they also had reduced secondary phloem with radial fiber bands.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Eastern Filbert Blight, {{caused by}} Anisogramma anomala (Peck) E. Miller, was first {{discovered}} in the Pacific Northwest in 1974. Orchard experiments suggest that the fungus completes its life cycle in two years. Infection takes place from mid-January to May, mainly through mite-galled-buds infested with an Eriophyid mite, Phytocoptella avellanae Nal. Ascospores are presumed {{to be the only}} infectious propagules since no conidial stage has been observed during the four years of investigation. After a latency period of 12 - 16 months, the fungus can be detected in the <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> and vascular cambium and later penetrates deep into the xylem. Stromata are initiated during May as indicated by a somatic pressure cushion which gradually crushes and splits the bark to expose the ectostroma. Dense aggregates of smaller fungal cells arise deep within the endostroma in 2 - 3 layers forming primordia. The primordia consist of an "outer coil" of filamentous hyphal cells terminated by a non-functional trichogyne, surrounding an "inner coil" of more isodiametric ascogenous cells. The centrum arises from this "inner coil" as a loose clump of ascogenous cells which lack croziers. Mononucleate asci arise from these ascogenous cells near the end of July. Meiosis occurs from mid-July through August and each ascus cleaves eight unequally two-celled hyaline ascospores. A. anomala causes a simple interest type of disease during a single season but is considered a compound interest type in longstanding orchards. Disease severity, measured as the percent of plant surface attacked, was evaluated for individual cankers, for individual trees and for orchards as a whole. Disease increase was found to be r= 0. 265, r= 1. 084 and r= 1. 240 units/year respectively. The disease spread south from the original focus which was determined to be a group of five orchards, in the northwest quadrant of the diseased area. Spread of inoculum over long distances is infrequent. Therefore, established secondary foci to the south {{are more likely to be}} the source of inoculum to nearby orchards and pose the greatest threat of spread into orchards further south in the main filbert growing areas of Oregon. Various inoculation methods were tested on several filbert tissues. Hypodermic infiltration of ascospores into mite-galled-buds and into healthy non-infested buds, proved to be the only successful inoculation methods giving 46. 5 and 29. 0 percent infection respectively. There was a general increase in percent infection as inoculation dates approached the natural infection period which was determined to extend from February through May and to correlate with the duration of rainfall during the same season. Ascospores were recovered continuously from each of ten different exposure periods from 26 November to 3 April. Spore release is thought to be at least six months in duration extending well beyond the spore trapping dates, and thus lasts longer than the natural infection period. Heaviest discharge was recorded during periods of constant wetting of the stromata. Free moisture on the stromata induces inoculum discharge which is further dispersed by rain splash. Natural infection occurs when the inoculum is washed between the scales of P. avellanae infested buds. Hypodermic infiltration of ascospores into mite-free-buds also resulted in a substantial percent infection. Following infection there is normally a 12 - 16 month latency period for symptom expression. Under greenhouse conditions symptoms developed within six months of inoculation. Culture isolation taken from diseased and healthy filbert twigs resulted in a substantial recovery of Phomopsis sp., from 36. 4 to 93. 2 percent. Therefore although Phomopsis was isolated from cankered tissue it is unlikely that it is more than an epiphyte...|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo anatômico de Coffea arabica L. var. typica Cramer tem por finalidade fornecer informações básicas necessárias ao estudo da anatomia comparada das principais espécies e variedades de cafeeiros, cultivadas no Estado de São Paulo. Nesta primeira contribuição o autor realiza o estudo anatômico detalhado dos órgãos vegetativos e reprodutivos da variedade typica, não se limitando apenas à anatomia descritiva dos diversos órgãos, mas também, sempre que possível, discutindo o desenvolvimento ontogenético das diversas partes do cafeeiro. No estudo da raíz e do caule procurou-se estabelecer a duração do desenvolvimento primário, assinalando o local de aparecimento, primeiramente do câmbio {{vascular}} e, posteriormente, do felógeno ou câmbio suberoso. Na discussão da anatonia das folhas mereceu especial atenção o estudo das domácias, sua morfologia e possível função. As flores são estudadas detalhadamente nos seus diversos elementos. Nos capítulos referentes à anatomia do fruto e da semente, além do estudo puramente descritivo das suas estruturas são ainda discutidas as diversas modificações verificadas durante o desenvolvimento do ovário e dos óvulos, respectivamente em fruto e sementes. The {{knowledge of}} the anatomy of Coffea arabica L. var. typica Cramer {{should be considered as}} a basic contribution to the comparative study of the anatomy of coffee species and varieties cultivated in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The detailed investigations carried out on the vegetative and reproductive organs of the coffee plant revealed the following. The roots {{at the end of the}} primary growth present a protostelic, poliarch (6, 7, 8, 9, 11 primary xylem bundles), and exarch structure, the following tissues or zone of tissues being visible: root cap, epidermis, exodermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle, <b>primary</b> <b>phloem</b> and primary xylem. This primary growth has a very short duration and is very soon followed by the secondary growth, formed from a vascular cambium which makes its first appearance in a region localized approximately 5 cm from the root apex. Phellogen arises first in the pericycle and later in phloem and gives origin to a relatively thin periderm; this protective layer replaces the epidermis that is gradually killed and sloughs away. Lateral roots originate from pericyclic cells situated at the protoxylem outer edges. The origin of all stem tissues, as well as those of the leaves, can be traced back to a dome-shaped shoot apex, which measure 220 - 360 microns in diameter and 48 - 120 microns in its major height; this shoot apex interpreted under the terms of Schmidt's theory shows to possess a tunica composed of two or three cell layers, and a corpus, represented by a central core of irregularly arranged cells. Differentiation of meristematic tissue initiates at the distance of 800 - 900 microns from the shoot apex, but the complete primary tissue differentiation is only achieved in a region situated 2. 5 cm from the shoot apex. Stem cross sections at this level exhibit the following tissue zones: epidermis, angular collenchyma, cortical parenchyma, pericycle, <b>primary</b> <b>phloem,</b> primary xylem and pith. No distinct endodermis is visible. The vascular cambium, firstly visible in a region distant 2. 5 cm from the shoot apex, originates from procambial cells localized between the xylem and phloem, being at the beginning only fascicular; the cells of the primary rays undergo cambiform meristematic activity, and interfascicular cambium is thereby formed between the vascular bundles. Following a centripetal differentiation the cambial derivatives give rise to a continuous band of secondary xylem and secondary phloem. Older stem cross sections present a periderm which is about 70 microns thick. Cork cambium arises from the innermost cells of cortex and produces cork externally and phelloderm internally. Petiole presents a tricyclic structure, exhibiting three vascular bundles, the major one corresponding to the mid-rib; all the bundles show a normal orientation of the xylem and phloem tissues. Secondary vascular bundles are also present towards the wings of the petiole cross section. The structure of foliage blade is that of typical leaves of dorsiventral symmetry. At an early stage the blade consists of seven layers of relatively undifferentiated cells. At maturity, just one layer of palisade parenchyma and ten to twelve layers of spongy cells are present. Upper epidermis is uniseriate and formed only by epidermal cells proper; uniseriate lower epidermis exhibits these cells and stomata which are of the rubiaceous type, being formed by two guard cells and two subsidiary cells. Remarkable is the occurrence on the lower epidermis of certain structures called domatiae; the constancy of these structures on the lower epidermis of the leaves of Coffea and a few other rubiaceous genera has been considered an important taxonomic characteristic for genera identification. On the other hand, the domatia localization, shape, size and constitution, as well as the presence or absence of stomata on their outermost cell layer or the presence or absence of hairs on the borders of the domatia aperture, have shown to be important characteristics to be utilized in the differentiation of Coffea species and varieties. In Coffea arabica L. var. typica Cramer the,domatiae are localized at the very angle formed by the secondary veins with the mid-rib, have a vesicular shape and open externally through an elliptical or round pore which measures 200 - 260 microns in diameter; the borders of the pore are nearly glabrous, a few hairs appearing only in a region distant from the borders; very few stomata are also present on the outermost cell layer of the domatia. Stipule structure is similar to that of foliage blade, but no differentiation between palisade parenchyma and spongy cells is apparent. The inflorescence is of the homotatic type, the lateral axes being very short; consequently the flowers are disposed in axilar glomerules; bracteoles are in number of two pairs for each flower set, being respectively lanceolate and triangular, and presenting the same structure of the stipules. Calyx is very rudimentary; the sepals resemble the leaves anatomically, and present only a trace supply; the petals are united in a tube forming a salver-shaped corolla, presenting a single vascular trace each. Stamens are epipetalous and have also a single trace as vascular supply; the anthers are two-celled, opening lengthwise. At maturity each anther exhibits in cross section four pollen-sacs, surrounded by an uniseriate epidermis, two fiber layers and a narrow strip of tapetum vestiges. Microsporogenesis is reported to be normal by several authors. Pollen grains are numerous, globose, with a very thick, smooth, and 3 - 4 -sulcate exine. Pistil is represented by an inferior ovary, terminal style and two stigmatic branches. Ovary is normally two-celled, each one bearing a single anatropous ovule on a central placenta; funicle is very short, and the embryo-sac is of the normal type, monosporic, 8 -nucleate. Anatomically the ovary shows to be formed by uniseriate epidermes, the outer one presenting stomata; between the epidermes there is parenchymatous tissue, and distributed in this thick parenchyma there are 2 or 3 concentric vascular bundle series. The coffee fruit is a drupe, containing normally two seeds; exceptionally there is the occurrence of three or more seeds in the cases of tri-celled or pluri [...] celled ovaries, or through false polyembryony when bi-celled ovaries present more than one ovule in each cell. On the other hand, by abortion of an ovule one-seeded fruit may be formed (peaberry). Ripe fruits have a fleshy and thick pericarp. Fruit development brings about a series of chemical and morphological modifications that lead to a reduction in the thickness of pericarp, from 1. 5 mm in ripe fruits to 0. 4 in dried fruits. Exocarp is represented by a single layer of hardened and lignified cells, with scattered stomata. Mesocarp is formed by several layers of polyhedric, large and lignified cells, the innermost of which are somewhat compressed and flattened. Amidst these cells are visible the vascular bundles showing a great amount of fibers. Endocarp is about 100 microns thick and constitutes in the ripe fruits the so-called "seed parchment". Studied in cross section the endocarp shows to be formed by 5 - 6 layers of intercrossing strong fibers, what gives this zone of tissue an extraordinary strength. Maceration allows the detailed examination of the individual fibers which measure 350 - 370 microns in length by 20 - 45 microns in transverse diameter. The cell walls are very thick and provided with ramiform pits; cell lumen is almost occluded. The coffee seeds or coffee beans are elliptical or egg-shaped, plane-convex, possessing a longitudinal furrow on the plane surface. Seed coat is represented by the so-called "silver skin", which ontogenetically originates from the primine, the single ovule integument. This seed coat is about 70 microns thick and anatomically shows to be constituted by an outer layer of fibers somewhat similar to the endocarp fibers; they are, however, shorter, measuring the longest ones 180 - 320 microns in length and 18 - 30 microns in transverse diameter. Their thick walls are provided with round, elliptical, or elongated simple pits. The size of these fibers, the thickness and number of pits on their walls are considered by Chevalier as important taxonomic characteristics for the differentiation of Coffea species. Completing the silver skin structure there are several layers of amorphic parenchyma tissue, and a layer of indistinct cells which originate from the innermost cell layer of the primine. On the other hand, the fibers had their origin from the outermost cell layer of the primine. Endosperm is foimed by polyhedric cells of very thick cellulosic walls, functioning the cellulose in this case as food storage. With the aid of a special technique plasmodesmata can be detected in the primary-pit-fields of the endosperm cell walls. The endosperm tissue seems to present differences in the structure and chemical composition of its various layers; thus, at the level of the embryo cavity the cells are flattened and elongated constituting a region which probably désintégrâtes during embryo development. The outer layers represented by hard endosperm slough away as a cap that involves the cotyledons of seedlings obtained from completely naked seeds. This cap resembles the seed parchment in gross morphology. The inner layers are considered soft endosperm. As to the chemical composition, the endosperm cells besides Water, contains protein, the alkaloids caféine and coffearine, oil, sugar, dextrins, pentosans, cellulose, caffetannic acids, minerals, various acids and minor constituents. The small embryo, localized at the bottom of the seed, on its convex surface is represented by an hypocotyl and two adherent cordiform cotyledons. Very seldom there is the occurrence of embryo with 3 or 4 cotyledons...|$|E
