When comparing chlorhexidine to normal saline, W-Dahl [30] [...] found that chlorhexidine resulted in fewer positive bacteria cultures, lower frequency of Staphylococcus aureus and fewer days of antibiotic use.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Because {{of disease}} {{transmission}} concerns, field studies {{to evaluate the}} impact of water-hardening eggs at different concentrations of <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> <b>iodine</b> (iodophor) for various times of exposure have rarely used untreated controls. Additionally, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service protocol requires a subsequent post–water-hardening surface disinfection for salmonid eggs transferred between stations. The cumulative im-pact of this second disinfection on survival has not been fully investigated for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. This study compared the percent of eye-up Atlantic salmon eggs that had been water-hardened with iodophor treat-ments at 50, 100, and 150 mg active ingredient/L for 30, 60, and 90 min with that of untreated controls and also examined the impact on egg survival of a secon...|$|E
40|$|Achromobacter xylosoxidans, a {{bacterial}} species named in 1971, is often isolated from aqueous environments, but {{little has been}} reported about its pathogenicity in humans, its epidemiological pattern, and its susceptibility to antibiotics and antiseptics. We were faced with an epidemic caused by this microorganism for 18 months in an intensive care unit. Two patients had fatal infections and 37 others were colonized. The source was the deionized water of the hemodialysis system. The 46 isolates were identified by comparison with the reference strain A. xylosoxidans ATCC 27061. The characteristic cellular fatty acids of this species were demonstrated by gas-liquid chromatography. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of 27 antibiotics were determined. The isolates were susceptible to only two: moxalactam at 4 micrograms/ml and ceftazidime at 8 micrograms/ml. The minimal bactericidal concentrations of one disinfectant and three antiseptics were: sodium hypochloride, 109 micrograms/ml; chlorhexidine digluconate in ethanol solution, 15 to 125 micrograms/ml; <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> <b>iodine,</b> 750 micrograms/ml; and iodine ethanol, 312 to 625 micrograms/ml...|$|E
40|$|The trypan blue {{exclusion}} test, the MTT {{test and}} an immunostaining test for apoptosis were performed {{before and after}} incubation of SW 620 human colonic carcinoma cells with different cytotoxic agents (CTAs) {{in order to assess}} tumor cell viability and CTA efficacy in vitro. A modified MTT test using light microscopy was also performed. A good correlation was found between the trypan blue assay and the MTT test, as determined by spectrophotometry. There was no 'overestimation' of cell viability as measured by the trypan blue test. The monitoring of formazan formation by light microscopy was feasible, but not very reliable since it did not show a good correlation with findings determined by spectrophotometry. The apoptosis test failed to show good correlation with other tests. Distilled water had no relevant cytotoxic effect, while chlorhexidine cetrimide (HAC 3. 5 %), chloramine 0. 5 % and <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> <b>iodine</b> (PVP-I) > or = 0. 05 % damaged a large majority of cells. PVP-I at a concentration of > or = 5 % was found to be the most effective CTA. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} of rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax embryos was evaluated after treating fertilized eggs with tannic acid (150, 300, 600, or 1, 200 mg/L) in suspension for 10 min to remove adhesiveness or treating them with calcium hypochlorite (25, 50, 75, or 100 mg/L), <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> <b>iodine</b> (PVP-I; 25, 50, 75, or 100 mg/L), or hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2); 500, 1, 000, 1, 500, or 2, 000 mu L/L) for 15 min to achieve surface disinfection. Nonlethal concentrations of egg disinfectants were also evaluated for their germicidal effects by culturing disinfected eggs in sterile Bacto Tryptic Soy Broth. The hatching {{success of the}} eggs treated with tannic acid (at all concentrations) was not {{different from that of}} the controls. Disinfecting eggs with H(2) O(2) (all doses) and low doses of calcium hypochlorite (25 - 75 mg/L) or PVP-I (25 mg/L) did not reduce embryo survival, but exposure to calcium hypochlorite and PVP-I at higher concentrations (100 mg/L and 50, 75, or 100 mg/L, respectively) was lethal. In the first disinfection trial both H(2) O(2) and PVP-I (25 mg/L) prevented bacterial growth, but only H(2) O(2) at 2, 000 mu L/L did so in the second trial...|$|E
40|$|Vaginal douching with <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> <b>iodine</b> (PVP-I) during {{pregnancy}} results in maternal iodine overload {{and increases the}} iodine content of amniotic fluid. We evaluated the possible effects of this therapy on the thyroid of the fetus by investigating 62 women with a mean duration of amenorrhea of 20 weeks who solicited controlled abortion. Nineteen of them douched daily with PVP-I for 7 consecutive days before abortion (treated group). The other 43 women were not treated (control group). In both groups the iodine content was determined in the fetal thyroid and in amniotic fluid and maternal urine {{at the time of}} abortion. In addition, in the treated group the concentrations of iodine were also determined in amniotic fluid and urine before therapy and in urine after 4 days of therapy. There were no differences in the concentrations of iodine in urine and amniotic fluid in the control group and in the treated group before therapy. In the treated group urinary iodine increased from 6. 1 +/- (SEM) 0. 8 micrograms/dl before therapy to 91 +/- 20 micrograms/dl after 4 days and to 153 +/- 60 micrograms/dl after 7 days of therapy (p less than 0. 001). In parallel, iodine in amniotic fluid increased from 1. 2 +/- 0. 2 micrograms/dl before therapy to 3. 7 +/- 1. 3 micrograms/dl after 7 days (p less than 0. 05). In both groups the iodine content of the fetal thyroid increased with gestational age. However, it increased more rapidly in the treated group (from 1 to 7. 7 micrograms) than in the control group (from 1 to 2. 5 micrograms), p less than 0. 05.
