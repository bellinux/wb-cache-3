40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to empirically test the {{endogenous}} money hypothesis for the Eurozone. Based on data on loans to <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>deposits,</b> monetary aggregates, prices and GDP we use three empirical approaches to test the hypothesis: (i) moving correlation; (ii) Granger causality tests and (iii) original framework for the analysis based on the structural VAR model. The empirical results confirm our main hypothesis on the endogeneity of money in the Eurozone as they show that the commonly accepted neoclassical relations between monetary variables, inflation and economic activity are reversed in case of Eurozone and that the direction of influence goes from loans to deposits and from real sector of the economy towards the monetary sector. The basic conclusion from carried out research is that ECB should implement measures directly aimed at stimulation of domestic demand (monetary-supported tax cut) ...|$|E
30|$|The error {{correction}} mechanism (ECM) {{is used to}} verify the short-run relationship between credit to <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>deposits,</b> monetary mass (M 2) and economic growth (GDP). The rule {{for the existence of}} a short-run relationship between financial development and economic growth is that the coefficient of the {{error correction}} term should be negative and it should be significant. Our results above confirms this, thus we can conclude that the there is a return to equilibrium in case of disequilibrium at a rate of adjustment of 80.5 %. This implies 80.5 % of errors of previous year are corrected within the current year. The divergence of results in the short-run and long-run equilibrium explains the fragility of the financial system of Cameroon. The system cannot quickly adjust to shocks in the short-run, this is principally due to the dominance of the banking sector which is over liquid and information efficiency is very low in the system. The financial system is made up of the Douala stock exchange which is still at its embryonic stage (Piabuo et al. 2015) with very low capitalization and few listed firms, thus limiting short-run adjustments. The underdeveloped nature of the financial system is equally characterized by high information asymmetry which limits the effective financing of the private sector by banks thus reducing short run benefits to the economy.|$|E
40|$|The {{economy in}} Kosovo {{continues}} to generate macroeconomic growth and solid stability, especially in fiscal and financial terms. Despite the increasing risks from the external sector, Kosovo’s economy has marked positive growth rates in 2012 also. Nevertheless, being an open economy, {{it has not}} been spared {{of the effects of the}} crisis faced direly by some of the most developed countries, and especially those in the Eurozone, which have shrinked the growth rate in comparison to previous years, despite it being positive. These risks mainly are reflected into the adverse impacts of the crisis on external demand for Kosovo products (along with an already low export rate), and by a lighter impact on migrant remittances, and a stronger impact on foreign direct investment. The decline in remittances has been smaller than forecasted, mainly because migration in Kosovo is of longer term in nature, and 70 % of our migrants possess foreign citizenships. The banking sector has remained solid, with <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>deposits</b> and loans continuing to increase in 2009 and 2010. There is still evidence though, that banks have become more prudent in extending loans, mainly due to the fact that bad loans are increasing at a slow pace. Adverse impacts of the global financial crisis have been compensated by an expansionist fiscal policy adopted by the Government, thereby ensuring medium growth rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} {{automated teller machine}} (ATM) as a major payment system has redefined banking services both in Nigeria and internationally. This paper evaluates the impact ATM on the banking service delivery in Nigeria using descriptive and regression analyses {{on the value of}} ATM transactions and customer deposit series for the sample period ranging from January 2009 to December 2013. The results of descriptive statistics show that <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> saving <b>deposits</b> and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> demand <b>deposit</b> series are normally distributed but the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> time <b>deposits</b> and the value of ATM transaction are not normally distributed. The results of the ADF unit root tests show that the levels of the variables contain unit roots whereas their first differences do not contain unit roots. The regression results indicate that ATM transactions positively and significantly impacts <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> demand <b>deposits</b> in Nigeria but not <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> savings <b>deposits</b> and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> time <b>deposits.</b> It is recommended that the monetary authorities and commercial bank enlighten the depositors on the usage of ATM machine through mass media such as, television, bill board and radio as well as paste directive posters at every ATM centres across the country...|$|R

30|$|We break {{financial}} development {{into the}} various proxies, which are credit to <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> (CRD), bank <b>deposits</b> (BDP) and money supply (M 2).|$|R
30|$|Previous {{research}} had indicated {{the use of}} credit to <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> and bank <b>deposits,</b> separately, as percentages of GDP, as measures of financial development. This study recognises that these measures may be limited to accessibility to formal financial services. This study then goes further to include quasi money (M 2) or money supply {{as a measure of}} financial development, in addition to the previously known measures to have a better view of remittance effects on various proxies of financial development. This stems from the argument that the financial structure of African countries is considered under developed. The inclusion of money supply serves a greater purpose, as it creates a wider bracket for financial inclusion as compared to only having credit to <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> and bank <b>deposits</b> as measures of financial development. Again we include the quasi money (M 2) to find out if it may behave differently from the other proxies of financial development. From the foregoing, our study then hypothesizes that, migrants remittances are thus very likely to promote the availability of credit financing to the <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> increase <b>deposits</b> and money supply severally as measures of financial development in Africa.|$|R

30|$|Mexico {{is not the}} exception. Although {{the country}} began to liberalize the {{financial}} sector in the late 1980 s, its intermediaries are still underdeveloped (De la Torre et al. 2012; Jiménez and Manuelito 2011). In the finance and growth literature, banking sector depth is measured mostly by bank credit to the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> and <b>deposit</b> money bank assets {{as a percentage of}} gross domestic product (GDP) (King and Levine 1993 a, b). Accordingly, in 1961 in Mexico the value of the first indicator was 20.49  % and of the second 21.21  %; whereas 50  years later bank credit to the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> went down to 18.26  %, bank assets increased to 33.93  % (Global Financial Development Database 2013). Financial depth of Mexican banks is even worse than that of smaller economies such as Guatemala and Colombia. For instance, in 1961 their <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> bank credit as a percentage of GDP was 10.07 and 20.15, respectively, and in 2011 the values went up to 22.58 and 31.97. The same story repeats for bank assets: 10.20 and 20.50  % in 1961, and 35.15 and 39.78  % in 2011 (Global Financial Development Database 2013).|$|R
30|$|The paper {{seeks to}} {{establish}} {{whether or not}} remittances promoted financial developments and explore the traceable causality between remittances and financial developments in some countries in Africa. We examine the association between remittances received and how they affect the availability of credit to <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> bank <b>deposits</b> intermediated by financial institutions and money supply. We also question whether the development in the financial sector causes higher levels or otherwise of remittances received. This paper uses data on remittance flows to 50 developing countries in Africa from 1990 to 2011 to explore the nexus. The study uses fixed effects and random effect estimations as well as Vector Error Correction Model method on the panel data. The study shows that remittances promote certain aspects of financial development to some extent and better financial system foster receipts of remittances. The effect of causality {{is seen in the}} short run and not in the long-run. The study alludes to literature that remittances could promote financial development in the short run and the development of the financial sector helps increase the propensity to remit via formal channels.|$|R

To practice and policy, there seems to be a recent surge in the adoption of money transfer systems by various financial institutions.

30|$|The {{findings}} generally {{indicated that}} remittances positively and significantly influence {{certain aspects of}} financial development such as bank deposits and money supply, leaving out the eligibility to acquire credit from banks in Africa. However, these remittances received however did not promote financial development in the long-run. This scenario is real since remittances are basically used for survival purposes by the recipient. In line with some previous studies, remittances could be primarily purposed for meeting basic needs such as education, clothing, housing and entrepreneurial ventures etc. by the recipients or the migrants’ home countries. These uses of remittances are not promoters of immediate or contemporaneous development of financial development, particularly using credit to <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> and bank <b>deposits,</b> all percentages of GDP and as proxies of financial development. This {{is due to the}} fact that remittances received are not long left with financial institutions but for other purposes.|$|R
40|$|The {{symbiotic}} relationship between adequate funds to real sector {{and speed of}} economic growth is not in contention. Consequently, the successive Nigerian governments have made several policy attempts {{in the last three}} decades at ensuring that funds are channeled to savings deficits. These efforts notwithstanding, the economy at a glance, seems not to have made remarkable progress. What is more, there is dearth of empirical studies specifically targeted at assessing the specific contribution of financial intermediation to economic growth in Nigeria. It is this gap that this study sought to fill. To realize the goal of this study, we adopted Private Investment (PRIVET) as the regressand and Financial Savings as a ratio of Real Gross Domestic Product (FS/RGDP), Credit Extended to <b>Private</b> <b>Sector</b> by <b>deposit</b> money banks (CEPS), Prime Lending Rate (PLR) & Real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP) as the regressors. The study employed econometric method to construct a multiple regression model to analyze the long-run relationships among variables. The results showed that three out of the five coefficients are statistically significant at 5 % level. CEPS and PLR conformed to the theoretically expected signs, while FS/RGDP, RGDP and DUM did not. Hetroscedasticity test carried out suggests that OLS assumption of constant variances over time was not violated. Ramsey Reset test indicates that the model is well specified.

Regression model has been stipulated with the consideration of special economic circumstances prevailing in Iran. Currency ratio (circulating currency to total <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> bank <b>deposits</b> ratio) has been considered as a function of economic development (per capita income), inflation rate, the degree of urbanization (a measure of the development of financial institutions) and private consumption expenditures. Government expenditures to GDP ratio (a measure of government economic interventions), import tax burden, direct tax burden, social security tax burden and black market foreign exchange rate have been also considered as the indicators and variables reflecting underground economy. The model has been estimated by using an auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) method and the results are indicative of a high volume of such activities within the frameworks of the economy of Iran. The mean size of underground economy has been 27. 76 percent of GDP during the period of study. Out of all the factors creating the underground economy, the size of government fraction of economy has had the greatest effect and social insurance burden has had the smallest one. Although the increase in insurance burden is in itself a factor in the creation of underground economy, in its turn has a striking negative impact on the performance and stability of social insurance funds. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the role of implicit deposit insurance in North Cyprus Banking Sector during the period 1984 - 2002. Design/methodology/approach – A multivariate logit model is an empirical methodology that identifies the probability of bank failure. The model links the probability of banking problems to a set of bank-specific factors, macro-environment and structural weaknesses that may have exacerbated the internal troubles of the financial institutions. Findings – The empirical findings suggest that in addition to the microeconomic variables, high credit expansion to <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> implicit <b>deposit</b> insurance, existence of economic rehabilitation programmed, financial liberalization, weak regulation and supervision played an important role in the escalation of the 2000 - 2002 banking distress in North Cyprus. Research limitations/implications – For further research, this paper may extend the time period and include other macroeconomic variables such as inflation, exchange pressure that may have a direct effect on bank failure in North Cyprus. Practical implications – This paper presents a practical application of the deposit insurance policy as a main determinant of bank failure, which would help bank examiners, investors and regulators in their decisions to alert management in time, to prevent bank failure. The ability for early detection of any structural or financial weaknesses in the country will help to minimize financial costs of the island that brought about by financial instability. Originality/value – Overall, the empirical results that are obtained by logit model analysis are quite robust. The logit regression results reveal that the predicted values, i. e. the potential risk levels for Mediterranean Bank was very high in this analysis. Towards 2005 Mediterranean Bank had to close, which prove that the model is robust. Banks, business failures, Cyprus, Insurance, Regulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{operations}} and discusses {{the effectiveness of}} public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> provision of solid waste collection in Kampala, Uganda. Household {{data suggest that the}} <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> is more effective than the public <b>sector.</b> <b>Private</b> <b>sector</b> companies provide services like container provision and providing timely and fixed collection time tables. Contrary to popular perception, fees charged by private companies are moderate. Public sector clients are charged fees even when the service is supposed to be free. Clients of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> providers are more satisfied than those of public sector providers. It is however, revealed that while public sector serve mainly the low incomes, the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> serves mainly the rich. In spite of these notable differences, clients of both public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> perceive the problem of solid waste management (SWM) in Kampala to be very serious. The effectiveness of public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> operations in solid waste collection in Kampala is hampered by corruption and lack of transparency. Given the situation of open competition for clients involving both public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in Kampala, it is possible the public sector can operate effectively if they start commercial services officially like their <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> counterparts.

The public sector is playing a leading role of purchaser (buyer) on behalf of citi-zens through subsidies and/or user charges, whiles the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> is taking on an increasing role as provider (seller) of public services, and being regulated by the public sector to correct market failures associated with ‗public good‘ nature of solid waste service. It is believed that <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> involvement is a way to maintain market discipline and to bring <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> management and technical expertise and private finance into public service to achieve cost efficiency and better service provision (improve service quality) (Cointreau, 1994; Bartone, 2001; van Dijk, 2008 b). Even though <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> involvement (PSI) provides opportunities for improved efficiency and service quality, the few studies on PSI in solid waste management in developing countries did not explore the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> performance to ascertain the expected gains and the factors influencing efficiency and service quality at the firm level.
