5|$|During {{development}} {{and construction of}} the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra <b>pilings</b> to be driven into the bedrock to support the added weight, {{the cost of the}} bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500million.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test <b>pilings</b> into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test <b>pilings</b> for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E
5|$|In {{both their}} native and {{introduced}} ranges, C.mutica are also synanthropic, being found abundantly in fouling communities in artificial structures like submerged ropes, fishing nets, <b>pilings,</b> docks, buoys, aquaculture equipment, oil rig platforms, ship hulls, and even offshore wind farms. In their introduced ranges (particularly in Europe), they are primarily and even exclusively found inhabiting artificial structures.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. They inhabit the splash zone on rocky shores, jetties and <b>pilings,</b> may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on <b>pilings</b> to protect against storm surges.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was {{appointed}} {{to carry out the}} rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel <b>pilings</b> and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|E
5|$|In St. Tammany Parish, the storm's {{effects were}} mainly limited to wind damage: gusts reached 48mph (77km/h), {{knocking}} down trees and power lines. A storm surge of 4.3ft (1.3m) flooded 20 {{homes in the}} parish. Winds in Jefferson Parish gusted up to 55mph (88km/h), causing minor roof damage and power outages. In Orleans Parish, a storm surge of 5.81ft (1.77m) destroyed 85 fishing camps constructed on wooden <b>pilings.</b> Winds gusting up to 68mph (109km/h) left 80,000 residences without power in the parish. Throughout the state, a total of 160,000 homes and businesses lost power due to the hurricane. Georges is blamed for three indirect fatalities; two men collapsed and died due to medical conditions aggravated by {{the stress of the}} evacuation, and another died {{as the result of a}} house fire sparked by an emergency candle that was tipped over. Damages from the storm totaled approximately $30.1million.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} of the roundabouts to reach {{operational}} status were those at Point Pleasant Road and Durand Boulevard. The Point Pleasant Road roundabout opened to traffic on September8, 2009, by which time the Durand Boulevard roundabout was also ready for use. The Titus Avenue roundabout was completed in late 2009, while work on the Seneca Road junction was delayed until October 2009 due to {{the proximity of the}} intersection {{to the side of the}} hill overlooking Irondequoit Bay. Although the original plans for the project had already accounted for the issue, the plans had to be revised to comply with new federal standards regarding the use of steel <b>pilings</b> for supporting the hillside. Work on the roundabout finally began on October12. The Seneca Road roundabout and the new alignment of Sea Breeze Drive north of Durand Boulevard were completed in the first half of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{and water}} damage across the Outer Banks was extensive. Strong waves and {{the storm surge}} from Hurricane Isabel knocked about 30 to 40 houses and several motels off of their <b>pilings.</b> Two {{families}} who did not evacuate were nearly swept out to sea when their home was destroyed. Local rescue was unable to reach them; however, they were ultimately able to reach safety. The rough waves greatly affected piers in Nags Head, Rodanthe, and Frisco, with three being completely destroyed. Several locations along North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris, and 15foot (4.5m) sections of pavement {{on both sides of}} a bridge near Ocracoke were washed away. Strong waves destroyed a beach access ramp, as well. Several thousand homes and businesses were damaged by the passage of the hurricane, and damage in Dare County totalled nearly $350million (2003USD, ($ USD)). In the Outer Banks, no deaths or injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|With its {{location}} {{close to the}} storm's center, Dauphin Island saw the greatest damage in Alabama. Access to the island was shut down during and immediately after the hurricane, slowing the progression of damage assessments. Additionally, the storm cut power and phone services. Post-storm surveys revealed discernible patterns in structural damage on the island; these included a nearly complete lack of destruction on the heavily wooded eastern end, and damage concentrated closer to the western side and along areas exposed to strong easterly winds. First-hand accounts relayed that in the most severe cases, entire elevated homes were torn from their <b>pilings</b> and swept into the Gulf of Mexico. The number of homes demolished in that manner was informally placed at 50, though such total building collapses were typically confined to poorly secured buildings. In total, the hurricane destroyed 190 residences on Dauphin Island, accounting for nearly 25% of all homes, and a further 235 sustained substantial damage. An unofficial and early estimate of losses on the island was $30 million.|$|E
5|$|The next {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} {{at the site}} was an 860-foot (262-meter) steel girder bridge, the third to be named for Cullen. Its first span opened in 1965, and it was widened by the addition in 1976 of a second span slightly {{to the west of}} the first one, the newer span carrying southbound traffic while the older span became one-way northbound. When the first span opened in 1965, the inlet was 23 feet (7 meters) deep, but inlet currents led to scouring of the piers of the bridge, first noticed in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, scouring was severe enough to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divers to swim beneath one of the span's concrete footings. The Corps installed protective riprap around the bridge piers in 1989, but this was only a temporary solution; realizing that the bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm, Delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement. Scouring had increased the inlet's depth to over 100 feet (30 meters) by 1999, leading the Corps of Engineers and Delaware officials to question the stability of the <b>pilings</b> and their protective riprap. By 2005, various reports gave the bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013. By 2007, the bridge carried 14,000 cars on an average day and an average of 28,000 cars per day during the summer months, and the disruption to traffic if the bridge had to be closed before a replacement could open was of increasing concern.|$|E

25|$|While {{creosote}} treated wood is {{no longer}} used {{in the building of}} structures and piers, old broken down piers still could contain these creosote preservatives. Many properties contain piers that were built before 2008 with creosote preservatives, and now remain in the water even if they are broken down. One simple remedy for this would be removing the <b>pilings</b> after they are broken down or are no longer in use. On the coast, after storms pass through, debris and wreckage breaks piers that are built on the water. One of the harder remedies is for <b>pilings</b> that have sunk {{to the bottom of the}} water and settled on the sediment. These <b>pilings</b> are not visible and are harder to detect. The <b>pilings</b> will then sit on the bottom and leach chemicals out into the sediment and ecosystem. A solution to the problem of hidden <b>pilings</b> could be an analytical method or technique that could be used to track creosote compounds or byproducts in situ (the original place of contamination). If there was a technique that could be used out in the field that could trace higher concentrations of the chemical in the sediment, then hidden <b>pilings</b> could be isolated and removed from the environment. Many methods, such as gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), have been used to identify creosote preservatives in the ground water and sediment, but most methods must be taken back to the lab in order to be properly conducted due to the run time and size of the instrument. New studies have shown that the use of smaller, more user friendly bio-assays are available to researchers so they can be used in the field for faster identification of chemical compounds. A test that could identify creosote compounds or other toxic byproducts quickly and efficiently in the field would allow researchers to remove contaminated <b>pilings</b> before further damage can be done.|$|E
25|$|The Exploratorium at Pier 15 was {{designed}} by architecture firm EHDD. Nibbi Brothers served as the General Contractor, and AGA (Architectural Glass and Aluminum) as the Glazing Contractor. The piers had been neglected for decades {{leading up to the}} Exploratorium’s move, and extensive renovation and repair was required. Nearly two thirds of the <b>pilings</b> under Pier 15 were repaired, including almost every piling needed to provide structural integrity, and new <b>pilings</b> were sunk. The removal of the parking lot between the piers was done slowly over the two years of construction, and the debris from the removal was captured and recycled. Several <b>pilings</b> were left in the water between the piers, both for aesthetic reasons and to support future exhibits.|$|E
25|$|Though faint, the island's <b>pilings</b> and outline {{can still}} be seen from space, via Google Earth and Google Maps, and from Yahoo Maps.|$|E
25|$|The {{light was}} {{converted}} to solar power in 1991 and upgraded in 1995. The remaining <b>pilings</b> {{from a previous}} lighthouse are still present next to the current one.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pilings</b> sit {{in about}} 5–10 {{feet of water}} and extend about 5–10 feet above the water, {{depending}} on the tide. The <b>pilings</b> and the island's outline shape are clearly visible from the Julia Tuttle Causeway {{as well as from}} many of the tall buildings that overlook the bay. They present a clear hazard to boat navigation and the interior of the island is a peaceful place that remains free of boat and jet ski traffic for kayakers, dolphin, manatee, sting rays, manta rays, and many types of fish.|$|E
25|$|Hurricane {{damage and}} {{economic}} collapse caused {{the project to}} be abandoned shortly {{after the start of}} construction, but <b>pilings</b> remain visible in the bay and are a hazard to navigation.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} {{was built on}} landfill; the original marshland still surrounds it. The building foundations extend down to bedrock through 50,000 <b>pilings,</b> but the land surrounding Co-op's structures settles and sinks {{a fraction of an}} inch each year, creating cracks in sidewalks and entrances to buildings.|$|E
25|$|A {{foundation}} of <b>pilings</b> and heavy timbers {{were built in}} Lake Michigan, at the north-east corner of the exposition grounds. The sides of Illinois were constructed of brick, plastered with cement. The hull structure was carefully constructed to match the contour of the Indiana-class warships.|$|E
25|$|Bouchot culture: Intertidal growth technique, or bouchot technique: <b>pilings,</b> {{known in}} French as bouchots, are planted at sea; ropes, {{on which the}} mussels grow, are tied in a spiral on the pilings; some mesh netting {{prevents}} the mussels from falling away. This method needs an extended tidal zone.|$|E
25|$|From the {{contamination}} of the sediment, more of the ecosystem is effected. Organisms in the sediment are now exposed to the new chemicals. Organisms are then ingested by fish and other aquatic animals. These animals now contain concentrations of hazardous chemicals which were secreted from the creosote. Other issues with ecosystems include bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation occurs when high levels of chemicals are passed to aquatic life near the creosote <b>pilings.</b> Mollusks and other smaller crustaceans are at higher risk because they are directly attached {{to the surface of}} wood <b>pilings</b> that are filled with creosote preservative. Studies show that mollusks in these environments take on high concentrations of chemical compounds which will then be transferred through the ecosystem's food chain. Bioaccumulation contributes to the higher concentrations of chemicals within the organisms in the aquatic ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Ground-breaking {{began in}} March 2012. Initially, the tunnel was {{estimated}} at $38 million, but this was revised to a cost of $82.5 million. It was expected to take 25 months to complete but eventually took 40 to complete. Tunnelling contractor Technicore Underground, Inc. {{had to deal with}} left over metal <b>pilings</b> from the 1930s tunnel project and contaminated soil. The <b>pilings</b> themselves were not a surprise, their details being in the TPA archives, but the <b>pilings</b> had fractured much of the rock in the tunnel area, meaning that the strength of the rock around the tunnel area was weaker and needed extra shoring up. There was also a dispute over payments and Technicore filed a $10 million lien against the project alleging unpaid work. To deal with the delays, the contractor applied for an exemption from the city's noise bylaw to work around the clock. Its application for round-the-clock work was denied, but it was allowed to work longer hours until 11 PM. The Toronto Port Authority announced that the project would be complete during the winter of 2014/2015 and blamed the delay on the winter of 2013/2014 being colder than in previous years and ice build-up slowed progress. The agency announced a further delay to the late spring of 2015. The project finally opened on July 30, 2015.|$|E
25|$|The geology of the site, {{a former}} farmer's field on a slight slope, {{with a heavy}} clay soil that is subject to {{seasonal}} movements when wet, meant that substantial foundations and drainage had to be constructed. The main support for the above ground structures consists of 210 concrete piles extending vertically downwards into the soil, each up to 7 metres deep. These <b>pilings</b> were engineered in June 2009 by a specialist company, Wig-Palen, from Belgium, using a 62-ton machine to drill and compact the required holes. Concrete was then poured into the hollow drill {{to fill the void}} as the drill was extracted, and steel reinforcement cages were then placed into the still-wet concrete. This screw-piling technique ensured that the cemetery foundations were both end-bearing and friction-bearing in nature, increasing the stability of the <b>pilings</b> and the structures they support.|$|E
25|$|Stiltsville is a {{group of}} wood stilt houses located one mile south of Cape Florida on sand banks of the Safety Valve on the edge of Biscayne Bay in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The {{structures}} stand on wood or reinforced concrete <b>pilings,</b> generally ten feet above the shallow water which varies from one to three feet deep at low tide.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{creosote}} is pressurized {{into the}} wood, {{the release of}} the chemical can be seen from many different events. During the lifetime of the marine piling, weathering occurs from tides and water flow which slowly opens the oily outer coating and exposes the smaller internal pores to more water flow. Frequent weathering occurs daily, but more severe weather, such as hurricanes, can cause damage or losening of the wooden <b>pilings.</b> Many <b>pilings</b> are either broken into pieces from debris, or are completely washed away during these storms. When the <b>pilings</b> are washed away, they come to settle {{on the bottom of the}} body of water where they reside, and then they secrete chemicals into the water slowly over a long period of time. This long term secretion is not normally noticed because the piling is submerged beneath the surface hidden from sight. The creosote is mostly insoluble in water, but the lower molecular weight compounds will become soluble the longer the broken wood is exposed to the water. In this case, some of the chemicals now become water-soluble and further leach into the aquatic sediment while the rest of the insoluble chemicals remain together in a tar-like substance. Another source of damage comes from insects such as Shipworms and Limnoria. Though creosote is used as a pesticide preservative, studies have shown that Limnoria is resistant to wood preservative pesticides and can cause small holes in the wood which creosote can then be secreted from.|$|E
25|$|When the Tarpon Inn was rebuilt in 1923, {{many of the}} new <b>pilings</b> {{were placed}} in concrete, with the ends {{extending}} up through the entire structure and into the attic. Because the Tarpon Inn was built with impressive reinforcements and a protected shelter, it has housed many residents during storms and has served as headquarters for the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and military units.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{were made}} to move Illinois seven miles (11km) north to the {{waterfront}} {{at the foot of}} Van Buren street, upon completion of the exposition. After the move, the Illinois was to serve as the headquarters for the newly formed Illinois Naval Militia. Despite skepticism that moving her was feasible, some foundation <b>pilings</b> were reportedly laid down at the new location starting 13 June 1894.|$|E
25|$|In North Belfast, several British Army patrols were {{harassed by}} gunfire and a bomb was thrown at an RUC base. An {{armoured}} vehicle {{was set on}} fire in Ardoyne, according to republican sources. Another one was burnt-out on Antrim Road. Late that evening in the Oldpark area, an RUC Land Rover became stuck in a barricade made of iron <b>pilings</b> and its crew had to flee when it was attacked with petrol bombs.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} rebuilt, but never regained the {{popularity}} of its early years. Hurricane Donna in 1960 damaged most of the structures in Stiltsville, including the Quarterdeck Club, then the building was completely destroyed by a fire in 1961 that burned {{all the way to}} the <b>pilings.</b> The rumor was that the owner's wife set fire to the club after a jealous fit. Karl Mongelluzzo, the last owner of the Quarterdeck Club, was denied a building permit in 1967.|$|E
25|$|The George Hyman Construction Company of Bethesda, Maryland, was {{the general}} {{contractor}} on the Washington Harbour construction project. Structural engineer Zivan Cohen of the firm Tadjer-Cohen-Edelson and landscape architect James Urban also worked on the complex.

25|$|To {{attempt to}} reduce {{the effect of the}} Bushes Wind, the course was narrowed and pushed further to the centre of the river. The width was 135 feet in 1887, in 120 feet in 1888 and then {{progressively}} until by 1914 it was down to 100 feet at the start tapering to 80 feet at the finish. In 1899, floating booms secured between the <b>pilings</b> which mark the course were also introduced along part of its length in an attempt to keep spectators from obstructing races.|$|E
