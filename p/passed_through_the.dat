5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea.

Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{there was}} a timbering {{industry}} in the watershed of Big Wapwallopen Creek. It {{was carried out by}} J.C. Patterson. However, the timbering was completed by the 1870s on several properties. In the early 1900s, the main industry in the watershed of Big Wapwallopen Creek was agriculture. However, the creek's main stem and Crystal Lake were used as a water supply by the Spring Brook Water Supply Company. A small hydroelectric plant and several mills operated in the lower reaches of the creek. In the early 1900s, the main population centers in the watershed included Wapwallopen, Hobbie, and Briggsville. Their populations were 450, 113, and 60, respectively. The Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey historically <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> upper part of the creek's watershed and the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway also <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> creek's drainage basin. The Albert Methodist Church was moved from the Powder Glen near Wapwallopen in the early 1900s and dedicated in 1927.|$|E
