Evaluate characteristics and {{risk factors for}} patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Study Design. Retrospective case series. Setting. Tertiary care center. Patients and Methods. Chart review of patients with cSCC undergoing a parotidectomy (2003 - 2012). Results. Of 218 patients identified, 49 % presented with a new primary lesion (n = 107) and 51 % with a recurrence (n = 111). Parotid lymph nodes were positive in 52 % of patients; 81 % had a concurrent neck dissection, and 28 % had cervical lymph node metastases. In 18 % of patients, both parotid and cervical nodes were positive, while 44 % were both parotid and cervical node negative; 33 % had positive parotid and negative cervical nodes, and only 5 % had negative parotid and positive cervical nodes. The overall 2 - and 5 -year survival rates were 0. 71 and 0. 58. Overall 5 -year survival was lower for patients presenting with recurrent (0. 49) versus new primary disease (0. 69; P =. 04). In addition, decreased overall 5 -year survival rates were associated with cervical lymph node involvement (0. 47 vs. 0. 62; P =. 01). There {{was no difference in}} overall survival when stratified by <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement (P =. 85), margin status (P =. 67), perineural invasion (P =. 42), facial nerve sacrifice (P =. 92), or type of parotid operation performed (P =. 51). Conclusions. In this study, cervical, but not <b>parotid,</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement was associated with poor outcomes in patients with advanced cSCC requiring a parotidectomy.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research presented here were twofold: to study the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) in cattle {{and to develop a}} strategy for intranasal immunization that would induce a strong mucosal and systemic immune response to a soluble antigen. ^ The NALT of cattle was compared with Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s patches and with <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> in terms of lymphocyte populations and expression of adhesion molecules by flow cytometry, the expression of vascular addressins using immunofluorescence, and the expression of cytokine mRNA by a semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The NALT was found to be structurally more similar to Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s patches than <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> having similar numbers of B cells, T cell subsets, and activated and memory CD 4 + cells. However, in regard to expression of homing receptors (L-selectin and α 4 β 7 integrin) and vascular addressins (PNAd and MAdCAM- 1), NALT CD 4 + cells were more similar to <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> than to Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s patches. The results indicate that NALT and Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s patches, both part of the common mucosal immune system, probably utilize different homing receptors and vascular addressins in lymphocyte migration to these mucosal sites. NALT CD 4 + cells expressed a broader range of homing receptors {{and are more likely to}} migrate to a greater variety of tissues. In terms of cytokine mRNA expression, no differences in interleukin (IL) 4, IL- 10, and interferon gamma expression were observed in the NALT, Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s patches, and <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> These cytokines were also expressed in freshly isolated cells from these tissues, indicated a lack of polarization towards a T helper 1 (Th 1) or Th 2 cytokines. ^ The results of three intranasal immunization studies in cattle indicate that it is possible to induce strong mucosal and systemic immune responses by intranasal administration of soluble antigens in cattle. The best results were obtained with antigen incorporated into alginate microparticies, with high levels of IgG 1 in the serum, nasal secretions, and to a lesser extent in saliva. The fact that most microparticles were less than 5 μm in diameter, which facilitated their uptake in the NALT, and the inherent adjuvanticity of the alginate may have contributed to the development of a strong humoral immune response. However, a vaccine formulation consisting of antigen adsorbed to 1 μm latex microspheres did not induce an immune response. Cholera toxin was used as an adjuvant in two studies where it was either admixed with or chemically conjugated to the antigen. In these studies, an immune response was observed, but results were not significant and in one study long periods and three immunizations were required before an immune response was detected. With optimization of factors such as the volume and dose of antigen, number and frequency of doses, presence of adjuvants, and technique of intranasal administration, it may be possible to induce strong mucosal and systemic immune response to soluble antigens by intranasal vaccinations. ...|$|E

In the present study, we generated recombinant proteins of RAS- 3 (rRAS- 3), RAS- 4 (rRAS- 4) and RIM 36 (rRIM 36), and assessed their potency as an anti-tick cocktail vaccine in cattle model. RT-PCR analysis showed that RAS- 3, RAS- 4 and RIM 36 transcripts were detected in both adult male and female ticks during feeding. Immunization of cattle with the combination of rRAS- 3, rRAS- 4 and rRIM 36 had raised antibodies against all recombinants and anti-sera had reacted with the molecules from the tick salivary gland extract. Tick infestation challenge demonstrated protective immunity against female ticks, resulting in mortality rates of 39. 5 and 12. 8 % for the vaccinated and control groups, respectively. Moreover, the mortality rate of Theileria parva-infected female ticks was 48. 5 and 10. 8 % in the vaccinated and control group, respectively. In order to evaluate the levels of pathogen transmission capacity by T. parva-infected ticks fed on immunized cattle, the occurrence of T. parva in the bovine <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and peripheral blood was also determined and quantified by real-time PCR.

Increased resistance to S 2308 infection occurred at 12 to 20 weeks in mice vaccinated i. p. with SRB 51 (5 x 10 (8) or 5 x 10 (6) CFU) but occurred at 12 weeks only in mice vaccinated orally with SRB 51 (5 x 10 (8) CFU). Oral SRB 51 vaccination induced lower levels of antibodies to the surface antigens of intact SRB 51 bacteria than did i. p. vaccination. However, neither route of vaccination induced anamnestic antibody responses to the surface antigens of intact S 2308 bacteria after challenge infection of the vaccinated mice with S 2308. Mice vaccinated orally with SRB 51 and challenged with S 2308 at 12 to 20 weeks had lower and less persistent spleen cell proliferation and production of gamma interferon in response to S 2308 and certain immunodominant S 2308 proteins (32 to < or = 18 kDa) than did mice vaccinated i. p. with SRB 51. However, mice vaccinated orally or i. p. with SRB 51 and challenged with S 2308 had similar spleen cell tumor necrosis factor alpha production. These results indicate that oral vaccination of mice with SRB 51 was effective in inducing protective immunity to S 2308 infection, although the immunity was lower and less persistent than that induced by i. p. vaccination. The lower protective immunity induced by oral vaccination may have resulted from lower and less persistent cell-mediated immunity and gamma interferon production in response to S 2308 and S 2308 proteins...|$|E
40|$|About 6 % of all newly {{diagnosed}} malignancies worldwide are cancers {{of the head}} and neck. They account for nearly 5 % of all cancer-related deaths. Surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy as well as combinations of these three are currently regarded as the standard treatment. While high cure rates can be achieved for the early stage disease, cure and survival rates for locoregionally advanced and distant metastatic disease are still disappointing. Thus, the development of new treatment strategies is essential, particularly for the treatment of cancers with metastatic involvement of the lymph nodes. The VX 2 auricle carcinoma of New Zealand White rabbits (NZWR) is an accepted animal model for human head and neck cancers, since both are similar in growth leading to early regional lymph node metastases and subsequent distant metastatic spread. Ozone, 2002 recognized as a biomolecule since it was found to be endogenously produced by human neutrophils, exhibited protective effects in a rat sepsis model when insufflated intraperitoneally as a gas mixture with oxygen. This finding suggests that ozone might have immunemodulatory properties. In vitro, ozone was found to inhibit selectively the growth of human cancer cells. However, until now there are no randomized controlled trials that show a clear therapeutic effect of ozone on cancer disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the effects of an intraperitoneally insufflated O 3 /O 2 gas mixture (O 3 /O 2 -pneumoperitoneum, O 3 /O 2 -PP) on growth of the primary tumour and metastatic spread of the VX 2 auricle cancer in NZWR. Fourteen days after inoculation of a VX 2 tumour cell suspension into the subcutis of the right auricle rabbits were randomized to three experimental groups. The treatment was performed daily for five consecutive days, beginning on day 14 after tumour cell inoculation. Rabbits in Group A (n = 14, O 3 /O 2 group) each day received an intraperitoneally insufflated volume of 80 ml/kg body weight of an O 3 /O 2 gas mixture with an ozone concentration of 50 μg/ml gas mixture. Rabbits in Group B (n = 13, O 2 group) received the same amount of pure oxygen and rabbits in Group C (n = 14, Sham group) were sham-treated. Arterial blood samples were taken on day 14 (prior to initiation of treatment) and on day 19 (after the last treatment) and standard haematological and clinical chemistry blood parameters were measured. O 3 /O 2 -PP significantly increased the 3 -month survival probability (50. 0 %) and the complete remission rate (42. 9 %) compared with sham treatment (7. 1 % 3 -month survival probability and complete remission rate). The 3 -month survival probability (23. 1 %) and complete remission rate (15. 4 %) of the rabbits that received pure medical oxygen were neither significantly different from the sham group nor from the O 3 /O 2 group. All animals with complete remission of the primary tumour had an enlarged sentinel lymph node (<b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node)</b> at the beginning of the treatment period that regressed simultaneously. None of these rabbits had detectable lung metastases at day 90 on computed tomography scans of the thorax. No severe side effects could be detected except for a mild transient body weight loss and a mild leukocytosis pointing to O 3 /O 2 -PP as a relatively safe method. Animals of the O 3 /O 2 group with complete tumour remission were resistant to the tumour cells after reinoculation of the tumour cell suspension. However, when treating these animals with dexamethasone and cyclosporin A, rabbits became susceptible to reinoculation of the tumour again. This indicates a crucial role of the immune system in tumour eradication with subsequent resistance to reimplantation. However, prior to a potential clinical use of the O 3 /O 2 -PP method, further research is essential to clear up the exact mechanisms by which ozone exerts this antitumoural effects. Particularly, further clarification is needed regarding the dose response relationship, evaluation of yet undetected adverse effects and reproducibility of the results of the VX 2 tumour model in other tumour model systems...|$|E

40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and major cause of economic losses in dairy farms. Bovine mastitis caused by strains of S. aureus is a major economically important disease affecting the dairy industry worldwide. S. aureus {{is one of the}} most common udder pathogens that cause either clinical or sub-clinical mammary gland infections. Different treatment regimes have failed to cure S. aureus intramammary infections. Most mastitis vaccination strategies have focused on the enhancement of systemic humoral immunity rather than strengthening local intramammary immunity. Vaccines aimed at enhancing intramammary immunity of dairy cows against S. aureus mastitis have had limited success. Commercially available vaccines show various degrees of success and work in research laboratories with experimental vaccines suggest that in part, the failure of these vaccines lies in the limited antigenic repertoire contained in the vaccine formulations. Moreover, not only does variation in the antigenic composition but also presence of capsular polysaccharide in most pathogenic strains and decreased activity of immune effectors in milk affect the success of vaccines. In addition to these, the ability of S. aureus to attach and internalize into mammary epithelial cells, enables bacteria to escape from the effect of immunity and antibiotics by being hidden in the intracellular niche and thereby causing chronic recurrent intramammary infection. S. aureus also has the ability to become electron-transport-defective and to form slow-growing small colonies that are non haemolytic and less virulent. These small colony variants might hide from the immune surveillance in the intracellular area and revert to the parental strain causing chronic recurrent infections. If immunization targets antigenic molecules that are conserved throughout all pathogenic strains, even the small colony variants can be controlled since the immune system will clear the parental strain which causes lethal infection. Thus, immunization trials should focus on conserved immunogenic antigen molecules among pathogenic strains formulated with an adjuvant and delivered by a route of immunization to induce maximum stimulation of the immune system. Moreover, immunization should focus on inducing Th 1 responses, which is protective against S. aureus mastitis. It has been reported that proteins with glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity might be used as such antigens to induce protection against parasitic and microbial infections. Previous study in our laboratory on mastitis-causing streptococci indicates that GapC proteins of S. uberis and S. dysgalactiae have potential as vaccine antigens to protect dairy cows against mastitis caused by environmental streptococci. Two conserved cell wall associated proteins with iii glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity, GapB and GapC have been identified from S. aureus isolates from bovine intramammary infections. The overall goal of this study was to improve our understanding on intramammary immunity using the GapC and GapB proteins of S. aureus as model antigens for mastitis and to determine the regulation of expression of gapB and gapC genes and their roles in the pathogenesis of bovine S. aureus mastitis. We hypothesized that strengthening local intramammary immunity using GapB and GapC proteins of S. aureus as antigens will protect against bovine S. aureus mastitis. To test this hypothesis we took the approach of using the gapB and gapC genes and constructed plasmids encoding GapB, GapC and GapB::GapC (GapC/B) chimeric proteins. We set six objectives to test our hypothesis using these proteins to enhance the intramammary immunity. In aim 1 we constructed plasmids encoding the GapB, GapC proteins and also constructed a chimeric gene encoding the GapC and GapB proteins as a single entity (GapC/B chimera) as the basis for a multivalent vaccine. In this objective the humoral and cellular immune responses to GapC/B were compared to the responses to the individual proteins alone or in combination in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Our results showed that the GapC/B protein elicited strong humoral and cellular immune responses as judged by the levels of total IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2 a, IL- 4 and IFN-ã secretion and lymphocyte proliferation. These results strongly suggest the potential of this chimeric protein as a target for vaccine production to control mastitis caused by S. aureus. In aim 2 we continued our studies on GapC/B by testing the effects of DNA vaccination with plasmids encoding the individual gapB and gapC genes as well as the gapC/B protein gene with or without a boost with the recombinant proteins. The results showed that DNA vaccination alone was unable to elicit a significant humoral response and barely able to elicit a detectable cell-mediated response to the recombinant antigens but subsequent immunization with the proteins elicited an excellent response. In addition, we found that DNA vaccination using a plasmid encoding the GapC/B chimera followed by a boost with the same protein, although successful, is less effective than priming with plasmids encoding GapB or GapC followed by a boost with the individual antigens. In aim 3 we optimized immune responses in cows by comparing route of vaccination (subcutaneous versus intradermal), site of vaccination (locally at the area drained by the supramammary lymph node versus distantly at area drained by <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Our results showed that both subcutaneous and intradermal immunizations with the GapC/B protein at the area drained by the supramammary and parotid lymph nodes resulted in significantly increased serum and milk titers of total IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2, iv and IgA in all vaccinated groups as compared to placebo. The anti-GapC/B IgG 1 serum and milk titers were significantly higher in all vaccinated group as compared to the placebo group. These results indicated that vaccination at the area drained by the supramammary lymph node resulted in better immune responses. In aim 4 we tested different formulations of the GapC/B antigen with adjuvants such as PCPP, CpG, PCPP + CpG and VSA- 3. We found that the VSA- 3 formulation induced the best immune responses in cows. In this objective we also monitored immune responses longitudinally over one lactation cycle to determine the duration of immune responses by measuring IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2, and IgA on monthly blood and milk samples. We found that the duration of immune responses was about four months. In aim 5 we tested the role of GapC in the virulence of S. aureus mastitis using the S. aureus wild type strain RN 6390 and its isogenic GapC mutant strain H 330. Our results from both in vitro adhesion and invasion assays on MAC- T cells and in vivo infection of ovine mammary glands showed that GapC is an important virulence factor in S. aureus mastitis. In aim 6 we examined the role of sar and agr loci on the expression of gapC and gapB genes by qRT- PCR using S. aureus RN 6390 and its isogenic mutants defective in agrA, sarA and sar/agr (double mutant) at exponential and stationary phases of growth. Our results showed that both gapB and gapC expression were down regulated in the mutant strains, indicating that the expression of the gapB and gapC genes is controlled by the universal virulence gene regulators, agr and sar. We also checked the role of environmental factors such as pH, growth media, and oxygen tension on the expression of gapB and gapC using q-RT-PCR. Our results showed that the expression of gapB and gapC genes in different strains of S. aureus was not consistent under the above-mentioned environmental conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A double {{antibody}} sandwich ELISA {{developed by}} ID-DLO, Lelystad to detect Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infection was used on 329 sheep from four pedigree Suffolk flocks in which clinical cases of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) had occurred. At subsequent necropsy, typical CLA lesions {{were seen in}} 133 sheep, and the diagnosis was confirmed on culture. Lesions were most commonly seen in lungs (n = 46), <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (n = 44), prescapular <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (n = 38) and mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (n = 31). The sensitivity of the ELISA test for detecting culture-positive sheep was 0. 88, while the specificity of the test was 0. 55. The antibody ELISA detected 87. 5 per cent of sheep that had CLA lesions restricted to internal organs only. It was concluded that the ELISA test has a valuable role in detecting sheep with both clinical and subclinical CLA. </p...|$|R
40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} (SCC) arising from odontogenic cyst lining is rare. The exact incidence of carcinoma arising in odontogenic cyst is unknown, {{but it is}} estimated to vary between 1 and 2 / 1000. The pathogenesis is unknown, but a long-standing inflammation and continuous intracystic pressure have been suggested as possible causative factors. Metastasis from these lesions is not common (< 20 %), {{and most of the}} carcinomas are moderately to well differentiated. To qualify as a primary intraosseous carcinoma, there must be no initial connection with the oral mucosa, overlying skin, or antral or nasal mucosa. This paper presents a case of primary intraosseous carcinoma arising from odontogenic keratocyst in the anterior mandible with metastasis to left <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Background: Radiofrequency-induced {{thermotherapy}} {{has shown}} promising {{results in the}} palliative treatment of various tumor entities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of bipolar radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (VTR) on <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (LN) metastases in the VX 2 SCC model. Materials and Methods: Six male New Zealand white rabbits, with palpable metastatic disease within the <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> were treated using the Celon-ProSurge ® probe, needle length 110 mm, diameter of 2. 3 mm. The animals were sacrificed on the 4 th, 8 th, 11 th, 14 th, 18 th and 22 nd postoperative days respectively. Results and Conclusion: Bipolar radiofrequency VTR could prevent progression of local metastatic disease in one-third of the animals compared to the control group of untreated VX 2 carcinoma rabbits. These results encourage further studies, directed at whether this treatment modality could play a role i...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis of <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{is a rare}} condition. Although uncommon, it must be {{included}} in differential diagnosis of a discrete parotid gland swelling or mass. Early recognition of the disease entity and awareness of its potential existence can spare the patient unnecessary surgical intervention. A 13 -year-old female patient presented with a painless swelling in left preauricular region. Ultrasonographic examination showed presence of calcified <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> with central necrosis. Fine needle aspiration cytology showed epitheloid cells, foci of calcification and areas of caseation necrosis suggestive of tuberculosis- Standard antituberculous regimen was planned for 6 months with rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid and pyrazinamide. Patient discontinued the antituberculous regimen after free of clinical symptoms {{at the end of}} the 5 th month. Recurrence of the tuberculosis was seen 2 weeks after the discontinuation of the treatment. Completed retreatment for 8 months and follow-up shown patient free of tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report a}} case of a lymphoepithelioma-like {{carcinoma}} (LELC), which is a variant of carcinoma most commonly involving the nasopharynx and rarely occurring in a variety of sites outside its typical location. METHODS: We present the case of a 79 -year-old Caucasian man with LELC of the lacrimal gland undergoing surgical resection of the mass. RESULTS: The patient had remained disease-free for 2 years, and then he developed homolateral metastases in latero-cervical and <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> detected by computed tomography and confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. He did not receive any surgical treatment, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy because of the advanced stage of the disease and poor health condition. CONCLUSIONS: This case report suggests that a diagnosis of lacrimal gland LELC makes combined early and radical therapy necessary...|$|R

40|$|The <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of {{naive and}} {{previously}} infected Balb/c mice were studied after, respectively, infection and re-infection with cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni via the ears. Schistosomula {{were able to}} pass through the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> by following the lymph flow or by penetrating the veins of the medullary cords. The number of nodal mast cells was higher from day 2 to 6 of primary infection; and from day 5 to 11 of re-infection. The amount of degranulating mast cells was significantly higher at day 4 of infection and at day 1 of re-infection. Eosinophils characterized the nodal inflammatory processes observed after day 5 in both primarily-infected and re-infected mice. However, only in the latter the eosinophils were able to adhere to the larval surface. In primarily-infected mice, no intranodal larva presented signs of degeneration. In contrast, in re-infected animals, some degenerating larvae were found inside eosinophilic infiltrates. The eosinophils reached the nodal tissue by migrating through the high endothelial venules and their collecting veins...|$|R
40|$|Forty-six {{patients}} with malignant melanoma metastatic to cervical or <b>parotid</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> with an unknown primary site were treated at UCLA Medical Center from 1964 through 1991. Treatment consisted of parotidectomy and/or neck dissection {{with or without}} adjuvant therapy. The initial presentation was a cervical mass in 74 % and a parotid mass in 26 % of patients. Metastasis distal to {{the head and neck}} nodal basins developed in 22 % of patients. Involvement of more than four cervical or parotid nodes resulted in a significant increase in distant metastasis (P <. 01). Adjuvant therapy was found to have no significant effect on survival rates. However, age at the time of diagnosis influenced the survival rates. The significance of the improved survival of these patients as compared to those with a known primary melanoma is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A 44 -year-old {{woman with}} a 12 -year history of Sjögren's {{syndrome}} (SS) developed a low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in the parotid gland. Two years later, she presented with generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly and a follicular lymphoma was diagnosed. To investigate {{the relationship of the}} two histologically distinct lymphomas, we re-examined their histology and immunophenotype and studied the lymphomatous tissue from the <b>parotid,</b> cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> and spleen using molecular genetic methods. Histologic and immunophenotypic studies confirmed the previous diagnoses and also identified a previously unnoticed focus of follicular lymphoma in the second parotid gland biopsy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the rearranged Ig heavy-chain gene showed the same sized dominant product in the MALT lymphoma and the follicular lymphoma. Similarly, PCR analysis of the t(14 : 18) translocation yielded an identical sized band from both MALT and follicular lymphoma. Cloning and sequencing of the Ig PCR products showed an identical CDR 3 sequence from each lesion, indicating a common clonal lineage. The follicular lymphoma of the <b>parotid</b> gland <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and the follicular lymphoma of the spleen showed an identical mutation signature to that of the salivary gland MALT lymphoma. We propose that follicular lymphoma in the <b>parotid</b> gland <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> may have resulted from colonization of lymphoid follicles by MALT lymphoma cells, following which the tumor cells were induced to express a follicular lymphoma phenotype, due to Bcl- 2 overexpression caused by t(14; 18), leading to a change in clinical behavior resulting in rapid widespread dissemination of disease. These observations suggest that the distinct phenotypes of low-grade B-cell lymphomas may be the consequence of interplay between genetic and local microenvironmental factors...|$|R
