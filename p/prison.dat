5|$|Clifford's Tower {{played no}} part in the formal design of the <b>prison,</b> {{although}} the talus, or sloping edge of the motte, was cut away and replaced by a retaining wall to allow more space for the new <b>prison</b> building. The backyard of the Female <b>Prison,</b> concealed from public view by the new wall, was used for hangings from 1868 onwards. The <b>Prison</b> Act, 1877, reformed the English <b>prison</b> system, and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year. It {{was used as the}} county <b>prison</b> until 1900, when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield <b>Prison,</b> and from then onwards the facility was used as a military <b>prison</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|Following another Royal Commission {{investigation}} 1911, {{there were}} some rapid changes in <b>prison</b> policy. A new superintendent with outside experience, Hugh Hann, was appointed, {{and supported by the}} newly elected Labor government interested in penal reform. Fremantle <b>Prison</b> was partially used as a military gaol during both world wars. The World War II takeover necessitated the commissioning of Barton's Mill <b>Prison</b> in 1942, which remained opened after the war. Pardelup <b>Prison</b> Farm was another <b>prison</b> outstation established in 1927 to reduce overcrowding at Fremantle. Both facilities were part of reforms made to the <b>prison</b> system, but significant changes to the operation of Fremantle <b>Prison</b> did not begin until the 1960s. Comptroller General Colin Campbell introduced expedient prisoner assessments, officer training, work release programs, and social workers and welfare officers.|$|E

5|$|The Maze <b>Prison</b> escape (known to Irish {{republicans}} as the Great Escape) {{took place on}} 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland.

In the biggest <b>prison</b> escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the <b>prison.</b> One <b>prison</b> officer died of a heart attack as a result of the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the <b>prison.</b> The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into the escape placed most of the blame onto <b>prison</b> staff, who in turn blamed the escape on political interference in the running of the <b>prison.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} department {{in charge of}} the <b>prison</b> underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle <b>Prison</b> was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The <b>prison</b> closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina <b>Prison.</b> Since 1991, the <b>prison</b> has been conserved as a recognised heritage site on state, national, and World Heritage lists, and various restoration works have been undertaken since the 1990s. New uses have been found for various sections of the <b>prison,</b> including a New Business Enterprise Centre in the New Division cell block, and wedding ceremonies in the <b>prison</b> chapels.

5|$|The {{history of}} Fremantle <b>Prison,</b> a former Australian <b>prison</b> in Fremantle, Western Australia, extends from its {{construction}} as a <b>prison</b> for convicts, using convict labour, in the 1850s, through to its modern-day usage {{as a tourist}} attraction. The design for Fremantle <b>Prison</b> {{was based on the}} Pentonville <b>Prison</b> in Britain, and it would be the longest, tallest <b>prison</b> cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and was completed by the end of 1859. The <b>prison</b> was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally sentenced prisoners. Following a Royal Commission held in 1898−99, some changes were made to Fremantle <b>Prison,</b> including knocking down the inner wall between two cells, introducing a prisoner classification system, and constructing internal walls in the main block to create four separate divisions. A new cell block, New Division, was completed in 1907 and occupied in 1908.|$|E
5|$|The <b>prison</b> was {{administered}} by a comptroller general, sheriff, or director, {{responsible for the}} entire convict or <b>prison</b> system in Western Australia, and a superintendent {{in charge of the}} <b>prison</b> itself. <b>Prison</b> officers, known as warders in the 19th century, worked under stringent conditions until they achieved representation through the Western Australian <b>Prison</b> Officers' Union. Convicts were initially of good character as potential future colonists, but less desirable convicts were eventually sent. As a locally-run <b>prison,</b> Fremantle's population was generally short-sentenced white prisoners in the 1890s, with very few Aboriginal prisoners. By the late 20th century, most prisoners were serving longer sentences, a higher proportion of them were violent, and Aboriginal people were over-represented.|$|E
50|$|Physical Conditions: <b>Prisons</b> were overcrowded. The {{government}} {{reported that}} at the end of September 2013, 45,510 prisoners were in <b>prisons</b> designed to hold 41,034 inmates. Prisoners included 3,540 women (held in separate sections of the same facilities as men or in separate facilities). At the end of August, 3,054 minors were in <b>prisons</b> or detention centers (held separately from the adult population). Many <b>prisons</b> were antiquated and offered substandard sanitary conditions, inadequate food, and insufficient medical services. Inadequate heating in some <b>prisons</b> remained a serious problem, and inadequate lighting and ventilation also affected inmates at some <b>prisons.</b> The government reported that access to potable water was limited in several <b>prisons.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the Civil War, Oxford Castle served {{primarily}} {{as the local}} <b>prison.</b> As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging. The <b>prison</b> also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752. For most of the 18th century, the castle <b>prison</b> was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. In the 1770s the <b>prison</b> reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including {{the extent to which}} vermin infested the <b>prison.</b> Partly {{as a result of this}} criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford <b>Prison.</b>|$|E
