5|$|Swedish {{debate about}} America {{remained}} mostly theoretical before the 19th century, since very few Swedes had any personal {{experience of the}} nation. Emigration was illegal and population {{was seen as the}} wealth of nations. However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850, and as population growth outstripped economic development, it gave rise to fears of overpopulation based on the influential <b>population</b> <b>theory</b> of Thomas Malthus. In the 1830s, the laws against emigration were repealed.|$|E
5|$|After eight years, Fetter {{returned}} to academia and finally completed his B.A. in 1891. In 1892, Jeremiah W. Jenks—who had taught Fetter at Indiana University—acquired a teaching position at Cornell University {{at the new}} President White School of History and Political Science and subsequently secured a fellowship for Fetter at that institution. Fetter completed his Master of Philosophy degree the same year. Jenks then convinced Fetter to study, as Jenks himself had, under Johannes Conrad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. Fetter earned his Ph.D. in 1894 from the University of Halle in Germany, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation, a critique of Malthusian <b>population</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
50|$|Trained as an economist, Brandes {{spent much}} of the {{energies}} of his brief life on economic and social questions. The chief objects of Brandes' attack in his 1885 Samfundssporgsmaal were the <b>population</b> <b>theories</b> of Thomas Malthus and theory of value advanced by David Ricardo. Though prominent as a social liberal, Brandes reserved part of Samfundssporgsmaal for a critique of the Marxist movement.|$|R
50|$|The {{roster of}} early urban traditions is notable for its diversity. Excavations at early urban sites show that some cities were sparsely {{populated}} political capitals, others were trade centers, and still other cities had a primarily religious focus. Some cities had large dense populations, whereas others carried out urban {{activities in the}} realms of politics or religion without having large associated <b>populations.</b> <b>Theories</b> that attempt to explain ancient urbanism by a single factor, such as economic benefit, fail to capture the range of variation documented by archaeologists.|$|R

5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's <b>population</b> <b>theory</b> was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E
25|$|In addition, many Russian {{philosophers}} {{could not}} easily apply Malthus’ <b>population</b> <b>theory</b> to Russian {{society in the}} 1840s. In England, where Malthus lived, population was rapidly increasing but suitable agricultural land was limited. Russia, on the other hand, had extensive land with agricultural potential yet a relatively sparse population. It is possible that this discrepancy between Russian and English realities contributed to the rejection of Malthus’ Essay on the Principle of Population by key Russian thinkers.|$|E

In 1758 appeared Wallace's Characteristics of the Present State of Great Britain.

25|$|Malthus {{convinced}} {{most economists}} that even while high fertility might increase the gross output, it tended to reduce output per capita. David Ricardo and Alfred Marshall admired Malthus, and so came under his influence. Early converts to his <b>population</b> <b>theory</b> included William Paley. Despite Malthus's opposition to contraception, his work exercised {{a strong influence}} on Francis Place (1771–1854), whose neo-Malthusian movement became the first to advocate contraception. Place published his Illustrations and Proofs of the Principles of Population in 1822.|$|E
25|$|In June 1957, at {{the fourth}} session of the First National People's Congress, Ma {{presented}} his New <b>Population</b> <b>Theory.</b> Having examined trends of the early 1950s, he concluded that further population growth at such high rates would be detrimental to China's development. Therefore, he advocated government control of fertility. During the following three years, Ma's theory suffered two rounds of attacks, and he was dismissed from public life. The charges of the government were that the theory followed Malthusianism, attempted to discredit the superiority of socialism, and showed contempt for the people.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{extinguish}} a viral population of fixed reproductive capacity by causing {{small changes in}} the mutation rate is re-ferred to as lethal mutagenesis and is a corollary of <b>population</b> genetics <b>theory.</b> Here we show that coxsackievirus B 3 (CVB 3) ex-hibits reduced mutational robustness relative to poliovirus, manifesting in enhanced sensitivity of CVB 3 to lethal mutagens that {{is dependent on the}} size of the viral population. We suggest that mutational robustness may be a useful measure of the sensitiv-ity of a virus to lethal mutagenesis. RNA virus genomes are replicated at mutation rates orders ofmagnitude higher than DNA genomes (10, 27) and exist as heterogeneous populations of genetically distinct yet related ge-nomes.

500|$|While Essai was not {{published}} until 1755 {{as a result}} of heavy censorship in France, it did widely circulate {{in the form of an}} unpublished manuscript between its completion and its publication. It notably influenced many direct forerunners of the classical school of thought, including Turgot and other physiocrats. Cantillon was a major influence on physiocrat François Quesnay, who may have learned of Cantillon's work through Marquis of Mirabeau. While it is evident that Essai influenced Quesnay, to what degree remains controversial. There is evidence that Quesnay did not fully understand, or was not completely aware of, Cantillon's theories. Many of Quesnay's economic beliefs were elucidated previously in Essai, but Quesnay did reject a number of Cantillon's premises, including the scarcity of land and Cantillon's <b>population</b> <b>theory.</b> Also, Quesnay recognised the scarcity of capital and capital accumulation as a prerequisite for investment. Nevertheless, Cantillon was considered the [...] "father of physiocracy" [...] by Henry Higgs, due to his influence on Quesnay. It is also possible that Cantillon influenced Scottish economist James Steuart, both directly and indirectly.|$|E

This view can be demonstrated by the title of a newspaper article published in 1979: [...] "Erroneously criticized one person, population mistakenly increased 300,000,000". Ma's theory also became enshrined in public policy; China's One Child Policy draws heavily on Ma's reasoning that [...] "the State should have the power to intervene in reproduction and to control population", and follows his advice in heavily utilizing propaganda on the dangers of population growth. In Ma's hometown, a middle school has been named in his honor. His birth home is being renovated as a museum, and the street on which it resides is now called [...] "Famous Man Street". Nationally, the scholar is featured prominently in primary and middle school textbooks as [...] "Uncle Ma", where he is praised for his contributions to population control and environmental protection.
