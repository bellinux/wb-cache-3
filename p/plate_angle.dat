50|$|Pressure. In {{a typical}} pressure-compensated pump, the swash <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> is {{adjusted}} through {{the action of}} a valve which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous pump output flow is exactly enough to maintain a designated pressure. If the load flow increases, pressure will momentarily decrease but the pressure-compensation valve will sense the decrease and then increase the swash <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> to increase pump output flow so that the desired pressure is restored. In reality most systems use pressure as a control {{for this type of}} pump. The operating pressure reaches, say, 200 bar (20 MPa or 2900 psi) and the swash plate is driven towards zero angle (piston stroke nearly zero) and with the inherent leaks in the system allows the pump to stabilise at the delivery volume that maintains the set pressure. As demand increases the swash plate is moved to a greater angle, piston stroke increases and the volume of fluid increases; if the demand slackens the pressure will rise, and the pumped volume diminishes as the pressure rises. At maximum system pressure the output is once again almost zero. If the fluid demand increases beyond the capacity of the pump to deliver, the system pressure will drop to near zero. The swash <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> will remain at the maximum allowed, and the pistons will operate at full stroke. This continues until system flow-demand eases and the pump's capacity is greater than demand. As the pressure rises the swash-plate angle modulates to try to not exceed the maximum pressure while meeting the flow demand.|$|E
50|$|There are two design trade-offs, the girder <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> and the strut angle. Increasing the girder/plate angle {{towards the}} horizontal, the normal {{component}} of the force will increase towards vertical; this means that footings {{do not need to}} resist as much horizontal force, but requires more steel for a given upstream head. Increasing the strut angle towards vertical reduces the horizontal moment on the footings, reducing the risk of sliding.|$|E

It also provides future users of this mode with all necessary information to properly correct for instrumental effects in polarization data obtained with this instrument. Methods. The standard stars BD+ 59 d 389 (polarized) and HD 14069 (unpolarized) were observed with CAFOS in November, 2010, using 16 half-wave <b>plate</b> <b>angles.</b> The linear spectropolarimetric properties of CAFOS were studied using a Fourier Analysis of the resulting data. Results. CAFOS shows a roughly constant instrumental polarization {{at the level of}} ~ 0. 3 % between 4000 and 8600 A. Below 4000 A the spurious polarization grows to reach ~ 0. 7 % at 3600 A. This instrumental effect is most likely produced by the telescope optics, and appears to be additive. The Wollaston prism presents a clear deviation from the ideal behavior. The problem is largely removed by the usage of at least 4 retarder <b>plate</b> <b>angles.</b> The chromatism of the half-wave plate causes a peak-to-peak oscillation of ~ 11 degrees in the polarization angle. This can be effectively corrected using the tabulated values presented in this paper. The Fourier analysis shows that the k!= 0, 4 harmonics are practically negligible between 3800 and 7400 A. Conclusions. After correcting for instrumental polarization and retarder plate chromatism, with 4 half-wave <b>plate</b> <b>angles</b> CAFOS can reach an rms linear polarization accuracy of about 0. 1 %.

40|$|Background: In spastic {{cerebral}} palsy (SCP), a {{limited range of}} motion of the foot (ROM), limits gait and other activities. Assessment of this limitation of ROM and knowledge of active mechanisms is of crucial importance for clinical treatment. Methods. For a comparison between spastic {{cerebral palsy}} (SCP) children and typically developing children (TD), medial gastrocnemius muscle-tendon complex length was assessed using 3 -D ultrasound imaging techniques, while exerting externally standardized moments via a hand-held dynamometer. Exemplary X-ray imaging of ankle and foot was used to confirm possible TD-SCP differences in foot deformation. Results: SCP and TD {{did not differ in}} normalized level of excitation (EMG) of muscles studied. For given moments exerted in SCP, foot plate angles were all more towards plantar flexion than in TD. However, foot <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> proved to be an invalid estimator of talocrural joint angle, since at equal foot plate angles, GM muscle-tendon complex was shorter in SCP (corresponding to an equivalent of 1 cm). A substantial difference remained even after normalizing for individual differences in tibia length. X-ray imaging of ankle and foot of one SCP child and two typically developed adults, confirmed that in SCP that of total footplate angle changes (0 - 4 Nm: 15 °), the contribution of foot deformation to changes in foot <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> (8) were as big as the contribution of dorsal flexion at the talocrural joint (7 °). In typically developed individuals there were relatively smaller contributions (10 - 11 %) by foot deformation to changes in foot <b>plate</b> <b>angle,</b> indicating that the contribution of talocrural angle changes was most important. Using a new estimate for position at the talocrural joint (the difference between GM muscle-tendon complex length and tibia length, GM relative length) removed this effect, thus allowing more fair comparison of SCP and TD data. On the basis of analysis of foot <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> and GM relative length as a function of externally applied moments, it is concluded that foot <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> measurements underestimate angular changes at the talocrural joint when moving in dorsal flexion direction and overestimate them when moving in plantar flexion direction, with concomitant effects on triceps surae lengths. Conclusions: In SCP children diagnosed with decreased dorsal ROM of the ankle joint, the commonly used measure (i. e. range of foot <b>plate</b> <b>angle),</b> is not a good estimate of rotation at the talocrural joint. since a sizable part of the movement of the foot (or foot plate) derives from internal deformation of the foot. © 2013 Huijing et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The {{variable}} displacement pump control system has greater energy-saving advantages and application prospects than the valve control system. However, the {{variable displacement}} pump control of differential cylinder is not concurrent with the existing technologies. The asymmetric pump-controlled cylinder is, therefore, used to balance the unequal volume flow through a single rod cylinder in closed-circuit system. This {{is considered to be}} an effective method. Nevertheless, the asymmetric axial piston pump (AAPP) is a constant displacement pump. In this study, variable-displacement asymmetric axial piston pump (VAPP) is investigated according to the same principle used in investigating AAPP. This study, therefore, aims at investigating the characteristics of VAPP. The variable-displacement output of VAPP is implemented by controlling the swash <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> with angle feedback control circuit, which is composed of a servo proportional valve and an angular displacement sensor. The angular displacement sensor is connected to the swash plate. The simulation model of VAPP, which is set up through the ITI-SimulationX simulation platform, is used to predict VAPP’s characteristics. The purpose of implementing the experiment is to verify the theoretical results. Both the simulation and the experiment results demonstrated that the swash <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> is controlled by a variable mechanism; when the swash <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> increases, the flow of Port B and Port T increases while the response speed of Port B and Port T also accelerates. When the swash <b>plate</b> <b>angle</b> is constant, the flow of Port B and Port T increases along with the increase of pump speed, although the pressure-response speed of Port B is faster than that of Port T. Consequently, the flow pulsation of Port B and Port T tends to decrease gradually along with the increase of pump speed. When the pressure loaded on Port B equals to that of Port T, the flow ripple cycle of Port B is longer than that of Port T, whereas the peak flow of Port B is higher than that of Port T. Since the flow ripple of Port T is bigger than that of Port B, Port T should be connected to the low pressure sides or the oil tank so that it does not affect VAPP’s performance. Further, to avoid the backflow of VAPP from Port T to Port B, Port T cannot be loaded alone, and the loading pressure of Port T also cannot exceed that of Port B...|$|E
