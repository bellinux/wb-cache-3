For <b>the</b> derivative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variable <b>of</b> time, we use central difference at 4 <b>points</b> (instead <b>of</b> 2 <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classical Crank-Nicholson method), while for <b>the</b> second-order derivatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other spatial variables we use lagrangian interpolation at 4 <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central differences at 5 <b>points</b> (instead <b>of</b> lagrangian interpolation at 2 <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central differences at 3 <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classical Crank-Nicholson method).
