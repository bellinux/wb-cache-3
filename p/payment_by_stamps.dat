40|$|A {{model of}} the firm 2 ̆ 7 s {{decision}} to adopt a <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> results system is developed and tested with British establishment data. The model maintains that <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> results systems have larger set-up costs but lower supervision costs than time rates, particularly for short-tenure workers who are not well motivated by deferred compensation. The evidence confirms the model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions <b>by</b> showing that <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> results systems substitute for supervision, and that larger establishments and those with shorter-tenure workers {{are more likely to}} adopt <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> results. In addition, both the presence of a <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> results system and the new adoption of such a system are shown to exert a positive influence on measures of establishment performance...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in the potential of payments for ecosystem services (PES) to encourage land managers to protect and enhance the environment. However, questions remain about how PES agreements should be designed. There is a division between schemes that structure <b>payments</b> <b>by</b> action or by results, with most biodiversity PES schemes, including European agri-environment schemes, paying by action; for example incentivising land managers to carry out actions believed to increase biodiversity. <b>Payment</b> <b>by</b> results is a common incentive structure {{in the private sector}} (e. g. labourers doing piece work or no-win no-fee lawyers) but rarer in PES. Using a theoretical modelling approach, we investigate the conditions under which each way of structuring payments may be more cost-effective in a biodiversity PES. <b>Payment</b> <b>by</b> action is favoured where there is a clear action that can be specified at an appropriate level and to which biodiversity is sensitive. We found that <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> results is favoured in degraded landscapes as incentives are created for managers to use their private knowledge and join the scheme only if they can produce the biodiversity services targeted <b>by</b> the scheme. <b>Payment</b> <b>by</b> results is also favoured where biodiversity is less sensitive to conservation action and when it is difficult for a central agency to determine an appropriate level of conservation action. This is because <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> results allows individual managers to optimise their level of action. The relative cost of monitoring action (compliance with an agreement to manage in a certain way) versus results (the presence of biodiversity) has a substantial effect on which payment structure is more efficient only when the central agency can accurately set an appropriate level of action. We illustrate these principles with examples based on agri-environment schemes. Synthesis and applications. <b>Payment</b> <b>by</b> results deserves more attention from those designing biodiversity PES (be they agri-environment schemes in agricultural landscapes or direct payment schemes in more intact ecosystems). This paper provides a formal framework to help policy makers identify the conditions under which <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> results or <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> action is most likely to yield cost-effective biodiversity conservation. © 2011 The Authors.
