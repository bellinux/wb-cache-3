40|$|Low density (LDPE) {{and high}} density (HDPE) {{polyethylene}} films filled with starch up {{to a maximum}} level of 20 % by weight were tested for biodegradation under different environmental conditions. Composting windrows consisting of various putrescible waste and assembled for controlled biostabilization management under static conditions were used. The physical and chemical deterioration of the polyethylene-starch films exposed to a controlled composting environment were recorded and analyzed {{with respect to the}} different composting evolution and were compared with the data collected in pure culture systems and in bench scale tests simulating an aerobic biostabilization process. Evidences are presented on the partial removal of starch from the different films as a consequence of massive surface colonization by various microorganisms. Loss of starch is accompanied by a small but significant drop in the average molecular weight and decrement in mechanical strength. In the case of a composting trial experiencing prolonged severe temperature conditions, a small but spectroscopically detectable oxidation of the polyethylene matrix was also observed. Efficiency of the controlled composting systems can be claimed in assessing reproducible conditions in an accelerated biostabilization of <b>putrescible</b> <b>matter</b> and hence versatility in the evaluation of the degradation of plastic manufacts...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{incineration}} {{is the art}} of completely combusting waste, {{while maintaining}} or reducing emission levels below current emission standards. Where possible, objectives include the recovering of energy as well as the  combustion residues.   Successful waste incineration makes it possible to achieve a deep reduction in waste volume, obtain a compact and sterile residue, and eliminate a wide array of pollutants. This book places waste incineration within the wider context of waste management, and demonstrates that, in contrast to landfills and composting, waste incineration can eliminate objectionable and hazardous properties such as flammability and toxicity, result in a significant reduction in volume, and destroy gaseous and liquid waste streams leaving little or no residues beyond those linked to flue gas neutralization and treatment. Moreover, waste incineration sterilizes and destroys <b>putrescible</b> <b>matter,</b> and produces usable heat.   Incineration Technologies first appeared as a peer-reviewed contribution to  the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology. It provides detailed treatment of the challenges of this technically complex process, which requires huge investment and operating costs, as well as good technical skills in maintenance and plant operation.   Particular attention is paid to technologies for ensuring the complete burn-out of flue gas and residues and for controlling the resulting pollutants...|$|E
40|$|When {{treating}} municipal wastewater, {{the disposal}} of sludge {{is a problem of}} growing importance, representing up to 50 % of the current operating costs of a wastewater treatment plant. Although different disposal routes are possible, anaerobic digestion plays an important role for its abilities to further transform organic matter into biogas (60 - 70 vol% of methane, CH 4), as thereby it also reduces the amount of final sludge solids for disposal whilst destroying most of the pathogens present in the sludge and limiting odour problems associated with residual <b>putrescible</b> <b>matter.</b> Anaerobic digestion thus optimises WWTP costs, its environmental footprint and is considered a major and essential part of a modern WWTP. The potential of using the biogas as energy source has long been widely recognised and current techniques are being developed to upgrade quality and to enhance energy use. The present paper extensively reviews the principles of anaerobic digestion, the process parameters and their interaction, the design methods, the biogas utilisation, the possible problems and potential pro-active cures, and the recent developments to reduce the impact of the problems. After having reviewed the basic principles and techniques of the anaerobic digestion process, modelling concepts will be assessed to delineate the dominant parameters. Hydrolysis is recognised as rate-limiting step in the complex digestion process. The microbiology of anaerobic digestion is complex and delicate, involving several bacterial groups, each of them having their own optimum working conditions. As will be shown, these groups are sensitive to and possibly inhibited by several process parameters such as pH, alkalinity, concentration of free ammonia, hydrogen, sodium, potassium, heavy metals, volatile fatty acids and others. To accelerate the digestion and enhance the production of biogas, various pre-treatments can be used to improve the rate-limiting hydrolysis. These treatments include mechanical, thermal, chemical and biological interventions to the feedstock. All pre-treatments result in a lysis or disintegration of sludge cells, thus releasing and solubilising intracellular material into the water phase and transforming refractory organic material into biodegradable species. Possible techniques to upgrade the biogas formed by removing CO 2, H 2 S and excess moisture will be summarised. Special attention will be paid to the problems associated with siloxanes (SX) possibly present in the sludge and biogas, together with the techniques to either reduce their concentration in sludge by preventive actions such as peroxidation, or eliminate the SX from the biogas by adsorption or other techniques. The reader will finally be guided to extensive publications concerning the operation, control, maintenance and troubleshooting of anaerobic digestion plants. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The overall {{concept of}} {{landfill}} treatment {{is to keep}} the entombed waste isolated and to minimize its offsite pollution spreading to adjacent the adjacent environment. In Shiraz 69. 1 % of its domestic wastes contain <b>putrescible</b> organic <b>matter</b> which produces large quantities of leachate and gas. Construction of conventional leachate treatment plants is limited due to their high cost and leachate characteristics. Therefore, to control the production of landfill leachate from 2009 till now, several greenhouse and field experiments on vetiver grass were carried out to determine the possibility of using this technology for vegetative capping the landfill area and its potential to decontaminate the soil around the landfill. Greenhouse experiment results showed vetiver can tolerate irrigation with 45 % of leachate. Field experiments showed that vetiver can well adapt to Shiraz landfill conditions and survive. Cultivation of vetiver in large scale offers a pleasant view as an additional advantage, as well as to become a very effective soil and water conservation measure. Therefore, it can be concluded that vetiver planting is the best option for Shiraz landfill capping after closing Key words: Phytoremediation, landfill, Iran, rehabilitation, soil and water conservation 1...|$|R
40|$|The tourism {{phenomenon}} {{cannot be}} separated of transport systems {{and it needs}} to be examined in the light of the environmental dimension, in particular the air mode. The aim of this research was to investigate the situation of solid waste generation at Hugo Cantergiani Airport, located in Caxias do Sul-RS. The research, which applied a descriptive and exploratory approach, involved document survey, direct observation and solid waste characterization. The period of the sample was of 18 and a half days, spread over three weeks/months in 2012. The operational movimentation at the airport during the conduct of the research was of 15, 543 passengers. At the time of the sample 878. 76 kg of waste were weighed of which 606. 83 kg were segregated and characterized. In relation to this amount around 70 % were derived from services undertaken at the airport site and around 30 % came from the aircraft itself. The results revealed that there was a production by passenger at the aircraft of 30 g/passenger/trip and at the airport site a per capita production of 40 g/person/day. The most representative components were as follows: biological contaminant (29. 54 %), <b>putrescible</b> organic <b>matter</b> (27. 16 %), plastic (19. 15 %) and paper and paperboard (14. 04 %). These types of studies contribute to fill gaps in knowledge related to the gravimetric composition of solid waste in the context of airports, to assess the environmental impacts caused by the generation of such wastes and to provide guidelines for the management plan of solid waste at airports, tourism supporting infrastructures...|$|R
5000|$|On November 23, 2009, Premier Jean Charest {{announced}} {{targets for}} reducing greenhouse gases during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Quebec will cut its emissions by 20% {{by the year}} 2020 compared to international reference of 1990. On January 14, 2010, a new law came into force to reduce greenhouse gases from automobiles which represent 40% of Quebec GHGs. This new law stipulates that car manufacturers serving the territory of Quebec must meet an emission ceiling of 187 grams of GHG/km or approximatively 7.7 L/100 km. This level must be reduced annually up to 127 grams of GHG/km or approximatively 5.3 L/100 km in 2016. These standards are as stringent as those in California (United States), according to the Government of Quebec. The provincial government plans to offer up to $8,000 rebate towards the purchase of an electric car. The government hopes that by 2020, a quarter of cars purchased in Quebec will be electric. The plan would position Quebec as a world leader in electrified transportation according to Jean Charest. Quebec became the first region in North America to set a carbon tax. Since 2007, consumers pay a special tax on gasoline. Since July 2011, Quebec has imposed a carbon tax that affect more than 85% of industries in the province. This tax will be mandatory from 2013. The sectors affected by this carbon tax will have to reduce their carbon dioxide below 25 000 kilotonnes per year. Only the forest industry, agriculture and waste industries are not affected by this tax. In addition, the Quebec government plans to recover 60% of <b>putrescible</b> organic <b>matter</b> by 2015 {{in order to reduce}} its emissions. Quebec climate policy has been harshly criticised by the federal government under Prime minister Stephen Harper. In 2010, former minister Jim Prentice has openly criticized Quebec's plan to set GHG standards for motor vehicles sold in the province, describing it as [...] "lunatic". However, ten months later, Prentice successor, John Baird, has praised Quebec as a world leader in GHG abatement.|$|R
40|$|This Advisory Circular (AC) {{provides}} guidance on certain land uses {{that have the}} potential to attract hazardous wildlife on or near public-use airports. It also discusses airport development projects (including airport construction, expansion, and renovation) affecting aircraft movement near hazardous wildlife attractants. Appendix 1 provides definitions of terms used in this AC. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommends that public-use airport operators implement the standards and practices contained in this AC. The holders of Airport Operating Certificates issued under Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 139, Certification of Airports, Subpart D (Part 139), may use the standards, practices, and recommendations contained in this AC to comply with the wildlife hazard management requirements of Part 139. Airports that have received Federal grant-in-aid assistance must use these standards. The FAA also recommends the guidance in this AC for land-use planners, operators of non-certificated airports, and developers of projects, facilities, and activities on or near airports. Most public-use airports have large tracts of open, undeveloped land that provide added margins of safety and noise mitigation. These areas can also present potential hazards to aviation if they encourage wildlife to enter an airport 2 ̆ 7 s approach or departure airspace or air operations area (AOA). Constructed or natural areas—such as poorly drained locations, detention/retention ponds, roosting habitats on buildings, landscaping, odor-causing rotting organic <b>matter</b> (<b>putrescible</b> waste) disposal operations, wastewater treatment plants, agricultural or aquaculture activities, surface mining, or wetlands—can provide wildlife with ideal locations for feeding, loafing, reproduction, and escape. Even small facilities, such as fast food restaurants, taxicab staging areas, rental car facilities, aircraft viewing areas, and public parks, can produce substantial attractions for hazardous wildlife. During the past century, wildlife-aircraft strikes have resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives worldwide, as well as billions of dollars in aircraft damage. Hazardous wildlife attractants on and near airports can jeopardize future airport expansion, making proper community land-use planning essential. This AC provides airport operators and those parties with whom they cooperate with the guidance they need to assess and address potentially hazardous wildlife attractants when locating new facilities and implementing certain land-use practices on or near public-use airports...|$|R
40|$|The National Solid Waste Policy {{recommends}} that, in adequate final disposal, only unserviceable waste {{should be}} released, {{which it is}} not the case of organic waste that accounts {{more than half of the}} municipal solid waste generation in the country. In this context, this research aimed to develop a proposal for a selective collection of the organic fraction of household solid waste (OFHSW) in Pici neighborhood, Fortaleza-CE, aiming its use for the generation of biogas from the anaerobic digestion. This research occurred in 05 (five) steps, namely: the development of the environmental education (EE) program; physical characterization of household solid waste (HSW); the implementation of a selective collection program of OFHSW; the physical and chemical characterization of OFHSW; and the anaerobic biodegradability tests. Initially, a socio-environmental questionnaire was applied to a total of 175 residences, in which most of its residents presented favorable socioeconomic characteristics for the development of this project. The HSW sampled showed a high average of per capita generation (0. 93 Kg/hab. dia), low apparent specific weight (average of 156 Kg/mÂ) and high percentage of organic matter (average of 55. 9 %). In regard to the participation in the selective collection program, there was a potential participation of 61 % of the residences, from which 33 % effectively donated a clean OFHSW. The OFHSW showed slightly acidic characteristics, consisting of 74 % moisture and 26 % of TS, being basically composed of <b>putrescible</b> organic <b>matter</b> (VS = 92. 15 % TS on average) and rich in nutrients (average of TP= 0. 68 % and TKN = 1. 43 %). In biodegradability tests to analyze the effect of operating conditions, better results were found of SMA, biogas production and composition and COD removal in the flasks incubated at a speed of 150 rpm and with addition of 1 g/L of alkalizing. The pretreatment type that provided a higher biodegradability of OFHSW was the thermal one, in which the matter was exposed to a 30 minutes process of autoclaving, where were identified the largest removals of VS (41 % removed), COD (56 % removed) and value of SMA (1. 0777 gCOD-CH 4 /gVS. d). It is also emphasized that in all the biodegradability tests, about 60 % or more of the biogas composition was methane. It was observed that EE actions were able to provide a representative participation of the population in the OFHSW segregationA PolÃtica Nacional de ResÃduos SÃlidos preconiza que na disposiÃÃo final adequada somente os rejeitos devem ser lanÃados, nÃo sendo o caso dos resÃduos orgÃnicos, que constituem mais da metade dos resÃduos sÃlidos urbanos gerados no paÃs. Diante desse contexto, esta pesquisa teve como principal objetivo desenvolver uma proposta de coleta seletiva da fraÃÃo orgÃnica dos resÃduos sÃlidos domiciliares (FORSD) no bairro Pici, Fortaleza-CE, visando sua utilizaÃÃo para a geraÃÃo de biogÃs a partir da biodigestÃo anaerÃbia. Esta pesquisa ocorreu em 05 (cinco) etapas, sendo elas: o desenvolvimento do programa de educaÃÃo ambiental (EA); a caracterizaÃÃo fÃsica dos resÃduos sÃlidos domiciliares (RSD); a implantaÃÃo do programa de coleta seletiva da FORSD; a caracterizaÃÃo fÃsica e quÃmica da FORSD; e, os ensaios de biodegradabilidade anaerÃbia. Inicialmente, aplicou-se questionÃrio socioambiental, abordando-se um total de 175 residÃncias, com um pÃblico que possuiu, em sua maioria, caracterÃsticas socioeconÃmicas favorÃveis ao desenvolvimento deste projeto. O RSD amostrado apresentou uma geraÃÃo per capita mÃdia elevada (0, 93 Kg/hab. dia), baixo peso especÃfico aparente (156 Kg/mÂ, em mÃdia) e percentual de matÃria orgÃnica elevada (mÃdia de 55, 9 %). Quanto Ã participaÃÃo no programa de coleta seletiva, registrou-se uma participaÃÃo em potencial de 61 % das residÃncias e com 33 % doando efetivamente a FORSD limpa. A FORSD apresentou caracterÃsticas ligeiramente Ãcidas, constituÃda de 74 % de umidade e 26 % de ST, sendo basicamente composta por matÃria orgÃnica putrescÃvel (STV = 92, 15 % dos ST, em mÃdia) e rica em nutrientes (mÃdia de PT = 0, 68 % e de NTK = 1, 43 %). Nos ensaios de biodegradabilidade, para anÃlise da influÃncia das condiÃÃes operacionais, foram encontrados melhores resultados de AME, produÃÃo e composiÃÃo de biogÃs e remoÃÃo de DQO nos frascos incubados a uma rotaÃÃo de 150 rpm e com adiÃÃo de 1 g/L de alcalinizante. O tipo de prÃ-tratamento que proporcionou maior biodegradabilidade da FORSD foi o tÃrmico submetido a 30 minutos no processo de autoclavagem, em que foram registrados as maiores remoÃÃes de STV (41 % removido), DQO (56 % removida) e valor de AME (1, 0777 gDQO-CH 4 /gSTV. d). Ressalta-se tambÃm que nos ensaios de biodegradabilidade cerca de 60 % ou mais da composiÃÃo do biogÃs era gÃs metano.
