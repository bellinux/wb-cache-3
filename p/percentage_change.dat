5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is unit (or unitary) elastic (Ed = -1), the <b>percentage</b> <b>change</b> in quantity demanded is equal to that in price, so a change in price will not affect total revenue.|$|E
5|$|Price {{elasticity}} of demand (PED or Ed) {{is a measure}} used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded of a good or service {{to a change in}} its price, ceteris paribus. More precisely, it gives the <b>percentage</b> <b>change</b> in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price (ceteris paribus).|$|E

40|$|Version of RecordThis study explores month {{effects in}} terms of {{standard}} deviations of monthly and daily <b>percentage</b> <b>changes</b> of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. During the last century, the standard deviation of the monthly <b>percentage</b> <b>changes</b> of April (6. 63 %) is {{significantly higher than the}} standard deviations for the other months. The monthly standard deviations of daily <b>percentage</b> <b>changes</b> as a measure of volatility exhibit a slightly rising trend, peaking in October and are all significantly different from zero. The mean monthly standard deviation of daily <b>percentage</b> <b>changes</b> for October (1. 08 %) was the maximum and also significantly higher than the means of the other months. The DJIA became less volatile {{in terms of}} monthly as well as daily <b>percentage</b> <b>changes</b> {{during the second half of}} the last century compared to the first half. If we divide the data for the last century into decades, the thirties stand out as the most volatile period in terms of monthly as well as daily <b>percentage</b> <b>changes.</b> Based on both dimensions, the decades prior to 1940 experienced higher standard deviations compared to the subsequent decades. So it appeared that the stock market became more volatile in recent times – but that was in points, not in percentage terms. Hamid, S. A. (2006).

5|$|The table below {{details the}} {{population}} change since 1801, including the <b>percentage</b> <b>change</b> {{since the last}} census 10 years earlier. Although Trafford was formed as a Metropolitan Borough in 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that would later be constituent parts of Trafford. The greatest <b>percentage</b> <b>change</b> in the population occurred between 1851 and 1871, and {{was a result of}} the construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849. The decrease by 7.7% in Trafford's population since the 1971 census mirrors the trend for Greater Manchester, although on a smaller scale; this has been accounted for by the decline of Greater Manchester's industries, particularly those in Manchester and Salford but including those in Trafford, and residents leaving to seek new jobs.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is relatively inelastic (-1 < Ed < 0), the <b>percentage</b> <b>change</b> in quantity demanded is smaller than that in price. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue increases, and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|In 1700, the {{population}} of Ashton, the Tame Valley's main urban area, was an estimated 550. The town's 18th-century growth was fuelled by an influx {{of people from the}} countryside attracted by the prospect of work in its new industries, mirroring the rest of the region. In the early 19th century, Irish immigrants escaping from the Great Irish Famine were also drawn to the area by the new jobs created, The availability of jobs created by the growth of the textile industry in the town led to Ashton's population increasing by more than 400% between 1801 and 1861, from 6,500 to 34,886. The population dropped by 9% during the 1860s {{as a consequence of the}} cotton famine caused by the American Civil War. The table below details {{the population}} change since 1851, including the <b>percentage</b> <b>change</b> since the last census.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns from 1664, the {{township}} of Altrincham had {{a population of}} about 636, making it the largest of the local settlements; this had increased to 1,692 in 1801. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, the town's population increase by 165per cent, higher than 89per cent across England and 98per cent in the Trafford area. The growth of the settlement was a result of the Industrial Revolution, and although Altrincham was one of the fastest growing townships in the Trafford area, but paled in comparison to new industrial areas such as Ashton-under-Lyne, Hyde, and Manchester. In the second half of the 19th century, Altrincham's population grew by 275per cent, higher than the 235per cent for Trafford and 69per cent nationally in the same period. This was due to the late industrialisation of the area and the introduction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849. The table below details the population change since 1801, including the <b>percentage</b> <b>change</b> since the last census.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs.
