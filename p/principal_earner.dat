Tourism accounts directly or indirectly {{for more than half}} of GDP and is also the <b>principal</b> <b>earner</b> of foreign exchange in Antigua and Barbuda. However, a series of violent hurricanes since 1995 resulted in serious damage to tourist infrastructure and periods of sharp reductions in visitor numbers. In 1999 the budding offshore financial sector was seriously hurt by financial sanctions imposed by the United States and United Kingdom as a result of the loosening of its money-laundering controls. The government has made efforts to comply with international demands in order to get the sanctions lifted. The dual island nation's agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market; the sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the US, which accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals. Estimated overall economic growth for 2000 was 2.5%. Inflation has trended down going from above 2 percent in the 1995-99 period and estimated at 0 percent in 2000.|$|E

The only case where a positive association between BMI and hours of work is also observed at the married stage (and possibly larger for the marrieds than for the singles) is the case of White women. White women may be the exception for they may be more likely to receive in-marriage transfers from husbands compared to their Black or Hispanic counterparts. Therefore, there may be more of an in-marriage financial reward (or a reward in the form of extra access to consumption) for being thin in the case of married White women than in the case of married minority women. The result that the association between BMI and hours of work disappears for Black married women at the married state is consistent with Black women often being the <b>principal</b> <b>earner</b> in their couple (see Mincy et al. 2005).

40|$|The {{demand on}} {{material}} means indispensable to compensate effects of fortuitous events can {{be directed to}} various sources of compensation. A particular possibility of such compensation is created by property and personal economic insurances. Personal group insurances, including group family life insurances deserve the special attention in that group of insurances. They serve to cover material needs effected by illness, loss of a capacity to earn and loss of a <b>principal</b> <b>earner.</b> In that way they can substantially contribute to social security payments. They belong to {{the most popular and}} reckoned economic insurances. Their dynamic development since 1954 has reached the stage of almost total commonness among employees of the social sector of economy, eg. approximately 11. 6 mln of persons were covered by that insurance for total of 12 mln of the social sector workers in 1980. The attempt at estimating the effectiveness of group life insurances cannot be an easy task as both in the insurance practice and theory there are no unmistakable indices defining that effectiveness in relation to social and economic spheres. If we adopt that a function of the discussed life insurances is to institute the immediate aid to family of a deceased worker or in case of death of co-insured family members then the effects of that insurance aid can be observed by comparing costs incurred by family effected by an unfortunate fortituous event (death of a family member) and indispensable expenses for maintaining the present living standard with a lump sum of benefits gained within the schedule of social and economic insurances. Under those conditions, a level of effectiveness of life insuarance will be related to the sum insured of both the principal insured and others insured. The insurance office has to follow socio-economic changes, eg. inflationary processes observed recently and adjust sums insured to the raising costs. In that way taking out insurances with top sums insured can cover the above mentioned expenses. The previous insurance practice indicates at indispensability of conducting research by insurers on the effect of those processes on the effectiveness of insurance protection and particularly at ascertaining interrelations and indices to make the level of insurance protection follow the changing socio-economic conditions of family existence.

The empirical analysis is conducted for 3, 240 German households and their expenditure on 182 different soft drinks over a six-month period. We find that consumers have a preference for variety in food consumption, ceteris paribus.

Although the exercise is fraught with methodological problems, it nevertheless generates some salient outcomes. First and foremost, the available evidence unanimously points to a slight increase in the general standard of living, thereby contradicting the official macro-data. Further, given an increase in inequality, it is well possible that the period of transition was experienced increasingly unequally by different population groups. Third, {{one of the most significant}} changes observed is that Kinshasa has become more closely connected with world (food) markets. Meanwhile, the level of education of the <b>principal</b> income <b>earner</b> remains one of the main predictors of the level of household consumption, even in a thoroughly informalized economy...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{the health}} {{sciences}} have been observing {{the negative impact}} of mass unemployment on health for some time now, health reporting remains fragmentary. Methods: The 2005 microcensus was conducted as an official random sample survey. A total of 380, 000 households, comprising 820, 000 individuals, took part. Providing health information was optional, with a response ratio of about 85 %. The Scientific Use File contains a 70 % subsample of the data set. Results: As of the survey date, average annual illness rates for 2005 were 6. 5 % among unemployed and 26. 6 % among inactive persons seeking to work (not available). If unemployed and inactive persons seeking to work were pooled into the single group of "job seekers", their average annual illness rate was 8. 8 %. This was significantly higher than for employed individuals, whose rate was 4. 4 %. However, the age-standardised odds ratios decreased from 2. 2 to 1. 8 for female job seekers and from 2. 2 to 1. 6 for male job seekers after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, family type, household structure, education, vocational training, socioeconomic variables, disabilities, smoking status, and other factors. The children of job seekers who are the <b>principal</b> income <b>earners</b> were more than proportionally ill at the survey date, too. In multivariate model calculations, among persons who had been unemployed a year before, an illness lasting more than 12 months had the strongest impact on chances for present employment. Chances for reintegration were likewise substantially lower for persons with a disability.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between education/occupation/income and health status {{have been well}} documented in the international epidemiological and sociological literature for many years, however, specific studies on the subject are scarce in Canada. Even when relationships have been demonstrated, the reasons for these relationships are much debated. This study presents {{an analysis of the}} relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and health status. The study is based on analysis of data from a sample of nearly 2000 male <b>principal</b> income <b>earners</b> from the 1978 Canada Health Survey. Firstly, is there a relationship between an individual's SES and health status in Canada? Secondly, what aspects of SES [...] education, occupational status, and/or income [...] are most important? Thirdly, what are the possible explanations of the observed relationship? That is, is it possible to disaggregate the relationship and thereby infer possible causal mechanisms? The findings indicated a direct positive relationship between SES and health status, i. e. the higher an individual's SES, the better that person's health. The major exception to this was the SES/fitness relationship. In this instance, the higher the SES, the lower the level of fitness. Though age was an important control variable as SES, fitness and illness are age related, the findings relating SES to the health measures remained even when age was controlled for. Of the three SES measures, income was consistently the best correlate of health status. Occupational status showed the most inconsistent relationships with health status. The findings supported both the social causation and social selection hypotheses. That is, social position can have an effect on health status (social causation), while health status can affect one's social position (social selection). socioeconomic status physical and mental health status Canada Health Survey...|$|R

This analysis of exurban commuting patterns {{is based on a}} mail survey of 1408 households who bought homes in 1987 near Portland, Oregon. The bid-rent model of urban form predicts that exurbanites will trade-off long commutes for lower housing prices. But previous research suggests that exurban living may not require long commutes because of decentralized employment. The study finds that exurban commuters travel farther than suburban commuters and pay less for housing. Exurban home buyers do not, however, have longer commutes the farther out they live. Instead those with urban jobs generally locate closer to the city center than those with decentralized jobs. The commuting times of exurban <b>principal</b> wage <b>earners</b> are also influenced by occupation, flextime use, and by the presence and employment status of other adults in the household. The commuting times of exurban secondary wage earners are influenced by the number of hours they work, their mode of travel, and the number of children they have. Although most exurban home buyers moved to obtain a bigger lot and a more rural environment, there were many differences among households. Four types of exurban households were identified with cluster analysis. Only the Child-Raising households take full advantage of decentralized jobs to live in rural areas without longer commutes than suburbanites. In contrast, Long-Distance Commuters travel nearly twice the average time because they usually hold urban jobs and want large, but inexpensive, lots. Affluents also hold many urban jobs but can afford larger lots closer-in than others. The Economy-Minded commute average distances to obtain cheaper housing on smaller lots. This study improves understanding of the exurban development process. The study also finds that the bid-rent model of urban form is a useful theory for understanding exurban development despite the decentralization of employment and the predominance of two wage earner households...|$|R

40|$|Children {{with chronic}} {{diseases}} Chronic viral hepatitis Among human hepatitis viruses, hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses {{are able to}} persist in the host for years and thereby causing chronic hepatitis. Three hundred and seventy and 130 million people {{is estimated to be}} infected with HBV and HCV, respectively, worldwide (1). In endemic areas, HBV infection is often acquired perinatally or early in childhood and becomes chronic in a high proportion of cases. Universal vaccination of newborns has been effective in reducing the spread of infection. However, hepatitis B is still a social and health problem in underdeveloped areas where immunisation policies are unavailable, and even in developed countries, where the reservoir of infection is maintained by immigration and adoption. In some endemic areas children with chronic hepatitis B are also at risk for superinfection with the hepatitis delta virus (HDV), which worsens the prognosis of liver disease. HCV is not a less important problem. The prevalence of circulating anti-HCV antibodies in the pediatric population averaged 0. 3 % in Italy in the early 1990 s (2), but a national observational study suggest that the number of “new” pediatric infections dropped by approximately 40 % in 2000 - 2004 compared with the previous 5 years (3). The lower prevalence of HCV in children reflects the disappearance of transfusion-related hepatitis and the reduced efficiency of mother-to-child (vertical or perinatal) transmission, although the latter form of transmission is currently responsible for most “new” infections in the developed world and contributes to maintaining the reservoir of infection worldwide (4 - 7). This favourable epidemiologic trend is balanced, however, by the strong tendency of HCV infection acquired early in life (either perinatally or following blood transfusions) to become chronic (8 - 14). In the absence of a specific vaccination, HCV infection remains a major global health problem and HCV-related end-stage liver disease is still the most frequent indication for liver transplantation in adult patients. Chronic viral hepatitis acquired in childhood is a long-lasting process based on host-virus interaction, which may change over the years. A number of factors related to the virus (genotype, therapy), to the host (hormonal status, immunocompetence, therapy) and to the environment (alcohol, drugs, co-infections) affects the natural history of the disease, especially during adolescence and early adulthood. Strategies to improve the prevention and treatment of HBV and HCV infection, and the related liver disease in children, before the possible development of irreversible complications, should be investigated and implemented. HIV infection Countries most heavily affected, HIV has reduced life expectancy by more than 20 years, hampered economic growth, and deepened household poverty (UNAIDS. Data from: www. unaids. org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/GlobalReport/ 2008 / 2008 _Global_report. asp). Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the main source of pediatric HIV- 1 infection. MTCT of HIV- 1 mainly occurs around the time of delivery, but breastfeeding is an additional route of viral transmission and accounts for about one-third of pediatric infections in resource-poor Countries (15). In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, about 30 % of women transmit the virus to their infants. The estimated number of perinatally acquired AIDS cases in the United States peaked at 945 in 1992 and declined rapidly with expanding prenatal testing and implementation of appropriate preventive interventions (16). At the end of 2007, there were 2 million children living with HIV around the world, an estimated 370, 000 children became newly infected with HIV in 2007, and, of the 2 millions people who died of AIDS during 2007, more than one in seven were children. Every hour, around 31 children die as a result of AIDS. HIV can affects a child’s life through its effects directly on the child, on that child’s family, and on the community within the child is growing up: -	Many children are themselves infected with HIV -	Children live with family members who are infected with HIV -	Children act as carers for sick parents who have AIDS -	Many children have lost one or both parents to AIDS, and are orphaned -	An increasing number of households are headed by children, as AIDS erodes traditional community support systems -	Children end up being their family’s <b>principal</b> wage <b>earners,</b> as AIDS prevents adults from working, and creates expensive medical bills -	As AIDS ravages a community, schools lose teachers and children are unable to access education -	Doctors and nurses die, and children find it difficult to gain care for childhood diseases -	Children may lose their friends to AIDS -	Children who have HIV in their family may be stigmatized and affected by discrimination In the last 10 years, dramatic advances in medical management of HIV infection have followed the results of clinical trials of antiretroviral combination therapies in children. The use of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy in HIV-infected women has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the transmission rate to infants, which is currently less than 2 % in most high-income Countries (17). In parallel, the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed the natural history of HIV- 1 infection and the life expectancy of HIV- 1 -infected adults (18, 19) and children (20 - 26). Although in developed Countries children living with HIV infection are expected to live a long life, they still need to face major emotional burden, social stigma and global exclusion from the social contest (27). Being a child or an adolescent with HIV implies major problems in terms of management of multiple drugs, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, drug resistance, quality of life, frequency at school and social interactions with peers (28). Immunization in at risk children Vaccinations programs are one of the greatest public health interventions of the last century and have dramatically improved quality of life (29). Benefits of vaccination to the individual include partial or complete protection against infections and symptoms of illness, improved quality of life, and prevention of up to 3 million pediatric deaths per year worldwide (29, 30). Benefits of a universal vaccination program to society include creation and maintenance of herd immunity, prevention of disease outbreaks, and reduced health care costs (30). Despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines and substantial progresses in reducing vaccine-preventable diseases, delivery to and acceptance of vaccinations by targeted populations are essential to further reducing and eliminating vaccine-preventable causes of morbidity and mortality (31). Children who are not vaccinated endanger public health representing a risk for other nonimmunized individuals, including subjects who cannot be immunized due to underlying health problems, and the small percentage of individuals in whom vaccination does not confer protection (29). They also contribute to increase health care costs (29). Access to immunizations, prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases, and vaccination rates varies by geographic area or country. Throughout the United States and European Countries, immunization rates of children and adults are rising, but coverage levels have not reached established goals (32). As a result of low immunization rates, vaccine-preventable diseases still occur as evidenced by the measles epidemic, the large number of annual cases of varicella, pertussis, and hepatitis B, and the more than 50, 000 annual deaths in adults from influenza or pneumococcal infections (33 - 36). In an attempt to eliminate the risk of outbreaks of some diseases, governments and other institutions have instituted policies requiring vaccination for all people (compulsory vaccinations). For example, actual vaccination policies in most developed Counties require that children receive common vaccinations before entering school. In addition to compulsory vaccines, certain populations should receive additional vaccinations. Subjects with chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for severe complications related to vaccine-preventable infections, such as influenza and pneumococcal infections (34, 37). In Italy, compulsory vaccines are generally administered in vaccination centers and complementary vaccinations are actively offered to children with chronic conditions and are included in the Essential Levels of Care (38). Despite long-standing recommendations to provide recommended vaccinations to children with chronic medical conditions, immunisation rates in these vulnerable populations remain poor (39). Several conditions hamper implementation of these vaccinations, including problems in identifying at risk children, ineffective organizational strategies and lack of awareness of disease severity or poor confidence by parents in specific recommendations (40, 41). Often, the presence of a chronic condition is erroneously considered a contraindication rather than an indication to vaccination. It is important to ensure that patients comply with the vaccination schedule to the extent possible, and to provide education to parents who may have concerns about pediatric vaccinations.
