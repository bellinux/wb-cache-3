5|$|There was a {{movement}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word side means <b>pomegranate,</b> which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the <b>pomegranate,</b> as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.|$|E

5|$|The common {{explanation}} for the ship's name {{was that it was}} inspired by Henry VIII's favourite sister, Mary Tudor, and the rose as the emblem of the Tudors. According to historians David Childs, David Loades and Peter Marsden, no direct evidence of naming the ship after the King's sister exists. It was far more common at the time to give ships pious Christian names, a long-standing tradition in Western Europe, or to associate them with their royal patrons. Names like Grace Dieu (Thank God) and Holighost (Holy Spirit) had been common since the 15th century and other Tudor navy ships had names like the Regent and Three Ostrich Feathers (referring to the crest of the Prince of Wales). The Virgin Mary is a more likely candidate for a namesake, and she was also associated with the Rosa Mystica (mystic rose). The name of the sister ship of the Mary Rose, the Peter <b>Pomegranate,</b> {{is believed to have been}} named in honour of Saint Peter, and the badge of the Queen Catharine of Aragon, a <b>pomegranate.</b> According to Childs, Loades and Marsden, the two ships, which were built around the same time, were named in honour of the king and queen, respectively.|$|E
