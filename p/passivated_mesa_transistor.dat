2500|$|On August 28, 1958, Kilby {{assembled}} the first prototype of an IC using discrete components and received approval for implementing it on one chip. He {{had access to}} technologies that could form <b>mesa</b> <b>transistors,</b> <b>mesa</b> diodes and capacitors based on p-n junctions on a germanium (but not silicon) chip, and the bulk material of the chip {{could be used for}} resistors. The standard Texas Instruments chip for the production of 25 (5×5) <b>mesa</b> <b>transistors</b> was 10×10mm in size. Kilby cut it into five-transistor 10×1.6mm strips, but later used not more than two of them. On September 12, he presented the first IC prototype, which was a single-transistor oscillator with a distributed RC feedback, repeating the idea and the circuit in the 1953 patent by Johnson. On September 19, he made the second prototype, a two-transistor trigger. He described these ICs, referencing the Johnson's patent, in his [...]|$|R
50|$|Fairchild's first marketed {{transistor}} was the 1958 2N697, a <b>mesa</b> <b>transistor</b> {{developed by}} Moore, {{and it was}} a huge success. The first batch of 100 was sold to IBM for $150 a piece in order to build the computer for the B-70 bomber. More were sold to Autonetics to build the guidance system for the Minuteman ballistic missile.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe 1 /f {{noise of}} double InP/InGaAs {{heterojunction}} bipolar transistors is measured and analyzed. Standard <b>mesa</b> <b>transistors,</b> transistors with an air-bridge-connected base and hexagonal shaped transistors conceived for digital circuits are studied. These {{differences in the}} technology will have an influence {{on the origin of}} the noise sources. Regarding noise analysis, the base and collector internal current noise sources ib and ic are assumed to be correlated for all devices. This is highlighted by the voltage noise correlation function between the input and the output of the devices presenting an unusual behavior versus bias and geometry. The collector current noise source is divided into a correlated and uncorrelated part with base current. These parts give rise to spectral densities Sc and Snc. They are shown to have distinct origins for the different types of transistor geometry...|$|R
5000|$|Fairchild's {{strategy}} for {{competing in the}} transistor market was to be fast and flexible. Rather than tying their research and development to lengthy 1-3 year military contracts, they financed development through Fairchild Camera. This enabled them to focus on promising ideas and develop them quickly. IBM was interested in obtaining transistors for a navigation computer for the B-70 bomber. Fairchild contracted to provide transistors to meet the specifications for IBM's core-memory driver. They developed complementary NPN and PNP transistors {{which could be used}} as a matched pair in a variety of circuit applications. Gordon Moore and David Allison worked on the NPN transistor, while Jean Hoerni developed the PNP transistor using boron diffusion. Scaling up to production of components in quantity presented major technological challenges, and Moore's NPN transistor was ready for production before Hoerni's PNP transistor. By August 1958, within 8 months of the company's creation, Fairchild was delivering <b>Mesa</b> <b>transistors</b> to IBM. [...] Once it became available, the <b>mesa</b> <b>transistor</b> was desired for a wide variety of military applications. The speed with which it had been developed gave Fairchild a virtual monopoly on the fast-growing market for the next year. The most significant contract came from Autonetics, which was developing the navigation and control computer for the Minuteman ICBM.|$|R
5000|$|We {{were all}} {{focused on the}} single goal of {{producing}} our first product, a double diffused silicon <b>mesa</b> <b>transistor</b> ... We were all very young (27 to 32), {{only a few years}} beyond our school days. We were a very compatible group, and {{spent a lot of time}} outside our working hours. Most of the founders were married, busy starting their families and raising small children in addition to all the time and effort they were spending building Fairchild ... I am struck by what a remarkable time it was and what innovative opportunities. - Jay T. Last, 2010 ...|$|R
2500|$|In October 1961, Texas Instruments {{built for}} the Air Force a {{demonstration}} [...] "molecular computer" [...] with a 300-bit memory based on the #587 ICs of Kilby. Harvey Kreygon packed this computer into a volume of a little over 100cm3. In December 1961, the Air Force accepted the first analog device created within the molecular electronics program – a radio receiver. It uses costly ICs, which had less than 10–12 components and {{a high percentage of}} failed devices. This generated an opinion that ICs can only justify themselves for aerospace applications. However, the aerospace industry rejected those ICs for the low radiation hardness of their <b>mesa</b> <b>transistors.</b>|$|R
25|$|The group {{immediately}} set a clear goal {{to produce}} an array of silicon diffusion <b>mesa</b> <b>transistors</b> for digital devices, utilizing the research results of Bell Labs and Shockley Labs. Moore, Hoerni and Last led three teams working on three alternative technologies. The technology of Moore resulted in a higher yield of operational n-p-n transistors, and in July–September 1958, they went into mass production. The release of p-n-p transistors of Hoerni was delayed until early 1959. This created the Moore-Hoerni conflict at Fairchild: Moore ignored the contribution of Hoerni, and Hoerni believed that his work was unfairly treated. However, the Moore transistors formed the prestige of Fairchild Semiconductor – for several years, they beat all the competitors.|$|R
25|$|In 1958, Fairchild <b>mesa</b> <b>transistors</b> were {{considered}} for the D-17B Minuteman I guidance computer, {{but they did not}} meet military standards of reliability. Fairchild already had a solution in the planar technology of Hoerni proposed on December 1, 1957. In the spring of 1958, Hoerni and Last were spending nights on experiments with the first planar transistors. The planar technology later became the second most important event in the history of microelectronics, after the invention of the transistor, but in 1959 it went unnoticed. Fairchild announced the transition from mesa to planar technology in October 1960. However, Moore refused to credit this achievement to Hoerni, and in 1996 even attributing it to unnamed Fairchild engineers.|$|R

25|$|On December 1, 1957, Jean Hoerni first {{proposed}} a planar technology of bipolar transistors. In this process, all the p-n junctions {{were covered by}} a protective layer, which should significantly improve reliability. However, in 1957, this proposal was considered technically impossible. The formation of the emitter of an n-p-n transistor required diffusion of phosphorus, {{and the work of}} Frosch suggested that SiO2 does not block such diffusion. In March 1959, Chi-Tang Sah, a former colleague of Hoerni, pointed Hoerni and Noyce to an error in the conclusions of Frosch. Frosch used too thin oxide layers, whereas the experiments of 1957–1958 showed that a thick layer of oxide can stop the phosphorus diffusion. Armed with this knowledge, by March 12, 1959 Hoerni made the first prototype of a planar transistor, and on May 1, 1959 filed a patent application for the invention of the planar process. In April 1960, Fairchild launched the planar transistor 2N1613, and by October 1960 completely abandoned the <b>mesa</b> <b>transistor</b> technology. By the mid-1960s, the planar process has become the main technology of producing transistors and monolithic integrated circuits.|$|R

50|$|Around 1960 Cray {{decided to}} design a {{computer}} {{that would be the}} fastest in the world by a large margin. After four years of experimentation along with Jim Thornton, and Dean Roush and about 30 other engineers Cray completed the CDC 6600 in 1964. Cray switched from germanium to silicon transistors, built by Fairchild Semiconductor, that used the planar process. These did not have the drawbacks of the <b>mesa</b> silicon <b>transistors.</b> He ran them very fast, and the speed of light restriction forced a very compact design with severe overheating problems, which were solved by introducing refrigeration, designed by Dean Roush. Given that the 6600 outran all computers of the time by about 10 times, it was dubbed a supercomputer and defined the supercomputing market when one hundred computers were sold at $8 million each.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{at the new}} Chippewa Falls lab, Seymour Cray, Jim Thornton, and Dean Roush put {{together}} a team of 34 engineers, which continued work on the new computer design. One of the ways they hoped to improve the CDC 1604 was to use better transistors, and Cray used the new silicon transistors using the planar process, developed by Fairchild Semiconductor. These were much faster than the germanium transistors in the 1604, without the drawbacks of the older <b>mesa</b> silicon <b>transistors.</b> The speed of light restriction forced a more compact design with refrigeration designed by Dean Roush. In 1964, the resulting computer was released onto the market as the CDC 6600, out-performing everything on the market by roughly ten times. When it sold over 100 units at $8 million each it was considered a supercomputer.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} {{processes}} limiting {{the performance of}} 4 micron superlattice pin photodiodes for different temperature and mesa size regimes. We show that the performance of large mesa photodiodes at low temperature is most severely limited by a trap-assisted tunneling leakage current (x 300), while small mesa sizes are additionally limited by perimeter leakage (x 20). At room temperature, large mesa photodiodes are limited by the diffusion current, and small mesa photodiodes are further limited by the perimeter leakage (x 100). To reduce or eliminate the impact of perimeter leakage, we have tried <b>passivating</b> the <b>mesa</b> sidewalls with SiN, an approach that was only minimally successful. We have also {{laid the groundwork for}} another approach to elimination of perimeter leakage currents, namely, elimination of the sidewalls altogether through planar processing techniques. Planar processing schemes require the deposition of a thick, wide bandgap semiconductor or “window layer ” on top of the homojunction. We compare the performance of two otherwise identical InAs/GaSb superlattice homojunction detectors, except one with a GaSb window layer, and one without. We show that inclusion of the thick GaSb window layer does not degrade detector performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{high voltage}} (VR = 1200 V), high current (IF = 150 A), fast {{recovery}} (700 ns) and low {{forward voltage drop}} (1. 5 V) silicon rectifier was designed and the process developed for its fabrication. For maximum purity, uniformity and material characteristic stability, neutron transmutation n-type doped float zone silicon is used. The design features a hexagonal chip for maximum area utilization of space available in the DO- 8 diode package, PIN diffused junction structure with deep diffused D(+) anode and a shallow high concentration n(+) cathode. With the high temperature glass <b>passivated</b> positive bevel <b>mesa</b> junction termination, the achieved blocking voltage is close to the theoretical limit of the starting material. Gold diffusion is used to control the lifetime and the resulting effect on switching speed and forward voltage tradeoff. For solder reflow assembly, trimetal (Al-Ti-Ni) contacts are used. The required major device electrical characteristics were achieved. Due to the tradeoff nature of forward voltage drop and reverse recovery time, a compromise was reached for these values...|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 shows a {{single-stage}} monolithic microwave {{integrated circuit}} (MMIC) power amplifier {{in which the}} gain element is a double-heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) connected in common-base configuration. This amplifier, which has been demonstrated to function well at a frequency of 172 GHz, is part of a continuing effort to develop compact, efficient amplifiers for scientific instrumentation, wide-band communication systems, and radar systems that will operate at frequencies up to and beyond 180 GHz. The transistor is fabricated from a layered structure formed by molecular beam epitaxy in the InP/InGaAs material system. A highly doped InGaAs base layer and a collector layer are fabricated from the layered structure in a triple <b>mesa</b> process. The <b>transistor</b> includes two separate emitter fingers, each having dimensions of 0. 8 by 12 m. The common-base configuration was chosen for its high maximum stable gain in the frequency band of interest. The input-matching network is designed for high bandwidth. The output of the transistor is matched to a load line for maximum saturated output power under large-signal conditions, rather than being matched for maximum gain under small-signal conditions. In a test at a frequency of 172 GHz, the amplifier was found to generate an output power of 7. 5 mW, with approximately 5 dB of large-signal gain (see Figure 2). Moreover, the amplifier exhibited a peak small-signal gain of 7 dB at a frequency of 176 GHz. This performance of this MMIC single-stage amplifier containing only a single transistor represents a significant advance {{in the state of the}} art, in that it rivals the 170 -GHz performance of a prior MMIC three-stage, four-transistor amplifier. [The prior amplifier was reported in "MMIC HEMT Power Amplifier for 140 to 170 GHz" (NPO- 30127), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 27, No. 11 (November 2003), page 49. ] This amplifier is the first heterojunction- bipolar-transistor (HBT) amplifier built for medium power operation in this frequency band. The performance of the amplifier as measured in the aforementioned tests suggests that InP/InGaAs HBTs may be superior to high-electron-mobility (HEMT) transistors in that the HBTs may offer more gain per stage and more output power per transistor...|$|R
