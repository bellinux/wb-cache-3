[...] "Clastic" [...] <b>plastiglomerate</b> are smaller solitary pieces that form where larger fused items become {{fragmented}} by waves. <b>Plastiglomerate</b> is more dense than particles that are solely composed of plastic, which gives them greater {{potential to become}} buried and preserved in the rock record.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plastiglomerate</b> could {{potentially}} form a marker horizon of human pollution on the geologic record. and may survive as future fossils. <b>Plastiglomerate</b> may also conceivably form in plastic-polluted regions affected by lava flows or forest fires. They {{have been found}} on the surface as well as beneath the sand. This suggests that plastiglomerates are being actively deposited into the sedimentary record. Some geophysicists and geologists speculate that plastiglomerates will not persist in the fossil record, however, or that they might [...] "revert back to a source of oil from whence they came, given the right conditions of burial".|$|E
50|$|<b>Plastiglomerate</b> is a {{term that}} was {{proposed}} by Patricia Corcoran, Charles J. Moore and Kelly Jazvac for a stone that contains mixtures of sedimentary grains, and other natural debris (e.g. shells, wood) that is held together by hardened molten plastic. It has been considered a potential marker of the Anthropocene, an informal epoch of the Quaternary proposed by some social scientists, environmentalists, and geologists.|$|E
50|$|Jazvac is {{also known}} for the <b>Plastiglomerates,</b> which were {{collected}} from Kamilo Beach, Hawaii. The name was proposed by Jazvac alongside Charles Moore and Patricia Corcoran, and it designates a type of stone that contains mixtures of natural debris melded with hardened molten plastic. The <b>plastiglomerates</b> have been displayed as both sculptural ready-mades and as natural history specimens. It {{has been suggested that}} the <b>plastiglomerates</b> may be considered a marker of the Anthropocene.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plastiglomerates</b> form along shorelines where natural {{sedimentary}} {{grains and}} organic debris are agglutinated by melted plastic created during campfire burning. They {{have been reported}} from Kamilo Beach {{on the island of}} Hawaii.|$|R

5000|$|Charles Moore, a sea {{captain and}} {{oceanographer}} for the Algalita Marine Research Institute in Long Beach, California, discovered this substance in 2006 while surveying Kamilo Beach on the Big Island of Hawaiâ€™i. Geology professor, Dr. Patricia Corcoran and Visual artist professor, Kelly Jazvac of the University of Western Ontario investigated the samples on Kamilo Beach in 2012 where they also {{coined the term}} [...] "plastiglomerate". Approximately one-fifth of the plastiglomerates found at Kamilo Beach consisted of fishing debris, one quarter consisted of broken lid containers, and one half consisted of plastic [...] "confetti". The <b>plastiglomerate</b> at Kamilo Beach was more likely created from human campfires than from molten lava flows.|$|E
