5|$|These were {{difficulties}} {{which seemed}} rather {{to require the}} superior force of a Wycherley, or a Congreve, than of a raw and unexperienced pen; for I believe I may boast that none ever appeared so early upon the stage. However, such was the candour of the audience, the play was received with greater satisfaction than I should have <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> from its merit, had it even preceded the Provoked Husband.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
500|$|Love in Several Masques was [...] "neither {{a success}} nor a fiasco", and Fielding {{writes in the}} preface, [...] "the Play was {{received}} with greater Satisfaction than I should have <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> from its Merit". The play was later quoted in The Beauties of Fielding {{more than any of}} Fielding's other plays, according to Thomas Lockwood, [...] "because for anthology reading purposes it supplied far more extractably witty bits than other Fielding plays more representative or still holding the stage." ...|$|E

500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. It was dead. It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I just stopped making records myself, and I suppose that must just seem weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?' The answer is, it wasn't as good [...] And I always <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> I'd never do that, put out a worse record." [...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, MBV, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after Loveless.|$|E

2500|$|She won {{her first}} major {{marathon}} in 2010: seeing off competition including Derartu Tulu, {{she won the}} Nagoya Women's Marathon in 2:27:11, which also doubled as a national championship victory. She was happy with her second ever marathon win, saying: [...] "I have <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> to challenge for a victory many times before but I was unable to attain my goal previously...this time I was determined to win". A victory at the Sapporo Half Marathon in July came after as she held off a challenge from Azausa Nojiri to keep {{the lead in the}} final stages.|$|E
2500|$|Martha Wright {{replaced}} Martin in {{the role}} of Maria on Broadway in October 1961, followed by Karen Gantz in July 1962, Jeannie Carson in August 1962 and Nancy Dussault in September 1962. Jon Voight, who eventually married co-star Lauri Peters, was a replacement for Rolf. The national tour starred Florence Henderson as Maria and Beatrice Krebs as Mother Abbess. It opened at the Grand Riviera Theater, Detroit, on February 27, 1961, and closed November 23, 1963, at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto. Henderson was succeeded by Barbara Meister in June 1962. Theodore Bikel was not satisfied playing the role of the Captain, because of the role's limited singing, [...] and Bikel did not like to play the same role over and over again. In his autobiography, he writes: [...] "I <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> then that if I could afford it, I would never do a run as long as that again." [...] The original Broadway cast album sold three million copies.|$|E
2500|$|Francis Ford Coppola {{was drawn}} to S. E. Hinton's novel Rumble Fish because of the strong {{personal}} identification he had with the subject matter— a younger brother who hero-worships an older, intellectually superior brother, which mirrored the relationship between Coppola and his brother, August. A dedication to August appears as the film's final end credit. The director said that he [...] "started to use Rumble Fish as my carrot for what I <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> when I finished The Outsiders". Halfway through the production of The Outsiders, Coppola decided {{that he wanted to}} retain the same production team, stay in Tulsa, and shoot Rumble Fish right after The Outsiders. He wrote the screenplay for Rumble Fish with Hinton on Sundays, their day off from shooting The Outsiders. During rehearsals, Dillon got used to the adult-like acting behavior and situations after having been in The Outsiders. Dillon and Rourke developed a friendship when filming, getting used to their interesting, mischievous characters.|$|E

[...] exclaimed I, with irrepressible enthusiasm; [...] "this {{shows the}} liberality of the age; this proves, if {{anything}} can, that all musty prejudices {{are in a}} fair way to be obliterated.

I <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> great pleasure in informing him of it when we reach the Celestial City." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah your journalist, your journalist, mademoiselle!" [...] said Maxime de Cliche.

6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} of it," [...] he answered. [...] "The worst {{of it is that}} nothing in the world would induce me to forego the {{pleasure}} I <b>promise</b> <b>myself,</b> before very long, too, of giving to the whole world the story of your infamy.

6000|$|If {{the middle}} of the day prove warm and pleasant, I <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> to take a walk. [...] . I have taken one walk with Mr. Farley; and I could not have {{believed}} that there was such seclusion at so short a distance from a great city. Many spots seem hardly to have been visited for ages,--not since John Eliot preached to the Indians here. If we were to travel a thousand miles, we could not escape the world more completely than we can here.|$|R

60|$|I didn't {{want her}} to think that, nor that she should report to the Pudneys {{that they had not}} been happy in their agent; and I well {{remember}} that this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that should come to her in one of those penny envelopes. My emotion, and I fear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have been as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some diplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.|$|R

60|$|Well, seignior, says he, we {{will not}} be in haste, or view it by halves; for, if wild and uncouth places be a {{diversion}} to you, I <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> your curiosity shall be fully gratified; but as to extraordinary things, rarities in nature, and surprising incidents, which foreigners expect, I cannot say much to those. However, what think you, seignior, says he, if we should take a tour a little way into the entrance of the hills which I showed you the other day, and look upon the gate of this gulf? Perhaps your curiosity may be satisfied with the first day's prospect, which I assure you will be none of the most pleasant, and you may find yourself sick of the enterprise.|$|R
