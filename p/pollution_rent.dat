5000|$|Since ecologists are {{primarily}} concerned with conservation, they tend to emphasize less the issue of equitably distributing scarcity/pollution rents, whereas Georgists insist that unearned income not accrue to those who hold title to natural assets and pollution privilege. To the extent that geoists recognize the effect of pollution or share conservationist values, they will agree with ecological economists {{about the need to}} limit pollution, but geoists will also insist that <b>pollution</b> <b>rents</b> generated from those conservation efforts do not accrue to polluters and are instead used for public purposes or to compensate those who suffer the negative effects of pollution. Ecological economists advocate similar pollution restrictions but, emphasizing conservation first, might be willing to grant private polluters the privilege to capture <b>pollution</b> <b>rents.</b> To the extent that ecological economists share the geoist view of social justice, they would advocate auctioning pollution quotas instead of giving them away for free. [...] This distinction {{can be seen in the}} difference between basic cap and trade and the geoist variation, cap and share, a proposal to auction temporary <b>pollution</b> permits, with <b>rents</b> going to the public, instead of giving pollution privilege away for free to existing polluters or selling perpetual permits.|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{this type}} of pseudo-tax is to reduce carbon {{emission}} rates. This is similar to the cap-and-trade system, with the main difference being that citizens receive dividend payments financed from <b>pollution</b> <b>rents</b> that are publicly captured, as opposed to leaving the value of pollution privileges to become financialized as private assets. The dividend payments can also finance the addition of incentives designed to encourage consumers to increase energy efficiency, whereas cap-and-trade does not directly involve the consumer. The Healthy Climate Trust Fund is the agency in the U.S. government who are overseeing the cap-and-dividend policy. They will accomplish this by collecting and distributing the funds from the capping process.|$|R

40|$|In this comment, I analyze Damania's {{political}} economy model (Environmental and Resource Economics 13 : 415 – 433, 1999), correcting some flaws and clarifying some ambiguities. I arguethat {{the political parties}} are identical {{at the outset of}} the game. Onlyafter the parties have chosen the instrument (standards or taxation) and thestrictness of environmental policy do the environmentalists and thepolluting firms know which party to support in the election campaign. Inequilibrium, both parties choose the same platform, so that both have anequal probability of winning the election.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{political}} lobbying on the choice of environmental policy instruments. It is argued that the prevalence of pollution emission standards over more efficient policy instruments may result from rent seeking behaviour. The model further predicts that when an emission standard is used to control pollution, rival political parties {{have an incentive to}} set the same standard. There is therefore a convergence of policies. Moreover, it is shown that emission taxes {{are more likely to be}} supported and proposed by political parties which represent environmental interest groups. This feature appears to accord with the observed support for environmental taxes by ‘Green’ parties in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere.

40|$|Abstract: We {{construct}} a strategic trade model {{of an international}} duopoly, whereby production by exporting firms generates a local pollutant. Governments use environmental policies, i. e., an emissions standard or a tax, to control <b>pollution</b> and for <b>rent</b> shifting purposes. Contrary to their firm, however, governments are unable to perfectly foresee the actual level of demand, the cost of abatement and the damage caused from pollution. Under these modes of uncertainty we derive sufficient conditions under which the governments optimally choose an emissions tax over an emissions standard...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of electromagnetic pollution, noise and air <b>pollution</b> on the <b>rent</b> level for the aggregated and disaggregated market {{in the city of}} Zurich, Switzerland. Although there is no conclusive assessment about the health impacts of electromagnetic radiation people are nonetheless concerned about possible long term risks associated with the exposure. This risk perception may affect the price of dwellings located close to antenna. The regression results show that the environmental variables considered have the expected sign and are highly significant, with exception of the presence of an antenna and the air pollution for the non-profit submarket. However, the greatest part of the variation is explained by the structural variables.|$|R

40|$|The carbon {{emissions}} abatement, undertaken by some countries, may induce {{other countries to}} increase their own emissions. This effect, known as "carbon leakage", {{may be due to}} rather different mechanisms. The simplest case is when outside countries do not change their environmental policies and world prices are fixed. Unilateral policies may then induce a substitution of domestic production, generating emissions, with imports. This paper analyses the carbon leakage generated under the "small open economy" assumption, illustrating some findings through a numerical, dynamic, general equilibrium model of the Italian economy. The analysis highlights two main points. First, in a general equilibrium setting, the carbon leakage depends on both the substitution and income effects. Income effects, in turn, crucially depend on how carbon tax revenues are recycled, or <b>pollution</b> rights <b>rents</b> are assigned. Different recycling schemes have rather different impacts on the national income and on the trade-induced leakage. Second, carbon leakage may be significantly affected by the degree of capital mobility in international markets, because capital services enter the balance of trade. Capital outflows amount to exports of capital services, possibly financing the import of carbon-intensive goods. This result suggests that, in a world of increasingly integrated financial markets, unilateral environmental policies are becoming less effective, because of the existence of policy spill-overs...|$|R
