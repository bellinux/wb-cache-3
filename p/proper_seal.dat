Leakage and the subsequent loss of ventilation resulting from improperly sealed stoppings can lead to unhealthy and unsafe working conditions.

The study also examines sealing considerations for stoppings that are constructed under roof control screen, the effects that wooden wedges had on inhibiting efficient application of polyurethane foam sealant, and airflow leakage through the surrounding coal. The work involved building a stopping in a dead end room of the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine and then pressurising the room using compressed air. Stopping leakage was evaluated by measuring air pressure loss in the enclosed room due to the air leakage. Part of the research utilises a diluted soap solution that was applied to the stopping and the surrounding coal to detect air leakage signified by bubble formations.

50|$|Rifles were {{initially}} single-shot, muzzle-loading weapons.

50|$|Unlike {{wine that}} {{contains}} tannins which may change over time, {{even in a}} bottle if proper storage conditions are not met, spirituous liquors like tequila do not change much once they are bottled. Since tequila is a distilled liquor, {{it does not require}} strict storage conditions like wine does, and the same goes with most other distilled spirits such as whiskey, rum, or vodka. Furthermore, because the characteristics and certain quality (flavor, aroma, color, etc.) of the tequila are determined during the aging process inside wood barrels, the quality of the tequila should remain relatively constant after they are bottled. To maintain the quality of tequila, at least three conditions should be met: constant and moderate temperature (60 to 65 °F), no exposure to direct sunlight, and maintenance of <b>proper</b> <b>seal</b> of the bottle. Also, storage conditions will have more effect on the taste of aged tequila rather than the un-aged tequila.

40|$|The {{goal for}} this thesis is to {{minimize}} clearances and tolerances, {{in order to}} prevent water leakage. A <b>proper</b> <b>seal</b> on the seal rings does not let excess water flow through the turbine runner, thus conserving more water and wasting less energy. Moreover, water leakage past worn wear plates allows for an extra load for the turbine when operating in condense mode. When the wicket gates are closed, water leakage past worn plates wastes mechanical energy in the water; thus, decreasing the efficiency of the Francis turbine, especially when operating at partial loads. Furthermore, the wicket gates also known as guide vanes can increase the efficiency of the turbine in their relation to their laminar profile and <b>proper</b> <b>seal.</b> Water is a very vital resource in today 2 ̆ 7 s society. This thesis illustrates how existing hydro machinery can be improved to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels as an electric energy source. This study provides actual examples of improvements using the generating units located at Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam located in Boulder City, NV is part of the Lower Colorado Region, of the U. S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation. Overhauling a hydro unit to obtain better efficiency is very similar to overhauling a vehicles engine to improve the vehicles fuel economy. Modifying and replacing three major hydro-machinery components: seal rings, wear plates, and wicket gates, improves the efficiency of Hoover Dam units by an average of 2 percent. This increase in capacity equates to an additional 8, 000 MW-hrs per year per unit. The wholesale market value of this increase in energy and capacity, roughly equates to about 290, 000 per unit per year [1].

A total of 50 maxillary central incisors randomly divided into 5 experimental groups (n= 8). After preparation of the root canals with step back technique, in groups 1 and 2, post spaces were prepared and 4 or 5 [*]mm gutta-percha remained in the apical, respectively. In groups 3, 4, and 5, there was 1 - 2 and 3 [*]mm MTA in the apical, respectively. The ten teeth serve as control groups. The teeth were connected to a bacterial microleakage evaluation system. The study period was 120 days and the samples were evaluated on ten-day intervals; Meier-Kaplan technique was used for estimation of the mean time of microleakage to occur. Log-rank test was used for comparison of microleakage. Results. Number of samples exhibiting microleakage in MTA was less than those of gutta-percha at all intervals.

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFC) in a flat-plate {{configuration}} require a hermetic seal between the fuel and air {{sides of the}} electrodes, and this seal must withstand a variety of thermally-induced stresses over the lifetime of the cell. In this study, quantitative microstructure-property relationships are developed to predict optimum seal structures for mechanical properties and thermal expansion coefficient criteria. These relationships are used to create an inverse approach to characterizing the processing method from the desired microstructure. The main focus of the work concentrates on providing tools to enable macroscopic property predictions from the constituent properties using homogenization techniques based on the individual phase properties and microstructure morphology. The microstructure is represented by two-point correlation functions. Statistical continuum mechanics models were then employed and developed to predict the mechanical and thermal properties of the material. The models enable the prediction of elastic modulus and {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the multi-phase material. The inelastic mechanical behavior was also studied, indicating microstructure dependence.

40|$|Prosthetic socket liners {{provide both}} {{suspension}} and stability, {{and they do}} so best when they cover the remaining limb without breaks in the liner surface. This full coverage conflicts {{with the need to}} acquire myoelectric signals directly from the skin. Early solutions to this problem include windows in the liner and metal electrodes piercing and thereby weakening the liner. Windows compromise the integrity of the liner and often lead to discomfort {{at the edge of the}} window. Metal electrodes require attachment of external wires after donning. Another alternative is to mount cased electrodes in molded silicone receptacles. This may result in a <b>proper</b> <b>seal,</b> but it requires repeated removal of the electrode from the liner. The problems identified above can be addressed by passing the myoelectric signals directly though the liner with flexible Conductive Inserts.

LTI has developed Conductive Inserts that not only pass myoelectric signals through the liner but also allow for misalignment when the liner is inserted into the socket.
