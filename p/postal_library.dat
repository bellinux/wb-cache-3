50|$|From {{the time}} when it ﬁrst arose as a village, Frohnhofen was laid out for agriculture, {{although}} the practice of growing sweet cherries only {{dates back to the}} Electorate of the Palatinate times. It may be that there was already a mill standing at the brook in the Middle Ages. Whenever it was built, it was destroyed in the Thirty Years' War and was never restored. Beginning in the 18th century, collieries arose in the outlying countryside around the local villages, where workers from Frohnhofen also found jobs. Even until relatively recent times, there were workers in the village who commuted to jobs at coalmines in the nearby Saarland. Likewise setting up shop in neighbouring villages but not in Frohnhofen itself were the diamond-cutting shops, where workers from Frohnhofen nonetheless sometimes also earned a living. Today, the village is a residential community for people in various lines of work, most of whom must commute elsewhere. There is not {{much in the way of}} meaningful job opportunities in Frohnhofen itself. For basic food supplies, Frohnhofen has a grocer’s shop and a branch butcher’s shop. Rounding out the commercial offerings are a cabinetmaker’s shop, two heating system builders and a hairdresser’s. The village also has a <b>postal</b> agency, a <b>library</b> and a children’s playground. At the Entenweiher (“Duckpond”), the Pfälzerwaldverein (a hiking club) maintains a cabin. There are opportunities to expand tourism. Agriculture nowadays plays only a subordinate role in Frohnhofen’s economy.|$|R
