40|$|A {{simplified}} {{analytical approach}} for modeling the synchronous instability {{phenomenon known as}} Morton effect is presented. The analysis is straight forward and easily applied to any rotor supported on fluid film bearings. The analysis clarifies the interaction of three distinct machine characteristics which combine to create a case of Morton effect. Some example calculations are shown illustrating the possible types of spiral vibration. In addition, an analytical approach is described for estimating {{the magnitude of the}} shaft temperature difference in a journal bearing as a direct function of the shaft orbit. It is significant that this method can readily be applied to any type of journal <b>bearing,</b> from <b>plain</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> to tilting pad bearings. Example calculations using the method are shown...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> use two {{surfaces}} lubricated {{with oil}} or grease as a friction contact. They often use porous sintered sleeves to be self-lubricating, requiring only infrequent maintenance or replacement. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are less durable at higher temperatures as the contact surfaces wear and the lubricant dries up, eventually leading to failure; however, lifetime {{is similar to}} that of ball-bearing types (generally a little less) at relatively low ambient temperatures. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> may be more likely to fail at higher temperatures, and may perform poorly when mounted in any orientation other than vertical. The typical lifespan of a sleeve-bearing fan may be around 30,000 hours at 50 °C. Fans that use <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are generally cheaper than fans that use ball bearings, and are quieter at lower speeds early in their life, but can become noisy as they age.|$|R

5000|$|Rifle {{bearings}} {{are similar}} to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> but are quieter and have almost as much lifespan as ball bearings. The bearing has a spiral groove in it that pumps fluid from a reservoir. This allows them to be safely mounted with the shaft horizontal (unlike <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings),</b> since the fluid being pumped lubricates {{the top of the}} shaft. The pumping also ensures sufficient lubricant on the shaft, reducing noise, and increasing lifespan.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 32 One {{property}} of heavily to moderately loaded <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> is the resulting asymmetric stiffness and damping coefficients. These asymmetric properties often result in split {{first critical speed}}s. Since the horizontal stiffness is much softer than the vertical, a horizontal first critical speed may appear from several hundred to several thousand revolutions per minute lower than the vertical first critical. Tilting pad bearings produce more symmetric bearing properties. This symmetry usually results in a single unsplit first critical speed that is located approximately midway between the <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> split peaks. Two different case histories are examined. An induction motor and a steam turbine were both initially designed with tilting pad bearings. Both rotor bearing systems resulted in first critical speeds in the operating speed range. Numerous attempts to shift the critical out of the operating range were explored without success. As a last attempt short of a complete rotor redesign, switching to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> was successful. Analytical results that support the decision to switch to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are shown along with actual test stand response plots. Additionally, for the steam turbine, results from a high speed balance are presented along with actual field speed-amplitude plots. While a tilting pad to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> change is not recommended for all classes of turbomachinery to shift critical speeds, it is a powerful design tool as it may produce critical speed changes of up to 1000 rpm...|$|R

40|$|This paper shows a {{theoretical}} vibration analysis regarding excitation due to elliptical shaft journals in <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> of electrical motors, {{based on a}} simplified rotordynamic model. It is shown that elliptical shaft journals lead to kinematic constraints regarding {{the movement of the}} shaft journals on the oil film of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> and therefore to an excitation of the rotordynamic system. The solution of the linear differential equation system leads to the mathematical description of the movement of the rotor mass, the shaft journals, and the <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> housings. Additionally the relative movements between the shaft journals and the bearing housings are deduced, as well as the bearing housing vibration velocities. The presented simplified rotordynamic model can also be applied to rotating machines, other than electrical machines. In this case, only the electromagnetic spring value cm has to be put to zero...|$|R
40|$|Plastic sliding {{bearings}} in massive and composite structure mostly {{are used as}} wearing bearing. The author tries to improve the availability of thermoplastic massive {{sliding bearings}} with radial realization under different operation conditions. Experiments with initial lubrication and start-stop operation are described. The wear behavior of thermoplastic massive sliding bearings is determined with run-up and run-out experiments. The experiments concerning to the sliding bearings are realized on special test stands. This considers the fact that proceedings in thermoplastic sliding bearings {{are a part of}} complex tribologic systems. Short-time experiments provide sufficiently exact statements according to specific wear rates. If the thermoplastic sliding bearing works at its maximum load, the chemical degradation of the plastics and a reduction of the durability of the storage material may be observed. An initial lubrication with fat decreases the medium-coefficient of friction, the specific shear rate and storage temperatures. Non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> can be used successfully at start-stop operations. In comparison to endurance tests with non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> little medium coefficients of friction and little specific wear rates are established in start-stop operation. Endurance tests with non lubricated sheathed bearings provide little medium coefficients of friction in comparison to non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The specific wear rate is higher {{as in the case of}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The basic estimations with respect to the endurance tests with non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are transferable to the start-stop experiments. 114 figs., 37 tabs., 152 refs.

40|$|Modern {{heavy duty}} diesel engines utilize turbochargers for {{increased}} power output. Also, {{a wide range}} of power levels can be achieved with one engine displacement through the use of different turbocharger configurations, eliminating the need for several different sized engines. These are the reasons that virtually all diesel truck engines currently marketed use turbochargers. However, because these turbochargers rely on ring seals and oil-lubricated floating <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> they often suffer breakdowns. These turbochargers operate at elevated temperatures which often causes the oil to degrade and even coke to the bearing surfaces. This can lead to catastrophic failure, increased particulate emissions from oil leaks, and, in extreme cases, engine fires. Replacing the oil lubricated bearings from these turbochargers with some other device is desirable to eliminate these inherent problems. Foil bearings are compliant selecting bearings lubricated by air and are well suited to high speed, light load applications. Thus, foil bearings present one potential replacement for oil-lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> Their use as such is investigated in this work...|$|R
