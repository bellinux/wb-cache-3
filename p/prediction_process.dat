His choice of which hay to eat first was interpreted as indicating his prediction of a win for the country whose flag was on that box.

40|$|Background The {{multiple}} object tracking (MOT) {{paradigm is}} a cognitive task that requires parallel tracking of several identical, moving objects following nongoal-directed, arbitrary motion trajectories. Aims The current study aimed {{to investigate the}} employment of <b>prediction</b> <b>processes</b> during MOT. As an indicator for the involvement of <b>prediction</b> <b>processes,</b> we targeted the human premotor cortex (PM). The PM has been repeatedly implicated to serve the internal modeling of future actions and action effects, as well as purely perceptual events, by means of predictive feedforward functions. Materials and methods Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), BOLD activations recorded during MOT were contrasted with those recorded during the execution of a cognitive control task that used an identical stimulus display and demanded similar attentional load. A particular effort was made to identify and exclude previously found activation in the PM-adjacent frontal eye fields (FEF). Results We replicated prior results, revealing occipitotemporal, parietal, and frontal areas to be engaged in MOT. Discussion The activation in frontal areas is interpreted to originate from dorsal and ventral premotor cortices. The results are discussed in light of our assumption that MOT engages <b>prediction</b> <b>processes.</b> Conclusion We propose that our results provide first clues that MOT does not only involve visuospatial perception and attention <b>processes,</b> but <b>prediction</b> <b>processes</b> as well...|$|R

40|$|Both {{theoretical}} {{proposals and}} empirical {{studies suggest that}} the brain interprets sensory input based on expectations to mitigate computational burden. However, as social beings, much of sensory input is affectively loaded – e. g., the smile of a partner, the critical voice of a boss, or the welcoming gesture of a friend. Given that affective information is highly complex and often ambiguous, building up expectations of upcoming affective sensory input may greatly contribute to its rapid and efficient processing. This review points to the role of affective information {{in the context of the}} ‘predictive brain’. It particularly focuses on repetition suppression (RS) effects that have recently been linked to <b>prediction</b> <b>processes.</b> The findings are interpreted as evidence for more pronounced <b>prediction</b> <b>processes</b> with affective material. Importantly, it is argued that bottom-up attention inflates the neural RS effect, and because affective stimuli tend to attract more bottom-up attention, it thereby particularly overshadows the magnitude of RS effects for this information. Finally, anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, are briefly discussed as manifestations of modulations in affective prediction...|$|R

The research involved 241 students and 371 adults and has been carried out in two waves. The data have been analyzed by means of structural equation models. In each group, the hypothesized model shows a good fit to data and most of the predicted relations between constructs are significant and in the expected direction. The model explains 23 % of the behavior variance for the students and 22 % for the adults. The portion of variance of intention explained by antecedents variables is 39 % for the adults and 59 % for the students.

50|$|GNSS {{differs from}} {{traditional}} navigation systems because the satellites {{and areas of}} degraded coverage are in constant motion. Therefore, if a satellite fails or is taken out of service for maintenance, it is not immediately clear which areas of the airspace will be affected, if any. The location and duration of these outages can be predicted {{with the aid of}} computer analysis and reported to pilots during the pre-flight planning process.

50|$|This {{group of}} methods {{makes use of}} known protein complex {{structures}} to predict and structurally model interactions between query protein sequences. The <b>prediction</b> <b>process</b> generally starts by employing a sequence based method (e.g. Interolog) to search for protein complex structures that are homologous to the query sequences. These known complex structures are then used as templates to structurally model the interaction between query sequences. This method {{has the advantage of}} not only inferring protein interactions but also suggests models of how proteins interact structurally, which can provide some insights into the atomic level mechanism of that interaction. On the other hand, the ability for these methods to make a prediction is constrained by a limited number of known protein complex structures.|$|E
5000|$|The use of Precobs {{has risen}} {{different}} questions and concerns. One {{of the main}} concerns of predictive policing software in general and hence of Precobs refers {{to the use of}} data the software needs to forecast any crimes. Since the software does not use any personal information and the final decision is always met by a police officer, the Bavarian Data Security Officer has qualified Precobs as unproblematic. [...] However, critics of Precobs refer to the possibility of enriching the near repeat <b>prediction</b> <b>process</b> with data deriving from the internet of things and social networks. [...] For example, a 2014 published study suggests that the use of real time Twitter messages could improve automated crime prediction significantly. Other authors believe that the use of Precobs or comparable systems could be a justification for authorities to broadly expand the collection of data. Furthermore, critics question the reliability of the data produced by predictive policing systems. Generally, the causal link between the reduction in crime numbers and the use of predictive policing software has been doubted. When tested in Nuremberg, Germany, for example, numbers of break-ins first decreased in the typically burglary-intensive autumn, but then went up again in December. One of the often articulated concerns in this context is that authorities might tend to rely too easily on software predictions instead of their grown experience.|$|E
30|$|There {{is also a}} {{realization}} that it is equally important, if not more so, to accurately represent the uncertainty function across the whole space. Spatial uncertainty modeling {{is a key element}} in the regression-based <b>prediction</b> <b>processes.</b> Moreover, the spatial uncertainty functions may change over time due to the underlying geomorphic processes, and this can be evaluated with a stochastic estimator, such as a Kalman filter (Kalman 1960). For example, Mardia et al. (1998) and Cortes (2009) suggested the combination of spatial and temporal modeling by using Kriging and Kalman filters.|$|R

After error trials (i. e., when the ball missed the target), we found a sharp negative deflection in the EEG peaking 250 ms after ball release (mean amplitude: t = - 2. 5, df = 20, p = 0. 02) and another broader negative deflection following the first, reaching from about 300 ms after release until unambiguous visual knowledge of results (KR; hitting or passing by the target; mean amplitude: t = - 7. 5, df = 20, p < 0. 001).
