40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Our view of {{phytoplankton}} {{has historically}} revolved around {{their inability to}} control their location in space. The term phytoplankton itself underscores this particular difference between phytoplankton and their sessile terrestrial counterparts. Yet there are other differences between land plants and the phytoplankton that are perhaps equally important, beyond this sessile-planktonic dichotomy, to their growth, survival, and productivity. For example, phytoplankton are microbes and thus are short-lived, with generational scales {{on the order of}} days or less. An intriguing question to ask is how today’s pelagic ecology would differ, had this temporal difference between plants and phytoplankton been initially emphasized, perhaps by naming these microbes phytoephemera instead? This dissertation addresses certain aspects of the ecology of phytoplankton that result from their having short generational scales. Because they are so short lived, phytoplankton need to adjust their photosynthetic physiology to cope with more rapid changes in irradiance than may matter to longer-lived plants. Photoacclimation on the hours-plus time scales has been studied extensively in the phytoplankton, because its temporal scales match those of vertical mixing processes in the ocean. Yet most phytoplankton exhibit faster <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> as well, down to the time scales of seconds. These <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> have received considerably less attention in phytoplankton ecology. This dissertation specifically examines these rapid, seconds-to-hour scale <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> in phytoplankton. First, the physiological bases of rapid photosynthetic regulation were examined using a numerical model that shows how specific physiological changes in phytoplankton photosystems either constrain or enhance light harvesting. This model is stochastic, and thus replicates certain nonlinear aspects of light harvesting better than equation-based analytical models. Also in this dissertation, a laboratory study is described that examined rapid photosynthetic regulation in three model phytoplankton. Results suggest that rapid photosynthetic regulation is not only constrained to higher eukaryotic phytoplankton, but also occurs in the two dominant marine photosynthetic prokaryotes, Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. Finally, rapid <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> were examined in field assemblages at Station ALOHA in the North Pacific. This ocean region experiences considerable cloud cover, which may result in a strong degree of rapid <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses,</b> even in near-surface assemblages...|$|R
40|$|The {{seagrass}} Posidonia oceanica {{is widely}} recognized as an effective bioindicator of the health status of Mediterranean coastal waters. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, in particular through the Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry method, are performed to study aquatic plant ecology and vitality and to assess their responses to diverse stressful factors. However, the current understanding of P. oceanica <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> to environmental stresses does only allow scientists to use the PAM-method as a complementary tool to other more-robust monitoring techniques. Consequently, a more in-depth knowledge of the natural causes of variability of P. oceanica <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> are a prerequisite to any surveys relying on that time and cost-effective method. In {{the framework of the}} STARECAPMED project, this work aimed to determine the influence of several environmental (depth, daytime, season) and plant-specific characteristics (leaf age, leaf part analyzed, epiphytic coverage) on the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> (Y, ETR, RLC) of P. oceanica. Water temperature, irradiance and several biochemical parameters of the seagrass (chl. a, chl. b, C, N, P, micronutrients such as Fe, Cu) were measured as well. The field survey was performed in a pristine meadow in the Calvi Bay, Corsica. Environmental and plant-physiological characteristics deeply influenced P. oceanica <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses.</b> As an example, ETR decreased with depth, contrary to Y that mostly increased. ETR was lower in the basal part of leaf blade, and the epiphytic coverage of leaf tips slightly increased their ETR compared to leaf tips cleaned of epiphytes. Depth and leaf part-related variations in RLC were also observed. Because of this natural variability, it appears essential to develop a consensual protocol of chlorophyll fluorescence measurements to publish reliable and comparable results between studies. We therefore notably suggest to perform measurements close to midday, when <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> are the highest; at 10 - 15 m depth in order to avoid, among others, low depth light irradiance variability; on the middle part of the 3 rd- 4 th external leaf, well developed, highly photosynthetic, and little epiphyted. Finally, because P. oceanica fluorescence was correlated with N, P and chl. b leaf contents, the PAM-method could afterwards be used as bioindicator technique, according to the protocol proposed.

However, there is little understanding of their interactive effects on carbon uptake and growth. We hypothesized that: (1) {{in the absence of}} defoliation, photosynthetic rate and leaf respiration would be governed by limiting resource(s) and their impact on sink limitation; (2) <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> to defoliation would be a consequence of changing source:sink relationships and increased availability of limiting resources; and (3) photosynthesis and leaf respiration would be adjusted in response to limiting resources and defoliation so that growth could be maintained. We tested these hypotheses by examining how leaf photosynthetic processes, respiration, carbohydrate concentrations and growth rates of Eucalyptus globulus were influenced by high or low water and nitrogen (N) availability, and/or defoliation. Photosynthesis of saplings grown with low water was primarily sink limited, whereas <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> of saplings grown with low N were suggestive of source limitation. Defoliation resulted in source limitation. Net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> to defoliation were linked to the degree of resource availability, with the largest responses measured in treatments where saplings were ultimately source rather than sink limited. There was good evidence of acclimation to stress, enabling higher rates of C uptake than might otherwise have occurred...|$|R

50|$|As {{can be seen}} in the graph, {{two species}} can have {{different}} responses to the same incremental changes in light intensity. Population A (in blue) has an initial rate higher than that of Population B (in red) and also exhibits a stronger rate change to increased light intensities at lower irradiance. Therefore, Population A will dominate in an environment with lower light availability. Although Population B has a slower <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>response</b> to increases in light intensity its Pmax is higher than that of Population A. This allows for eventual population dominance at greater light intensities. There are many determining factors influencing population success; using the PI curve to elicit predictions of rate flux to environmental changes is useful for monitoring phytoplankton bloom dynamics and ecosystem stability.|$|E
50|$|In botany, a light curve {{shows the}} <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>response</b> of leaf tissue or algal {{communities}} to varying light intensities. The {{shape of the}} curve illustrates the principle of limiting factors; in low light levels, the rate of photosynthesis {{is limited by the}} concentration of chlorophyll and the efficiency of the light-dependent reactions, but in higher light levels it is limited by the efficiency of RuBisCo and the availability of carbon dioxide. The point on the curve where these two differing slopes meet is called the light saturation point and is where the light-dependent reactions are producing more ATP and NADPH than can be utilized by the light-independent reactions. Since photosynthesis is also limited by ambient carbon dioxide levels, light curves are often repeated at several different constant carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E

Examination of <b>photosynthetic</b> CO 2 <b>response</b> curves, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf thickness showed that this acclimation was most likely caused by reduction in Rubisco activity and a shift towards ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate regeneration-limited photosynthesis, but not a consequence of changes in mesophyll conductance. Also, measurements of the maximum efficiency of PSII and the carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio of leaves indicated that {{it was unlikely that}} the pattern of A (sat) seen was a consequence of growth [CO 2] induced stress.

50|$|FORECAST {{has four}} stages in its application: 1) data {{assembly}} and input verification, 2) establishing the ecosystem {{condition for the}} beginning of a simulation run (by simulating the known or assumed history of the site), 3) defining a management and/or natural disturbance regime, and 4) simulating this regime and analyzing model output. The first two stages represent model calibration. Calibration data are assembled that describe the accumulation of biomass (above and below-ground components) in trees and minor vegetation for three chronosequences of stands, each one developed under relatively homogeneous site conditions, representing three different nutritional site qualities. Tree biomass and stand self-thinning rate data are often generated from the height, DBH and stand density output of traditional growth and yield models in conjunction with species-specific component biomass allometric equations. To calibrate the nutritional aspects of the model, data describing the concentration of nutrients in the various biomass components are required. FORECAST also requires data on the degree of shading produced by different quantities of foliage and the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>response</b> of foliage to different light levels (photosynthetic light saturation curves for either average foliage or separately for sun and shade adapted foliage). A comparable but simpler set of data for minor vegetation must be provided if the user wishes to represent this ecosystem component. Lastly, data describing the rates of decomposition of various litter types and soil organic matter are required for the model to simulate nutrient cycling. Simulation of soil leaching losses and certain measures of soil nutrient availability require input data that define cation and anion exchange capacity data for organic matter and mineral soil, and sorption-desorption processes. The second aspect of calibration requires running the model in “set-up” mode to establish initial site conditions. The detailed representation of many different litter types and soil organic matter conditions makes it impractical to measure initial litter and soil pools and conditions directly in the field; consequently, the model is used to generate starting conditions.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{nitric oxide}} (NO) and/or sulfur (S) on stomatal and <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> was studied in mustard (Brassica juncea L.) in {{presence}} or absence of salt stress. The combined application of 100 µM NO (as sodium nitroprusside) and 200 mg S kg- 1 soil (excess-S) more prominently influenced stomatal behaviour, <b>photosynthetic</b> and growth <b>responses</b> in the absence of salt stress and alleviated salt stress effects on photosynthesis. Plants receiving combined treatment of NO plus excess-S showed well-developed thylakoid membrane and properly stacked grana lamellae under salt stress, while the chloroplasts from salt-stressed plants had disorganized thylakoids. Moreover, the leaves from the NO and excess-S treated plants exhibited lower superoxide ion accumulation under salt stress, induced activity of ATP-sulfurylase (ATPS), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) and optimized NO generation that helped in minimizing oxidative stress. The enhanced S-assimilation of these plants resulted in increased production of cysteine (Cys) and glutathione (GSH) reduced. These findings indicated that NO influenced photosynthesis under salt stress by regulating oxidative stress and its effects on S-assimilation, an antioxidant system and NO generation. The results suggest that NO improves <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> of plants grown under salt stress more effectively when plants received excess-S. Thus, excess-S conditions may be adopted for higher impact of NO in the reversal of salt stress effects on photosynthesis...|$|R

To reveal the molecular mechanisms of their <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>response</b> to fluctuating light, we examined the role of two cyclic electron flows around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) - one depending on PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR 5) and one on NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) - in photosynthetic regulation under fluctuating light in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The impairment of PGR 5 -dependent CEF-PSI suppressed the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>response</b> immediately after sudden irradiation, whereas the impairment of NDH-dependent CEF-PSI did not. However, the impairment of either PGR 5 -dependent or NDH-dependent CEF-PSl reduced the photosynthetic rate under fluctuating light, leading to photoinhibition at PSI and consequently a reduction in plant biomass. The results highlight that (1) PGR 5 -dependent CEF-PSI is a key regulator of rapid photosynthetic responses to high light intensity under fluctuating light conditions after constant high light; and (2) both PGR 5 -dependent and NDH-dependent CEF-PSI have physiological roles in sustaining photosynthesis and plant growth in rice under repeated light fluctuations.

The <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> observed following defoliation could be attributed to changes in source:sink ratios.

Application of N before defoliation allowed trees to compensate for the effect of defoliation on stem diameter growth, which could not be explained simply in terms of increases in Amax.

Using the pressure chamber, ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir seedlings which were planted in early spring were monitored for both seasonal and diurnal changes in moisture stress throughout the first growing season until the fall rains recharged the soil. Differences in seedling growth and-survival during the three years of measurement were related to moisture stress levels experienced by the seedlings.

Douglas-fir showed an almost linear decline in photosynthesis from a maximum when plant moisture stress (PMS) was less than 8 atm to 20...|$|E
40|$|Arid and {{semi-arid}} ecosystems of {{the southwestern}} U. S. are experiencing major {{changes that have}} profound impacts for community structure and ecosystem function. First, these ecosystems are experiencing dramatic shifts in vegetation composition {{as a result of}} the invasion of non-native species. Second these ecosystems are predicted to undergo substantial shifts in climate regime, which include increases in the variability and frequency of extreme temperature and precipitation events. It is not well understood how these current and predicted changes will affect the physiological performance of different plant types in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. To address the effect of these changes, this dissertation focused on the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>response</b> of a native and non-native grass species, and dominant shrub species to precipitation across contrasting soil surfaces in southeastern Arizona. The native and non-native grasses were exposed to wet and dry seasonal precipitation and responses to precipitation events ('pulses') were measured over the course of a summer growing season. To gain a mechanistic understanding of these patterns, the biochemical and diffusion limitations to photosynthetic function were measured over the course of a pulse period. Building on this foundation, natural stands of the non-native grass species were exposed to sequences of different sized pulse events. The physiological performance of a dominant shrub species, Larrea tridentata, was measured in order to determine the biochemical and diffusional constraints to photosynthetic function across seasons and contrasting soil surfaces. The results showed that leaf area development of these grass species affects water availability and time lags in <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>response.</b> Initial soil moisture conditions across contrasting soil surfaces influence the magnitude of <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>response</b> in grasses. Large photosynthetic responses of the non-native grass require large and consecutive precipitation pulses. Co-limitation of photosynthesis of Larrea tridentata by diffusion and biochemistry does not illustrate typical trends across seasons and soil surfaces. Overall results demonstrate the importance of determining the mechanisms responsible for observed leaf-level photosynthetic patterns across individual pulse events, seasons, and contrasting soil surfaces. This is especially important for predicting the magnitude of the response of plant communities in arid and semi-arid ecosystems to species invasions and changes in climate...|$|E
40|$|Ideally, {{terrestrial}} biogeochemical models {{should be}} based soundly on empirical data. One of the roadblocks {{on the path to}} achieving this ideal is that empirical data are often not available in forms useable in models. We address this roadblock by using common model assumptions as frameworks for meta-analysis of experimental data. This approach to meta-analysis yields estimates of model parameters and their responses to environmental change, which are directly useable in models. We present several examples of this approach, including analysis of <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> to temperature; stomatal responses to drought and CO 2; and interactive effects of CO 2 and temperature on plant growth. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{estimated}} the major <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) seedlings {{to the impact}} of elevated carbon dioxide concentration ([CO 2]). We focused on the diurnal changes in Rubisco (ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase) enzyme activity. Rubisco catalyses carboxylation of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate (RuBP), the first step of photosynthetic carbon assimilation, in competition with oxygenation of RuBP that leads to the photorespiratory pathway. Our analysis shows that the short-term exposure to elevated [CO 2] doesn’t change the carboxylation properties of Rubisco enzyme. The significant increase in CO 2 assimilation rate is thus caused mainly by the suppressed photorespiration...|$|R
50|$|Vines {{are unique}} in that they have {{multiple}} evolutionary origins and {{a wide range of}} phenotypic plasticity. They usually reside in tropical locations and have the unique ability to climb. Vines are able to grow in both deep shade and full sun due to their wide range of phenotypic plasticity. This climbing action prevents shading by neighbors and allows the vine to grow out of reach of herbivores The environment where a vine can grow successfully is determined by the climbing mechanism of a vine and how far it can spread across supports. There are many theories supporting the idea that <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>responses</b> are closely related to climbing mechanisms.|$|R
