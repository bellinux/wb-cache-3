50|$|By {{the turn}} of the ninth century, nails were tinted with scented red oils, and {{polished}} or buffed. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, people preferred a polished rather than a painted look by mixing tinted powders and creams into their nails, then buffing them until shiny. One type of <b>polishing</b> <b>product</b> sold around this time was Graf's Hyglo nail polish paste.|$|E
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to make optimal process planning for <b>polishing</b> <b>product</b> because of the complex processes and the multi-criteria, attributes and vagueness of process parameters. To solve this problem, this paper combines the methodologies of Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and fuzzy Set Theory (FST) to support process planners in planning processes and making decisions effectively for <b>polishing</b> <b>product.</b> Moreover, various mathematical models are designed and integrated to the Web Based Portal System (WBPS) which supports the optimization computation of process parameter settings and case reasoning for <b>polishing</b> <b>product.</b> Finally, some cooker samples from the collaborating company have been collected to demonstrate the effectiveness of Case Based Process Planning (CBPP) model. © 2008 IEEE. published_or_final_versionThe IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM 2009), Singapore, 8 - 11 December 2008.

Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low.

In recent years, the demand for shoe <b>polish</b> <b>products</b> has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|R

40|$|In this study, an {{environmental}} test chamber with controlled temperature, relative humidity, and airflow rate {{was developed to}} evaluate emissions of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) from three different kinds of furniture polish. The time dependence of TVOC concentrations produced from the emissions of furniture <b>polish</b> <b>products</b> in the chamber was tested. TVOC emissions from each furniture polish were compared. The main volatile organic compounds emitted from each polish were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A double-exponential equation was developed to evaluate the characteristics of emissions of TVOCs from these furniture <b>polish</b> <b>products.</b> With this double-exponential model, the physical processes of TVOC emissions can be explained.

40|$|Agricultural {{trade between}} Poland and Belgium {{has a long}} history but was never very {{important}} and is rather erratic, though some products are traditionally traded, such as oilseeds, strawberries, alcoholic beverages or horse meat. The collapse of communism gives new opportunities for both partners, through normal trade practices but also thanks to the Interim Agreement signed by Poland and the European Community and thanks to the PHARE programme. However, several obstacles do exist : the Polish unstable economic, legal and political situation, the financial difficulties of the Polish enterprises, the lack of reliability of some partners, the low packaging and marketing quality of the <b>Polish</b> <b>products,</b> problems at the border, [...] . Nevertheless, <b>Polish</b> <b>products</b> have a good intrinsic quality and Poland does not produce some fruits and vegetables, which constitute good reasons to believe in an increase of agricultural trade between Poland and Belgium.
