40|$|A simple, precise, and accurate, and stability-indicating isocratic Ultraperformance Liq. Chromatog. (UPLC) {{method was}} {{developed}} for the detn. of methdilazine hydrochloride (MDH) in bulk drug and in its tablets. The use of UPLC, with a rapid 5 -min-reversed-phase isocratic sepn. on a 1. 7 Î¼m reversed-phase packing material to provide rapid "high throughput" support for MDH, is demonstrated. The method was developed using Waters Acquity BEH C 18 column (100 mm Ã— 2. 1 mm, 1. 7 Î¼m) with mobile phase consisting of a mixt. of <b>potassium</b> <b>dihydrogenorthophosphate</b> and 1 -pentane sulfonic acid buffer of pH 4. 0 and acetonitrile (60 : 40 vol. /vol.). The eluted compd. was detected at 254 nm with a UV detector. The std. curve of mean peak area vs. concn. showed an excellent linearity over a concn. range 0. 5 - 80 Î¼g mL- 1 MDH with regression coeff. (r) value of 0. 9999. The limit of detection (S/N = 3) was 0. 2 Î¼g mL- 1 and the limit of quantification (S/N = 10) was 0. 5 Î¼g mL- 1. Forced degrdn. of the bulk sample was conducted {{in accordance with the}} ICH guidelines. Acidic, basic, hydrolytic, oxidative, thermal, and photolytic degrdns. were used to assess the stability indicating power of the method. The drug was found to be stable in acidic, basic, thermal, hydrolytic, and photolytic stress conditions and showed slight degrdn. in oxidative stress condition. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
