The biogenic base material was planned to possibly convert the hierarchically organized biological structure through capillary silicon treatment into the desired clear cut microstructure of SiSiC-ceramics.

40|$|The main {{requirement}} on {{kiln furniture}} is the save support or transport of ceramic products during the thermal processing. Therefore, high compressive strength and high bending strength especially at high temperatures are needed. Thick dense or thick porous ceramic plates are {{state of the}} art. However, these structures have a high thermal mass, which has to be heated and quenched during each heat treatment cycle. Furthermore, a homogeneous temperature distribution in the kiln can only be realize at low heating or cooling rates. Due to these challenges, the manufacturing of a novel generation of kiln furniture with advanced properties (low density and heat capacity, high stiffness, good thermal shock behavior) has been investigated.

40|$|This work {{presents}} an efficient finite element based scheme for {{the prediction of}} process properties and especially the material condition of workpiece surfaces after turning. This is achieved by using a database generated {{with the help of}} a micromechanically motivated material model - capable of simulating interactions of phase transitions and plasticity - for the efficient post-processing of a macroscopic thermo-mechanically coupled finite element simulation of the turning process. This modelling technique is applied to the martensitic part of a functionally graded workpiece which is produced by thermo-mechanically controlled forging processes. Those workpieces provide locally varying material conditions, which are tailored to the later application. The resulting <b>pre-products</b> have to be turned in order to achieve the desired final workpiece geometry and surfaces. Such processes strongly affect material properties such as hardness and ductility. A deterioration of the functionality of the gradation, i. e. the martensitic surface properties, may occur by generation of residual tensile principal stresses which can occur accompanied by white layer formation. These deteriorations can be avoided by adjusting the process parameters appropriately. Especially the cutting speed is supposed to bean a low level (v(c) < 80 m/min) to avoid thermally driven formation of a white layer and the generation of tensile residual stresses. It is shown how finite element simulations can give insight into the material interactions and thereby facilitate the support of the process parameter adjustment in order to support efficient and reliable part production in industrial applications.

40|$|For the {{processing}} of ceramic green tapes to form 3 D components, different technologies are known, for instance lamination to multilayer or folding. In the metal and plastic industry, deep drawing is after bending one of the famous method for reshaping of sheet metals and polymers. However, for processing green tapes this technology is not used because of the following debinding and sintering steps. During the complex shaping process, the within the polymer matrix arranged ceramic particles become rearrange and an inhomogeneous particle distribution can arise. During sintering this can result in defect because of inhomogeneous shrinkage behavior. This study presents basic investigations of the deep drawing of ceramic green tapes. A special method was developed to investigate the particle distribution within the green tapes {{before and after the}} deep drawing and to correlate the results with the process conditions and the location of the investigated volume.

40|$|The {{development}} of new Technologies is generally a time-consuming and cost-intensive task. Therefore, the future exploitation of a new technology has {{to be considered in}} the early stages of the {{development of}} said technology with the aim of managing the development-path in relation to market potential. In particular technology driven /-developing companies and applied research institutes aspire to a commercialization of potential new technologies which have been identified also sometimes within future-fields outside of their core businesses. Unfortunately, new technologies come with an increased complexity and thus also with an increasing need for explanation of their functionality and capabilities. The way to communicate technological advantages to a potential targetgroup is today primarily focused on single applications by the use of specific prototypes or other concepts of demonstration related to an explicit product. But even the development of application specific prototypes in each future field is very costintensive and not practicable in all industries. This paper introduces an approach to convey the functional profile of the new technology into potential target groups across different application fields by the focus on customer delight. The aim is to draw attention to a particular function of the technology by highlighting of a set of relevant attributes which lead to customer satisfaction.

40|$|The current {{trend in}} {{wireless}} operator networks is towards deploying in parallel {{a large number}} of heterogeneous access network technologies and core network functions in order to reach a higher capacity and thus accommodating the communication needs of a high number of connected devices. However, the wireless operator network is designed for handling uniformly all subscribers from the perspective of mobility management, subscription information, resource reservation and charging. The current architecture corroborated with a high increase of connected devices requires a new level of scalability to be attained which is not realizable. This dissertation provides a framework, named SelfFit, for subscriber oriented automatic adaptation of connectivity from core network perspective for access network selection, efficient usage of the core network resources and the data path adaptation, addressing the previous scalability challenge. In these three directions, a set of five innovative self-adaptation concepts for dynamic carrier grade network infrastructures was developed. The concepts were immediately exemplified as additions to the current 3 GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) architecture, for proving their value in a standard, real-life deployed architecture.

The demand {{for food and}} feeding stuff rises {{while at the same}} time energy, chemicals and other materials also need to be produced from biomass because of decreasing fossil resources. However, the biorefinery ideas and concepts can help to use the limited renewable raw materials more efficiently than today. With biorefineries, valuable products, such as platform chemicals, can be produced from agricultural feedstock, which can subsequently be further processed into a variety of substances by the chemical industry. Due to the role they play as producers of biomass, rural areas will grow in importance in the decades to come. Parts of the biorefinery process can be relocated to the rural areas to bring a high added value to these regions. By refining biomass at the place of production, new economic opportunities may arise for agriculturists, and the industry gets high-grade <b>pre-products.</b> Additionally, an on-farm refining can increase the quality of the products because of the instant processing. To reduce competition with the food production and to find new possibilities of utilisation for these habitats, the focus for new agricultural biomass should be on grasslands.

30|$|The 3 GPP is in {{the process}} of {{studying}} and eventually adopting proposals for the new 5 G air interface, which eventually will be standardized within 2017. Depending on the end use and specific operation band (i.e. sub 6 GHz and millimeter wave frequencies), it is expected that two versions of 5 G radio access waveforms will be standardized. Previous works from other researchers have focused either on a specific 5 G candidate waveform [6, 7] or on comparing different performance features (or target applications) [8, 9] from the ones presented in this paper. Details related to real-time implementation of 5 G waveforms [10] and laboratory-based experimental validation [11, 12] are very scarce in the literature and typically provide benchmarking of a particular use case [13]. The work presented in this paper is in this sense more transversal covering key performance aspects of the most popular 5 G waveform candidates, along with a computational complexity analysis and practical real-time implementations targeting field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices under realistic spectrum cohabitation scenarios (including experimental validation). Other sources related to the work presented in this paper are encountered in white papers [14] or application notes [15] describing add-on software libraries that target arbitrary waveform generation instruments. Such software <b>pre-products</b> are used to underpin the market readiness of the instrumentation and measurements sector and its ability to timely provide test solutions once the 5 G air interface will be finally standardized; typically, the non-academic references do not enter in a fine-grain analysis of the computational complexity and do not present hardware implementation details of the different candidate 5 G waveforms.|$|R
40|$|Many {{industrial}} and environmental processes are characterized as complex spatiotemporal systems. Such systems, which often modeled with nonlinear coupled PDEs, are often highly complex and their relationships between model inputs, parameters and output may be poorly understood. Moreover the solutions of physics-based models commonly {{differ from the}} real measurements. Hence, aim of this work {{is the development of}} a concept which provides support in understanding of the system behavior and the parameter calibration. Recently the simulation considering uncertainties in models known as uncertainty quantification framework is an active research area. The uncertainty quantification framework can perform the sensitivity analysis of the uncertain influenced parameter to the quantities of interest. The probabilistic description offers also the Bayesian inference to handle the discrepancy between the model prediction and the real measurement. The efficient numerical solution is achieved by means of the generalized Polynomial Chaos expansion (gPC). With the gPC we perform the global sensitivity analysis and the model parameter calibration. We introduce the calculation of the local sensitivity analysis, which normally computed by analytical differential, by using the gPC as surrogate model. The considered industrial process in this paper is a complex rheological forming process producing glass tubes and accordingly rods which are <b>pre-products</b> for optical fibers. The material parameters of the process are temperature dependent that lead to nonlinear PDEs. These dependencies are mostly empirical, thus the parameters are considered as the uncertainties of the model. The sensitivity analysis results improve the understanding of the process, i. e. the coupling of the parameters to the outputs.

40|$|Master's thesis in Literacy studiesThis {{thesis is}} about a study of English writing and {{feedback}} in an upper secondary school in Norway. The ability to express oneself in writing {{is one of the}} five basic skills in the Norwegian LK 06 English subject curriculum. However, some Norwegian studies (e. g. Lehmann 1999; Nygaard 2010) indicate that Norwegian students’ writing skills in English are inadequate. How teachers teach English writing is therefore important to investigate, and feedback is one important factor of teaching and developing writing. Theory on L 1 and L 2 writing is presented in the study, in addition to summative and formative assessment in writing, with process writing as one form of formative assessment. Research on feedback is also thoroughly presented. The study investigates the students’ and teachers’ experiences and attitudes to English writing and feedback in the upper secondary school. It looks into how teachers provide feedback to English writing and how students receive feedback. Both the students’ and teachers’ attitudes to English writing and feedback are investigated. In addition, the study also explores how feedback influences the development of the students’ writing by analysing some of the students’ drafts. The study used mixed methods, both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Semi-structured interviews with three teachers were conducted, questionnaires were answered by 83 students and four student texts were analysed. The teacher interviews showed that the teachers provided feedback in a rather similar way, namely that they gave mostly post-product feedback. However, one of the teachers asked the students to revise their texts after they had received feedback and their grades, while the other two required no revisions at all. Process writing, multiple drafts or peer feedback were not common in the teaching of English writing, even though the teachers said there were benefits with, for example, process writing. The teachers gave both written and oral feedback, with an emphasis on written feedback. However, they wished they could give more oral feedback. Thus, the teachers did not always practise what they thought was most beneficial for their students because they felt they did not have enough time. The questionnaires showed {{that the majority of the}} students produced texts in a similar way, namely they wrote one text without drafts and feedback. They claimed to receive mostly written feedback, and the feedback was mostly given at the same time as the grade, in other words it was post-product feedback. The analysis of student texts showed that the students who were required to revise their texts, improved them as a result of the feedback. However, most of the revisions were done in terms of language, and the teacher’s comments on content were not responded to by these students. This thesis has made a contribution to the research on English writing and feedback in upper secondary education in Norway by focusing on writing and feedback in one upper secondary school and using a mixed methods approach. It has provided insight into the experiences and attitudes to written feedback, both from the students’ and teachers’ perspectives, as well as including a study of some texts. The study confirms other research in this field (i. e. Vik 2013), namely that written feedback at the upper secondary schools that have been studied is primarily post-product feedback, because the teachers do not seem to have time to practise <b>pre-product</b> feedback...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{is based on}} the {{implementation}} of a reading and writing workshop-based program in the English as a foreign language (EFL) lessons of a Norwegian 8 th grade class of nine pupils. Seven of these pupils constituted the research group. These seven pupils were followed throughout their school year of English lessons with the applied workshop method. The aims of the research were to observe the development of the pupils’ English writing competence, motivation and attitudes towards reading and writing in English, and their motivation and attitudes towards the English subject in general. The implemented program was largely based on Atwell’s (1998) workshop approach. However, while Atwell’s program was designed for a first language context, the current study was carried out in a second language one. Important components of the reading and writing workshops in the study were, firstly, the pupils’ own choice of books to read and texts to write. Secondly, the pupils drafted and received <b>pre-product</b> feedback concentrated on a few specific points. Thirdly, direct instruction was limited to short mini-lectures, where the focus varied, e. g. from to how to come up with titles, to different reading strategies. Finally, the pupils shared their reading with each other, and published their texts in a class book. The data from the research period was collected through classroom observations, the pupils’ reading journals, and sample texts. There were also two separate semi-structured interviews with each pupil {{at the beginning of the}} autumn semester. A questionnaire and follow- up pupil conference about the autumn semester was carried out at the beginning of the spring semester. Finally, an evaluation of the whole project was carried out through a questionnaire at the end of the school year in June. The findings from the current study showed that all of the pupils improved their English writing after the year of workshop-based teaching. The features of the pupils’ writing that improved varied, and appeared somehow to target the distinct feature(s) which each pupil struggled with the most. In terms of motivation and attitudes, the pupils who appeared to be positive and motivated for reading and writing at the beginning of the year were still positive by the end of the year. The pupils who appeared negative or neutral at the beginning of the year had not changed their views much after the autumn semester. They were, however, clearly more positive at the end of the spring semester. All of the pupils were positive towards the English subject in general after the year of workshop-based teaching. What the pupils specifically mentioned as positive differences between the workshop-based teaching and regular teaching, were that they did not use a textbook, that they were not assigned with tasks, and that they were allowed to make more choices themselves about their reading and writing. Reading and writing skills are heavily emphasised in the English subject curriculum. The current study has referred to previous studies and scholars who call for changes in Norwegian EFL education towards a more efficient teaching of reading and writing. To the best of the author’s knowledge, the reading and writing workshop-based program has not been adapted to EFL lessons previously. The fact that this was a longitudinal study spanning one year has strengthened its contribution, which has been to implement and research a method that could potentially offer a successful approach to the teaching of English reading and writing in Norwegian schools...|$|E

To gain homogenous multi mission data access an Input Data Portal (IDP) been implemented on this infrastructure. The IDP consists of an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) conformant catalogue, a consolidation module for format conversion and an OGC-conformant ordering framework. Metadata of various EO-sources and with different standards is harvested and transferred to an OGC conformant Earth Observation Product standard and inserted into the catalogue by a Metadata Harvester. The IDP can be accessed for search and ordering of the harvested datasets by the services implemented on the cloud infrastructure. Different land-surface services have been realised by the project partners, using the implemented IDP and cloud infrastructure. Results of these are customer ready products, as well as <b>pre-products</b> (e. g. atmospheric corrected EO data), serving {{as a basis for}} other services. Within the IDP an automated access to ESA’s Sentinel- 1 Scientific Data Hub has been implemented. Searching and downloading of the SAR data can be performed in an automated way. With the implementation of the Sentinel- 1 Toolbox and own software, for processing of the datasets for further use, for example for Vista’s snow monitoring, delivering input for the flood forecast services, can also be performed in an automated way. For performance tests of the cloud environment a sophisticated model based atmospheric correction and pre-classification service has been implemented. Tests conducted an automated synchronised processing of one entire Landsat 8 (LS- 8) coverage for Germany and performance comparisons to standard desktop systems. Results of these tests, showing a performance improvement by the factor of six, proved the high flexibility and computing power of the cloud environment. To make full use of the cloud capabilities a possibility for automated upscaling of the hardware resources has been implemented. Together with the IDP infrastructure fast and automated processing of various satellite sources to deliver market ready products can be realised, thus increasing customer needs and numbers can be satisfied without loss of accuracy and quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{familial}} partial lipodystrophy type Dunnigan-Köbberling (FPLD) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disease}} and represents due to similarity in the symptoms with the metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) {{a model for the}} understanding of the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemias, insulin-resistant diabetes and adipositas. Aim of the presented study was to further characterise the FPLD with studies about muscular metabolism and lipid tissue distribution as well as performance physiology to detect possible pathophysiological pathway on a molecular basis. We analysed 19 patients with the clinical phenotype of FPLD and 17 healthy male probands. In all patients a genetic screening for typical mutations for FPLD was performed. The analyses focusing on muscular metabolism and lipid tissue distribution of the leg musculature were performed for all probands with the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a modern method to detect metabolic conditions and differences in the (working) muscle continuously and non-invasively. The ratio of metabolites of the energetic metabolism (phosphocreatine, beta-ATP, anorganic phosphate as well as phosphomono- and phosphodiester) were detected phosphospectroscopically (31 P-MRS), and the intra- and extracellular lipid tissue distribution with 1 H-MRS. In addition 31 P-spectra were acquired in a tomograph under load of the gastrocnemius muscle and during the recovery phase. The aerobic-alacticide metabolism was detected in a 5 -min-test with moderate load, the anaerobic-lacticide with incrementally increased load up to the individual maximum load. The physical working capacity was detected by bicycle ergometry. The spectroscopic results were tested for correlations with physiologic performance and clinical parameters. In 17 patients a mutation in LMNA- or PPAR-gamma-gene was found as the cause for FPLD. 31 P-MRS results showed a significantly higher concentration of phosphodiester (PDE) in FPLD-patients than in the healthy probands. In addition, the patients had constant quotients of phophocreatine and PDE during the entire exercise test in the tomograph, whereas in probands a decrease of these parameters during the exercise and increase during recovery phase could be seen. During the maximum load test a small decrease of intracellular ph-values and a delayed regeneration of the phosphocreatine pool could be observed. Significantly higher concentrations of intra- (IMCL) as well as extramyocellular (EMCL) lipids could be found in FPLD-patients in comparison to probands. The EMCL/IMCL ratio was significantly higher as well. In the bicycle ergometry the FPLD-patients showed a by 23 % reduced aerobic capacity with normal absolute and relative performance. The anaerobic capacity was in a high normal level. The individual anaerobic threshold (aerobic-anaerobic) was reached early in the patients at 40 % of maximal performance. We found a high correlation between relative PDE-concentrations and plasmalipide-concentration as well as EMCL/İMCL-quotients and the plasmalipide- as well as –LDL-concentration and the BMI. For the physical working capacity test we found a moderate to high negative correlation between relative PDE-concentrations at rest and during exercise and the parameters of the absolute and relative performance, relative oxygen absorption as well as heart rate and lactate concentration at each individual anaerobic threshold. We could characterise the clinical phenotype of patients with familial partial lipodystrophy type Dunnigan-Köbberling. The MRS analyses and correlation analyses provided important information for the pathophysiologic mechanisms: 1. 	The genetic defect probably led to interference of the glucose absorption directly by reduction of PPAR-gamma-activity and down-regulation of GLUT- 4 -transporter. This explains the disturbed exercise- and regeneration kinetics in the tomograph independent from the progress of the disease and the appearance of insulin resistance prior to the other metabolic disorders. 2. 	The high PDE- and IMCL-concentrations probably represent <b>pre-products</b> of the lipid metabolism in disturbed triglyceride syntheses or beta-oxidation. These intracellular lipid droplets lead to the clinical apparent metabolic pathologies via malfunction of the intracellular signal cascade, chronic inflammation due to free radicals as well as malfunction of the mitochondrial and membrane function, which are summarized as lipotoxicity. Extracellular an accumulation of <b>pre-products</b> of the lipid metabolism could be seen, which explains the high concentration of EMCL, plasma lipids and LDL. The accumulation of lipid increases during the progress of the disease and correlates with the clinical parameters. Genetically the FPLD leads to a disturbance of differentiation of adipocytes with reduction of subcutaneous tissue. The metabolic changes appear due to a loss of accumulation as well as endocrine and anti-inflammatory functions of the fat tissue. In the metabolic syndrome the organism reaches hyperalimentarly the limit of storage capacity and metabolic rate for lipids. Consequences on the lipid and glucose metabolism are the same as for the FPLD. The fatty degeneration of cells in older patients as well as the lipoatrophy, e. g. in HIV, are based on the same intracellular cascades as in FPLD. Similar pathophysiological mechanisms in diseases of different entities may lead to new therapeutic strategies, which might have an effect on intracellular lipid metabolism and lipid accumulation. The MRS represents a powerful diagnostic tool to detect the efficiency of these strategies...|$|R
