5|$|Schizophrenia affects around 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> life, or 24million people {{worldwide}} as of 2011. It occurs 1.4times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men—the peak ages of onset are 25 years for males and 27 years for females. Onset in childhood is much rarer, as is onset in middle or old age.|$|E
50|$|Generally, winning teams scored 600 to 800 points. Because of the {{elimination}} of the open 100 point round and the difficulty of the Dirty Half Dozen questions, teams rarely broke 1000 points. Only three teams did so: St. George's School scored 1,250 <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> first round game, Saint John High School scored 1,120 <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> third round game and Saint Malachy's Memorial High School scored 1,060 <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> second round game.|$|R

5|$|At some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history, {{not clearly}} documented, horses bred {{in the western}} regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E
5|$|Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did {{not give}} up her own life for his. In fact, they {{spent a great deal}} of time away from each other and {{maintained}} a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives, they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E

5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives and {{is the most common}} cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|For {{their first}} World Cup {{qualifying}} campaign, San Marino were drawn {{in a group}} with England, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Turkey. The opening match resulted in a 10–0 hammering {{at the hands of}} Norway. The return match was less one-sided, finishing 2–0 to the Norwegians. A 4–1 defeat in Turkey saw San Marino score their first World Cup goal, and a 0–0 draw against the same opposition on 10 March 1993 gave them their first ever <b>point.</b> <b>In</b> <b>their</b> final qualifier, against England, Davide Gualtieri scored the then-fastest goal in World Cup Qualifying history—after 8.3 seconds—though the team went on to lose 7–1.

5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lifetimes and {{is becoming more}} common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise {{is believed to be}} due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%.|$|E

Finnhorses perform both at their own competitions and in open, all-breed classes in dressage, show jumping, and eventing. They are also used for endurance riding, western riding and combined driving. Approximately 1,000 Finnhorses are used in riding schools and in riding therapy. They are also popular as pleasure horses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclones were named via the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. Hurricane Fox of 1952 {{was the final}} Atlantic tropical cyclone to be designated with this naming system, and a female list of tropical cyclone names was utilized in the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season. After the stronger 1917 Pinar del Río hurricane, Hurricane Fox was Cuba's second most intense landfall until Hurricane Michelle struck the island in 2001. Originally, the 1917 hurricane was {{believed to have been}} a Category3 hurricane prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis, which made Fox the second Category4 landfall after the 1932 Cuba Hurricane. At the time, Fox was the fourth most intense hurricane to strike Cuba in terms of atmospheric pressure; only the 1917, 1924, and 1932 storms were stronger at one <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> life spans.|$|E

5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one {{could be a good}} Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E
5|$|The 1855 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured tropical cyclone landfalls in the Gulf Coast of the United States, the Greater Antilles, and Mexico, but none along the East Coast of the United States. It was inactive, with only five known tropical cyclones. Operationally, another tropical storm {{was believed to}} have existed offshore Atlantic Canada in late August and early September, but HURDAT – the official Atlantic hurricane database – now excludes this system. The first system, Hurricane One, was initially observed on August 6. The final storm, Hurricane Five, was last observed on September 17. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. At one point during the season, two tropical cyclones existed simultaneously. Two of the cyclones only have a single known <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> tracks due to a sparsity of data, so storm summaries for those systems are unavailable.|$|E
