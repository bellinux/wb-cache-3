50|$|The tachinid fly, Subclytia rotundiventris, is a {{specialist}} endoparasite of the <b>parent</b> <b>bug</b> females. The parasite inserts a single egg through the upper prothorax of an E. grisea female and, after hatching, the larva feeds on its host. At the beginning the parasite feeds {{only on the}} non-vital parts of the bug, but finally it kills it and pupates outside the host. Interestingly, the larva ‘permits’ the <b>parent</b> <b>bug</b> to continue caring for the juveniles until their third stage. In experiments, the wing-fanning (regarded as the most effective defensive behaviour of the <b>parent</b> <b>bug)</b> {{did not differ significantly}} between parasited and non-parasited females until the nymphs were at the second instar stage. However, with older nymphs, females were much less effective in their defensive behaviour and often died before the end of maternal care. Considering that the older nymphs are more mobile and may escape from predators, some offspring of the parasited females of the <b>parent</b> <b>bug</b> probably survive and may also be potential hosts for the new generation of the parasite.|$|E
5000|$|Elasmucha grisea, {{common name}} <b>parent</b> <b>bug,</b> is {{a species of}} shield bugs or stink bugs {{belonging}} to the family Acanthosomatidae. The term parent bugs includes also the other species of the genus Elasmucha and some species of the family Acanthosomatidae.|$|E
50|$|This species, {{like other}} <b>parent</b> <b>bugs</b> possess methatoracic and {{abdominal}} glands, which discharge a foul smelling secretion. This secretion {{is used to}} deter potential enemies and is sometimes released when the bug is disturbed.|$|R
5000|$|Adults of Elasmucha grisea can {{be found}} all year around. In fact this species overwinters as an adult. Mating occurs {{in the spring and}} new adults {{can be found}} in August. These shield bugs feed on various woody plants, preferably on birch (Betula species), but also on alder (Alnus species), beech (Fagus species), holly (Ilex species), spruce (Picea species), etc. [...] Like most shield bugs, Elasmucha grisea and other <b>parent</b> <b>bugs</b> suck plant sap and require {{symbiotic}} bacteria for their digestion. They obtain symbionts at an early age: the mother covers her eggs with bacteria so that the larvae ingest them as they feed on the egg case. Both adults and larvae readily feed on developing seeds, and breeding individuals can be observed on host plants with many young catkins. However, they seem to avoid trees with a high predation risk.|$|R
50|$|After Fred {{leaves with}} her <b>parents,</b> many <b>bug</b> demons begin {{to show up}} at the hotel. Fred, who has {{realized}} in the cab that the cockroach demons would return, rushes back to deploy her toaster weapon, sending an ax flying at the severed demon head. The head splits open, releasing little bugs that the other demons collect before departing. Fred explains how she realized the little crystals were dried ichor from the bug demon, indicating a connection between it and the severed head. Fred decides she does have a place at Angel Investigations after all, and invites everyone up to her room, where they help her paint the walls. Fred paints over a picture she drew of her and Angel on the horse from Pylea.|$|R
50|$|Mappes {{earned her}} MSc degree in 1991 and her PhD in 1994 from the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. Her {{doctoral}} thesis focused on reproductive tactics and maternal care in shield bugs, particularly the <b>parent</b> <b>bug</b> (Elasmucha grisea). Her other study species include the wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis), vipers (Viperidae), the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and the drumming wolf-spider (Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata).|$|E
50|$|After oviposition, the <b>parent</b> <b>bug</b> female {{stands over}} the egg batch and shields it {{throughout}} egg development. Predation appears {{to limit the}} clutch size in E. grisea. Experiments have shown that large females lay larger egg clutches than small females. However, when the clutch size was manipulated, small females protecting large clutches lost significantly more eggs than large females guarding small clutches or females in the control groups (guarding clutches of optimal size).|$|E
5000|$|The {{common name}} of Elasmucha grisea {{comes from the}} {{relatively}} rare insect behaviour of prolonged caring for eggs and juveniles, exhibited by females of this species. Predators, such as bugs, beetles, earwigs and ants, can eliminate all the offspring of the <b>parent</b> <b>bug</b> {{if there is no}} maternal care. The repertoire of female defensive behaviours includes wing fanning, body jerking, tilting towards the enemy and, finally, releasing of 'nasty’ odours from the scent glands, ...|$|E
5000|$|Gaining {{the aid of}} Ms. Magpie, {{the forest}} gossip, Ailsworth is able to inform the forest of the {{incoming}} threat. Unfortunately, with the owl gone, morale is at a severe low. Of course, all is not lost- Ailsworth is able to convince the animals {{that they are all}} [...] "someones in particular" [...] and that, so long as they remember that, they can succeed. Inspired by Ailsworth, the forest animals all move ahead with separate plans to keep their families safe; the rabbits, however, decide to enact a bold plan- to sneak in the castle to save Mr. Owl. Receiving some unexpected help from the hawk that attacked J.C, the bunnies go to the castle (making sure to inform their <b>parents</b> via a <b>bug</b> messenger) under cover of darkness.|$|R
40|$|Advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) models link {{physical}} oceanography and biological oceanography. These models, which describe biology using continuous concentration fields, usually neglect individual-scale fluctuations. I describe a stochastic individual-based model,called the Brownian bug process,which illustrates {{some of the}} surprising issues associated with the neglect of fluctuations by adr descriptions. The Brownian bug model is an ensemble of random walkers which suffer birth and death at constant mean rates. (Probabilists will recognize the Brownian bug model as the simplest example of a "superprocess".) Binary division puts two <b>bugs</b> (<b>parent</b> and progeny) at the same position and the accumulation of these small-scale density fluctuations can produce palpable nonuniformities on large scales. In other words,provided that the diffusion is not too strong relative to the reproduction rate,a spatially homogeneous initial condition spontaneously develops patches and voids. The wavenumber signature of these reproductive pair correlations is that the spectrum of density fluctuations remains white,but rises linearly with time. Diffusion opposes this reproductive forcing,most effectively at large wavenumbers,so that a red spectrum develops...|$|R

50|$|After hatching, larvae of the <b>parent</b> <b>bug</b> {{remain in}} a tight aggregation, feeding on their empty egg shells. When any larva tries to abandon the aggregation, the female tilts her body, {{stretches}} her antennae to reach the larva and pushes the larva back to the aggregation. During {{the second and third}} instar they move, for food, towards catkins then back to the leaf with the female in close attendance. The female keeps a lookout for the larvae constantly and manages them with touches of her antennae. Finally, larvae form smaller groups and disperse {{at the end of the}} third instar, at which point the female leaves them.|$|E
