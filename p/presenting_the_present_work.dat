40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} suggest an alternative solution for writers {{in general and}} graduate students in particular in writing a proper research article introduction. In order to do so, the authors explored how the Swales’ model is applied in writing a research article introduction. The exploration was approached through a library study on the Swales model application. Some previous studies applying Swales Model were gathered and categorized into three categories − application of Swales model on different types of genre besides the research article introduction, different discipline or field and the last is the application of Swales’ on the research article introduction across languages. Another three articles written by professional writers were also collected as samples of introductions that have successfully presented three obligatory moves – establishing a territory (Move 1), establishing a niche (Move 2) and occupying the niche or <b>presenting</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>work</b> (Move 3) − proposed by Swales’ model. Those introductions were segmented into those three moves and analyzed based on a communication purpose in every step derived from each move. In order to add more comprehension about the model, an analysis was also conducted on introductions for seven articles in the English Education Journal (EEJ) published by the Graduate Program in English Language Education at Syiah Kuala University. The purpose of the analysis was to show the differences in structure of introductions organized without following the CARS Swales model. Conclusions are that the CARS Swales model is relevant for the teaching of introductions for research writing {{and it can be}} a guideline to teach students the moves and steps of this model for communication purposes...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{anisotropic}} elasticity, <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>work</b> studies work hardening in generation of mismatch dislocations. The work hardening is induced by dislocation-dislocation interaction. It has been observed experimentally that the stress relaxation induced by dislocation generation in a strained epilayer grown on a substrate is considerably less than expected from conventional equilibrium models. Dodson proposed that the discrepancy {{was the result of}} dislocation-dislocation interactions in which the first dislocations generated exert a back-stress on any subsequent dislocations. He drew an analogy between this type of process and work hardening in metals but provided no rigorous derivation of the magnitude of the effect. An isotropic elasticity study has demonstrated that the work hardening can be related to a dependency of the formation energy of the next dislocation to be generated on the number of dislocations already <b>present.</b> <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>work</b> studies this phenomon using an anisotropic elasticity approach.

30|$|Experimental {{results on}} {{differences}} in the morphological features in these films grown by spin process using the two precursor materials have been <b>presented.</b> <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>work</b> has shown that <b>the</b> films of ZnO prepared by using zinc nitrate exhibit dendrites while those using zinc acetate are uniform and smooth. Explanations have been offered involving basic chemical processes {{in the preparation of}} two types of sols used for growing such films. Zinc nitrate first crystallizes in the form of small crystallites of zinc nitrate followed by decomposition on heating to give small crystallites of zinc oxide. On the other hand, zinc acetate first hydrolyzes followed by the process of condensation, poly-condensation and finally give smooth films of zinc oxide on heating at 450 °C. The micrographs suggest that the film prepared by using zinc nitrate show a rapid and random crystallization compared to that using zinc acetate as the precursor materials.|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{simulations of}} fully hydrated Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers, extending {{temporal and spatial}} scales by almost one order of magnitude, are <b>presented.</b> <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>work</b> reaches system sizes of 1024 lipids and times 10 - 60 ns. The simulations uncover significant dynamics and fluctuations on scales of several nanoseconds, and enable direct observation and spectral decomposition of both undulatory and thickness fluctuation modes. Although the former modes are strongly damped, the latter exhibit signs of oscillatory behavior. From this, it has been possible to calculate mesoscopic continuum properties in good agreement with experimental values. A bending modulus of 4 x 10 (- 20) J, bilayer area compressibility of 250 - 300 mN/m, and mode relaxation times in the nanosecond range are obtained. The theory of undulatory motions is revised and further extended to cover thickness fluctuations. Finally, it is proposed that thickness fluctuations is the explanation to the observed system-size dependence of equilibrium-projected area per lipid...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{universal}} embedding distortion model for wavelet based watermarking is <b>presented.</b> <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>work</b> extends our previous work on modelling embedding distortion for watermarking algorithms that use orthonormal wavelet kernels to non-orthonormal wavelet kernels, such as biorthogonal wavelets. By using a common framework for major wavelet based watermarking algorithms and the Parseval's energy conservation theorem for orthonormal transforms, we {{propose that the}} distortion performance, measured using the mean square error (MSE), {{is proportional to the}} sum of energy of wavelet coefficients to be modified by watermark embedding. The extension of the model to non-orthonormal wavelet kernel is obtained by rescaling the sum of energy of wavelet coefficients to be modified by watermark embedding using a weighting parameter that follows the energy conservation theorems in wavelet frames. The proposed model is useful to find optimum input parameters, such as, the wavelet kernel, coefficient selections and subband choices, for a given wavelet based watermarking algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Detection and imaging of multi-reaction zones is an {{essential}} tool for understanding the detailed structure of complicated flames. In this work a combined 4 -camera technique is presented for multi-reaction zones imaging. The technique combines highly advanced laser-based diagnostics tools, namely Rayleigh scattering, laser-induced predissociation fluorescence (LIPF) of OH, LIF of PAH, and LIF of formaldehyde (CH 2 O). The application of this combined technique in turbulent non-homogeneous hydrocarbon flames is quite new. The technique shows its ability to detect simultaneously rich, lean and diffusion reaction zones. The 3 reaction zones can be spatially resolved, providing essential information about their interaction and overall flame stability. Therefore, the detection and study of triple flame structures in non-homogeneous turbulent flames becomes possible.

We aim to provide reliable and accurate predictions of emission line ratios and radiative cooling losses in astrophysical simulations of shocked flows.

The most important source of radiative cooling for our plasma conditions comes from the collisionally-excited line radiation.
