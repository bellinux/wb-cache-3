25|$|The {{authors of}} a 2009 {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study on the}} three subspecies that are currently recognised on the Canary Islands concluded that they are sufficiently distinct in both genotype and phenotype to be considered as separate species within the Fringilla genus. They also proposed a revised distribution of subspecies on the islands in which the birds on La Palma (<b>palmae)</b> and El Hierro (ombrioso) are grouped together as a single subspecies while the current canariensis subspecies is split into two with one subspecies occurring only on Gran Canaria {{and the other on}} La Gomera and Tenerife.|$|E

25|$|The Arecaceae are a {{botanical family}} of {{perennial}} climbers, shrubs, acaules and trees {{commonly known as}} palm trees (owing to historical usage, the family is alternatively called <b>Palmae).</b> They are flowering plants, a family in the monocot order Arecales. Currently 181 genera with around 2600 species are known, most of them restricted to tropical and subtropical climates. Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged {{at the top of}} an unbranched stem. However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of habitat within their range, from rainforests to deserts.|$|E
25|$|In Manú National Park {{the animal}} {{material}} in the diet includes frogs, lizards, small mammals and birds' eggs {{as well as many}} invertebrates, including orthopterans, lepidopterans and hymenopterans (especially ants and wasp larvae). In the Pacaya–Samiria National Reservation, it has been observed eating tent caterpillars. Terborgh identified 73 species of plants from 33 families consumed by this primate. The Moraceae was the most important family by a wide margin, counting the number of species (17) eaten, equivalent to 23.3% of all plant species consumed. Importance values for plant families consumed by the white-fronted capuchin in one study are as follows: Moraceae (17, 23.3%); Leguminosae (5, 6.8%); Araceae (4, 5.5%); Bombacaceae (4, 5.5%); <b>Palmae</b> (4, 5.5%).|$|E
25|$|The male of the {{subspecies}} {{resident in}} the British Isles (F. c. gengleri) closely resembles the nominate subspecies {{but has a}} slightly darker mantle and underparts. The males of the two North Africa subspecies F. c. africana and F. c. spodiogenys have a blue-grey crown and nape that extends down {{to the sides of}} the head and neck, a black forehead and lore, a broken white eye-ring, a bright olive-green saddle and a pink-buff throat and breast. The males of F. c. canariensis and F. c. <b>palmae</b> in the Canary Islands have deep slate-blue upperparts and lack a contrasting mantle. Male chaffinches in Madeira (F. c. maderensis) and the Azores (F. c. moreletti) are similar in appearance to F. c. canariensis but have a bright green mantle.|$|E

2500|$|UCL {{formerly}} {{made some}} {{use of a}} coat of arms depicting a raised bent arm dressed in armour holding a green upturned open wreath. A version of this badge (not on a shield) {{appears to have been}} used by UCL Union from shortly after its foundation in 1893. However, the arms are not known to have ever been the subject of an official grant of arms, and depart from several of the rules and conventions of heraldry. They are no longer formally used by the college, although they are still occasionally seen in unofficial contexts, or used in modified form by sports teams and societies. The blazon of the arms is: Purpure, on a wreath of the colours Argent and Blue Celeste, an arm in armour embowed Argent holding an upturned wreath of laurel Vert, beneath which two branches of laurel Or crossed at the nombril and bound with a bowed cord Or, beneath the nombril a motto of Blue Celeste upon which Cuncti adsint meritaeque expectent praemia <b>palmae.</b> The motto is a quotation from Virgil's Aeneid, and translates into English as [...] "Let all come who by merit deserve the most reward".|$|E
