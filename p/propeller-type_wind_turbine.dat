40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate turbulence characteristics {{in the wake of a}} wind turbine. The flow around a <b>propeller-type</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> with three blades is simulated by using an unsteady three-dimensional numerical simulation (DNS). The simulation technique with the Cartesian staggered grid is adopted as a method of reproducing behavior in the wake as simply as possible. The tip speed ratio is about 5, and the Reynolds number based on an approaching flow and a diameter of blade is about 20, 000. A variety of visualization results were shown.

40|$|The {{air flow}} through a <b>propeller-type</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> rotor is {{characterized}} by three-dimensional rotating cascade effects about the inner portions of the rotor blades and compressibility effects about the tip regions of the blades. In the case of large rotor diameter and/or increased rotor angular speed, the existence of small supersonic zones terminated by weak shocks is possible. An exact nonlinear mathematical model (called a steady Full Potential Equation - FPE) that accounts for the above phenomena has been rederived. An artificially time dependent version of FPE was iteratively solved by a finite volume technique involving an artificial viscosity and a three-level consecutive mesh refinement. The exact boundary conditions were applied by generating a boundary conforming periodic computation mesh...|$|E
40|$|Vertical Axis <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines</b> (hereafter VAWT) {{are one of}} {{the useful}} {{renewable}} energy systems. They have several advantages in comparison with the conventional, <b>propeller-typed,</b> horizontal axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> VAWTs operate independently of the wind direction. Moreover, maximum power coefficient can be obtained at lower tip-speed ratio compared to the conventional <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> Flow induced noise is therefore smaller than that of the conventional ones. In this paper, we attempt to simulate an unsteady flow filed and aerodynamic noise radiated from VAWT by using the discrete vortex method and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. The result shows that the power coefficient is almost the same as the conventional typed <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> Moreover, the predicted noise level of the developed VAWT is about 70 dB, which is 10 dB lower than that of the horizontal axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> We also attempted to estimate noise spectrum by using three dimensional vortex methods. However, the applied vortex methods can not simulate turbulent eddy motions such as the combination process and vortex break down process. Aerodynamic noise simulation by using discrete vortex methods is therefore limited to overall noise level estimation. However, vortex methods are useful to estimate aerodynamic noise from VAWT with small-scale computers. 1...|$|R
