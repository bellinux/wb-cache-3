40|$|Many Aboriginal peoples {{are widely}} exposed to stress in their lives. This {{exposure}} to stress appears linked {{not only to}} their contemporary and immediate life circumstances (e. g., marginal economic and at-risk living conditions) but also to their historical, cultural, and political contexts. Recently, diabetes has become prevalent in many Aboriginal communities worldwide. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to gain a better understanding of the ways in which Aboriginal <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>diabetes</b> cope <b>with</b> stress. The study used a series of focus groups among First Nations and Métis women and men <b>with</b> <b>diabetes</b> in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Based on our cross-thematic analyses of the data, three overarching themes were identified: (1) individual and collective strengths of Aboriginal <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>diabetes</b> must be recognized and utilized to facilitate healing from or coping with the experience of stress and trauma; (2) healing must be accomplished holistically by maintaining balance or harmony among mind, body, and spirit; and (3) effective ways of coping with stress and healing from trauma potentially promote positive transformations for Aboriginal peoples and communities at both individual and collective levels. Also, sub-themes of stress-coping and healing that underlie and further describe the above three overarching themes emerged from the data. These include: (a) interdependence/connectedness, (b) spirituality/transcendence, (c) enculturation/facilitation of Aboriginal cultural identity, (d) self-control/self-determination/self-expression, and (e) the role of leisure as a means of coping with stress and healing from trauma. Accordingly, our deeper analyses resulted in the development of an emergent model of stress-coping and healing among Aboriginal <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>diabetes,</b> which is presented as a dynamic system in which the three overarching themes are embedded in the five specific themes of coping/healing. This evidence-based emergent model appears to provide some important insights into health policy and program planning for Aboriginal <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>diabetes</b> and their communities.

5|$|While {{classified}} as generally recognized as {{safe in the}} US, juniper berries may have various side effects that have not been tested extensively in clinical trials.

5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} {{occurs in}} 4.6–8.0 per 1000 <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>diabetes</b> annually. Rates {{among those with}} type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to survey the level of {{self-reported}} physical activity in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes,</b> <b>with</b> and without peripheral neuropathy. Methods: A sample of South Australian adults (n= 481) aged 33 - 88 years <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes,</b> including 55 <b>people</b> <b>with</b> peripheral neuropathy, completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Levels of self-reported physical activity were compared between those with and without peripheral neuropathy. Results: <b>People</b> <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> and peripheral neuropathy (Mdn = 1433, IQR = 495 – 3390 MET. min/wk) were less physically active than those without peripheral neuropathy (Mdn = 2106, IQR = 876 – 4380 MET. min/wk) (p = 0. 04). A total of 49 % of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> and peripheral neuropathy met physical activity recommendations of 150 minutes of at least moderate activity per week, compared to 57 % of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> alone. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that <b>people</b> <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> and peripheral neuropathy reported being significantly less active than <b>people</b> <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> alone. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> and peripheral neuropathy need to be encouraged to perform higher levels of physical activity for biological, physical and psychological benefits.
