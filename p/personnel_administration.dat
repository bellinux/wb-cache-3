He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel in January 1947; the rank became substantive in October 1948. In May 1948 he was posted to Army Headquarters, Eastern Command, in Sydney as General Staff Officer 1. He joined the Directorate of Military Training at Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in January 1952. In 1954 Serong was tasked with redirecting Army training towards jungle warfare, in preparation for operations in South East Asia. As a colonel, he headed the Jungle Warfare Training Centre (JWTC), which had been recently re-established at Canungra, in south-east Queensland, from 1955 to 1957. The centre trained personnel for counter-insurgency operations during the Malayan Emergency against communist guerrillas fighting the security forces there. Under his direction the course at Canungra taught soldiers automatic responses and contact drills to cover the situations they might encounter in jungle warfare, emphasising instinctive shooting and patrolling, as well [...] "battle inoculation" [...] and physical conditioning. These skills underpinned the Australian Army's methods of dispersed patrolling in small groups moving quietly through the jungle, techniques utilised while fighting the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War, and later in Malaya and Vietnam. According to Serong [...] "...conventional soldiers think of the jungle as being full of lurking enemies. Under our system, we will do the lurking." [...] Officers were also trained in battle tactics at Canungra, and various research and development activities were undertaken.|$|E

2500|$|In 1949 Munschke {{switched}} from local government to national government {{when he took}} a position working for the Party Central Committee, again becoming head of the critical personnel department. By 1952 the government and their allies were looking to create an East German Kasernierte Volkspolizei (People's Police in Barracks), a quasi-military police service which is seen, in retrospect, as a precursor to the establishment in 1956 of an East German army. One thing on which the Soviets and their western allies had agreed back in 1945 was that Germany should not have its own army, but after the establishment in 1949 of the German Democratic Republic and the de facto division of what remained of Germany into two separate states, each in one of two competing military alliances, and both German states accommodating several hundred thousand fraternal troops from (respectively) the United States and the Soviet Union, perceived priorities had changed. [...] Both side were quietly preparing to re-introduce national armies into their versions of post-war Germany. In the late summer of 1952 Eward Munschke was surprised to find himself being interviewed by the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht himself. On 1 October 1952, despite never having held any military rank in any national army, Munschke was promoted to the (police) rank of major general, with the job of [...] "Kaderchef", tasked by Ulbricht to select capable and suitable young men ("befähigte und geeignete junge Männer auszuwählen ...") for the new quasi-military police brigade. Munschke's record in the Spanish Civil War and as a resistance operative in the Netherlands during the war, together with his never-questioned loyalty to his country's Communist status quo, had evidently impressed Ulbricht, and he stayed in the post of [...] "Kaderchef" [...] to which he had been appointed by the leader for five years. [...] The position went with a government job as Chief of Cadre administration ( [...] Chef der Verwaltung Kader) in the [...] which was the government department responsible for the police. [...] The National People's Army (NVA / Nationale Volksarmee) was formally founded on 1 March 1956, and this was also the date on which Ewald Munschke was appointed Deputy Minister for National Defence, and the country's first Head of <b>Personnel</b> <b>Administration</b> with the Ministry for National Defence (Chef der Verwaltung Kader beim Ministerium für Nationale Verteidigung). It was largely on the basis of Munschke's approach that the new East German officer class was drawn almost exclusively from the industrial and agricultural working classes.|$|E
