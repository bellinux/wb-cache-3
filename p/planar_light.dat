5000|$|Edward Hutchinson Synge {{is given}} credit for conceiving and {{developing}} the idea for an imaging instrument that would image by exciting and collecting diffraction in the near field. His original idea, proposed in 1928, was based upon the usage of intense nearly <b>planar</b> <b>light</b> from an arc under pressure behind a thin, opaque metal film with a small orifice of about 100 nm. The orifice was to remain within 100 nm of the surface, and information was to be collected by point-by-point scanning. He foresaw the illumination and the detector movement being the biggest technical difficulties. John A. O'Keefe also developed similar theories in 1956. He thought the moving of the pinhole or the detector when it {{is so close to}} the sample would be the most likely issue that could prevent the realization of such an instrument. It was Ash and Nicholls who, in 1972, first broke the Abbe’s diffraction limit using radiation with wavelength of 3 cm. A line grating was resolved with a resolution of λ0/60. A decade later, a patent on an optical near-field microscope was filed by Pohl, [...] followed in 1984 by the first paper that used visible radiation for near field scanning. [...] The near-field optical (NFO) microscope involved a subwavelength aperture at the apex of a metal coated sharply pointed transparent tip, and a feedback mechanism to maintain a constant distance of a few nanometers between the sample and the probe. Lewis et al. were also aware of the potential of an NFO microscope at this time. They reported first results in 1986 confirming super-resolution. In both experiments, details below 50 nm (about λ0/10) in size could be recognized.|$|E

Unlike a conventional lighting system that is constructed from white LEDs, the proposed <b>planar</b> <b>lighting</b> system uses blue LEDs to excite a YAG Ce yellow phosphor film remotely, yielding a high lumen efficiency with uniform and planar light-emission. The phosphor film herein acts as a wavelength converter and a light diffuser simultaneously. The optical properties of the pro-posed lighting system, angular color deviation and light-emitting uniformity, are studied. Eventually, a high lumen efficiency (73. 0 lm/W) and thin lighting module (7. 5 mm-thick) was demonstrated without the use of any conventional diffuser plate or light guiding plate (LGP). A low color deviation and a high light-emitting uniformity were achieved. Hence, the proposed lighting system exhibited superior optical performance using a compact module.

40|$|Hand-based {{verification}} {{is a key}} biometric {{technology with}} a wide range of potential applications both in industry and government. The focus of this work is on improving the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of hand-based verification. In particular, we propose using high-order Zernike moments to represent hand geometry, avoiding the more difficult and prone to errors process of hand-landmark extraction (e. g., finding finger joints). The proposed system operates on 2 D hand silhouette images acquired by placing the hand on a <b>planar</b> <b>lighting</b> table without any guidance pegs, increasing the ease of use compared to conventional systems. Zernike moments are powerful translation, rotation, and scale invariant shape descriptors. To deal with several practical issues related to the computation of highorder Zernike moments including computational cost and lack of accuracy due to numerical errors, we have employed an efficient algorithm that uses arbitrary precision arithmetic, a look-up table, and avoids recomputing the same terms multiple times [2]. The proposed hand-based authentication system has been tested on a database of 40 subjects illustrating promising results.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel hand-based verification {{system based on}} palm-finger segmentation and fusion. The proposed system operates on 2 D hand images acquired by placing the hand on a <b>planar</b> <b>lighting</b> table without any guidance pegs. The segmentation of the palm and the fingers is performed without requiring the extraction of any landmark points on the hand. First, the hand is segmented from the forearm using a robust, iterative methodology based on morphological operators. Then, the hand is segmented into six regions corresponding to the palm and the fingers using morphological operators again. The geometry of each component of the hand is represented using high order Zernike moments which are computed using an efficient methodology. Finally, verification is performed by fusing information {{from different parts of}} the hand. The proposed system has been evaluated on a database of 101 subjects illustrating high accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with competitive approaches that use the whole hand illustrate the superiority of the proposed, component-based, approach both in terms of accuracy and robustness.
