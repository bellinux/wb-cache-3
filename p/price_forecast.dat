30|$|Electricity <b>price</b> <b>forecasting</b> can be {{categorized}} into short-term and mid-term <b>forecasting.</b> Short-term <b>price</b> <b>forecasting</b> can help market participants determine the day-ahead bid/offer for the wholesale market to maximize the benefit and manage the risks [1]. Mid-term monthly average electricity <b>price</b> <b>forecasting</b> (e.g., month ahead) is essential in guiding the participants over mid- and long-term time scales. In retail markets, the month-to-month variable rate plan is prevalent. The retail rate varies from month to month based on the market price and retailors usually issue the retail rate for next month one month ahead of time. In this sense, mid-term <b>price</b> <b>forecasting</b> will be helpful for retailors. In addition, mid-long-term <b>price</b> <b>forecasting</b> can provide <b>price</b> signals for generation expansion.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} and quantifies {{the so-called}} {{loss of profit}} (i. e., the sub-optimality of profit) that can be expected in a Price Based Unit Commitment (PBUC), when incorrect price forecasts are used. For this purpose, a PBUC model has been developed and utilized, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Simulations are {{used to determine the}} relationship between the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of a certain <b>price</b> <b>forecast</b> and the loss of profit, for four different types of power plants. A Combined Cycle (CC) power plant and a pumped storage unit show highest sensitivity to incorrect forecasts. A <b>price</b> <b>forecast</b> with a MAPE of 15 %, on average, yields 13. 8 % and 12. 1 % profit loss, respectively. A classic thermal power plant (coal fired) and cascade hydro unit are less affected by incorrect forecasts, with only 2. 4 % and 2. 0 % profit loss, respectively, at the same <b>price</b> <b>forecast</b> MAPE. This paper further demonstrates that if price forecasts show an average bias (upward or downward), using the MAPE as measure of the <b>price</b> <b>forecast</b> might not be sufficient to quantify profit loss properly. Profit loss in this case has been determined as a function of both shift and MAPE of the <b>price</b> <b>forecast...</b>|$|E

Energy <b>price</b> <b>forecasting</b> coupled with energy price-aware scheduling, is a step toward this goal. In this work, we study cost-aware schedules {{and the effect of}} various <b>price</b> <b>forecasting</b> schemes on the end schedule-cost. We show that simply optimizing <b>price</b> <b>forecasts</b> based on classical regression error metrics (e. g., Mean Squared Error), does not work well for scheduling. <b>Price</b> <b>forecasts</b> that do result in significantly better schedules, optimize a combination of metrics, each having a different impact on the end-schedule-cost. For example, both price estimation and price ranking are important for scheduling, but they carry different weight. We consider day-ahead energy <b>price</b> <b>forecasting</b> using the Irish Single Electricity Market as a case-study, and test our <b>price</b> <b>forecasts</b> for two real-world scheduling applications: animal feed manufacturing and home energy management systems.

Data-driven approaches, which take impact factors as inputs, are prevalent in mid-term <b>price</b> <b>forecasting.</b> In [19], several methods with some economic data as inputs are utilized to forecast the monthly average price, and the best mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in these methods is 12.97 %. An SVM model considering calendar day, fuel prices, electric loads, weather and import/export power is proposed in [20], and the MAPE is 8.04 %.

The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach has been extended to make hourly market clearing <b>price</b> (MCP) <b>forecasting</b> in electricity spot markets with error correction and confidence interval estimation.

Hourly MCP forecasting of the Californian Power Market is used as a computer example, and the comparison with conventional ARIMA approach is given.
