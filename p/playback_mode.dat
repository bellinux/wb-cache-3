2500|$|A non-magnetic, non-electric, hand-powered tape {{recorder}} was patented {{by two of}} the Volta associates in 1886 (...) [...] The tape was a 3/16inch (4.8mm) wide strip of paper coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then scraping one side clean before the coating had set. The machine, of sturdy wood and metal construction, was hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The tape passed from one eight inch (20.3cm) diameter reel and around a pulley with guide flanges, where it came into contact with either the recording or playback stylus. It was then wound onto a second reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a sound-vibrated mica diaphragm, engraved a groove into the wax coating. In <b>playback</b> <b>mode,</b> a dull, loosely mounted stylus attached to a rubber diaphragm rode in the recorded groove. The reproduced sound was heard through rubber listening tubes like those of a stethoscope.|$|E
50|$|The Saturn port of Fighting Vipers added <b>Playback</b> <b>Mode</b> and Training Mode, both {{of which}} are now used widely in the genre, by games such as Tekken and Soulcalibur. Players could save their matches and play them again in <b>Playback</b> <b>Mode,</b> while Training Mode talked the player through the moves of each {{character}} one-by-one.|$|E
50|$|The Canon EOS 30D also {{features}} a large dial on its back which is used for fast scrolling over the stored pictures or over the settings in the menu. The JUMP button {{can also be used}} to reach sections of the menu easily, as well as scroll through either 10 or 100 image in <b>playback</b> <b>mode.</b> The 8 way controller above the dial is used to select one of the 9 AF points, to move around a zoomed image in <b>playback</b> <b>mode,</b> and to set custom white balance.|$|E
50|$|B-Step Sequencer has a {{long list}} of features, {{including}} full MIDI and MIDI beat clock sync support, Sequencer Ratcheting, shuffle (swing), monophonic and polyphonic note <b>playback</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{attempts}} {{to recreate the}} module replay and user experience of the popular DOS program FastTracker, with special <b>playback</b> <b>modes</b> available for improved Amiga ProTracker 2/3 compatibility.|$|R
40|$|New {{applications}} and display techniques may {{be tested in}} real-time or in post-event <b>playback</b> <b>modes.</b> Because applications can be rapidly prototyped in WDSS-II, it serves as an ideal platform to test new concepts in weather data analysis and warning decision-making before they are migrated into operational systems...|$|R
50|$|Enabling the crossfading backend option with a {{duration}} of 0.0 switches Rhythmbox into gapless <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> for music formats that support it. Gapless playback is not enabled by default.|$|E
50|$|The Sony α230 has a {{standard}} USB 2.0 port {{along with its}} mini HDMI port. The camera sends a review image to HDMI output immediately after taking a photo. There {{is no need to}} switch to <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> to review.|$|E
50|$|Sel-sync {{along with}} the {{multi-track}} head was invented by Ross Snyder at Ampex in 1955. Three problems had to be solved: mechanical alignment, switching of the record track to <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> and multitrack erase head. The hard problem was the switching of a track between record and <b>playback</b> <b>mode,</b> as the impedance of record heads are {{quite different from the}} impedance of play back heads. Prior to Sel-Sync record heads were directly wired to the record electronics and playback heads were directly wired to the playback electronics. Also the designs of the two heads were very different. The problem of switching very low-level/high-impedance circuitry without introducing hum or noise had to be solved. Mort Fujii in the Ampex special projects lab was responsible for the actual design.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{announcement}} that support and development for FT2 would be stopped, Ruben Ramos Salvador (BakTery) started working on a FastTracker 3 that {{is now known as}} Skale Tracker, available for both Windows, Linux and online. In later years many other trackers tried to follow up on the legacy of FT2, notably the MilkyTracker; with special <b>playback</b> <b>modes</b> available for improved Amiga ProTracker 2/3 compatibility. see also the Clone section below.|$|R
40|$|Technical {{issues are}} not the only ones {{preventing}} large scale introduction of online streaming video services. Unlike generic web browsing applications, streaming video imposes greater demands on network resources. Caching of content through the use of distributed servers has been proposed as a solution to reduce resource requirements and improve scalability. Video caching presents a unique challenge to copyright protection schemes, particularly if we consider provision of functionality such as indexed and high-speed <b>playback</b> <b>modes.</b> This paper discusses the issues involved in implementing copyright protection for cached streaming video, concluding with a set of requirements for any proposed scheme...|$|R
50|$|GPS {{support and}} {{improved}} wireless support (with WT-2 transmitter for 802.11b/g) were also added. A new LCD screen {{of the same}} size but with increased resolution and a higher refresh rate was added to the body. The screen's <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> now supports 15x zoom instead of the 8x of the D2H, with RGB Histogram.|$|E
50|$|It is {{actually}} the world's first bridge camera which can record in 4K (2160p) video resolution, as opposed to other compact cameras filming at full HD (1080p) resolution. What sets it apart the most is the introduction of 4K at 30p Ultra HD video with a price lower than $900. Furthermore, 8 megapixel JPEG photos can be extracted from any video frame from 4K videos in <b>playback</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} field of invention {{during this period}} was the tape recorder. Magnetic tape recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a tape head, which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In <b>playback</b> <b>mode,</b> the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature electric generator as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.|$|E
50|$|Note {{also that}} charge {{duration}} varies widely between <b>playback</b> and recording <b>modes.</b>|$|R
3000|$|There are {{applications}} where partial decoding can crucially {{influence the}} end user's experience. Consider, for example, broadcasting a continuous stream of video or audio in live or <b>playback</b> <b>modes.</b> Even though fountain codes and RLNC are throughput optimal, {{having to wait}} for the entire coded block to arrive can result in unacceptable delays in the application layer. But, we also note that partial decoding of packets out of their natural temporal order does not necessarily translate into low delivery delays desired by the application layer. The authors in [5, 6] have proposed feedback-based throughput-optimal schemes to deal with the transmitter queue size, as well as decoding and delivery delays at the destinations. When the traffic load approaches system capacity, their methods are shown to behave [...] "gracefully" [...] and meet the delay performance benchmark of single-receiver automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes.|$|R
40|$|Musicians often {{learn about}} their vision of a piece through {{practicing}} it and listening to recordings. However, this does not always free the player to develop {{his or her own}} interpretation of the piece, especially when technique is lacking. We have developed software, the BowScribe markup language, that supports a violinist in creating a "performance model" of a piece currently beyond his or her playing skills, by allowing the player fine control over tempo, volume, and articulation, including playing of chords, at a level of expressiveness and flexibility that is significantly beyond the MIDI <b>playback</b> <b>modes</b> of popular music notation software. BowScribe has been used by the first author (who was trained as a prfessional violinist) to create a model of the entire Bach Chaconne (edited by Glamian), a long and demanding piece of music for solo violin that has many phrases that span groups of chords as well as melodic passages. The markup language specified chords to be rolled in two classic ways, as well as a wide variety of other strokes, including greater volume for individual notes in long slurs and small but essential variations in tempo...|$|R
50|$|To detect fake models {{the user}} has to display an image {{captured}} {{with the camera}} in the camera's monitor. The name of the camera used to capture the image will be displayed at the top {{right corner of the}} display, when the overview display option is enabled in full-frame <b>playback</b> <b>mode.</b> If the correct model number is displayed, {{it is supposed to be}} authentic, otherwise it is a fake.|$|E
50|$|The {{recorder}} {{writes the}} video signal onto a recording medium, such as magnetic videotape. Since the record function involves many signal-processing steps, some distortion and noise historically {{appeared on the}} stored video; playback of the stored signal {{did not have the}} exact characteristics and detail as a live video feed. All camcorders have a recorder-controlling section, allowing the user to switch the recorder into <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> for reviewing recorded footage, and an image-control section controlling exposure, focus and color balance.|$|E
50|$|The factory {{firmware}} {{that the}} 7Ds initially shipped with (version 1.00) included a few performance related camera issues which affected initial reviews. The next build of firmware (version 1.10) gave {{such a great}} improvement in camera performance that DPReview revised their initial review of the 7D to retract {{a couple of the}} main negative points, citing true USB 2.0 speeds up to 25Mbit/s (up from 7.5Mbit/s), blinking highlights in the camera's built-in <b>playback</b> <b>mode,</b> the addition of a remote storage function in the transfer modes, and faster times when writing to the CF memory cards.|$|E
50|$|For normal dial-up data communications, modems enter data mode {{only once}} - {{starting}} when the session connects, and ending when the session disconnects. However, when modems {{are used for}} fax and voice (audio) communication, they rapidly switch between command and data modes several times during a call. This is because {{the role of the}} modem changes more frequently - rather than simply handing bytes from point A to point B, it is either negotiating parameters and pages with a fax machine, or switching between recording, pausing, and <b>playback</b> audio <b>modes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Interface circuit {{triggers}} laser {{or other}} external source {{of light to}} flash in proper frame and field (at proper time) for video recording and <b>playback</b> in "pause" <b>mode.</b> Also increases speed of electronic shutter (if any) during affected frame to reduce visibility of background illumination relative to that of laser illumination...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThis paper {{describes}} the functionality of an airborne telemetry system which collects data from standard PCM, MIL 1553 and ARINC data sources and records this data to an AMPEX DRCSi Digital Tape Recorder while supporting concurrent realtime data processing and display functions. The system includes data acquisition equipment, {{digital to analog}} capability, data simulation and {{a wide range of}} data preprocessing capability. Emphasis is given to the implementation of the AMPEX recorder interface. The entire system is composed of data acquisition equipment to directly input measurements, a telemetry front end to collect PCM, MIL 1553 and ARINC 429 & 561 data, a host computer to control and monitor the setup, recording and distribution of data and a pair of high resolution color workstations for operator control and data display. This equipment is housed within a single, military-type electronic enclosure which is loaded into the cargo bay of the aircraft as a single unit and manned by two people during flight. The Digital Tape Recorder provides for a large data capacity and very high data rates. Special I/O requirements, data rates and data selection options are discussed. Consideration is given for the best test flight utilization of the AMPEX recorder in both acquisition and <b>playback</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R
50|$|To better {{understand}} this, suppose one has two screens, called A and B, {{and the ability}} to instantly switch the display from one to the other. The normal <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> is to load the initial frame into A and duplicate it into B. Then frame A is displayed on the screen. Then the differences for frame 2 are used to alter screen B and it is displayed. Then the differences for frame 3 are used to alter screen A and it is displayed, and so on. Note that frame 2 is stored as differences from frame 1, but all other frames are stored as differences from two frames back.|$|E

5000|$|According {{to video}} game website IGN, Square Enix representatives have branded Dragon Quest Swords {{a sequel to}} Kenshin Dragon Quest, a motion-activated {{plug-and-play}} TV game. In a detailed preview of Dragon Quest Swords, IGN speculated that the game mechanics will be similar to those featured in Kenshin. A short teaser video of a first-person perspective battle sequence appeared to confirm IGN's speculation as the onscreen protagonist mimicked the sword fighting antics of the Revolution Remote wielder. Furthermore, Square Enix stated in a press release that the game [...] "is being developed with {{every aspect of the}} unique Wii hardware in mind." [...] Square-Enix would later announce extra features for the North American version, such as a <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> and four hidden bosses. The localization follows the style of other recent releases in the Dragon Quest series from Square Enix. Notably, the same team responsible for the English translation of Dragon Quest VIII, Plus Alpha Translations, is listed among the translators in the ending staff roll.|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} work, we described an adaptive fast playback framework for video summarization where {{we changed the}} playback rate using the motion activity feature so as to maintain a constant ”pace”. This method provides an effective way of skimming through video, especially when the motion is not too complex and the background is mostly still, such as in surveillance video. In this paper, we present an extended summarization framework that, in addition to motion activity, uses semantic cues such as face or skin color appearance, speech and music detection, or other domain dependent semantically significant events to control the playback rate. The semantic features we use are computationally inexpensive and can be computed in compressed domain, yet are robust, reliable, and have {{a wide range of}} applicability across different content types. The presented framework also allows for adaptive summaries based on preference, for example, to include more dramatic vs. action elements, or vice versa. The user can switch at any time between the skimming and the normal <b>playback</b> <b>modes.</b> The continuity of the video is preserved, and complete omission of segments that may be important to the user is avoided by using adaptive fast playback instead of skipping over long segments. The rule-set and the input parameters can be further modified to fit a certain domain or application. Our framework can be used by itself, or as a subsequent presentation stage for a summary produced by any other summarization technique that relies on generating a sub-set of the content...|$|R
50|$|Nintendo of Europe {{released}} the Nintendo MP3 Player in December 2006. It {{is very similar}} to the Japanese Play-Yan Micro, however the MP3 Player cannot play video files. Music is played from an SD Card inserted into the MP3 Player Cartridge (which fits into the GBA Slot), and a special Headphone port is included in the cartridge to enable <b>playback</b> during sleep <b>mode,</b> and in a higher quality than the DS speakers.

Some of {{these include the}} Screen Ratio, which allows users to indicate {{if they have a}} standard or widescreen display, Color Profile, which allows changing the color scheme of displays, and subtitle, which selects the default subtitle language. Other options include DVD Angle, which allows viewing the DVD from a different angle if necessary, audio language, which selects the default language for the movie's audio and sound, speaker environment, which allows selection of number of speakers for <b>playback,</b> and output <b>mode,</b> which determines the special process used on the sound signal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide flanges) mounted above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In <b>playback</b> <b>mode,</b> a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|E
50|$|The payload weighed 68 kg (150 pounds), and {{was built}} into the fairing pods of the Atlas missile. Combined weight of the total on-orbit package was 3969 kg (8750 pounds). SCORE was {{launched}} into a 183 km by 1,481 km (114 mile by 920 mile) orbit from LC-11 at Cape Canaveral Missile Test Annex, Florida inclined 32.3 degrees, with a period of 101.5 minutes. Its batteries lasted 12 days and it reentered the atmosphere on 21 January 1959. The communications repeater installed on the missile would receive a signal, amplify it, and then retransmit it. Two redundant sets of equipment were mounted in {{the nose of the}} SCORE missile. Four antennas were mounted flush with the missile surface, two for transmission and two for reception. SCORE's other equipment included two tape recorders, each with a four-minute capacity. Any of four ground stations in the southern United States could command the satellite into <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> to transmit the stored message or into record mode to receive and store a new message. These redundancies proved invaluable as one of the tape recorders malfunctioned and was rendered inoperable during the 12-day mission.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} field of invention {{during this period}} was the tape recorder. Magnetic tape recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a tape head, which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In <b>playback</b> <b>mode,</b> the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature electric generator as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it. The original solid steel ribbon {{was replaced by a}} much more practical coated paper tape, but acetate soon replaced paper as the standard tape base. Acetate has fairly low tensile strength and if very thin it will snap easily, so it was in turn eventually superseded by polyester. This technology, the basis for almost all commercial recording from the 1950s to the 1980s, was developed in the 1930s by German audio engineers who also rediscovered the principle of AC biasing (first used in the 1920s for wire recorders), which dramatically improved the frequency response of tape recordings. The technology was further improved just after World War II by American audio engineer John T. Mullin with backing from Bing Crosby Enterprises. Mullin's pioneering recorders were modifications of captured German recorders. In the late 1940s, the Ampex company produced the first tape recorders commercially available in the US.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Nintendo's {{previous}} handheld consoles {{such as the}} Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite, the Nintendo DSi {{has built}} in music playback support. The DSi Music program is split into two modes: voice recording and music playback. Both offer plenty of entertainment value because of the tools and gimmicks Nintendo has included. The recording mode lets users record at most 18 clips of maximum 10 seconds length. Once they have recorded a clip, they can play around with it in various ways. For example, users can make the clip play backwards or forwards, isolate small sections using A-B repeat, and modify the speed and tone by dragging a pointer around on a 2D graph. They can also apply 12 effects to the clip, {{which can be used}} to transform the sound. The music <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> also has many play options. Once a song has been loaded up, users can change the speed and tone just like with the recording mode. They can also overlay the recordings that has been made in the recording mode to songs at any point. In addition, Nintendo has provided a set of sound effects which can be selected quickly by using the stylus, then inserted freely using shoulder buttons.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} implementation {{and evaluation of}} a haptic playback system using the PHANToM haptic inerface, {{in the context of}} our Virtual Haptic Back Project at Ohio University. Playback has the potential to improve virtual palpatory diagnosis training by allowing students to follow and feel an expert's motions prior to performing their own palpatory tasks. We have two modes in our playback system. In mode 1 the human is passive and experiences position playback of the expert's tactile examination via the PHANToM with a PD position controller. No haptics model is enabled in mode 1. In mode 2 the human traces the expert's path actively through visual cues. Mode 2 enables the haptics model so that the trainee feels approximately what the expert did in the original task. The experiment described in this article showed that performance with <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> 2 is enhanced (i. e., there is less position error) when preceded by <b>playback</b> <b>mode</b> 1...|$|E
