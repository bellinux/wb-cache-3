5|$|Nonstandard {{amino acids}} are usually formed through {{modifications}} to standard amino acids. For example, homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway {{or by the}} demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite S-adenosyl methionine, while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of <b>proline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{amino acids}} have special {{properties}} such as cysteine, that can form covalent disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues, <b>proline</b> that forms a cycle to the polypeptide backbone, and glycine {{that is more}} flexible than other amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} have biological functions. For example, {{in the human}} brain, glutamate (standard glutamic acid) and gamma-amino-butyric acid ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Hydroxyproline, {{a major component of}} the connective tissue collagen, is synthesised from <b>proline.</b> Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells. Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} of human elastin is not random {{with regard to}} the positioning of <b>prolines</b> and glycines. (A) An analysis of the number of residues between consecutive <b>prolines</b> reveals clear patterns which result from the repetitive nature of elastin’s sequence. Larger spacings between <b>prolines</b> occur due to cross-linking domains, many of which contain long proline-free stretches. (B) Converting the inter-proline spacing data to a probability distribution indicates that it is mostly likely to find 2, 3, 4 or 5 residues between consecutive <b>prolines...</b>|$|R
40|$|L-Glutamic acid was {{transformed}} into β-keto-phosphonate in two steps.  This compd. was employed in the stereocontrolled synthesis of cis- 5 -substituted <b>prolines</b> through a Woodward-Horner-Emmons (WHE) reaction with different aldehydes followed by hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation-mediated ring closure.  We found also that a one-pot sequential hydroformylation-WHE reaction was possible with cis- 5 -substituted <b>prolines.</b>  In addn. to differently functionalized <b>prolines,</b> an indolizidine amino acid with a structure related to constrained peptidomimetics was obtained...|$|R
50|$|RNase T1 {{also has}} four <b>prolines,</b> {{two of which}} (Pro39 and Pro55) have cis isomers of their X-Pro peptide bonds. Nonnative isomers of these <b>prolines</b> can retard {{conformational}} folding dramatically, folding on a characteristic time scale of 7,000 seconds (almost two hours) at 10 °C and pH 5.|$|R
5|$|This was {{followed}} by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline. Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid <b>proline.</b> Using various copolymers {{most of the remaining}} codons were then determined.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were {{isolated}} from tobacco which activated {{the production of}} protease inhibitors {{in a similar way}} to systemin in tomatoes. Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, Petunia and black nightshade. In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved <b>proline</b> or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E
5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only <b>proline</b> differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E
5000|$|Hydroxylation of lysines and <b>prolines</b> on propeptide by the enzymes 'prolyl hydroxylase' and 'lysyl hydroxylase' (to produce {{hydroxyproline}} and hydroxylysine) {{occurs to}} aid cross-linking of the alpha peptides. This enzymatic step requires vitamin C as a cofactor. In scurvy, {{the lack of}} hydroxylation of <b>prolines</b> and lysines causes a looser triple helix (which is formed by three alpha peptides).|$|R
40|$|The human {{prostacyclin}} receptor (hIP), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), plays {{important roles}} in vascular smooth muscle relaxation {{as well as the}} prevention of platelet aggre-gation. It has been postulated that GPCR transmembrane (TM) <b>prolines</b> serve as molecular hinges or swivels and are neces-sary for proper binding and activation. By individually (as well as collectively) mutating these hIP <b>prolines</b> to alanine, the ability to form key structural and functional configurations was re-moved. Significant effects on both binding and activation were observed. Two highly conserved <b>prolines</b> across GPCRs, Pro- 154, and Pro- 254 (TMVI), showed the greatest effect on de-creasing both binding and activation when changed to alanine. Along the extracellular boundary of the highly conserved trans-membrane III domain, a proline-to-alanine mutation at positio...|$|R
50|$|Another {{model is}} based on a larger segment of the same loop, {{containing}} amino acids 42 to 47, PTAMWP. Because sites of protein-protein interaction have often been found to be flanked by <b>prolines,</b> the presence of the two <b>prolines</b> in this ‘finger’ of the structure indicates a possible interaction site. A short polypeptide of eight amino acid residues, containing this sequence, was indeed found to block the L-type calcium channels, though with a lesser activity.|$|R
5|$|Overexpression of systemin and HypSys {{has been}} found to improve plants' {{tolerance}} to abiotic stress, including salt stress and UV radiation. When prosystemin was over-expressed in tomato, transgenic plants had lower stomatal conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of abscisic acid and <b>proline</b> and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that systemin either allowed the plants to adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment. Similarly, wounded tomato plants were less susceptible to salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots. An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the transgenic and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini et al. suggested that the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway determines a physiological state that not only directs resources towards the production of compounds active against pests, but also pre-adapts plants to minimize water loss. These effects are achieved by negatively regulating the production of hormones and metabolites that will force plants to invest additional resources to counteract water loss, a secondary effect of herbivores.|$|E
25|$|Imino acids {{typically}} {{contain an}} imine functional group, {{instead of the}} amino group found in amino acids. <b>Proline</b> is considered and usually referred to as an amino acid, but unlike others, it has a secondary amine. This feature, unique to <b>proline,</b> identifies <b>proline</b> also as an imino acid. Hydroxyproline is another imino acid, made from the naturally occurring hydroxylation of <b>proline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gyrate atrophy is an {{inherited}} degenerative disorder of the retina and choroid, sometimes accompanying the metabolic condition hyperornithinemia. The presence of gyrate atrophy with iminoglycinuria {{stems from a}} deficiency of <b>proline</b> in chorioretinal tissues, while processes behind hyperornithinemia disrupt the metabolic pathway from ornithine to <b>proline,</b> which alters the catabolism of ornithine, and also results in reduced levels of <b>proline.</b> Thus, gyrate atrophy can be found with either disorder, with <b>proline</b> deficiency as an underlying feature.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo date, 22 {{mitochondrial}} carrier subfamilies {{have been}} functionally identified based on substrate specificity. Structural, functional and bioinformatics studies {{have pointed to}} the existence in the mitochondrial carrier superfamily of a substrate-binding site in the internal carrier cavity, of two salt-bridge networks or gates that close the cavity alternatively on the matrix or the cytosolic side of the membrane, and of conserved <b>prolines</b> and glycines in the transmembrane α-helices. The significance of these properties in the structural changes occurring during the catalytic substrate translocation cycle are discussed {{within the context of}} a transport mechanism model. Most experimentally produced and disease-causing missense mutations concern carrier regions corresponding to the substrate-binding site, the two gates and the conserved <b>prolines</b> and glycines...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSurfactant protein SP-B is {{absolutely}} {{required for the}} surface activity of pulmonary surfactant and postnatal lung function. The results of a previous study indicated that the N-terminal segment of SP-B, comprising residues 1 – 9, is specifically required for surface activity, and suggested that <b>prolines</b> 2, 4, and 6 as well as tryptophan 9, may constitute essential structural motifs for protein function. In this work, we assessed the role of these two motifs in promoting the formation and maintenance of surface-active films. Three synthetic peptides were synthesized including a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 37 amino acids of native SP-B and two variants in which <b>prolines</b> 2, 4, 6, or tryptophan 9 were substituted by alanines. All three synthetic peptides were surface-active, as expected from their amphipathic structure. The peptides were also able to insert into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (7 : 3 w/w ratio) monolayers preformed at pressures > 30 mN/m, indicating that they perturb and insert into membranes. Substitution of alanine for tryptophan at position 9 significantly decreased both the rate of adsorption/insertion of the peptide into the interface and reinsertion of surface-active material excluded from the film during successive compression-expansion cycles. Substitution of alanines for <b>prolines</b> at positions 2, 4, and 6 did not produce substantial changes {{in the rate of}} adsorption/insertion; however, reinsertion of surface-active material into the expanding interface film was not as effective as {{in the presence of the}} nativelike peptide. These results suggest that W 9 is critical for optimal interface affinity, whereas <b>prolines</b> may promote a conformation that facilitates rapid insertion of the peptide into phospholipid monolayers compressed to the highest pressures during compression-expansion cycling...|$|R

25|$|There is one natural {{variant of}} the {{population}} (frequency 0.436) at 233aa from <b>proline</b> to leucine in the CXorf66 protein, with <b>proline</b> being the ancestral encoded amino acid. No effects have been observed with this missense mutation.|$|E
25|$|While arginine, {{glutamine}} {{and other}} amino acids are rapidly consumed often {{very early in}} fermentation, <b>proline</b> is not consumed by yeast at all during the normal, anaerobic conditions of fermentations. This is {{because one of the}} enzymes required for its use is an oxidase (requiring molecular oxygen) and the other is repressed by the presence of ammonium (another source of assimilable nitrogen needed by yeast) in the must. However, well aerated starter cultures that contain must which hasn't had any diammonium phosphate added it to it will usually see some utilization of <b>proline</b> before the anaerobic conditions of fermentation kick in. When winemakers measure FAN, they need to be aware if their assay is including <b>proline</b> since this will make their YAN measurement higher. Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are two Vitis vinifera varieties that are known to have very high <b>proline</b> levels while Riesling and Sauvignon blanc usually have very low levels.|$|E

Both reabsorption or absorption of glycine and imino acids takes place respectively at the proximal tubule or intestinal brush border epithelium. The more selective transport of <b>proline</b> and other imino acids is driven {{at the molecular level}} by a mammalian cellular transport mechanism aptly known as system IMINO.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} by o-phthaldialdehyde assay (NOPA) {{is used to}} measured available primary {{amino acids}} in grape juice using a spectrophotometer that can measure at 335nm wavelengths. Since the assay only measures primary amino acids, the results produces won't include <b>proline</b> or ammonia concentrations. <b>Proline</b> can be separately measured with an assay that uses ninhydrin to react with the amino acid {{in the presence of}} formic acid, yielding a compound that can be absorbed at 517nm.|$|E

These reactions add hydroxyl groups to the amino acids <b>proline</b> or lysine in the collagen molecule via prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, both requiring vitamin C as a cofactor. Hydroxylation allows the collagen molecule to assume its triple helix structure, and thus vitamin C {{is essential to the}} development and maintenance of scar tissue, blood vessels, and cartilage.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{molecular}} genetic {{analyses of}} Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2 (EBNA 2) identified {{a negative effect}} of deletion of codons 19 to 33 on transformation and gene transactivation, while deletion of codons 19 to 110 was a null mutation for transformation and gene transactivation. We here report the surprising finding that codons 2 to 88, which encode the highly conserved unique N terminus (amino acids 1 to 58) {{and most of the}} polyproline repeat (amino acids 59 to 95), can be deleted with only minimal effects on transformation. Codons 97 to 122 can also be deleted with only minimal effects on transformation. However, deletion of 35 of the 37 <b>prolines</b> (amino acids 59 to 93) or deletion of codons 2 to 95 results in a null transforming phenotype. Although EBNA 2 from which codons 59 to 93 were deleted was a null mutation for transformation, it was similar to some transforming mutants of EBNA 2 in abundance, in interaction with RBPJK, and in transactivation of the LMP 1 promoter in transient transfection assays. These data indicate that between three and seven <b>prolines</b> are critical for EBNA 2 structure or for intermolecular interaction. Aside from these seven <b>prolines,</b> codons encoding the rest of the N-terminal half (amino acids 2 to 230) of EBNA 2 are nonessential for primary B-lymphocyte growth transformation...|$|R
25|$|RNA {{polymerase}} II holoenzyme stability {{determines the}} number of base pairs that can be transcribed before the holoenzyme loses its ability to transcribe. The length of the CTD is essential for RNA polymerase II stability. RNA polymerase II stability {{has been shown to}} be regulated by post-translation <b>proline</b> hydroxylation. The von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL, human GeneID: 7428) complex binds the hyperphosphorylated large subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex, in a <b>proline</b> hydroxylation- and CTD phosphorylation-dependent manner, targeting it for ubiquitination.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{a common}} {{polymorphism}} involves {{the substitution of}} an arginine for a <b>proline</b> at codon position 72.

A 2011 study found that the TP53 <b>proline</b> mutation did {{have a profound effect on}} pancreatic cancer risk among males. A study of Arab women found that <b>proline</b> homozygosity at TP53 codon 72 is associated with a decreased risk for breast cancer. One study suggested that TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms, MDM2 SNP309, and A2164G may collectively be associated with non-oropharyngeal cancer susceptibility and that MDM2 SNP309 in combination with TP53 codon 72 may accelerate the development of non-oropharyngeal cancer in women. A 2011 study found that TP53 codon 72 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.|$|E
