5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's {{habitable}} zone, its gravitational influence would disrupt {{the orbit of}} <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> the outer part of the habitable zone.

5|$|Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets {{primarily}} {{composed of}} {{hydrogen and helium}} and are the most massive <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System.

5|$|Studies {{made with}} the NASA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer have {{discovered}} that the disk around Beta Pictoris contains an extreme overabundance of carbon-rich gas. This helps stabilize the disk against radiation pressure which would otherwise blow the material away into interstellar space. Currently, there are two suggested explanations for {{the origin of the}} carbon overabundance. Beta Pictoris might be in the process of forming exotic carbon-rich <b>planets,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to the terrestrial <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System, which are rich in oxygen instead of carbon. Alternatively it may be passing through an unknown phase that might also have occurred early {{in the development of the}} Solar System: in the Solar System there are carbon-rich meteorites known as enstatite chondrites, which may have formed in a carbon-rich environment. It has also been proposed that Jupiter may have formed around a carbon-rich core.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that 55 Cancri e is a solid planet made of carbon-rich material rather than the oxygen-rich material that makes up the terrestrial <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> our solar system.

5|$|As {{with all}} exoplanets, Kepler-11d is named first for its host star, Kepler-11. Because Kepler-11d was {{announced}} {{at the same time}} as the five other <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> the system, their names are sorted by their distances from the host star; thus, because Kepler-11d is the third planet from Kepler-11, it was given the designation d. Kepler-11 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA Earth-trailing satellite purposed with discovering Earth-like <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> a small area of the sky between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra by observing planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The transit causes the star's brightness to dim slightly and at a regular rate, a phenomenon that the Kepler satellite notes till future study can prove or disprove the existence of a planetary body. Kepler-11d was flagged by Kepler-11, given the designation KOI-157.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was {{originally}} intended to be designed by Mark Cerny, who had designed all the games in the series thus far, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.

5|$|Free-floating <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> stellar {{clusters}} {{have similar}} velocities {{to the stars}} and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 876 b was {{discovered}} independently by two different teams, one led by Geoffrey Marcy (with data from Keck Observatory and Lick Observatory) {{and the other}} by Xavier Delfosse (at Geneva Observatory). Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, it {{was discovered}} by detecting variations in its star's radial velocity {{as a result of}} the planet's gravity.

5|$|HAT-P-33b's {{existence}} was first suggested after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, {{a project that}} searches the sky for <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> transit of, or crossing in front of, their host stars.
