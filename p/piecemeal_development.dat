2500|$|Pierpont Bay (Pierpont) is a {{residential}} {{neighborhood in the}} one-mile stretch between the Ventura Harbor and San Buenaventura State Beach. Reclaimed marshland was subdivided in 1925 and houses were built in fits of development interrupted by years of economic depression, war, and coastal floods (in 1937 and 1962). Long a hodge-podge of rental dwellings, weekend cottages and vacant lots, it was transformed by successive California real estate booms into a fashionable but eclectic mix of newer large homes and older modest beach cottages, now mostly owner-occupied. <b>Piecemeal</b> <b>development,</b> not overly burdened by planning efforts or regulatory attentions, left Pierpont with widely varying architectural styles, a spotty retail district Seaward Avenue, newer residents' demands for increased municipal [...] maintenance, and continuing disputes about the proper regulation of the neighborhood's public beaches. Recently plans have been announced for high-density development on some streets, and state authorities have begun to more actively manage beaches that were mostly self-regulated for eighty years.|$|E
60|$|It is in {{this sort}} of matter that {{revolutions}} are most useful. If the Russian Revolution had been accompanied by a revolution in Germany, the dramatic suddenness of the change might have shaken Europe, for the moment, out of its habits of thought: the idea of fraternity might have seemed, in the twinkling of an eye, to have entered the world of practical politics; and no idea is so practical as the idea of the brotherhood of man, if only people can be startled into believing in it. If once the idea of fraternity between nations were inaugurated with the faith and vigor belonging to a new revolution, all the difficulties surrounding it would melt away, for all of them are due to suspicion and the tyranny of ancient prejudice. Those who (as is common in the English-speaking world) reject revolution as a method, and praise the gradual <b>piecemeal</b> <b>development</b> which (we are told) constitutes solid progress, overlook the effect of dramatic events in changing the mood and the beliefs of whole populations. A simultaneous revolution in Germany and Russia would no doubt have had such an effect, and would have made {{the creation of a new}} world possible here and now.|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} of city-regions, {{the increase in}} the standard of living and changing lifestyles have collectively led to an increase in housing demand. New residential areas are encroaching onto the city fringes including suburban and green field areas. Large and small developers are actively building houses ranging from a few blocks to master-planned style projects. These residential developments, particularly in major urban areas, represent a large portion of urban land use in Malaysia, and, thus, have become a major contributor to overall urban sustainability. There are three main types that comprise the mainstream, and form integral parts to contemporary urban residential developments, namely, subdivision <b>developments,</b> <b>piecemeal</b> <b>developments,</b> and master-planned developments. Many new master-planned developments market themselves as environmentally friendly, and provide layouts that encompass sustainable design and development. To date, however, there have been limited studies conducted to examine such claims or to ascertain which of these three residential development layouts is more sustainable. To fill this gap, this research was undertaken to develop a framework for assessing the level of sustainability of residential developments, focusing on their layouts at the neighbourhood level. The development of this framework adopted a mixed method research strategy and embedded research design to achieve the study aim and objectives. Data were collected from two main sources, where quantitative data were gathered from a three-round Delphi survey and spatial data from a layout plan. Sample respondents for surveys were selected from among experts in the field of the built environment, both from Malaysia and internationally. As for spatial data, three case studies – master-planned, <b>piecemeal</b> and subdivision <b>developments</b> representing different types of neighbourhood developments in Malaysia have been selected. Prior to application on the case studies, the appropriate framework was subjected to validation to ascertain its robustness for application in Malaysia. Following the application of the framework on the three case studies the results revealed that master-planned development scored a better level of sustainability compared to <b>piecemeal</b> and subdivision <b>developments.</b> The results generated from this framework are expected to provide evidence to the policy makers and development agencies as well as provide an awareness of the level of sustainability and the necessary collective efforts required for developing sustainable neighbourhoods. Continuous assessment can facilitate a comparison of sustainability over time for neighbourhoods as a means to monitor changes in the level of sustainability. In addition, the framework is able to identify any particular indicator (issue) that causes a significant impact on sustainability...|$|R

50|$|The Dysarts' {{acquisition}} of Canbury was well timed as Kingston expanded northwards during the 19th-century. The expansion {{was driven by}} {{the coming of the}} railway to the area with the extension of the line from Twickenham to Kingston completed in 1863, then extended to Norbiton in 1869 to its terminus at Ludgate Hill. Developers bought 103 acres of Lord Liverpool's Farm to the north and east of the railway as well as 33 acres next to Kingston Station, and 44 acres of pasture and arable land of the Dysart estate.

Early settlement in the area consisted of expansive estates, later subdivided {{in response to the}} city’s burgeoning population. The West Sixth Street streetcar line, commonly referred to as the West Line, extended into the district from downtown and facilitated the development of suburban tracts. Due to the <b>piecemeal</b> <b>development</b> and hilly topography of the area, the streets form an irregular rectilinear grid. A number of notable nineteenth-century residences and institutional buildings exist throughoutthe district, but the preponderance of resources consist of Craftsman and Classical Revival-influenced bungalows built {{during the height of the}} area's development from the 1910s-1930s. In keeping with the original developers’ intentions, the historic district maintains strong residential characteristics.|$|E
40|$|The <b>piecemeal</b> <b>developments</b> {{in product}} {{liability}} reform in Europe have their {{origins in the}} tragic association of phocomelia in children with thalidomide in 1962. In many ways these events have continued to generate pressure for reform of product liability, especially {{for the victims of}} drug-induced injury. This monograph attempts to address the major problems that typify claims for drug-induced injury, as well as highlighting the complex interrelationship between liability exposure and drug regulation. While medicinal products are subject to strict liability under the product liability directive, the claimant may have considerable difficulty in establishing that the relevant product is defective and that it caused the damage. It may also be necessary to overcome the development risk defence where this is pleaded. The monograph addresses these problems on a comparative jurisprudential basis, and seeks to determine whether medicinal products should be treated as a special case in the field of product liability. It examines the role of epidemiological evidence in assessing causation in product liability cases concerning medicinal products in the light of recent developments in the UK Supreme Court, the United States, Canada and France. In particular, it addresses the difficulties in reconciling the standards of proof in law and science, including the theory that causation can be proved on the balance of probabilities by reference to the doubling of risk of injury. An important case study compares and contrasts the approaches of the UK and the US to the measles, mumps, rubella Litigation. The book also examines the question as to whether compliance with regulatory standards should protect pharmaceutical manufacturers from product liability suits. It seeks to support a via media whereby the victims of drug induced injury can receive justice, {{while at the same time}} encouraging drug safety and innovation in drug development...|$|R

In this way density is achieved without losing the characteristic of the indoor outdoor relationship we expect in our environment. This also provides a platform for interaction between people which may develop a sense of invigoration and community.

50|$|Although Vancouver {{public support}} for the stadium was high (a Mustel survey found that 71% of Vancouver {{residents}} supported the project), the proposal drew protests from several groups including the Gastown Neighbourhood Coalition. Local architects Arthur Erickson and Bing Thom also urged caution, saying that <b>piecemeal</b> <b>development</b> of some of Vancouver's last undeveloped waterfront should be avoided. They argued that the stadium would deny waterfront access and would negatively affect the historical theme of the Gastown area. The architects urged city hall to delay approval until a comprehensive plan had been submitted. Independent architecture firm Hotson Bakker, which was hired by the city of Vancouver, concluded that the stadium plans as proposed were unworkable. They reported that the development did not fit with the Gastown district and did not take future residential developments into account. They also stressed the need for a comprehensive waterfront plan.|$|E

40|$|The United Kingdom {{constitution}} is evolutionary, historical and predominantly political. Parliamentary sovereignty, as interpreted by Dicey, states that Parliament can legislate on any subject matter that it wishes; {{that the courts}} cannot question duly enacted legislation of the Westminster Parliament and that Parliament is unable to bind its successors as to the content or the manner and form of legislation. Understood in this manner, parliamentary sovereignty prevents the enactment of a legally entrenched Constitution. 	 However, recent developments question the accuracy of this account of UK constitutional culture. The UK’s membership of the EU is one event influencing this change in attitude. First, the supremacy of directly effective EU law questions the accuracy of Dicey’s conception of parliamentary sovereignty. Secondly, {{the way in which}} courts have modified English law to accommodate supremacy and direct effect may be evidence of a shift away from a political towards a legal constitution based on constitutional principles of the common law – referred to as ‘common law constitutionalism’. This is reinforced by the Human Rights Act 1998 which incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into English law. Thirdly, there are legal dicta supporting the claim that courts could, in extreme circumstances, strike down legislation.

Open space planning, or land use planning, centers around the concept of communities directing their own development. When communities develop their own strategy for development, they get to decide what is important in their particular situation. Through open space planning, stakeholders can identify areas that they feel are important to protect from development and direct growth to areas that can sustain it. Open space planning can be used to develop ordinances that incorporate conservation features, or areas, into subdivisions.
