40|$|International audienceThe {{role of the}} Mg 2 + cation on {{antihypertensive}} molecule {{binding on}} human serum albumin (HSA) was studied by affinity chromatography. The thermodynamic data corresponding to this binding were determined {{for a wide range}} of Mg 2 + concentrations (c). For the nifedipine molecule, an increase in the Mg 2 + concentration produced a decrease in binding due to a decrease in the electrostatic interactions. For verapamil and diltiazem, which have the highest solvent accessible surface area, the solute binding on HSA was divided into two Mg 2 + concentration regions. For a low c value below c(c) (approximately 1. 6 mmol/l), the binding dependence with c was similar to that of nifedipine. For c above c(c) the hydrophobic effect created in the bulk solvent associated with a decrease in the van der Waals interactions between the solute molecule and the HSA implied a decrease in its binding.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} microchamber system for {{performing}} electrophysiological measurements on epithelial surface on culture membranes in the mm 2 range. This miniaturised system permits the use of small quantities of epithelial cells, which in relatively short time grow into a tight layer {{that can be used in}} electrophysiological (ion transport) experiments. Availability of cells is an issue, for example when the cells originate from human biopsies or from (expensive!) transgenic mice. Apart from having reduced culture surfaces (for use with scarce biological tissues), there are tremendous advantages in having a cell culture mini-chamber. Our systems are with integrated electrical electrodes, micro-fluidic channels and feed-throughs, making them extremely compact and easy to use, thereby avoiding cell perturbation by manipulations. The structures facilitate control of the cell layer growth, the measurement of the cell layer resistance and the transport and diffusion of biological or <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecules</b> through the cell layer. Moreover we have chosen cheap and easy-to-tool materials for the realisation of disposable devices. We have also fabricated modular devices, in which the cell culture membranes can be reversibly placed within or removed from the system, thereby offering flexibility and economic interest. These microsystems (for biological applications ("biosystems")) are realised using photolithography, various etching procedures (among which powder-blasting), thin film deposition, electrochemical deposition, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) moulding and gluing technologies. Both electrical and fluidic characterisation of the biosystems has been performed.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The charge {{distribution}} of halogen atoms on organochlorine compounds {{can be highly}} anisotropic and even display a so-called Ï-hole, which leads to strong halogen bonds with electron donors. In this paper, we have systematically investigated a series of chloromethanes with one to four chloro substituents using a polarizable multipole-based molecular mechanics model. The atomic multipoles accurately reproduced the ab initio electrostatic potential around chloromethanes, including CCl 4, which has a prominent Ï-hole on the Cl atom. The van der Waals parameters for Cl were fitted to the experimental density and heat of vaporization. The calculated hydration free energy, solvent reaction fields, and interaction energies of several homo- and heterodimer of chloromethanes are in good agreement with experimental and ab initio data.

40|$|Abstract In {{the repair}} of complex {{congenital}} heart defects or in surgery of the aortic arch, normal circulation may be temporarily halted {{to ensure a}} clean, bloodless operation field. The brain is the organ most vulnerable to ischemic injury during this no-flow period, and the mortality and morbidity of these procedures today consists mostly of neurological complications. Hypothermia decreases the need for oxygen and other metabolites, and cooling the patient with an extracorporeal heart-lung machine can provide enough time to perform the necessary surgical procedures during a circulatory standstill. This procedure {{is referred to as}} hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). Sometimes the cerebral circulation can be maintained even if {{the rest of the body}} undergoes circulatory arrest, and this strategy, involving separate catheterization of brain-destined vessels, is referred to as selective cerebral perfusion (SCP). In this work, four separate brain protection strategies were evaluated. Two studies were performed on a surviving porcine model (I, II) to evaluate neurological recovery as well as cerebral metabolism and histopathology, and two were acute in design (III, IV), employing the modern technology of intravital microscopy to examine cerebral microcirculation. The first study (I) showed that the administration of hypertonic saline dextran (HSD) led to a decrease in intracranial pressure, improved brain metabolism, better neurological recovery and less histopathological injury of the brain tissue in association with HCA. In the second study (II) a novel <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecule,</b> levosimendan, reduced the intracranial pressure during the operation, but no improvement in terms of cerebral metabolism, neurological recovery or histopathological brain injury was observed after HCA. In the third study (III), real-time intravital microscopy showed that in association with HCA, a leukocyte depleting filter (LDF) attached to the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit reduces the number of activated leukocytes in cerebral microcirculation. In the fourth study (IV), cerebral metabolism and microcirculation were similar during SCP independent of the acid-base management strategy. The results of this work suggest that HSD could be assessed in human trials, that levosimendan needs further studies to optimize its potential, that the LDF functions as designed and that the differences between the Î±- and the pH-stat acid-base management strategies with SCP did not differ in moderate hypothermia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Today {{there are}} many {{licensed}} antiviral drugs, but the emergence of drug resistant strains sometimes invalidates {{the effects of the}} current therapies used in the treatment of infectious diseases. Compared to conventional antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used as <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecules</b> have particular physical characteristics and modes of action, and, therefore, they should be considered as a distinct therapeutic class. Despite being historically validated, antibodies may represent a novel tool for combatting infectious diseases. The current high cost of mAbs' production, storage and administration (by injection only) and the consequent obstacles to development are outweighed by mAbs' clinical advantages. These are related to a low toxicity combined with high specificity and versatility, which allows a specific antibody to mediate various biological effects, ranging from the virus neutralization mechanisms to the modulation of immune responses. This review briefly summarizes the recent technological advances in the field of immunoglobulin research, and the current status of mAb-based drugs in clinical trials for HIV and HCV diseases.

40|$|The {{enterohepatic}} circulation of bile acids {{is one of}} the most efficient recycling routes in the human body. It is a complex process involving numerous transport proteins, which serve to transport bile acids from the small intestine into portal circulation, from the portal circulation into the hepatocyte, from the hepatocyte into the bile, and from the gall bladder to the small intestine. The tremendous transport capacity and organ specificity of {{enterohepatic circulation}} combined with versatile derivatization possibilities, rigid steroidal backbone, enantiomeric purity, availability, and low cost have made bile acids attractive tools in designing <b>pharmacological</b> hybrid <b>molecules</b> and prodrugs with the view of improving intestinal absorption, increasing the metabolic stability of pharmaceuticals, specifically targeting drugs to organs involved in enterohepatic circulation, as well as sustaining therapeutically reasonable systemic concentrations of active agents. This article briefly describes bile acid transport proteins involved in enterohepatic circulation, summarizes the key factors affecting on the transport by these proteins, and reviews the use of bile acids and their derivatives in designing prodrugs capable of exploiting the bile acid transport system...|$|R
