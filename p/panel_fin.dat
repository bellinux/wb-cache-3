50|$|The similar {{production}} Masterline wagon (also {{based on}} the Crown) had only 2 doors, 2 rows of bench seats to allow seating for 6 people (plus luggage) and simpler side <b>panels</b> (without <b>fins).</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{full page}} of <b>panel</b> of World's <b>Finest</b> Comics #3 (Fall 1941), {{featuring}} the Scarecrow's debut. Art by Bob Kane.|$|R
50|$|The tower's fa√ßade {{will consist}} of a full-height glass curtain wall, with coated metal panels and {{louvered}} metal <b>panels</b> with projecting <b>fins.</b> The crown will be formed from a ring of spires.|$|R
50|$|Photographs of {{the gates}} in Birmingham show the mermaids {{on the four}} iron <b>panels</b> had {{suffered}} <b>fin</b> loss and other signs of damage, which older photographs from 1941, show occurred before the move. This may be malicious damage caused by seamen angry at being locked out of the Home after curfew, or during the three occasions, two of them deadly, when thechains failed to stop the massive doors coming off the rails.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Shark {{is formed}} with integral fin, seat backs, floors and instrument <b>panel.</b> The <b>fin,</b> set forward so the rudder trailing edge {{is above the}} elevator hinge line, is shaped like a shark's back fin, strongly swept and with a curved leading edge. There is also a small ventral fin. From the fin forward the upper fuselage line rises rapidly to merge into that of the side hinged, single piece canopy. There is a big baggage space behind the cockpit. Both of the adjustable tandem seats have flight controls; the Shark is flown by a sidestick. It {{is powered by a}} [...] Rotax 912ULS or [...] Rotax 914 turbocharged powerplant, driving a three-blade or a two-blade propeller. The Shark UL has retractable gear and a variable-pitch propeller.|$|R
40|$|Computer {{programs}} are presented which {{are capable of}} calculating detailed aerodynamic loadings and pressure distributions acting on pitched and rolled supersonic missile configurations which utilize bodies of circular or elliptical cross sections. The applicable range of angle of attack is up to 20 deg, and the Mach number range is 1. 3 to about 2. 5. Effects of body and fin vortices {{are included in the}} methods, as well as arbitrary deflections of canard or <b>fin</b> <b>panels...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first-generation Toronado lasted {{with the}} usual annual facelifts through 1970. Other than the brakes, the major changes were the {{replacement}} of the original [...] V8 with the new [...] in 1968 that was rated at [...] in standard form or [...] with the W-34 option, revised rear quarter <b>panels</b> (with small <b>fins</b> to disguise the slope of the rear body in side view) in 1969, and the disappearance of hidden headlights and the introduction of squared wheel arch bulges in 1970. An ignition lock became standard in 1969.|$|R
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on a 0. 175 -scale model of the OMAC Laser 300 canard configuration in the NASA Langley 12 -Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel to determine its low-speed high angel-of-attack aerodynamic characteristics. The Laser 300 is a general aviation turboprop pusher aircraft utilizing a canard configuration. The design incorporates a low forward wing and a high main wing with a leading-edge droop installed on the outboard <b>panel</b> and tip <b>fins</b> mounted on the wing tips. The model was tested over a range of - 6 to 50 -deg angle-of-attack and 20 to - 20 deg sideslip. Static force and moment data were measured, and the longitudinal and lateral-directional characteristics were determined...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program that simulates {{the performance of}} a space radiator is presented. The program basically consists of a rigorous analysis which analyzes a symmetrical <b>fin</b> <b>panel</b> and an approximate analysis that predicts system characteristics for cases of non-symmetrical operation. The rigorous analysis accounts for both transient and steady state performance including aerodynamic and radiant heating of the radiator system. The approximate analysis considers only steady state operation with no aerodynamic heating. A description of the radiator system and instructions to the user for program operation is included. The input required for the execution of all program options is described. Several examples of program output are contained in this section. Sample output includes the radiator performance during ascent, reentry and orbit...|$|R

50|$|The Terrier Malemute is a {{two-stage}} American {{sounding rocket}} typically used for smaller payloads (less than 180 kg). Both the Terrier first {{stage and the}} Malemute second stage use solid fuel. The Terrier burns for approximately 5.2 seconds, and the Malemute burns for approximately 21.5 seconds. The first stage booster consists of a surplus Navy Terrier MK 12 Mod 1 rocket motor with four 340-square-inch (0.22 m2) <b>fin</b> <b>panels</b> arranged in a cruciform configuration. The Terrier rocket booster has a diameter of 18 inches (460 mm). The second stage solid rocket is a Thiokol Malemute TU-758 rocket motor, specially designed for high altitude research rocket applications. Apogee is approximately 400 km (220 nmi) for a 500 lb (230 kg) payload or 700 km (380 nmi) for a 91 lb (41 kg) payload. For a payload weight of 200 lb (91 kg), the acceleration during the boost phase is 26 g.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} facades of {{the building}} are divided into bays by flat vertical moulded fins which extend beyond the parapet line, terminating with leaf shaped silhouettes. These fins define the bays {{of the building}} and separate banks of windows surrounded by decorative moulding and moulded <b>panels.</b> A vertical <b>fin</b> moulded <b>panel</b> forms a base to the building and surmounting this are sills for the ground floor window openings. The windows throughout the building are timber framed vertical sashes. Between the windows of the ground floor and the first floor are vertical <b>fin</b> moulded <b>panels</b> with central disc and diamond shaped ornaments which also act as ventilators, alternating on each of the panels. Above the first floor windows openings is a strip moulding with chevron and diamond pattern. The parapet is lined on its upper edge with a strip moulding with a vertical lined pattern which creates a miniature crenellated silhouette between the leaf shaped fins. Separating the windows are vertical moulded pilaster-like elements with vertical mouldings. The other faces of the building are of unrendered brickwork.|$|R
