50|$|Mining: Deposits {{of sulfur}} ore, rock <b>phosphate,</b> <b>guano,</b> {{limestone}} and cement raw materials were also traced but {{still have to}} be tapped for commercial and industrial uses.|$|E
50|$|The large arch-shaped opening {{was made}} to access the <b>phosphate</b> (<b>guano)</b> {{resources}} for use as fertilizer, which has been quite profitable. Prospects of mining limestone at this location have been explored, but dismissed as unviable.|$|E
50|$|Yet later during September 1933 the leases and guano {{rights of}} Fairfax and Hoskyn Islands, off Gladstone, were sold by auction at Gladstone. They were bought {{on behalf of}} the Barrier Reef <b>Phosphate</b> (<b>Guano)</b> Syndicate.|$|E
50|$|The {{island was}} a seabird rookery and {{depressions}} {{on the surface}} of the island were filled by a <b>phosphate</b> rich <b>guano</b> layer up to several metres thick.|$|R
50|$|Numerous caves {{developed}} in limestone terrains had been inventoried {{in the past}} for presence of <b>phosphate</b> - <b>guano</b> deposits. However, with the current thrust on prioritization of cave for protection and use as eco-tourism spots, extraction of guanos from caves is currently minimal.|$|R
50|$|Deposits {{which contain}} {{phosphate}} in quantity and concentration which are economic to mine as ore for their phosphate content {{are not particularly}} common. The two main sources for <b>phosphate</b> are <b>guano,</b> formed from bird droppings, and rocks containing concentrations of the calcium phosphate mineral, apatite.|$|R
5000|$|Île du Lys, {{located at}} [...] about 8 km {{northeast}} of Grande Glorieuses, is about 600 m long {{and consists of}} sand dunes and scrub with some mangroves. It was formerly quarried for <b>phosphate</b> (<b>guano).</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{resident}} of Okinawa Prefecture {{who had been}} engaging in activities such as fishery around the Senkaku Islands since around 1884 made an application for the lease of the islands, and approval was granted by the Meiji Government in 1896. After this approval, he sent a total of 248 workers to those islands and ran the following businesses: constructing piers, collecting bird feathers, manufacturing dried bonito, collecting coral, raising cattle, manufacturing canned goods and collecting mineral <b>phosphate</b> <b>guano</b> (bird manure for fuel use). The fact that the Meiji Government gave approval concerning {{the use of the}} Senkaku Islands to an individual, who in turn was able to openly run these businesses mentioned above based on the approval, demonstrates Japan's valid control over the Islands.|$|E
5000|$|The {{firm had}} opened an agents office in Lima in 1822. In 1841, the agent {{announced}} {{he was about to}} sign contracts with the Peruvian and Bolivian governments to purchase consignments of guano. William called it [...] "an act of insanity" [...] because of the huge loans needed to facilitate the business. Rich in nitrogen and <b>phosphate,</b> <b>guano</b> soon became accepted in England and Europe for the same purpose, with 211,000 tons imported via the ports of Bristol and London in 1856. The firm's profits from this trade were such that William became the richest non-noble man in England, remembered in the Victorian music hall ditty:Within a few years however, cheaper products such as nitrate of soda and super phosphate fertilisers were available. Hence by 1880 the company had moved its South American base to Chile, where it manufactured nitrate of soda and its by-product iodine, both of which were in high demand for use in the burgeoning European and North American munitions trade.|$|E
50|$|In {{more modern}} times the islands were mined for <b>phosphates</b> derived from <b>guano.</b> Mining ceased in the mid-20th century.|$|R
5000|$|Nauru's only {{economically}} significant {{natural resources}} are <b>phosphates,</b> formed from <b>guano</b> deposits by seabirds over {{many thousands of}} years, and fisheries, particularly for tuna.|$|R
5000|$|By some definitions, {{minerals}} are distinctly {{separate from}} organic materials. However, certain organic fertilizers and amendments are mined, specifically guano and peat, and other mined minerals are fossil products of animal activity, such as greensand (anaerobic marine deposits), some limestones (fossil shell deposits) and some rock <b>phosphates,</b> (fossil <b>guano).</b> Peat, {{a precursor to}} coal, offers no nutritional value to the plants, but improves the soil by aeration and absorbing water; it is sometimes credited as being {{the most widely used}} organic fertilizer and by volume is the top organic amendment.|$|R
5000|$|The Barrier Reef <b>Phosphate</b> (<b>Guano)</b> Syndicate {{interests}} on the north-east {{coast of}} Queensland {{have been taken}} over by Phosphates Pty, Ltd, a private company formed with a capital of £10,000 to work guano deposits and exploit other products The Bunker Group includes Lady Musgrave, Fairfax, and Hoskyn Islands, as they run m that order north of Lady Elliott Island The new company has secured leases of Fairfax and Hoskin, and the right to remove guano there fromFrom the report of the company's surveyor it appears that there are 20000 tons of guano available for immediate exploitation, and samples analysed by Mr John D. Spence, PCS, are said to show the component parts of nitrogen and phosphoric acid to make it of commercial value as a phosphate fertiliser which {{could be used as a}} base in the manufacture of complete compound fertilisers.In addition to the guano commercial use of the coral obtainable from the islands may be mace by conversion into lime, a branch of industry now followed farther north, whence lime for the sugar industry is drawn in large quantities. The company proposes, with a formula which has been proved satisfactory, to prepare turtle soup, turtle extract and calipee and calapash for [...]he overseas market. Fish and other Great Barrier products will also be dealt in by the company.|$|E
50|$|Malva arborea tolerates {{sea water}} to varying degrees, {{at up to}} 100% sea water in its natural habitat, excreting salt through glands on its leaves. This salt {{tolerance}} can be a competitive advantage over inland plant species in coastal areas. Its level of salinity tolerance {{is thought to be}} improved by soil with higher <b>phosphate</b> content, making <b>guano</b> enrichment particularly beneficial.|$|R
50|$|Whitlockite is a mineral, {{an unusual}} form of calcium phosphate. Its formula is Ca9(MgFe)(PO4)6PO3OH. It is a {{relatively}} rare mineral but is found in granitic pegmatites, <b>phosphate</b> rock deposits, <b>guano</b> caves and in chondrite meteorites. It was first described in 1941 and named for Herbert Percy Whitlock (1868-1948), American mineralogist, Curator, American Museum of Natural History, New York City, NY, US.|$|R
50|$|<b>Guano</b> <b>phosphate</b> is a {{superior}} organic fertilizer {{that became a}} mainstay of American agriculture in the mid-19th century. Duncan transferred his discoverer's rights to his employer, an American guano trader in Jamaica, who sold them to the newly formed Navassa Phosphate Company of Baltimore. After an interruption for the American Civil War, the company built larger mining facilities on Navassa with barrack housing for 140 black contract laborers from Maryland, houses for white supervisors, a blacksmith shop, warehouses, and a church.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} named after Juan de Nova, a Galician admiral {{in the service of}} Portugal who came across the island in 1501. The island had never been {{inhabited}} when it became a possession of France in 1897. In 1921, France decided to transfer the administration of Juan de Nova from Paris to Tananarive in its colony of Madagascar and Dependencies. Before the independence of Madagascar, France transferred the administration to Saint-Pierre on Réunion Island. Madagascar became independent in 1960 and claims sovereignty over the island since 1972. <b>Guano</b> (<b>phosphate)</b> deposits were exploited {{from the start of the}} 20th century until 1970. The island was abandoned during World War II and was visited by German submariners. Installations, including a hangar, rail lines, houses and a jetty are in ruins.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th-century Ichaboe and other {{islands of the}} south African coast {{witnessed}} the guano equivalent of the American gold rush. The island was once used for sealing and following a visit in 1828 by Captain Benjamin Morrell and the discovery of bird manure to depths of more than 7 m, the focus turned to the quarrying of guano. At one time more than 400 ships anchored off the island and shanty towns, housed thousands of workers. Large-scale scraping and bagging of ′white gold′ began in 1843 and peaked two years later. The value {{was so great that}} competition was fierce, murder committed over harvesting rights and two British warships were despatched to restore order over {{what became known as the}} ′Great Guano War′. Britain took procession of the island on 21 June 1861. Guano has been taken off the island regularly and, for example, in 1880 and 1881 Ichaboe Guano was claimed to be the ″richest and most fertilising guano imported into England″ and contained 12 to 13 % ammonia and 27 to 30 % <b>guano</b> <b>phosphates.</b> The island was administered by the Cape Provincial Administration of South Africa and became a nature reserves in 1987. The islands were returned to Namibia in 1994 and the islands are managed by the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resouces (MFMR). Ichaboe, alongwith Mercury and Possession Islands, have permanent residents who partake in research and conservation of the seabirds. Scraping of guano continues with concessions granted during the 1980s and in 2000 a wall was put up around the perimeter of the island. The wall was built to prevent winds blowing the guano into the sea and has a few entry points for penguins’ to access the breeding areas.|$|R
