40|$|The {{dependence}} of hardness, adhesiveness and cohesiveness of processed cheese spreads on {{the composition of}} binary mixtures of disodium hydrogen phosphate, tetrasodium diphosphate, <b>pentasodium</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> and/or sodium salt of polyphosphate was studied. Suitable statistical models to describe the {{dependence of}} the texture parameters examined on the composition of binary mixtures were investigated. Each of the 6 types of binary mixtures was applied in 11 percentage ratios of each component. In binary mixtures of polyphosphate combined with monophosphate, diphosphate or triphosphate, hardness gradually rose with the increasing proportion of polyphosphates within the mixture. In binary mixtures of monophosphate combined with diphosphate or triphosphate, a rapid growth in hardness of the samples was observed when the proportion of diphosphate or triphosphate in the mixture increased (up to 50 - 60 %). A further increase in diphosphate or triphosphate content (above 60 %) resulted in a rapid decrease in hardness of the processed cheeses. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Normal 0 false false false CS JA X-NONE The aim of {{this work}} was to observe the effects of {{emulsifying}} salts composed of trisodium citrate and sodium phosphates with different chain length (disodium phosphate (DSP), tetrasodium diphosphate (TSPP), <b>pentasodium</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (PSTP) and sodium salts of polyphosphates with 5 different mean length (n ≈ 5, 9, 13, 20, 28)) on hardness of processed cheese spreads. Hardness of processed cheese spreads with selected binary mixtures of the above mentioned salts were also studied. Measurements were performed after 2, 9 and 30 days of storage at 6 °C. Hardness of processed cheese increased with increase in chain length of individually used phosphates.   Majority of applied binary mixtures of emulsifying salts had not significant influence on hardness charges in processed cheese spreads. On the other hand, a combination of phosphates salts (DSP with TSPP) was found, which had specific effect on hardness of processed cheese spreads. Textural properties of samples with trisodium citrate were similar compared to samples with DSP. </div...|$|E
40|$|Background: Exopolyphosphatases and pyrophosphatases play {{important}} but still incompletely understood roles in energy metabolism, {{and also in}} other aspects of cell biology such as osmoregulation or signal transduction. Earlier work has suggested that a human exopolyphosphatase, Prune, might exhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity. Results: The kinetoplastida, a large order of unicellular eukaryotes that contains many important pathogens such as Trypanosoma brucei (human sleeping sickness), Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) or Leishmania ssp (several clinically dinstinct leishmaniases) all contain several exo- and pyrophosphatases. The current study provides a systematic classification of these enzymes, which now allows to situate the information that is already available {{on some of these}} enzymes. It then analyses the exopolyphosphatase TbrPPX 1 of T. brucei in detail, using RNA interference and genetic knockouts in an attempt to define its function, and immunofluorescence microscopy to study its subcellular localization. TbrPPX 1 is an exopolyphosphatase that does hydrolyze <b>pentasodium</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> but not organic triphosphates such as ATP, pyrophosphate or long-chain polyphosphates.

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{dependence}} of the hardness of processed cheese spreads on the composition of binary mixtures of phosphate emulsifying salts consisting of disodium hydrogenphosphate, tetrasodium diphosphate, <b>pentasodium</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> and/or sodium salt of polyphosphate and {{on the number of}} days of storage. The main goal was to find suitable statistical models in order to describe the dependence of the hardness examined on the composition of binary mixtures. Polynomial regression proved to be suitable for the global behaviour of the statistical relationship observed. Detailed observation of local changes was made by means of a fuzzy inference system. In binary mixtures of polyphosphate combined with monophosphate, diphosphate or triphosphate, hardness was gradually increasing with rising amount of polyphosphate in the mixture. In binary mixtures of monophosphate combined with diphosphate or triphosphate, a rapid increase in the hardness of the samples was determined when the proportion of diphosphate or triphosphate in the mixture was rising up to 50 - 60 %. A further increase in diphosphate or triphosphate content in the binary mixture (above 60 %) resulted in a similarly rapid decrease in the hardness of the processed cheeses...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{dependence}} of hardness of processed cheese spreads on the composition of binary mixtures containing disodium hydrogenphosphate, tetrasodium diphosphate, <b>pentasodium</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> and/or sodium salt of polyphosphate using advanced statistical models. Eleven percentage ratios were applied {{in each of the}} 6 types of binary mixtures. The study was focused on finding of suitable models in order to describe the dependence of hardness on the composition of binary mixtures. These models use fuzzy sets - especially as Fuzzy Inference System. Fuzzy inference system is able to identify possible nonlinear dependence between input variables and output variables in process. It can also work with data described in vague terms. In mixtures of polyphosphate with the other phosphates studied, hardness was increasing with the rising amount of polyphosphates within the mixture. In binary mixtures of monophosphate with diphosphate or triphosphate, a rapid grow in sample rigidity was determined when the amount of diphosphate or triphosphate in the mixture was rising (up to 40 - 60 %). A further increase in diphosphate or triphosphate concentration (above 50 - 60 %) resulted in a drop in rigidity of processed cheeses. Hardness of samples was increased during 30 -day storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the dependence of textural properties (hardness, cohesiveness, and relative adhesiveness) of processed cheese spreads on the proportion of disodium phosphate (DSP), tetrasodium diphosphate (TSPP), and sodium salts of polyphosphate in ternary mixtures of emulsifying salts. Sodium salts of polyphosphate with different mean lengths (n ≈ 5, 9, 13, 20, and 28) were used. <b>Pentasodium</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (PSTP) was used instead of TSPP in the second part of the study. Products with and without pH adjustment were tested (the target pH value was 5. 60 - 5. 80). Textural properties of the processed cheese were observed after 2, 9, and 30 d of storage at 6 °C. Hardness of the processed cheese with a low content of polyphosphate increased at a specific DSP:TSPP ratio (~ 1 : 1 to 3 : 4). This trend was the same for all the polyphosphates used; only the absolute values of texture parameters were different. The same trends were observed in the ternary mixtures with PSTP, showing lower final values of hardness compared with samples containing TSPP. Hardness and cohesiveness decreased and relative adhesiveness increased in the samples with increased pH values and vice versa; the main trend remained unchanged. © 2014 American Dairy Science Association...|$|E

Conclusions All kinetoplastid genomes that are currently available contain genes for an exopolyphosphatase and two classes of pyrophosphatases, one associated with the acidocalcisomes and one cytoplasmic. TbrPPX 1 represents the T. brucei exopolyphosphatase. It is located throughout the cytoplasm, and its genetic ablation does not produce a dramatic phenotype. Importantly, TbrPPX 1 does not exhibit any cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterase activity, which definitively eliminates it as an additional player in cAMP signalling of the kinetoplastida. </p...|$|E
