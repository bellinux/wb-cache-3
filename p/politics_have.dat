Ashland has a mayor-council government assisted by citizen committees. Historically, its liberal <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> differed, often sharply, {{with much of the}} rest of southwest Oregon.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{there is}} a {{long-established}} and widespread belief in astrology. It is commonly used for daily life, particularly in matters concerning marriage and career, and makes extensive use of electional, horary and karmic astrology. Indian <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> also been influenced by astrology. It is still considered {{a branch of the}} Vedanga. In 2001, Indian scientists and politicians debated and critiqued a proposal to use state money to fund research into astrology, resulting in permission for Indian universities to offer courses in Vedic astrology.|$|E

His controversial writings on music, drama and <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> attracted extensive comment, notably, {{since the late}} 20th century, where they express antisemitic sentiments. The effect of his ideas can be traced {{in many of the}} arts throughout the 20th century; his influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, the visual arts and theatre.|$|E

5|$|Music and <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> been {{intertwined}} {{for centuries}} in Italy. Just as many {{works of art}} in the Italian Renaissance were commissioned by royalty and the Roman Catholic Church, much music was likewise composed on the basis of such commissions—incidental court music, music for coronations, for the birth of a royal heir, royal marches, and other occasions. Composers who strayed ran certain risks. Among the best known of such cases was the Neapolitan composer Domenico Cimarosa, who composed the Republican hymn for the short-lived Neapolitan Republic of 1799. When the republic fell, he was tried for treason along with other revolutionaries. Cimarosa was not executed by the restored monarchy, but he was exiled.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E
5|$|Progressive <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> been {{particularly}} strong in municipal government since the 1960s. Voters approved charter amendments that have lessened the penalties {{for possession of}} marijuana (1974), and that aim to protect access to abortion in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, Kathy Kozachenko's victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly homosexual candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local Human Rights Party, which feared a splintering of the liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of May 2016, Democrats hold the mayorship and nine out of the ten council seats. Nationally, Ann Arbor is located in Michigan's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Debbie Dingell.|$|E

30|$|The split of {{domestic}} politics {{emerged in the}} both countries before the 1965 coup and the reformasi occurred. In the 1965 coup, Indonesian domestic <b>politics</b> <b>had</b> splits into two groups namely anti-Sukarno (TNI-AD and Islamic groups) versus pro-Sukarno (PKI and sympathisers). While in Malaysia domestic <b>politics</b> <b>had</b> splits into two political factions namely the anti-Malaysia (PAS and PKM) versus the government (UMNO and the British). In reformasi, Indonesian domestic <b>politics</b> <b>had</b> separate into two elements namely pro-new order (GOLKAR and TNI) challenged by anti-Suharto groups encompassing university students, scholars and the citizens. At the same time, the Malaysian domestic <b>politics</b> <b>had</b> split into two political groups, namely pro-government encompassing UMNO and the National Front (Barisan Nasional, BN) challenged by anti-Mahathir groups such as Anwar Ibrahim, PAS, and Democratic Action Party (DAP) under the Alternative Front (Pakatan Rakyat, PR).|$|R

25|$|Until fairly recently, Indianapolis was {{considered}} one of the most conservative major cities in the U.S. Republicans held the mayor's office for 32 years (1967–1999), and controlled the City-County Council from its inception in 1970 to 2003. Since the early-2000s, the city's <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> gradually shifted more liberal. , the city is regarded as politically moderate.|$|E
25|$|Kansas <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> been roiled {{in recent}} years.

25|$|Other writers, however, {{have argued}} that, though Taine {{displayed}} increasing conservatism throughout his career, he also formulated {{an alternative to}} rationalist liberalism that was influential for the social policies of the Third Republic.

25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, Coloured {{identity}} <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> grown in influence.

The Western Cape is considered as an area in which this party might gain ground against the dominant African National Congress. The Democratic Alliance drew in some former New National Party voters and won considerable Coloured support. The New National Party collapsed in the 2004 elections. Coloured support aided the Democratic Alliance's victory in the 2006 Cape Town municipal elections.|$|E
25|$|While {{serving in}} the House of Representatives, Schumer, along with California senator Dianne Feinstein, {{authored}} the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban which expired in 2004. The National Rifle Association and other gun groups (see gun <b>politics)</b> <b>have</b> criticized him for allegedly not knowing much about guns, alluding to various errors regarding the subject. Supporters of gun control legislation, however, give him {{much of the credit}} for passage of both the Assault Weapons Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The Assault Weapons Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, some {{politicians}} and political commentators representing {{the right wing}} of Israeli <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> advocated annexing the West Bank and granting its Palestinian population Israeli citizenship while maintaining Israel's current status as a Jewish state with recognized minorities. In 2013, Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely argued that Jordan was originally created as the Arab state in the British Mandate of Palestine and that Israel should annex the West Bank as a historic part of the Land of Israel. Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home party, included in many Likud-led coalitions, argues for the annexation of Zone C of the West Bank. Zone C, agreed upon as part of the Oslo Accords, comprises about 60% of West Bank land and is currently under Israeli military control.|$|E
25|$|Haitian <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> been contentious: since independence, Haiti has {{suffered}} 32 coups. Haiti {{is the only}} country in the Western Hemisphere to undergo a successful slave revolution, but a long history of oppression by dictators—including François Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude Duvalier—has markedly affected the nation. France, the United States and other Western countries have repeatedly intervened in Haitian politics since the country's founding, sometimes at the request of one party or another. Along with international financial institutions, they have imposed large quantities of debt. Haiti has so much foreign debt that payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending. There have been criticisms of financial institutions for enforcing trade policies on Haiti, which are considered by some to be detrimental to local industry.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the theory}} would involve radical {{developments}} in {{politics at the}} center, {{as well as social}} innovation in localities. At the center, by bestowing wide ranging revising powers to those in office, it would give political parties the ability to try out concrete yet profound solutions and proposals. It would turn partisan conflicts over control and uses of governmental power into an opportunity to question and revise the basic arrangements of social life through a rapid resolution of political impasse. In local communities, empowered democracy would make capital and technology available through rotating capital funds, which would encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. Citizens' rights include individual entitlements to economic and civic security, conditional and temporary group claims to portions of social capital, and destabilization rights, which would empower individuals or groups to disrupt organizations and practices marred by routines of subjugation that normal <b>politics</b> <b>have</b> failed to disrupt.|$|E
