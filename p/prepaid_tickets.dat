50|$|The Kolumbus Card is an {{electronic}} ticketing system launched in 2006. It allows all travels with bus, ferry and the Jæren Commuter Rail {{to be paid}} with the cards. Depending on the travel card a user purchases, the card is either personal or impersonal. If used as a prepaid card, it is impersonal and allows the user to charge the card like a prepaid card for a mobile telephone, giving the use a credit that can use to pay for travel. <b>Prepaid</b> <b>ticket</b> rates are cheaper than the cash fare. The card can also be charged with a monthly ticket. Depending on the monthly ticket, the card can be both personal or impersonal: The Flexipass which allows unlimited monthly travel by bus within one of four zones is impersonal. As long as the account is valid, the Kolumbus card {{can be used by}} anybody. The Periodic pass allows unlimited travel along a given route, with the options of used train, bus, and ferry. The Periodic pass is personal and can only be used by the person who owns the card. The Kolumbus Card uses non-contact smartcard technology so the card can stay in the wallet while it is swept by the reader.|$|R

5000|$|The theatre {{suffered}} from a serious fire in 2005 and slipped into debt. [...] The financial distress of the theatre was also attributed to a poor management decision, which canceled the extremely popular annual production of A Christmas Carol in favor of High School Musical 2. With debts totaling more than $10 million in 2009, NSMT officials announced that the financially distressed theatre had failed to raise $2 million in philanthropic commitments to fund a new business model and launch a 2009 season. Although more than $500,000 in pledges had been made since the theatre announced a turn-around strategy in mid April, not enough money was raised to save the season. [...] The planned productions were cancelled, and more than 4,000 people who had <b>prepaid</b> for <b>tickets</b> for the 2009 season were never refunded.|$|R
50|$|The Hōzanji Line is {{the only}} {{double-track}} funicular in the country.

Hōzanji Line 2 is operated in holiday seasons, and for safety inspections of the Line 1. Since the Hōzanji Line runs along a fairly urbanized area, it also functions as a commuter line. However, the line does not accept PiTaPa, a smart card ticketing system, neither Surutto Kansai, a <b>prepaid</b> magnetic card <b>ticketing</b> system.|$|R

5000|$|Class {{inequality}} in the hierarchic Swedish society {{was a strong}} theme in {{the findings of the}} Commission. It appeared as a major motivating force in the summarized case histories of outbound Swedish emigrants, interviewed in Hull and Liverpool, which were published in Volume VII. The motif was also typical of the personal documents - of greater human and research interest today - which were included in the same volume. Those were narratives submitted by anonymous Swedes in Canada and the US in response to solicitations by the Commission in Swedish-American newspapers. 289 of them were also published in Volume VII, with the individuals identified by initials, state of residence, and year of emigration. Barton warns that, statistically, the response to the Commission's newspaper appeal will be slanted towards individuals with particularly strong views; yet their experiences remain illuminating. The great majority were enthusiastic over their new homeland, and critical of conditions in Sweden. They describe particularly the grim poverty in the Swedish countryside, the hard work, pitiful wages, and discouraging prospects. One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her Värmland home parish, she had had to go out and earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight, starting work {{at four in the morning}} and living on [...] "rotten herring and potatoes, served out in small amounts so that I would not eat myself sick." [...] She could see [...] "no hope of saving anything in case of illness, but rather I could see the poorhouse waiting for me in the distance." [...] When she was seventeen, her emigrated brothers sent her a <b>prepaid</b> <b>ticket</b> to America, and [...] "the hour of freedom struck." [...] The emigrants also strongly emphasized non-material considerations, such as the exclusion of the poor from the political process, through the restrictive Swedish franchise before 1907. Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40 - 50 years in America. A man who'd emigrated in 1868 described the disparaging comments he had heard in his youth from the aristocrat in charge of the parish poor relief, which [...] "gave rise to great bitterness and a large number, among them myself, emigrated to America, which I have never regretted. Here, you are treated like a human being, wherever you are." ...|$|R
25|$|Silverlink: In {{the autumn}} of 2007, Shere Fasticket {{machines}} were installed at stations on the Barking & Gospel Oak line.

The machines are able to take cash, but are (at the time of writing) payment card only, pending cash collection (i.e. emptying) arrangements being put in place. Oystercard validators have been installed at B (including on platforms) ready for 11 November, and the ticket machines have a circular blanking plate, perhaps for an Oyster reader/writer.|$|R
25|$|By September 2009, {{speculation}} {{had begun}} to build about MLB forcing the Rangers to shut down front rotation man Kevin Millwood before he surpassed his inning threshold that would vest his 2010 option for $12 million. Hicks did admit that the Rangers had received some advances from MLB, but that the money borrowed would be repaid out of future earnings due the team {{at the end of}} the year. In October 2009, MLB executive vice president Rob Manfred sent a letter to then potential buyers Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan informing them the Rangers had been in violation of the collective-bargaining agreement and owed around $40 million. Another major problem for the Rangers following the 2009 season was the refund for <b>prepaid</b> post season <b>tickets.</b> Some fans did not receive refunds from the Rangers until late December, even after the team failed to make the post season.|$|R
