Tanks filled with clay were mixed with various amounts of <b>powdered</b> <b>dye</b> as a tracer. The objective of the entire project {{was to determine the}} best mixing protocol (nozzle velocity, number of spargers used, total air flow, etc.) by determining the percent mixed volume through the use of an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrometer. The dye concentration within the sample could be correlated to the volume fraction mixed in the tank. Samples were received in vials, a series of dilutions were generated from the clay, allowed to equilibrate, then centrifuged and siphoned for the supernate liquid to analyze by absorption spectroscopy. Equilibration of the samples and thorough mixing of the samples were a continuous issue with dilution curves being difficult to obtain. Despite these technical issues, useful data was obtained for evaluation of various mix conditions...|$|E
30|$|Evans blue {{is a type}} of {{dark blue}} <b>powdered</b> <b>dye</b> that is unable to {{penetrate}} the BBB in normal conditions. The Evans blue assay is a popular method for quantifying BBB disruption. A small amount of Evans blue was observed in normal animal brains after intravenous injection (Wu et al. 2011). In the present studies, perihematomal Evans blue content was significantly increased in the ICH groups at different time points compared with the control group, demonstrating that the BBB was disrupted after the intracerebral infusion of blood. BBB disruption was followed by brain edema formation. Perihematomal BWC began to increase in the 6 -h group and peaked 48  hours after ICH was induced. The change of BWC was consistent with enhanced BBB permeability. The range of edematous brain area was observed on histological sections. An area extending at least 5  mm from the hematoma became edematous, but because we only collected a total of 5  mm of brain tissue around the area to measure BWC, we were unable to precisely quantify the range of brain edema. This is a limitation of the present study.|$|E

40|$|DHHS publication; no. (NIOSH) 97 - 107 The {{hazards of}} <b>powder</b> <b>dye</b> {{handling}} operations and their control were {{discussed in this}} leaflet. During the manual transfer of <b>powder</b> <b>dyes</b> from bulk containers to smaller process containers, significant amounts of dust can be generated. Worker exposure to dye dust through breathing or skin contact can result in asthma, eczema, and severe allergic reactions. Certain dyes may also be carcinogens. Semidowndraft ventilation booths were recommended for use during the manual transfer of dyes. A vertical air shower pushes airborne dust out of the breathing zone of the worker until the dust is captured and exhausted. The use of shorter drums for shipping <b>dye</b> <b>powders</b> should {{eliminate the need for}} workers to place their heads inside the drum for manually transferring the powder. By providing a space between the worker's face and the top of the drum, booth ventilation should be able to capture the dust before it reaches the breathing zone of the worker. The suggestion was to limit drum height to 25 inches. When moving <b>dye</b> <b>powder,</b> slow, smooth movements are best. Dye transport distances between the bulk and the process containers should be minimized.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to find the suitable dyeing method for dyeing cotton fabric into indigo blue color using the raw indigo <b>powder</b> <b>dyes</b> sold in the Korean market. The research focused primarily on the comparison of the non-reduced dyeing method and the reduced dyeing method. The dyeing effects using different dyeing temperatures (2 ～ 80 ℃) and different concentrations of reducing agent and alkali were also investigated. It was found that the reduced dyeing method must be used for dyeing cotton into indigo blue color using the commercial raw indigo <b>powder</b> <b>dyes.</b> The best result was obtained by 20 ℃ dyeing with the 40 ℃ dyeing giving a comparable result. The intensity of the blue color could be enhanced by increasing the alkali concentration. The non-reduced dyeing could not dye cotton fabric into indigo blue color at any given dyeing temperatures (2 ～ 80 ℃). The reduce-dyed cotton fabrics showed a gradual color change upon repeated washing and extended sunlight exposure, the most color change occurring after the first two washing cycles and the first 5 hours of sunlight exposure. The standard tests of colorfastness showed that the reduce-dyed cotton fabrics had good to excellent colorfastness whereas the colorfastness of the non-reduce-dyed cotton fabrics were mostly poor...|$|R

The aim was to evaluate the influence of increasing levels of annatto byproduct on the components of sheep body weight. Thirty-two male sheep, not castrated, with initial weight of 23. 17 ± 1. 45 kg, without a defined breed, were used in randomized blocks in all four treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 g kg? 1 of annatto byproduct in the diet dry matter). The increase to 300 g kg? 1 of annatto byproduct had a negative linear effect (P < 0. 05) for hot carcass weight (kg) and cold carcass weight (kg). Increasing levels of annatto byproduct resulted in a linear reduction (P < 0. 05) for palette weight (kg), leg weight (kg), carcass compactness index (kg cm? 1), liver weight (kg) and skin weight (kg).

In this study, two methods of colour marking mosquitoes were described in detail {{and the impact of}} both methods on the survival and host-seeking behaviour of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto was investigated. Methods: Mosquitoes were marked in groups with fluorescent <b>powder</b> or fluorescent <b>dye.</b> The <b>powder</b> was applied by creating a cloud of powder in a paper cup and the dye was applied with an airbrush. The effect of marking on the survival of mosquitoes of different age groups was tested under controlled conditions.

Results: No effect of either of the marking methods was found on the survival of mosquitoes that were treated 1 or 3 days after emergence, however, the survival of mosquitoes treated 5 or 9 days after emergence was significantly reduced. The host-seeking response of mosquitoes to human or cow odour was tested in a dual-port olfactometer and was not found to be affected by treatment with fluorescent <b>powder</b> or <b>dye.</b> Conclusions: Both methods are suitable for colour marking large groups of mosquitoes.
