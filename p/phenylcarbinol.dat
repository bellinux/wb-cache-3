40|$|Conventional {{preparations}} of diazepam for i. v. use contain solvents {{which cause}} pain on injection and thrombophlebitis {{in a high}} percentage of cases. However, diazepam can be dissolved with advantage in the oleaginous phase of an oil-in-water emulsion (Diazemuls). Diazemuls has been given to 9492 patients without serious side-effects. Following i. v. injection, 2435 patients were studied with respect to pain and clinical effect. Only 0. 4 % experienced pain. The intended Hinimi effect was recorded in 99 % of the patients. I. m. injection of Diazemuls resulted in a significantly smaller frequency of pain in connection with the injection rhan did the injection of Valium (7 % and 43 % respectively). Pharmacokinetic studies have been made after i. v. and i. m. injection of Diazemuls and Valium. The distribution and elimination phases after i. v. injection were the same with both forms. Thus the drug probably quickly separates from the oil particles of the emulsion after injection. After i. m. administration, the plasma concentration shows a wide spread with both preparations. A brief survey of other substances tested in emulsion form is presented. Many drugs used in anaesthesia dissolve poorly in water but are fat-soluble. In order to manufacture forms suitable for parenteral administration solvent must be added. In many instances the solvents are toxic and can produce local side-effects such as pain on injection and thrombophlebitis. They can also produce anaphylactoid reactions. One of the drugs in this group is diazepam. Conventional dosage forms of diazepam contain solvents such as propylene glycol, <b>phenylcarbinol</b> and ethanol. These substances are tissue irritants and are associated with a high frequency of pain and thrombophlebitis upon i. v. injection (Langdon...|$|E
