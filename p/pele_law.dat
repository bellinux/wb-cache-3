O nosso objeto de investigação {{consiste}} nos impactos provocados pelo fim do passe no futebol brasileiro no período de 2001 a 2006, buscando apreender as características do processo civilizatório na sociedade brasileira mediante a análise da nova regulamentação das relações entre clubes e jogadores. Tem como recorte empírico 12 clubes de futebol das séries A, B e C do campeonato brasileiro. Analisa-se o novo sistema de transferências de jogadores de futebol que surgiu com a Lei Pelé (nº 9. 615 / 98), os processos de modernização, flexibilização das relações de trabalho e contratuais e a construção de um habitus profissional no futebol brasileiro. O fim do passe é resultado de um conjunto de mudanças na legislação e na estrutura administrativa do futebol, que teve início com a criação do Clube dos Treze, em 1987, consolidando-se com a promulgação da Lei Pelé, e mais especificamente com o artigo que estabelece liberdade de trabalho ao jogador de futebol. Pode-se concluir, então, que mesmo tendo em vista que a Lei Pelé altera o sistema de relações de trabalho dos atletas profissionais, caminha-se para uma regulamentação de característica híbrida, mantendo institutos do antigo passe. Portanto, a modernização conservadora do futebol brasileiro se caracteriza pelo fato de que a extinção do passe pela Lei Pelé (nº 9. 615 / 98) não garantiu a plena liberdade de trabalho para os jogadores devido aos Decretos e Medidas Provisórias que buscam preservar os interesses dos dirigentes e empresários através do sistema de multas rescisórias e indenizações por formação e por promoção do atleta, pois não foi suficiente para abolir os mecanismos de negociação e venda de jogadores e as correspondentes taxas de intermediação.

Analisa a influência do fim do passe nas transferências (internas e externas) de jogadores de futebol no Brasil. Trata-se de uma investigação empírica, o fim do passe e a exportação de jogadores brasileiros. Utilizamos técnicas de pesquisa quantitativas e qualitativas (questionários e entrevistas). Aplicamos 97 questionários com atletas de 12 clubes do campeonato brasileiro de futebol das Séries A, B e C. A pesquisa indica que o fim do passe criou novas condições para as transferências internas e externas de jogadores brasileiros. Houve crescimento significativo das transferências internacionais de jogadores depois do fim do passe, acentuando a exportação de atletas brasileiros. Além da globalização, as razões desse crescimento devem-se ao fato de que a Lei Pelé facilitou as transferências ao decretar o fim do passe, estabelecer a liberdade de trabalho e flexibilizar os contratos.

40|$|Este trabalho aborda primeiramente as diversas leis que regulam o desporto no Brasil. Dentre essas leis, fala-se especificamente das que contemplam em seu texto a relação trabalhista desportiva, com preponderância para a lei n° 9. 615 / 98, que é a Lei Pelé. Aborda ainda os principais aspectos do contrato de trabalho do jogador profissional de futebol, como os atores da relação laboral, os direitos devidos ao atleta, assim como remuneração, adicionais, a famosa cláusula penal, e os motivos que ensejam a rescisão indireta do contrato, com especial atenção para a exploração da imagem do atleta profissional que tem sido foco de diversas discussões na doutrina e na jurisprudência. Comenta-se ainda sobre uma nova possibilidade, dentre as diversas possíveis, para a rescisão indireta do contrato, que se convencionou chamar neste trabalho de direito a exposição do trabalho do jogador profissional. Deixa-se como sugestão, ao final, que o poder legislativo edite nova legislação acerca da relação de emprego entre clube e atleta, o que valorizará a profissão de jogador de futebol e trará a diminuição das demandas judiciais.
