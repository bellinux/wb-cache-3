5|$|Though many people, {{fans and}} critics alike, have debated {{each of these}} theories, the ending was <b>purposely</b> left {{uncertain}} to allow each individual reader to decide what happened.|$|E
5|$|The Deseret {{alphabet}} was <b>purposely</b> {{designed so}} as to not have ascenders and descenders. This was envisioned as a practical benefit for the alphabet {{in an era of}} metal type: after many uses, the edges of type sorts become dull, and narrow ascenders and descenders are most prone to this effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was deliberately mined after the Arabs had captured the area. Together with that major synagogue, another 57 Jewish sanctuaries were <b>purposely</b> and systematically {{destroyed by the}} Jordanians soon after their occupation of the Old City in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Fight Club {{was filmed}} mostly {{at night and}} Fincher <b>purposely</b> filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew {{equipped}} the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes {{in the basement and}} instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.|$|E
5|$|Future space {{missions}} carrying dogs {{would be}} designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was <b>purposely</b> destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.|$|E
5|$|Hall <b>purposely</b> distanced {{the camera}} from Hanks' character, Michael Sullivan Sr., at the {{beginning}} of the film to establish the perspective of Sullivan's son, who is unaware of his father's true nature. Hanks' character was filmed as partially obscured and seen through doorways, and his entrances and exits took place in shadows. A wide lens was used to maintain a distance from the character.|$|E
5|$|In Czechoslovakia, {{especially}} in the week immediately following the invasion, popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance. On 16 January 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest against the renewed suppression of free speech. Civilians <b>purposely</b> gave wrong directions to invading soldiers, while others identified and followed cars belonging to the secret police.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) is {{determined}} {{to carry out his}} revenge on London's FSB head of operations Arkady Kachimov (Stuart Wilson), who in the previous episode <b>purposely</b> withheld intelligence that caused the death of Adam Carter. However, the MI5 team discover he is overseeing a cyber attack in progress, and returned officer Lucas North (Richard Armitage) may be involved. In the end, MI5 stop the attack, and Harry kills Kachimov.|$|E
5|$|The 10 man command group {{proceeded}} to drive vehicles to LZ Hotel, <b>purposely</b> disabling them to block vehicle access from {{any part of}} the city, other than the road from the Embassy to the LZ. The command group then {{proceeded to}} make contact with King Bird, an orbiting HC-130 plane of the 56th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, that would control the flow of the helicopters.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins, with Ken Keeler {{coming up with the}} story and the general idea of {{intentionally}} bad writing. It was directed by Neil Affleck, and Tim Conway, Gailard Sartain and Phil Hartman guest-starred. The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as they feared that the <b>purposely</b> bad writing would be mistaken for actual bad writing. The episode, however, now appears on several lists of the most popular Simpsons episodes.|$|E
5|$|The way {{in which}} the Vaikom Satyagraha events have been {{recorded}} provides a clue to the image of the respective organisers. In an article entitle Gandhi and Ambedkar, A Study in Leadership, Eleanor Zelliot relates the 'Vaikom Satyagraha', including Gandhi's negotiations with the temple authorities in relation to the event. Furthermore, the editor of E.V. Ramasamy's Thoughts states that Brahmins <b>purposely</b> suppressed news about E.V. Ramasamy's participation. A leading Congress magazine, Young India, in its extensive reports on Vaikom never mentions E.V. Ramasamy.|$|E
5|$|Users can rotate their device {{horizontally}} to landscape mode {{to access}} Cover Flow, likewise this feature may be disabled if <b>purposely</b> wishing {{to view a}} screen from another angle. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls {{can be used to}} pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.|$|E
5|$|While Smith {{tends to}} write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a {{collaborative}} effort. The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or acoustic guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'. Smith {{has said that he}} <b>purposely</b> makes the lyrics ambiguous so people can draw their own conclusions.|$|E
5|$|A trio {{of small}} Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon a common {{platform}} {{at the east}} end of the terrace, facing west. It is likely that the platform was <b>purposely</b> built to support the three temples that were built more-or-less simultaneously. Neither the platform nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that an early version of the central temple (Temple 30) was built first, then decommissioned with the platform being built to cover the early version, followed by {{the construction of a new}} version plus the two additional flanking temples.|$|E
5|$|After {{a company}} night {{out to the}} Springfield drag races, Smithers fails to protect Mr. Burns from being harassed by a drunken Lenny. Though he tries to make amends the next day, Smithers again bungles his duties and {{attempts}} to drown himself in the water cooler out of guilt, so Burns suggests he take a vacation. Seeking a replacement who will not outshine him, Smithers <b>purposely</b> selects Homer for the job. Burns soon proves to be ridiculously demanding {{for someone who has}} not devoted his life to him like Smithers. After putting up with Mr. Burns' constant abuse for several days, Homer finally snaps and punches Burns. Fearing he has killed the old man, Homer runs away in panic, and hides at home.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set <b>purposely</b> and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner <b>purposely</b> {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which {{ultimately}} explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the dive bombers were attacking, the 20 torpedo bombers were also {{approaching}} Hornet from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes into Hornets side between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking out her engines. As Hornet came to a stop, a damaged Japanese dive bomber approached and <b>purposely</b> crashed into the carrier's side, starting a fire near the ship's main supply of aviation fuel. At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving Hornet dead in the water and burning. Twenty-five Japanese and six American aircraft were destroyed in this attack.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Hartman was {{preparing}} to voice Zapp Brannigan, a character written specifically for him on Groening's second animated series Futurama. Even though the role was made for Hartman, he still insisted on auditioning and according to Groening, he 'nailed it'. After Hartman's death, Futuramas lead character Philip J. Fry was named in his honour, and Billy West took over the role of Brannigan. Though executive producer David X. Cohen credits West with using his own take on the character, West later said that he <b>purposely</b> tweaked Zapp's voice to better match Hartman's intended portrayal. Hartman was also planning to appear with Lovitz in the indie film The Day of Swine and Roses, scheduled to begin production in August 1998.|$|E
5|$|In 1385, Elizabeth {{received}} an official delegation from Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania, {{who wished to}} marry Hedwig. In the Act of Kreva, Jogaila promised to pay compensation to William of Austria on Elizabeth's behalf and requested that Elizabeth, as widow of King Louis and heiress of Poland herself as great-grandniece of King Władysław I (whose name Jogaila had <b>purposely</b> assumed on his baptism), legally adopt him as her son {{in order to give}} him a claim to the Polish crown in the event of Hedwig's death. The marriage was celebrated in 1386.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and <b>purposely</b> blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 American {{intelligence}} analyst Raelynn Hillhouse {{wrote that}} according to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward. According to the sources, Pakistan <b>purposely</b> stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S. raid, and the original plan was to kill – not capture – bin Laden. Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis. According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance {{on their way to}} and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid.|$|E
5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later <b>purposely</b> scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th and through the 19th century, {{criticism}} centred on debates over the moral message of the play. Actor and playwright David Garrick's 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been <b>purposely</b> included in the play to show how reckless the hero was {{and that this was}} the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths.|$|E
5|$|Mari is not {{considered}} a small settlement that later grew, but rather a new city that was <b>purposely</b> founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c. 2900 BC, to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes that connect the Levant with the Sumerian south. The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from the Euphrates river {{to protect it from}} floods, and was connected to the river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which old meander it used to be attached with, which is hard to identify today.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} Skinner and Leamus, {{telling them that}} the New Spartans are {{planning}} to rob a bank and that Haley wants copies of surveillance files on the group, {{in an attempt to}} discover the spy's identity. Leamus, expecting the request, hands over a redacted microfilm for Haley to see. Scully discovers that the biological weapon was engineered by the U.S. government, and concludes that someone <b>purposely</b> sent Mulder on a suicide mission. She realizes that the pathogen is spread through touch, and that New Spartans plan to spread it via the money in the bank. Meanwhile, Mulder joins the New Spartans as they infiltrate the bank and spray the money with the pathogen.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{traveled}} to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, John Allan married {{his second wife}} Louisa Patterson. The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe decided to leave West Point by <b>purposely</b> getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically {{pleaded not guilty to}} induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the storm's first {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings beginning on August29 for areas of Florida's east coast from Palm Beach south to Key West, while storm warnings were issued from Key West to Boca Grande on the peninsula's western coast. Electrical power was <b>purposely</b> stopped in Miami as a precautionary measure {{prior to the}} storm's landfall. Two Red Cross officials were sent to Miami to monitor the area during the storm's passage. Other relief agencies were also preparing supplies {{in the event of}} an emergency. In Pahokee and Belle Glade, an estimated 2,000people evacuated to Okeechobee, fearing a repeat of the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Prog {{is based}} on fusions of styles, {{approaches}} and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and {{only a handful of}} groups <b>purposely</b> emulated or referenced classical music.|$|E
5|$|Royal Sovereign {{was laid}} down on 15 January 1914 at the HM Dockyard, Portsmouth. The ship was {{launched}} on 29 April 1915 and commissioned in May 1916. On 30 May 1916, {{three weeks after}} her commissioning, Royal Sovereign was present in Scapa Flow when the fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to sea. Jellicoe <b>purposely</b> left Royal Sovereign behind in port due to the inexperience of her crew; causing her to miss the Battle of Jutland the following day. In the months after the engagement, Royal Sovereign was quickly made ready for service with the fleet to further increase the numerical superiority of the Grand Fleet over the German High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{elongate}} organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily {{to protect their}} bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to <b>purposely</b> roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|The {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan held hearings on January 25, 2012, to investigate why the NHTSA opened a formal investigation only {{five months after the}} first postcrash battery fire occurred in June. The subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform wanted to determine if government officials, including from NHTSA, <b>purposely</b> held back information on the Volt fire for political reasons. Both Daniel Akerson, General Motors CEO, and David L. Strickland, NHTSA administrator, denied any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} days of the Flamingo {{engagement}} went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she <b>purposely</b> thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.|$|E
5|$|Twenty minutes later, the 16 Zuikaku torpedo planes {{arrived and}} split up to attack Enterprise. One group of torpedo bombers was {{attacked}} by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft <b>purposely</b> crashed into the destroyer , setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The torpedo carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. The fires initially seemed out of control until Smiths commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship , which helped put out the fires. Smith then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the torpedo planes.|$|E
5|$|Yangwu was {{a wooden}} corvette, {{built at the}} Foochow Navy Yard and {{launched}} on April 23, 1872. She was the seventh vessel built {{as part of a}} larger shipbuilding program at the Foochow Arsenal, and cost 254,000 taels (353,000 silver dollars) for her construction. She was the largest warship built between 1868–75 out of the 19 vessels planned. The shipyard was overseen by Imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen but led by staff from Western nations, who advised the Chinese to continue building wooden-hulled ships despite them being made obsolete by the construction of ironclads by those nations. Chinese officials would later blame the French, in particular Prosper Giquel, for <b>purposely</b> providing them with out-of-date equipment and designs.|$|E
5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to {{the fact that some of}} them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, <b>purposely</b> breaking the arms of three of them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way he liked to harm people.|$|E
