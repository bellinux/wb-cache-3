25|$|In 1931, Italian {{immigrant}} John Santangelo, Sr., a bricklayer who {{had started}} a construction business in White Plains, New York, five years earlier, began what became a highly successfully business publishing song-lyric magazines out of nearby Yonkers, New York. Operating in violation of copyright laws, however, he was sentenced in 1934 to {{a year and a}} day at New Haven County Jail in New Haven, Connecticut, near Derby, Connecticut where he and his wife by then lived. In jail, he met Waterbury, Connecticut, attorney Ed Levy, with whom he began legitimate publishing in 1935, acquiring <b>permissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> lyrics in such magazines as Hit Parade and Song Hits. Santangelo and Levy opened a printing plant in Waterbury the following year, and in 1940 founded the T.W.O.

The tales have been translated, or, in the case of those from Madame d'Aulnoy's long stories, adapted, by Mrs. Hunt from the Norse, by Miss Minnie Wright from Madame d'Aulnoy, by Mrs. Lang and Miss Bruce from other French sources, by Miss May Sellar, Miss Farquharson, and Miss Blackley from the German, while the story of 'Sigurd' is condensed by the Editor from Mr. William Morris's prose version of the 'Volsunga Saga.'

Charles Marelles, for <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> his versions of the 'Pied Piper,' of 'Drakestail,' and of 'Little Golden Hood' from the French, and M.

40|$|Abstract. What {{makes one}} author a good {{communicator}} and another a poor one? What turns out one manuscript a swift editorial task, and another an editorial nightmare? Based on direct experience from the manuscripts of the lectures and papers presented during this school, advice is given {{on what to}} do and on what to avoid when writing a scienti¯c paper. Some feedback recom-mendation is also provided on how to prepare manuscripts, handle copyright and <b>permissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduce,</b> how <b>to</b> anticipate plagiarism, how to deal with editors and referees, and how to avoid common errors. A few illustrations of English grammar and style for the foreign author are given. Preamble This meeting is very special in the sense that less than a dozen scienti¯c talks were delivered by senior scientists, whereas 75 % of the papers in this book were presented by PhD students. As the sample of students was expected to show wide variance in research experience, writing skills and capabilities of commu-nication, all students were requested to submit a ¯rst version of their 4 -pag...|$|R
