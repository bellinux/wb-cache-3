50|$|The {{advantages}} {{of working with}} an SPMD <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> {{as opposed to a}} normal field test with an organism are that SPMDs are able to be deployed in extremely toxic waters that might be too toxic for an organism to live in or just not inhabited by sessile filter feeders. The design of the SPMD makes it so that it imitates the process of accumulating contaminants the way a mussel or oyster would, but without the issues of mortality or metabolizing any contaminants that may be present. They can also be deployed {{for a long period of}} time and can account for surge runoff events, chemical spills or other abnormal pollution events. The physical structure of a SPMD with its stainless steel covering protects it and allows it to be suspended on a sessile anchor in the water column. The main advantage of the SPMD over a different <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> called the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) is that SPMDs will detect contaminants that have not fully dissolved in the water.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of passive}} {{samplers}} greatly reduces {{the cost and}} the need of infrastructure on the sampling location.

Due to being small the <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> can also be hidden, and thereby {{lower the risk of}} vandalism.

Insufficient quality control is a present weakness of <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> in water.

The element or compound passes through the membrane filter and diffusive gel and is assimilated by the binding gel in a rate-controlled manner.

5000|$|The first passive {{sampling}} devices {{were developed in}} the 1970s to determine concentrations of contaminants in the air. In 1980 this technology was first adapted for the monitoring of organic contaminants in water. The initial type of <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> developed for aquatic monitoring purposes was the semipermeable membrane device (SMPD). SPMD samplers are most effective at absorbing hydrophobic pollutants with a log octanol-water partitioning coefficient (Kow) ranging from 4-8. As the global emission of bioconcentratable persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was shown to result in adverse ecological effects, industry developed {{a wide range of}} increasing water-soluble, polar hydrophilic organic compounds (HpOCs) to replace them. These compounds generally have lower bioconcentration factors. However, there is evidence that large fluxes of these HpOCs into aquatic environments may be responsible for a number of adverse effects to aquatic organisms, such as altered behavior, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and impaired reproduction. In the late 1990s research was underway to develop a new <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> in order to monitor HpOCs with a log Kow value of less than 3. [...] In 1999 the POCIS sampler was under development at the University of Missouri-Columbia. It gathered more support in the early 2000s as concern increased regarding the effects of pharmaceutical and personal care products in surface waters. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has been heavily involved in the development of passive samplers and has articles in their database regarding the development of POCIS as early as 2000. The USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC) is a self-proclaimed international leader in the field of {{passive sampling}}. There have been recent efforts by the USGS to connect people who have an interest in passive sampling. An international workshop and symposium on passive sampling was held by the USGS in 2013 to connect developers, policy makers and end users in order to discuss ways of monitoring environmental pollution.|$|E

The data collected from a <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> is important for examining the amount of chemical in the environment and can therefore be used to formulate other scientific research about the effects of those chemicals on the organisms as well as the environment. Examples of commonly measured chemicals using SPMDs include: PAHs (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), dioxins and furans as well as hydrophobic waste-water effluents like fragrances, triclosan and phthalates.|$|E
50|$|SPMDs can be {{deployed}} within {{a wide range}} of water bodies, although flowing shallow water is preferable. These devices need to be secured to nearby structures to allow the SPMD to remain in a fixed position in its environment. To aid in the stability of SPMDs, various ways can be employed including attaching the device to a buoy system, an anchor, a boat, or structures/debris in shallow water. For the best possible data to be collected using passive samplers, some degree of stability and the ability of the SPMD to be stationary are required. As long as there are openings on the canister of the device, there is no particular way that the SPMD needs to be facing while deployed. Depending on the type of analysis that will be conducted, the extract of the sampler one or more may be needed to {{be deployed}}.

Based on the measured LDPEâ water partition coefficients (Kpew) of 12 {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its seven metabolites, the detection limits with the <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> containing 10 -g LDPE ranged from 0. 04 to 56. 9 pg/L in the equilibrium sampling mode. Furthermore, {{the utility of the}} <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> in measuring dissolved HOC concentrations in open waters was examined through a comparison with solid-phase extraction combined with liquidâliquid extraction (SPE-LLE) and poly(dimethyl) siloxane (PDMS) coated fiber samplers. The total concentrations of PAHs (3. 8 â 16 ng/L) obtained by the <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> were lower than those (87. 7 â 115. 5 ng/L) obtained through SPE-LLE. This large difference was probably attributable to slower water exchange {{in and out of the}} <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> as time progressed because of blockage by algae in eutrophia reservoirs and high dissolved organic carbon contents resulting in higher-than-expected PAH concentrations by SPE-LLE. Furthermore, the concentrations and compositional profiles of DDXs (sum of p,p 0 -DDT, p,p 0 -DDD, p,p 0 -DDE, o,p 0 -DDT, o,p 0 -DDD, o,p 0 -DDE, and p,p 0 -DDMU) at site A obtained by the <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> agreed with the results obtained with the PDMS-coated fibers, suggesting that the <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> was able to reasonably quantify dissolved HOCs in seawater.

This poses several challenges for both monitoring and understanding ecological risks/impacts of these chemicals. This study aimed {{to compare the}} performance of <b>passive</b> and spot <b>sampling</b> strategies given the constraints of typical regulatory monitoring. Nine pesticides were investigated in a river currently undergoing regulatory monitoring (River Ugie, Scotland). Within this regulatory framework, spot and <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> were undertaken to understand spatiotemporal occurrence, mass loads and ecological risks. All the target pesticides were detected in water by both sampling strategies. Chlorotoluron was observed to be the dominant pesticide by both spot (maximum: 111. 8 ng/l, mean: 9. 35 ng/l) and <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> (maximum: 39. 24 ng/l, mean: 4. 76 ng/l). The annual pesticide loads were estimated to be 2735 g and 1837 g based on the spot and <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> data, respectively. The spatiotemporal trend suggested that agricultural activities were {{the primary source of}} the compounds with variability in loads explained in large by timing of pesticide applications and rainfall. The risk assessment showed chlorotoluron and chlorpyrifos posed the highest ecological risks with 23 % of the chlorotoluron spot samples and 36 % of the chlorpyrifos <b>passive</b> <b>samples</b> resulting in a Risk Quotient greater than 0. 1. This suggests that mitigation measures might need to be taken to reduce the input of pesticides into the river. The overall comparison of the two sampling strategies supported the hypothesis that <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> tends to integrate the contaminants over a period of exposure and allows quantification of contamination at low concentration. The results suggested that within a regulatory monitoring context <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> was more suitable for flux estimation and risk assessment of trace contaminants which cannot be diagnosed by spot sampling and for determining if long-term average concentrations comply with specified standards.
