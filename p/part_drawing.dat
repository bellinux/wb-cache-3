Rhodesia contributed approximately 1,000 men in all, about 20% of the white male population at the time. Rhodesia contributed part of the British garrison at the Battle of the Elands River in August 1900, during which a 500-man force made up principally of Australians and Rhodesians held off attacks from a far larger Boer army under General Koos de la Rey, and repeatedly refused offers of safe passage in return for surrender. Captain [...] "Sandy" [...] Butters, the Rhodesian commanding officer, encouraged his men with shouts towards the Boers that [...] "Rhodesians never surrender!"

This part of the country indeed is full of open plains, and somewhat sandy and barren, and feeds great flocks of good sheep; but put it all together, the county of Norfolk has the most people in the least tract of land of any county in England, except about London, and Exon, and the West Riding of Yorkshire, as above.|$|E
6000|$|Till Schiller's flight, {{in which}} what endless {{interest}} and industries Christophine had {{we have already}} seen, the young girls,—Christophine 25, Luise 16, Nanette a rosy little creature of 5,—had known no misfortune; nor, except Christophine's feelings {{on the death of}} the two little Sisters, years ago, no heavy sorrow. At Solitüde, but for the general cloud of anxiety and grief about their loved and gifted Brother and his exile, their lives were of the peaceablest description: diligence in household business, sewing, spinning, contented punctuality in all things; in leisure hours eager reading (or at times, on Christophine's <b>part,</b> <b>drawing</b> and painting, in which she attained considerable excellence), and, as choicest recreation, walks amid the flourishing Nurseries, Tree-avenues, and fine solid industries and forest achievements of Papa. Mention is made of a Cavalry Regiment stationed at Solitüde; the young officers of which, without society in that dull place, and with no employment except parade, were considerably awake to the comely Jungfers Schiller and their promenadings in those pleasant woods: one Lieutenant of them (afterwards a Colonel, 'Obrist von Miller of Stuttgart') is said to have manifested honourable aspirations and intentions towards Christophine,—which, however, and all connection with whom or his comrades, the rigorously prudent Father strictly forbade; his piously obedient Daughters, Christophine it is rather thought with some regret, immediately conforming. A Portrait of this Von Miller, painted by Christophine, still exists, it would appear, among the papers of the Schillers.[62] ...|$|E

50|$|Milton's {{argument}} did {{not just}} discuss church government but discussed {{the concept of}} government as a whole. In an argument that was based partly on the writings of Polybius and Thomas Smith's The Commonwealth of England, Milton declares the importance of republicanism:the best founded Commonwealths, and least barbarous have aym'd at a certain mixture and temperament, partaking the severall vertues of each other State, that each <b>part</b> <b>drawing</b> to it selfe may keep up a steddy and eev'n uprightnesse in common.There is no Civill Government that hath beene known, no not the Spartan, not the Roman, though both for this respect so much prais'd by the wise Polybius, more divinely and harmoniously tun'd, more equally ballanc'd as it were {{by the hand and}} scale of Justice, then is the Commonwealth of England: where under a free, and untutor'd Monarch, the noblest, worthiest, and most prudent men, with full approbation, and suffrage of the People have in their power the supreame, and finall determination of highest Affaires.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} social {{analysis}} {{that led to}} The Chalice and the Blade {{is the study of}} relational dynamics. In contrast to earlier studies of society, this method addresses the question of what kinds of social systems support our human capacities for consciousness, caring, and creativity, or alternately for insensitivity, cruelty, and destructiveness. The study of relational dynamics is an application of systems analysis: the study of how different components of living systems interact to maintain one another and the larger whole of which they are a <b>part.</b> <b>Drawing</b> from a transdisciplinary database, it applies this approach to a wide-ranging exploration of how humans think, feel, and behave individually and in groups. Its sources include cross-cultural anthropological and sociological surveys, and studies of individual societies as well as writings by historians, analyses of laws, moral codes, art, literature, scholarship from psychology, economics, education, political science, philosophy, religious studies, archeology, the study of myths and legends; and data from more recent fields such as primatology, neuroscience, chaos theory, systems self-organizing theory, non-linear dynamics, gender studies, women’s studies, and men’s studies.|$|E

Reviewing the production for UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, Anita Singh began by noting, [...] "Few people feel nostalgic about {{the works of}} JB Priestley. An Inspector Calls (BBC One), his most famous play, was first performed in 1945 but fell out of fashion decades ago and is rarely filmed, although Stephen Daldry’s striking Nineties revival at the National Theatre gave it a fillip. These days it’s most commonly encountered on the GCSE curriculum, stodgy as the pudding and custard served up in the school canteen". Singh went on to add, [...] "This was as good an adaptation as it could be", praising both the filming location (Saltaire) and the [...] "decent job" [...] done by its screenwriter, Helen Edmundson, and finding that the [...] "fine performances from Ken Stott and Miranda Richardson as the smug Birlings elevated the material".
