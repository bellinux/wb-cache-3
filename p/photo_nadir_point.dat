In order to meet GOES-R pointing stability requirements, the spacecraft flight software implements an Active Vibration Damping (AVD) rate control law which acts in parallel with the <b>nadir</b> <b>point</b> attitude control law. The AVD controller commands spacecraft reaction wheel actuators based upon Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) inputs to provide additional damping for spacecraft structural modes below 3. 0 Hz which vary with solar wing angle. A GOES-R spacecraft dynamics and attitude control system identified model is constructed from pseudo-random reaction wheel torque commands and IMU angular rate response measurements occurring over a single orbit during spacecraft post-deployment activities. The identified Fourier model is computed on the ground, uplinked to the spacecraft flight computer, and the AVD controller filter coefficients are periodically computed on-board from the Fourier model. Consequently, the AVD controller formulation is based not upon pre-launch simulation model estimates but upon on-orbit <b>nadir</b> <b>point</b> attitude control and time-varying spacecraft dynamics. GOES-R high-fidelity time domain simulation results herein demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} AVD identified Fourier model relative to the pre-launch spacecraft dynamics and control truth model.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new method called ND-Tree-based update (or shortly ND-Tree) for the dynamic non-dominance problem, i. e. the problem of online update of a Pareto archive {{composed}} of mutually non-dominated points. It uses a new ND-Tree data structure in which each node represents a subset of points contained in a hyperrectangle defined by its local approximate ideal and <b>nadir</b> <b>points.</b> By building subsets containing points located close in the objective space and using basic properties of the local ideal and <b>nadir</b> <b>points</b> we can efficiently avoid searching many branches in the tree. ND-Tree may be used in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and other multiobjective metaheuristics to update an archive of potentially non-dominated points.
