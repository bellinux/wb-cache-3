40|$|Russia is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} a country with substantial energy efficiency and renewable energy potential. In 2000 - 2008 energy-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios were improved by 35 %, however, the contribution of technological progress accounts for only 1 % of the energy-GDP ratio reduction. At the same time, although new policy mechanisms to stimulate renewable energy development have been recently introduced, renewable technology deployment has not yet taken off. Economic theory suggests that there is no better incentive for industry development than cost signals. This paper adapts the levelised cost of energy methodology to examine the cost structures associated with electricity generation by conventional and new technology types for a Russian region (Moscow). The model, run for two fuel price scenarios, allowed us to conclude that the regional energy supply system is heavily dependent on the natural gas price and that the diversification provided by technology development will be beneficial for the energy security of the region. We conclude that new and renewable technologies become cost-effective for electricity generation as domestic natural gas prices reach <b>parity</b> <b>with</b> <b>export</b> prices. However, strong political and financial support is needed to boost technological development and renewables application in Russia...|$|R

Objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to know whether there any relationship between <b>parity</b> <b>with</b> success of labor induction using vaginal misoprostol in RSUD DR Moewardi Surakarta Methods: This study is an observational research with cross sectional analytic. The population was all pregnant women giving birth in RSUD Dr Moewardi in June 2009 until January 2010. Sampling was done by purposive sampling of 60 samples. Data were analyzed using Chi-Square test statistics with significance level 0, 05 and then processed with software SPSS 16 for Window. Results: Chi-Square count X 2 5. 455 with α = 0. 05 greater than 3. 841 for X 2 tables. Thus we can conclude that Ho is rejected and Ha is accepted, it means that there is a relationship between <b>parity</b> <b>with</b> the success of labor induction using vaginal misoprostol. Conclusion: There is a relationship between <b>parity</b> <b>with</b> the success of labor induction using vaginal misoprostol in RSUD DR Moerwadi Surakarta with OR of 4. 35, which means that the multiparous women are 4, 35 times more successfully induced than nulliparous women.
