50|$|The {{passenger}} accommodation was a rectangular area within the deepest {{part of the}} centre section, 5.35 m (17 ft 6 in) long, about 9.5 m (30 ft) wide and 1.88 m (6 ft 2 in) high. The structural bays divided this space laterally into three: two outer, 10 seat cabins 1.80 m (6 ft) wide, each lit by 5 windows in the outer fuselage walls, and a central saloon with eight arm chairs grouped around two tables. For night flights, the seats {{in each of the}} cabins were replaced by 8 berths, reducing the overall accommodation to 24. Aft of this central area were toilets, a kitchen and baggage space plus corridor access to a floor trapdoor which was the principal passenger entryway. A 'promenade' ran the width of the centre section ahead of the seating areas, lit by glazed wing leading edges, with further <b>passenger</b> <b>access</b> <b>doors</b> at either end. Adjacent to it in the centre section leading edge was a corridor that allowed the third crew member, a mechanic, to enter the engine compartments for in-flight servicing. The two pilots sat in an open cockpit, fitted with dual controls, at the centre section leading edge.|$|E

40|$|Considering {{availability}} {{purposes for}} train transportation, <b>passenger</b> <b>accesses</b> (<b>doors</b> and steps) are often designated as critical systems. To improve global availability of its rolling stock, Bombardier Transportation (BT) aims at reinforcing its maintenance procedure by introducing predictive diagnosis. The SURFER {{project has been}} initiated to develop online and in-cars tools to early detect and prevent faults. In this paper, an overview of achieved progress with respect to online predictive diagnosis will be introduced. For this purpose, many signals are recorded using a test bench by BT: electrical motor intensity current, door displacement, binary indicators as door closed and locked. The paper focuses on designing a semi-Supervised discriminative probabilistic model that take into account contextual variables (train inclination or constraints due to passengers affluence) to perform a robust predictive diagnosis. The main steps of the proposed method are the followings: the segmentation of the provided signals into opening and closing phases, the extraction of relevant features from opening/closing phases, {{the setting of the}} discriminative diagnosis model based on statistical semi-supervised learning. The proposed approach is tested on signals collected from regional trains fleeting around Paris. It allows the earlier detection of anomalies, for instance, those due to maladjustments. The practical implementation of this approach will be detailed together with its preliminary results...|$|R
5000|$|The Isis uses {{a unique}} {{approach}} to the sliding doors in that the front passenger door and the rear passenger sliding door interlock when closed, instead of having a doorjamb that the doors attach to. Toyota calls this on the Japanese Wikipedia article [...] "Panoramic Door". This door system is used only on the passenger side. The doors on the driver's side attach with a conventional doorjamb. The front passenger seat can be folded flat upon itself and then tilted forward to further provide <b>passenger</b> <b>access.</b> The <b>doors</b> also interlock with {{the top and bottom}} door openings so that both doors can be opened independently of each other. This door feature was first used by Toyota on the Toyota Raum. This door approach is also used on the U.S.-spec 2000-2006 Toyota Tundra Extra Cab. This type of door was first used on the Nissan Prairie in 1981.|$|R
50|$|Van {{conversions}} involve adding {{windows to}} the bodywork, and seating to the cargo area. Van conversion minibuses outwardly {{look the same}} shape as the parent van, and the driver and front passenger cabin remains unchanged, retaining the driver and <b>passenger</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>Access</b> to the former cargo area for passengers is through the standard van side sliding door, or the rear doors. These may be fitted with step equipment to make boarding easier. Optional extras to van converted minibuses can include {{the addition of a}} rollsign for transit work, and/or a full-height walk-in <b>door,</b> for <b>passenger</b> <b>access</b> to the former cargo area. For public transport use, this door may be an automatic concertina type. For other uses, this may be a simple plug style coach door. Depending on the relevant legislation, conversions may also involve wheelchair lifts and tachograph equipment. A van conversion with a passenger area in the front and a storage area in the back, behind a fixed bulkhead, is called a splitter bus.|$|R
