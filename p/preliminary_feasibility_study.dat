The Field Programmable Processor Array (FPPA), a radiation tolerant alternative to Field Programmable Gate Arrays, developed at NASA/Goddard under ESTO funding, is the computation engine of our <b>study,</b> while <b>preliminary</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>studies</b> are also performed on an hybrid reconfigurable architecture, the SRC- 6. For this <b>feasibility</b> <b>study,</b> {{one of the first}} basic methodologies that is considered deals with dimension reduction of hyperspectral data. This processing represents one of the few most important first steps to be performed on-board, since it enables to reduce communication bandwidth, and make subsequent computations simpler, faster and more accurate.

This paper proposes a new hybrid-BTS (H-BTS) system architecture for the green Metrozones. The hybrid free-space optical and radio frequency (FSO/RF) system is integrated at the macro-cellular tier, to enable high-capacity, power-efficient wireless backhauling. A resource prioritization mechanism is designed, to maintain good control and optimal on-demand resource allocation.

40|$|An {{array of}} bow-tie slot antennas coupled through an {{extended}} hemispherical lens is proposed {{to operate in}} the 30 GHz frequency band. The design includes a combination of three microstrip Wilkinson power dividers (WPD) and transitions to coplanar wave guides (CPW) to form the feeding antenna network. This configuration is suitable for the integration with heterodyne imaging detectors commonly used in radioastronomy. Measurements and simulation results exhibit a frequency range of operation from 20 to 40 GHz with a bandwidth of 24 % achieved for - 10 dB return loss at the central frequency. The measured radiation patterns show a maximum peak gain of around 13 dB with HPBW of 10 ° for the E-plane, and whose first side lobes are lower than 13 dB below the main lobe in both angular shift sides.
