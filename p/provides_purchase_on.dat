40|$|An {{important}} claim {{made for}} second-generation accounts of cognition {{is that they}} help {{solve the problem of}} dualism, which arguably remains unchallenged in much literary criticism. Kafka's short story “Ein Hungerkunstler” (A Hunger Artist) is about a profoundly embodied experience of (unsuccessfully) denying embodiment: fasting to death. With this text's cognitive realism as my focal point, I use insights from second-generation cognitive science (which acknowledges the embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended nature of human cognition), including research on eating disorders and starvation, to <b>provide</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> two traditional literary-critical concerns: thematic interpretation and paradox. I also suggest that a first-person perspective which acknowledges the complexities of individual real-world embodiment may sometimes enrich cognitive literary studies. This combined first-person and second-generation methodology can help us recognize that for the real people who read our scholarship and learn from us, the dangers of dualism are ethically as well as interpretively profound. </p...|$|R

50|$|Commodification of {{the womb}} {{is the process}} by which {{services}} performed by the female womb are offered for sale and <b>purchased</b> <b>on</b> the market. The market transaction transforms the womb from a human body part, to being a service <b>provided</b> for <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> the market. The womb in its commodified state has both exchange value and use value. Market transactions involving the services of women's wombs became increasingly common in the early twenty-first century. Such transactions are generally relied upon by those unable to conceive and those who are willing to pay someone else to bear the inconvenience of going through a pregnancy. Commodification of the womb raises several ethical and legal questions, which have expanded from questions regarding the rights of surrogates and biological parents, and the legitimacy of a child resulting from the transaction, to questions regarding transnational surrogacy within a global market.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the lives}} of {{individual}} species differ, a pollinating fig wasp life cycle is as follows. In {{the beginning of the}} cycle, a mature female pollinator wasp enters the immature [...] "fruit" [...] (actually a stem-like structure known as a syconium) through a small natural opening, the ostiole and deposits her eggs in the cavity. Forcing her way through the ostiole, she often loses her wings and most of her antennae. To facilitate her passage through the ostiole, the underside of the female's head is covered with short spines that <b>provide</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> the walls of the ostiole. In depositing her eggs, the female also deposits pollen she picked up from her original host fig. This pollinates some of the female flowers on the inside surface of the fig and allows them to mature. After the female wasp lays her eggs and follows through with pollination, she dies. After pollination, there are several species of non-pollinating wasps which deposit their eggs before the figs harden. These wasps act as parasites to either the fig or possibly the pollinating wasps. As the fig develops, the wasp eggs hatch and develop into larvae. After going through the pupal stage, the mature male’s first act is to mate with a female. The males of many species lack wings and are unable to survive outside the fig for a sustained period of time. After mating, a male wasp begins to dig out of the fig, creating a tunnel through which the females escape.|$|R

In engaging with the limits and possibilities of recent assemblage-based work in urban studies, our concern has been to help forge new analytical tools for deciphering emerging patterns of planetary urbanization, which have unsettled the coherence and viability of earlier intellectual frameworks. As urbanization is changing, so too must urban theory change, and it must do so in ways that <b>provide</b> critical <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> emergent sociospatial divisions, conflicts, struggles and transformations at all spatial scales and across divergent places and territories.

We insist on the importance of abstraction as a necessary methodological moment in any reflexive approach to urban knowledge formation...|$|R

Evidence is presented to show the emerging importance of not-for-profit registered social landlords, and the growing significance of stock transfer associations (formed from within the public sector), but {{the main purpose of}} the article is to look at explanations for the current restructuring process.

40|$|The {{empirical}} identification and description of local music processes as {{enacted by the}} band Bastèr from La Réunion makes a very interesting case study of world music. As a sociologist {{with an interest in}} the social organisation and cultural significance of music, whether world or not, I believe it is essential that this type of empirical work is carried out, as world music literature is dominated by theoretical and abstract concerns, especially in relation to globalisation debates. Moreover, accounts of its empirical meaning help to <b>provide</b> further <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> it as a cultural process that reflects both local and global influences. The following questions arose in my reading of this article. I have first tried to explain the thinking process behind {{some of the issues that}} stimulated such queries. It is argued here that world music is demonstrably an artistic genre and not simply a marketing concept, achieved through a particular kind of musical practice, with a style defined by its expression and representation of ideas about culture and identity. The typical understanding of the history of world music as a marketing concept is shaped by the idea that music industry movers and shakers at a point in the 1980 s needed a more convenient label for heterogeneous music in order to sell more units to western consumers and thus, unlike jazz o...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} days of anthropology, {{indigenous}} concepts of animating essences and the cross-cutting nature of the life-force, expressed in such terms as hau and mana, were front and centre in the ethnographic literature (e. g.

Quantitative analysis was carried out using the statistical package SPSS.

40|$|New state spaces {{can be seen}} as {{products}} of the interaction between emerging initiatives and pre-existing institutional arrangements (Peck 1998, Space and Polity 2 : 5 – 31). In the devolved territories of the UK devolution has created new political centres of policy formulation and this paper is concerned with how devolved policy initiatives are reshaping and rescaling sub-national spaces of governance. We focus on the rescaling of transport governance in Scotland through a nationally orchestrated process of regionalisation involving the creation of Regional Transport Partnerships (RTPs), an initiative that has been shaped by tensions between changing national political objectives and local interests. Our approach draws on Neil Brenner's “new state spaces” (NSS) framework, which has value in emphasising the historically embedded and path-dependent nature of restructuring processes. At the same time, its abstract nature leads the NSS approach to privilege the broad processes that generate new configurations of state power over the complex politics associated with the restructuring of particular spaces. In response, we suggest a new theoretical synthesis that draws NSS together with the ancillary notions of “regional armatures” and “the politics of scale” to <b>provide</b> a stronger <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> the political agency and struggles that “form” and “mould” particular spaces...|$|R

Where sequence {{is known to}} matter, language clearly demands some sort of sequence-sensitive structure. The dog bit the man is not equivalent to The man bit the dog, and any system that represented sentences as unordered lists of words simply could not capture that fact. A standard (though not universal) assumption in most theories of linguistics and psycholinguistics is that phrase structure is represented as a tree (Partee, ter Meulen, & Wall, 1990), as in Figure 2. 1. Trees are widespread, and their formal properties are well understood (Knuth, 1973). They {{play a central role}} not only in linguistics, but also in disciplines such as mathematics, computer science, taxonomy, and even genealogy. For example, computer programmers use trees to represent the nested directory (or folder) structures in which files are stored. In linguistics, tree-theoretic concepts, such as path and distance, often seem to <b>provide</b> important <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> syntactic phenomena (Kayne, 1984; Pesetsky, 1982). It is an open question, however, whether human beings can actually use trees as a data structure for representing sentences in a stable and reliable fashion. Although it is clear that educated humans can understand at an abstract level what trees are, implement them in computers, and use them as external representational devices, the evidence for their existence qua mental representation has been remarkably indirect, and there has not thus far been any fully satisfying account for how trees as such could be neurally realized. The goal of this chapter is to suggest an alternative: in the course of ordinary linguistic processing, mental representations of sentences may be incomplete, inconsistent, or partial—realized via a system of overlapping but incompletel...|$|R
40|$|This article explores three {{different}} inflections {{of the idea}} of economy: imagined, real and moral. Each offers a distinctive way of thinking about economies and each raises the possibility of <b>providing</b> critical <b>purchase</b> <b>on</b> the formations of ‘actually existing capitalisms’. The article begins from the idea of imagined economies given the proliferation of such imaginaries, not least {{in the wake of the}} financial crisis. In political, public and policy discourse, economies have become the focus of intense fantasy and projection. The resulting imaginaries underpin a range of economic, public and social policies. Importantly, they articulate a foundational distinction between economic and other sorts of policy. The idea of imagined economies opens the space for a certain type of critical engagement with contemporary political economy. In a rather different way, ideas of the ‘real economy’ have also been the site of critical work – distinguishing between ‘real’ relations and practices involved in the production of material objects (and value) in the contrast with virtual, digital, financialised economies. This article treats the ‘real economy’ as one further instance of an imagined economy. Like the concept of the ‘real economy’, E. P. Thompson’s exploration of a ‘moral economy’ also offers a standpoint from which critical analysis of the current economic, political and social disintegrations might be constructed. Thompson’s articulation of a moment in which collective understandings of economies as fields of moral relationships and obligations dramatises the contemporary de-socialization of economies, even if it may be harder to imagine twentieth and twenty first century capitalisms as moral economies that the current crisis has disrupted. Again, the article treats ‘moral economies’ as another form of imagined economy, in part to make visible the shifting and contested character of what counts as ‘economic’...|$|R
