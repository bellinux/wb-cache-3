5|$|In 1931, the Government of Canada {{enacted the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which {{provided}} <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> {{in the national}} parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects.</b> New projects included {{construction of a new}} registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, McNary {{supported}} the development of federal hydroelectric power dams, and in 1933, he introduced legislation {{that led to the}} building of the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams on the Columbia, as <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects.</b> He voted for the US joining the World Court in 1926. He favored buying more National Forest lands, reforestation, fire protection for forests via the Clarke–McNary Act, and farm support. Although vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill was the forerunner of the farm legislation of the New Deal.|$|E
5|$|During the Depression, {{the state}} sought to ease {{unemployment}} through <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> {{as an economic}} stimulus. It applied this to the new Highway 82. First it converted the Maroon Creek Bridge for automotive traffic by widening it with a timber deck, which was then paved and supported with outriggers. In 1937, four miles (6.4km) between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale was paved; {{the remainder of the}} road to Aspen was oiled the following year.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was {{that government should}} aid {{it as much as}} possible. He was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought to get them to work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in his opening address that no federal money would be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> were accelerated.|$|E

5|$|In this period, Germany {{was still}} in a dire {{economic}} situation as millions were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting. Hitler knew that reviving the economy was vital. In 1934, using deficit spending, <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> were undertaken. A total of 1.7 million Germans were put {{to work on the}} projects in 1934 alone. Average wages both per hour and per week began to rise.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the rule}} of Isma'il Pasha, the {{grandson}} of Muhammad Ali, major <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> were initiated {{with the aim of}} transforming Cairo into a European styled city. These projects, at first funded by a boom in the cotton industry, eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by the British, providing an excuse for the British to occupy Egypt in 1882 after having pushed out Isma'il Pasha in 1879.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{political}} {{forces in the}} Northwestern United States generally favored private development of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia. But the overwhelming victories of gubernatorial candidate George W. Joseph in the 1930 Republican primary, and later his law partner Julius Meier, were understood to demonstrate strong public support for public ownership of dams. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill that enabled {{the construction of the}} Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams as <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects.</b> The legislation was attributed to the efforts of Oregon Senator Charles McNary, Washington Senator Clarence Dill, and Oregon Congressman Charles Martin, among others.|$|E

5|$|Major <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> financed with deficit {{spending}} included {{the construction of}} a network of Autobahns and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements. To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs. On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 3 {{opened on}} June 27, 2012. The project was {{announced}} in January 2001 {{as a way to}} accommodate rapid growth in passenger traffic, including international traffic. It came into question amid the 2008 recession and decreased tourism to Las Vegas, but the county decided to proceed with the project, anticipating eventual economic recovery and a rebound in passenger numbers. Terminal 3 cost $2.4 billion to build {{and is one of the}} largest <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> in Nevada. It replaced Terminal 2, providing more international gates and a larger U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility. With its seven domestic gates, the terminal also eases congestion at Terminal 1.|$|E
5|$|Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects.</b> In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately {{were put to}} work, which gave them an income and social benefits. The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns. Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof. Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakar {{employed}} {{the service of}} a Chinese contractor and long-time acquaintance, Wong Ah Fook, to oversee the development of Johor Bahru. The Johor Archives showed that Wong was the largest building contractor at that time and had been involved in at least twenty <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> between 1887 and 1895. In addition, Wong was contracted to oversee the construction of the state mosque and several palaces under the direction of Abu Bakar. As a gratitude to Wong's contributions to the state, Abu Bakar granted him a plot of land in the heart of Johor Bahru in 1892. Wong then oversaw the construction of a village, Kampong Ah Fook, as well as a road, Jalan Wong Ah Fook on the land that he was granted.|$|E
5|$|By 1827, the Chinese {{had become}} the largest ethnic group in Singapore. They {{consisted}} of Peranakans, who were descendants of early Chinese settlers, and Chinese coolies who flocked to Singapore to escape economic hardship in southern China. Their numbers were swelled by those fleeing the turmoil caused by the First Opium War (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860). Many arrived in Singapore as impoverished indentured laborers. The Malays were the second largest ethnic group until the 1860s and they worked as fishermen, craftsmen, or as wage earners while continued to live mostly in kampungs. By 1860, the Indians {{had become the}} second largest ethnic group. They consisted of unskilled labourers, traders, and convicts who were sent to carry out <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> such as clearing jungles and laying out roads. There were also Indian Sepoy troops garrisoned at Singapore by the British.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{was named}} to the Senate Committee on Labor, Education and Public Welfare and chaired its {{education}} and labor subcommittees. He sponsored a bill authorizing <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> along the Big Sandy River, including the Tug and Levisa forks. He also supported the reconstruction of the locks and dams along the Ohio River and the construction of locks, dams, and reservoirs in the Green River Valley. He opposed the Dixon-Yates contract, which would have paid a private company to construct a new power station to generate power for the city of Memphis, Tennessee, calling instead for authorization for the Tennessee Valley Authority to issue bonds to finance the construction of new power stations. He supported a comprehensive program benefiting the coal industry and cosponsored a bill to extending public library services to rural areas.|$|E

5|$|Rural {{families}} that sold a large agricultural surplus {{to the market}} not only could afford to buy more charcoal, tea, oil, and wine, but they could also amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming families could often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk wares, while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that could lift water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Pacific Railway was {{instrumental}} in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects.</b> Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through the park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study, which resulted in management recommendations, and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.|$|E
5|$|The Excellency of Works, {{also known}} as the Minister of Works, was less {{powerful}} than his previous counterpart, the Imperial Counselor. This official's advisory and censorial responsibilities coincided with those of two other Excellencies, forming a tripartite cabinet arrangement. Unlike the abolished Imperial Counselor, he was given the specialized role of overseeing <b>public</b> <b>works</b> <b>projects</b> throughout the empire. The Excellency of Works was responsible for the construction of city walls, towns, canals, irrigation ditches, dykes and dams, and other structural engineering projects. The Court Architect supervised only imperial building projects. The Excellency of Works made annual reports to the throne about the progress of local administrations' conduct of construction projects. He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of the Imperial Clan, Minister of Finance, and Minister Steward.|$|E
