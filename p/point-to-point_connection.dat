Technically, Internet service offered an enormous advantage over BBS systems, as a single connection to the user's Internet service provider allowed them to contact services around the world. In comparison, BBS systems relied on a direct <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection,</b> so even dialing multiple local systems required multiple phone calls. Moreover, Internet protocols allowed that same single connection {{to be used to}} contact multiple services at the same time, say download files from an FTP library while checking the weather on a local news web site. In comparison, a connection to a BBS allowed access only to the information on that system.|$|E

These results take into account the <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connections</b> between all the nodes of the network.

50|$|A SOAPConnection is a <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection</b> {{for sending}} {{messages}} {{directly to a}} remote party. A SOAPConnection object, which represents a <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection,</b> is simple to create and use. You {{do not have to}} do any configuration to use a SOAPConnection object because it does not need to run in a servlet container (like Tomcat) or in a J2EE server. It is the only way for a client to have a connection without a service provider.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, ICs {{have been}} {{designed}} with dedicated <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connections,</b> with one wire dedicated to each signal. For large designs, in particular, this has several limitations from a physical design viewpoint. The wires occupy much of {{the area of the}} chip, and in nanometer CMOS technology, interconnects dominate both performance and dynamic power dissipation, as signal propagation in wires across the chip requires multiple clock cycles. (See Rent's rule for a discussion of wiring requirements for <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connections).</b>|$|R

50|$|Traditional voice {{calls are}} {{predominantly}} two party calls, requiring a <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection</b> using only the voice medium. To access pictorial {{information in a}} remote database would require a <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection</b> that sends low bit-rate queries to the database and high bit-rate video from the database. Entertainment video applications are largely point-to-multi-point connections, requiring one-way communication of full motion video and audio from the program source to the viewers. Video teleconferencing involves connections among many parties, communicating voice, video, as well as data. Offering future services thus requires flexible management of the connection and media requests of a multi-point, multi-media communication call.|$|E
50|$|In addition, CalDriCon {{and many}} other {{advanced}} driver interfaces adopt <b>Point-to-Point</b> <b>connection</b> that brings much less distortion of signal integrity even in the multi-drop connection than mini-LVDS that is often affected by noise because of its bus topology.|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} a {{permanent}} point-to-point network is unimpeded communications between the two endpoints. The {{value of a}}n on-demand <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection</b> {{is proportional to the}} number of potential pairs of subscribers and has been expressed as Metcalfe's Law.|$|E

50|$|Before <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection,</b> {{electrical}} assemblies used screws or {{wire nuts}} to hold wires to an insulating wooden or ceramic board. The resulting devices were prone to fail from corroded contacts, or mechanical loosening of the connections.

This paper introduces an aggregated system control, both for a set-up with two <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connections</b> and for a multi-terminal HVDC system. Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink show that the aggregated system control is able to adequately control the power distribution from the wind farm to the two onshore grids at varying wind farm output. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|More modern designs use <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connections</b> like AMD's HyperTransport and Intel's DMI 2.0 or QuickPath Interconnect (QPI).

50|$|A VPN {{is created}} by {{establishing}} a virtual <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection</b> {{through the use of}} dedicated connections, virtual tunneling protocols, or traffic encryption. A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a wide area network (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.|$|E
50|$|As {{there are}} only two {{endpoints}} on a tunnel, the tunnel is a <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection</b> and PPP is a natural choice as a data link layer protocol between the virtual network interfaces. PPP can assign IP addresses to these virtual interfaces, and these IP addresses can be used, for example, to route between the networks {{on both sides of the}} tunnel.|$|E
50|$|For each <b>point-to-point</b> <b>connection,</b> {{the dynamic}} system {{behavior}} {{is defined by}} a connection state machine. The connection state machine defines the states and sub-states an Agent and Manager pair passes through, including states related to connection, association, and operation. The communication model also defines in detail the entry, exit, and error conditions for the respective states including various operating procedures for measurement data transmission.|$|E
