40|$|In 1993, {{the health}} {{department}} serving the city of Amarillo, Texas, and surrounding communities was merged with the city's tax-supported Hospital District, which operated a public hospital and clinics providing medical care to poor people. Three years later, the public hospital and clinics were sold to a for-profit corporation, privatizing most medical services for the poor. The proceeds from this sale created a community trust fund {{for the provision of}} indigent care and eliminated Hospital District taxes. The city government reassumed operation of the Health Department, which redefined itself primarily in terms of public health functions not involving the provision of <b>personal</b> health <b>services.</b> These <b>functions</b> included communicable disease control, monitoring the health status of the community, identification of public health problems, and health promotion. The new Health Department, with a smaller budget and fewer staff members, is now funded by the for-profit corporation that purchased the public hospital, the community trust fund, and grants from the state health department...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1980 s, the {{introduction}} of market mechanisms in the public sector has been a dominant feature in Sweden. The same is true for the social services in several municipalities, where business style behaviour and organisation, and competition have become salient features of market-oriented social services. The aim of the study is to describe and analyse: the structural conditions for market oriented personal social services; how social workers pursue client centred work in market oriented personal social services; the consequences of this market orientation on the <b>personal</b> social <b>services.</b> The empirical study is a case study of the <b>personal</b> social <b>services</b> in the municipality of Linköping. The purchaser-provider model in Linköping {{is one of the most}} advanced and discussed in Sweden. The research comprises a quantitative pilot study and a qualitative main study. The main study is based on twenty semi-structured interviews with experienced social workers and their immediate superiors. The analysis of the interviews reveals that the <b>personal</b> social <b>services</b> are only achieving to a lesser extent the ends that a quasi-market, theoretically, should achieve. The conditions that have to be satisfied to achieve the ends of the quasi-market are only partly met. Bureaucratic control is one important reason why the <b>personal</b> social <b>services</b> are imperfect as a quasi- market. The re-organisation has resulted in a number of, to some extent, positive consequences. The re-organisation has, however, also resulted in some negative consequences. In the thesis these are categorised in terms of fragmentation, antagonism and obscurity. A linguistic change, in market oriented <b>personal</b> social <b>services,</b> appears to have influenced social workers to think and act differently in relation to their work. The most important conclusion drawn from the study is that the market oriented <b>personal</b> social <b>services</b> partly <b>function</b> as a responsive quasi-market for strong, rational and well- informed clients. However, in relation to the most vulnerable, it is failing in many respects. digitalisering@um...|$|R
50|$|Bengali Hindu society {{used to be}} caste-oriented {{throughout}} {{centuries and}} the professional status of men depended exclusively on the hierarchical caste divisions. Some professions such as weaving, pottery, carpentry, blacksmithing etc. have always been carried out by special Hindu caste groups in Bengal. In traditional Bengali Hindu society, nearly every occupation is carried on by a ranked hierarchy of specialized caste groups- not only artisan occupations but also <b>personal</b> and domestic <b>service</b> <b>functions</b> such as barbering, laundering, latrine cleaning as well as non-menial tasks such as priesthood. However, {{with the introduction of}} British rule and appearance of urban civilization, the former rural agrarian and artisan economy gradually crumbled and gave way to modern middle class economy. However, agriculture, land tenure, farming and fishing form the predominant economic activity in most of the rural area till now. A small but significant section of rural people carry out small trades and businesses. In urban and semi-urban areas, most of the people are engaged in business, industry, government and private service sectors, self-employing works and intellectual pursuits. Unemployment has persisted in a certain minuscule section of the community.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} three complementary measures of portal use: frequency of use, length of visits and repeat use. To examine these three measures of use, we first classify the {{services provided by}} portals into three categories: search, information, and <b>personal</b> <b>services.</b> We argue that these three different functions affect portal use in different ways. We primarily rely on the human computer interaction literature to develop our model of portal use. Our analysis is based on Internet navigation data of 102 demographically diverse users {{over a period of}} one year for six major portals. In total, we study 6321 distinct portal choices. Our results show strong repeat use for <b>personal</b> <b>services</b> followed by information <b>services</b> and search <b>function.</b> Our findings show that cumulative dissatisfaction with search results has a negative effect on future user choice decisions. Both information and <b>personal</b> <b>services</b> tend to extend the length of portal visits. As expected, search services tend to reduce the time spent as users move on to the search targets. But we also find that search function availability drives more traffic to portals than information or <b>personal</b> <b>services.</b> Of the three <b>services,</b> <b>personal</b> <b>services</b> use shows maximum (week-to-week) stability, information services use, on the other hand, shows least stability. Use of <b>personal</b> <b>services</b> leads to use of search and information services. We also find that demographic characteristics play some role in portal use. Ó 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Consumersatisfaction is {{fundamental}} to organisational success. It is well recognised that <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> is important in achieving consumer satisfaction. However, the application of self-service technology (SST) is widcning and is attennuating traditional exchanges between consumers and service employees. The effect of this reduction of <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> on consumer satisfaction judgements is not well understood. This study addresses this gap by investigating the relative effects of SST and <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> attributes on overall consumer satisfaction. Thc study highlights important service attributes applicable to SST and <b>personal</b> <b>service.</b> The conceptual framework is tested using data collected from 241 leisure and business travellers drawn from premium hotels in a regional area. Structural equation modelling techniques support the conceptual framework. As expected, the attributes of <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> and SST contribute to consumer satisfaction. However, thc impact of <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> attributes 011 consumer satisfaction is much stronger than the effects of SST attributes. Though SST is an important determinant of consumer satisfaction, interactions with staff are critical. These results have applications for the {{theory and practice of}} services marketing, and high light avenues for further investigation...|$|R
