5|$|The oldest known tetrapodomorph is Kenichthys from China, dated {{at around}} 395 million years old. Two of the {{earliest}} tetrapodomorphs, dating from 380 Ma, were Gogonasus and Panderichthys. They had choanae and used their fins to move through tidal channels and shallow waters choked with dead branches and rotting plants. Their fins {{could have been used}} to attach themselves to plants or similar while they were lying in ambush for prey. The universal tetrapod characteristics of front limbs that bend forward from the elbow and hind limbs that bend backward from the knee can plausibly be traced to early tetrapods living in shallow water. <b>Pelvic</b> <b>bone</b> fossils from Tiktaalik shows, if representative for early tetrapods in general, that hind appendages and pelvic-propelled locomotion originated in water before terrestrial adaptations.|$|E
5|$|When swimming, baleen whales rely {{on their}} {{flippers}} for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Flipper movement is continuous. While doing this, baleen whales use their tail fluke to propel themselves forward through vertical motion while using their flippers for steering, much like an otter. Some species leap out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Because of their great size, right whales are not flexible or agile like dolphins, and none can move their neck because of the fused cervical vertebrae; this sacrifices speed for stability in the water. The hind legs are enclosed inside the body, and {{are thought to be}} vestigial organs. However, a 2014 study suggests that the <b>pelvic</b> <b>bone</b> serves as support for whale genitalia.|$|E

The acetabular point in immature <b>pelvic</b> <b>bones</b> is clearly represented by the point of the fusion lines for each bony element {{at the level of the}} acetabular fossa. In adult <b>pelvic</b> <b>bones</b> the acetabular fossa has an irregular clover-leaf shape, the superior lobe being smaller than the anterior and posterior lobes. Cross-sectional analysis of acetabular morphology suggested that the acetabular point in adult <b>pelvic</b> <b>bones</b> is always represented by the indentation between the superior and the anterior lobes of the acetabular fossa...|$|R

500|$|Dinosaurs {{stand with}} their hind limbs erect {{in a manner}} similar to most modern mammals, but {{distinct}} from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur. Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of [...] "sprawling" [...] reptiles. Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including rauisuchians, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a [...] "pillar erect" [...] configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the upper <b>pelvic</b> <b>bone</b> was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.|$|E

500|$|While {{the first}} Pteranodon wing bones were {{collected}} by Marsh and Cope in the early 1870s, the first Pteranodon skull was found on May 2, 1876, along the Smoky Hill River in Wallace County (now Logan County), Kansas, USA, by Samuel Wendell Williston, a fossil collector working for Marsh. A second, smaller skull soon was discovered as well. These skulls showed that the North American pterosaurs were different from any European species, in that they lacked teeth and had bony crests on their skulls. Marsh recognized this major difference, describing the specimens as [...] "distinguished from all previously known genera of the order Pterosauria by the entire absence of teeth." [...] Marsh recognized that this characteristic warranted a new genus, and he coined the name Pteranodon ("wing without tooth") in 1876. Marsh reclassified all the previously named North American species from Pterodactylus to Pteranodon. He considered the smaller skull to belong to Pteranodon occidentalis, based on its size. Marsh classified the larger skull, YPM 1117, in the new species Pteranodon longiceps, which he {{thought to be a}} medium-sized species in between the small P. occidentalis and the large P. ingens. Marsh also named several additional species: Pteranodon comptus and Pteranodon nanus were named for fragmentary skeletons of small individuals, while Pteranodon gracilis was based on a wing bone that he mistook for a <b>pelvic</b> <b>bone.</b> He soon realized his mistake, and re-classified that specimen again into a separate genus, which he named Nyctosaurus. P, nanus was also later recognized as a Nyctosaurus specimen.|$|E
500|$|On 12 September, it was {{announced}} that the skeleton discovered during the search might be that of Richard III. Several reasons were given: the body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; and there was severe scoliosis of the spine, possibly making one shoulder higher than the other (to what extent depended on the severity of the condition). Additionally, there was an object that appeared to be an arrowhead embedded in the spine; and there were [...] injuries to the skull. These included a relatively shallow orifice, which is most likely to have been caused by a rondel dagger, and a scooping depression to the skull, inflicted by a bladed weapon, most probably a sword. Additionally, the bottom of the skull presented a gaping hole, where a halberd had cut away and entered it. Forensic pathologist, Dr Stuart Hamilton stated that this injury would have left the King's brain visible, and most certainly would have been the cause of death. Dr Jo Appleby, the osteo-archaeologist who excavated the skeleton, concurred and described the latter as [...] "a mortal battlefield wound {{in the back of the}} skull". The base of the skull also presented another fatal wound in which a bladed weapon had been thrust into it, leaving behind a jagged hole. Closer examination of the interior of the skull revealed a mark opposite this wound, showing that the blade penetrated to a depth of [...] In total, the skeleton presented 10 wounds: 4 minor injuries on the top of the skull, 1 dagger blow on the cheekbone, 1 cut on the lower jaw, 2 fatal injuries on the base of the skull, 1 cut on a rib bone, and 1 final wound on the King's pelvis, most probably inflicted after death. It is generally accepted that postmortem, Richard's naked body was tied to the back of a horse, with his arms slung over one side and his legs and buttocks over the other. This presented a very opportunistic target for onlookers, and the angle of the blow on the pelvis suggests that one of them stabbed Richard's right buttock with substantial force, as the cut extends from the back all the way to the front of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>bone</b> and was most probably an act of humiliation. It is also possible that Richard suffered other injuries which left no trace on the skeleton.|$|E

Christakos assures, [...] "This position {{can give the}} woman plenty of clitoral stimulation if the man leans forward thus rubbing his <b>pelvic</b> <b>bone</b> against her clitoris." [...] Emily Queenie Chung notes, [...] "Also, this position is the easiest {{for a woman to}} stimulate her clitoris manually." [...] Sexual Health Resource notes that also [...] "the man can reach under and stimulate his partner using his fingers on her clitoris" [...] although [...] "the man has limited use of his hands" [...] (presumably this would depend on the variant of the position used and whether the man's hands are occupied holding himself up).|$|E
5|$|The {{sex of the}} {{different}} size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the <b>pelvic</b> <b>bones.</b> Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set <b>pelvic</b> <b>bones.</b> Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. He concluded that the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males.|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of gender {{is an important}} part of forensic anthropology because as the first essential step for positive identification process. Besides empirical methods for gender determination such as Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA), Artificial Intelligence methods such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) should be considered to obtain more accurate determination result. This paper proposes Back propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model of ANN methods. By using data and DFA result of <b>pelvic</b> <b>bones</b> and patella from previous work, this paper compares accuracy of result obtained from the BPNN models. A total sample data of 136 <b>pelvic</b> <b>bones</b> and 133 patellae have been collected. For <b>pelvic</b> <b>bones,</b> BPNN gave average accuracy as much as 98. 5 % for training and 98. 3 for testing. While on left <b>pelvic</b> <b>bones,</b> average accuracy that is obtained are 98. 49 % for training and 86. 6 % for testing. For patella bones, all average accuracy (males and females) are obtained by BPNN is 94. 09 %. If compared with previous study that using DFA obtained accuracy as much as 92. 9 %. It is concluded that in gender determination, BPNN gives high accuracy of classification for both bones compared with DFA...|$|R

Contrary to popular assertions, the dinosaur is not {{named after the}} Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, or the battle that was fought there. The holotype, the specimen the name was based on, was discovered in New Mexico and, {{at the time of}} its naming, Alamosaurus had not yet been found in Texas. Instead, the name Alamosaurus comes from Ojo Alamo, the geologic formation in which it was found and which was, in turn, named after the nearby Ojo Alamo trading post (since this time there has been some debate as to whether to reclassify the Alamosaurus-bearing rocks as belonging to the Kirtland Formation or whether they should remain in the Ojo Alamo Formation). The term alamo itself is a Spanish word meaning [...] "poplar" [...] and is used for the local subspecies of cottonwood tree. The term saurus is derived from saura (σαυρα), Greek for [...] "lizard" [...] and is the most common suffix used in dinosaur names. There is only one species in the genus, Alamosaurus sanjuanensis, which is named after San Juan County, New Mexico, where the first remains were found.|$|E
