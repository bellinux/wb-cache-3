50|$|The model {{engineering}} {{range was}} extensive throughout the inter-war years, {{with a lot}} of production sold as kits of castings, though some complete engines were also sold. Most of the models were designed to be representative of a class of engine, mainly steam driven, rather than an accurate scale recreation of a specific engine. Internal combustion engines were also available as kits, including the 'lighweight' 2-stroke petrol engine. From 1935 Stuart Turner were also UK agents for the American 'Brown Junior' 10 cc engine for which they developed an aluminium (elektron) airscrew. Some of the engines were intended to do a job of work rather than for the entertainment of a model engineer, for example the 1935 Sandhurst horizontal 2/3 bhp engine, which was described thus: 'This engine will run on gas or petrol and is designed for continuous work such as dynamo, workshop or <b>pump</b> <b>driving.</b> It is supplied only as castings for the amateur to machine up.'. The larger steam engines, for example the model 6A, are capable of 4 bhp and powering steam launches, thereby blurring the distinction between whether they were model engines, or designed to do a job of work, or both.|$|E

40|$|When N driven atoms emit {{in phase}} into a high-Q cavity mode, the {{intracavity}} field generated by collective scattering interferes destructively with the <b>pump</b> <b>driving</b> the atoms.

The effect gets more pronounced for large atom numbers, when the sum of the atomic decay rates exceeds the rate of cavity losses and one would expect the opposite behaviour.

A high resolution QG ocean model, coupled to a dynamic atmospheric mixed layer, is used to demon-strate that, despite the small spatial scale of the Ekman pumping anomalies, this phenomena significantly modifies the large-scale ocean circulation. The primary effect is to decrease {{the strength of the}} nonlinear component of the gyre circula-tion by approximately 30 – 40 %. This result is due to the highest transient Ekman pumping anomalies destabilising the flow in a dynamically sensitive region close to the western boundary current separation. The instability of the jet produces a flux of potential vorticity between the two gyres which acts to weaken both gyres. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme to {{modulate}} the entanglement between two oscillators separated in space via the squeezing cavity field generated by the optical parametric amplifier instead of injecting the squeezing field directly {{with the assistance of}} Coulomb interaction. We show that the Coulomb interaction between the oscillators is the essential reason for the existence of entanglement. Due to the gain of the optical parametric amplifier and the phase of the <b>pump</b> <b>driving</b> the optical parametric amplifier can simultaneously modulate the squeezing cavity field, the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity field and the oscillator is modulated accordingly. We find that there is competing effect between the radiation pressure interaction and the Coulomb interaction for the oscillator which these two interactions act on simultaneously. Therefore, the modulation of entanglement can be achieved with the assistance of Coulomb interaction. The results of numerical simulation show that the present scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of environment compared with previous schemes in experimentally feasible regimes.

40|$|A {{pneumatically}} actuated PDMS based microfluidic {{devices were}} designed and fabricated by soft-lithography. Two types of molds were fabricated out of different {{material for this}} experiment. The first mold, (device 1), was fabricated from a sheet of Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) material, similar to Plexiglas. The device features were micro-engraved onto {{the face of the}} material. The second mold, (device 2), was fabricated from the use of fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3 D printing. The pumping efficiency of the PDMS devices was analyzed through the characterization of the micro-pumps flowrate with respect to the <b>pumps</b> <b>driving</b> pressure and the actuation frequency. Tested at a driving pressure of 10 psi, the flowrate for device 1 peaked at 75 µL/min with a 7 Hz actuation frequency before failing, while device 2 peaked at 498 µL/min with a 15 Hz actuation frequency. Using the techniques of rapid prototyping and fused deposition modelling a pneumatically actuated 3 D printer based micro-pump and micro-mixer are fabricated. The devices were fabricated using a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) material as an alternative material to the present polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The micro-pump’s fluid flow output was analyzed through the characterization of the micro-pumps flowrate with respect to the <b>pumps</b> <b>driving</b> pressure and the actuation frequency. Testing showed that a maximum flowrate of 1120 µL/min was achieved at an actuation frequency of 10 Hz with an applied driving pressure of 40 psi. A qualitative mixing performance was conducted with the micro-mixer. The diffusion of two dyes was tested under an active mix and non-active mix condition. Testing showed that the active mixing condition resulted in a complete diffusion as opposed to the non-mixing condition which partially diffused. As a proof of concept for biological testing, E. coli and E. coli anti-bodies were mixes to measure the capturing efficiency. The results showed that the active mixing resulted in about 50 % capturing efficiency as opposed to the non-mixing which resulted in 33 % capturing efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{temperature}} and density near supra-arcade current sheets suggest that plasma on unreconnected field lines may experience {{some degree of}} "pre-heating" and "pre-densification" prior to their reconnection. Models of patchy reconnection allow for heating and acceleration of plasma along reconnected field lines but do not offer a mechanism for transport of thermal energy across field lines. Here we present a model in which a reconnected flux tube retracts, deforming the surrounding layer of unreconnected field. The deformation creates constrictions that act as peristaltic <b>pumps,</b> <b>driving</b> plasma flow along affected field lines. Under certain circumstances these flows lead to shocks that can extend far out into the unreconnected field, altering the plasma properties in the affected region.

40|$|By {{using the}} ability to shift to high {{overdrive}} ratios, a CVT equipped vehicle can outperform the fuel econ-omy of its counterpart with conventional automatic transmission. A further signi cant reduction of fuel consumption {{can be obtained by}} reducing transmis-sion power loss. The main sources of power loss are well known to be losses inside the V-belt variator and losses caused by driving the hydraulic pump. Signi-cant reduction of these losses will increase the attrac-tiveness of the V-belt type CVT. This paper rst analyses the most important loss con-tributions present in a reference transmission and how they depend on actuation and control properties, like <b>pump</b> <b>driving</b> power, over-clamping and variator slip. Based on this analysis, actuation and control im-provements will be proposed. The ef ciency increase is presented, that can be expected when the hydraulic pump is replaced by a servo-electromechanical actu-ation system, and when variator slip control is intro-duced. The ef ciency bene t is shown to be sub-stantial, especially at part load conditions. At 25 % of rated load the CVT losses are halved, whereas at full load, a reduction of 25 % can be expected. The proposed servo-electromechanical actuation sys-tem is currently in the realization phase, as well as the slip control technique. Experimental results will be re-ported on when available...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether a}} biventricular bypass system operated in an independent variable rate (VR) mode can maintain the entire circulation. Two pusher-plate pumps which incorporated the Hall effect position sensors were used to bypass the right and left ventricles in 10 sheep under fibrillation. The flow distributions of the pump output to the carotid and renal arteries were investigated every 6 h using ultrasonic blood flow meters for 24 h in 5 animals, and the controllability of the VR mode was evaluated in 5 long-term experiments. The carotid artery flow ratio to the pump output decreased significantly from 4. 7 +/- 0. 8 % before the bypass to 2. 7 +/- 0. 9 % after 24 h. However, the renal artery flow ratio did not change throughout the experiments. In the long-term experiments, the animals were kept alive from 3 to 48 days (mean 15. 6 days). The mean pump output had been maintained at more than 90 ml/min/kg for the first 7 days. After the surgery, the <b>pump</b> <b>driving</b> conditions were not readjusted in any experiment.

40|$|The Pulsatile {{catheter}} (PUCA) pump {{consists of}} a single port membrane pump connected to an indwelling valved catheter. This so-called transarterial blood pump was originally designed to be introduced through a superficial artery into the left ventricular cavity to pump blood from the left ventricle into the ascending aorta. By introducing the catheter directly into the thoracic aorta or the pulmonary artery, the possibility is created of applying large-diameter catheter PUCA pumps as left, right, or biventricular assist devices (LVAD, RVAD, or BIVAD) without damaging any of the structures of the heart. The pump performance of an 8 mm PUCA pump prototype (internal diameter catheter, 8 mm; catheter length, 40 cm; stroke volume, 80 ml) was studied in a mock circulation to investigate the influence of pulsatile intraventricular pumping on ventricular pressure patterns. The pumping mode of the PUCA pump was changed from approximately 1 : 1 ([n + 1]:n) to 1 : 2 ([1 / 2 n + 1]:n) and 1 : 3 ([1 / 3 n + 1]:n) {{in relation to the}} frequency of a ventricle-simulating membrane pump.

Inadequate pressure load to push the molten plastic pellets through to filling the mold during the molding processes {{is one of the}} problems reported in literature.

The Stirling pump is intended to fill the technological gap of a compact high energy density power supply for untethered fluid power applications in the 50 W to 500 W range. Specifically, this prototype is intended as a compact and quiet, untethered, hydraulic power supply for an ankle foot orthosis testbed associated with the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power. The energy source for the unit is flexible and can include propane, butane, methane, natural gas, or other high energy density hydrocarbon source of heat. The target output pressure of 7 MPa (1000 psig) is obtained from a pumping stage that is driven by a sealed engine stage that utilizes high pressure helium as the working fluid.

40|$|Abstract Effect of fine {{graphite}} flake, carbon nanotube, {{and carbon}} nanofiber additives on {{the efficiency of}} an external gear <b>pump</b> <b>driving</b> an ethanol-based closed hydraulic loop was investigated experimentally. A number of graphite, carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) dispersions in ethanol were prepared with concentrations ranging from 194 - 1500 ppm. The fluids were investigated in an external gear pump with a maximum operating pressure of 100 psi. Pump inlet pressure, volumetric flow rate, and electric power consumption data were recorded over a range of pump discharge pressures. The power consumed by the motor at a given differential pump pressure was found to remain approximately constant for all additive concentrations. It was found that increases in both volumetric flow rate and overall pump efficiency were observed when pure ethanol {{was replaced by the}} colloidal suspensions. This was attributed to a roller bearing effect caused by the alignment and self-lubrication of the colloidal additives when confined to micro-scale clearances between the gear surfaces. It was found that that pump performance was also a function on the CNT aspect ratio and could very from pump to pump, or even after a pump was disassembled and reassembled. This indicates that the clearance geometry between the gears and between the housing may play a critical role. To examine any potential structural changes in the additives, environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) images of the additives were obtained before and after extended run periods within the pump. The results indicate that graphite and CNTs retained significant resilience, i. e. no breakage and deformation was observed. However, the very long aspect ratio CNFs appear to have undergone some scission. To examine any issues with filterability, iii graphite and CNT suspensions were run through two filters of different size and composition and the filters where then qualitatively examined using ESEM images. The results indicate that a considerable amount of the additives were filtered from the suspension. This indicates that filterability is an issue {{that needs to be addressed}} if these suspensions were to be used in industrial applications...|$|E
