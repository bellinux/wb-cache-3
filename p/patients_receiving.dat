5|$|Selenium may be {{measured}} in blood, plasma, serum, or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior elimination in the urine. Cancer <b>patients</b> <b>receiving</b> daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the prescribing trends of analgesics used in the postoperative patients in a surgical unit of Enam Medical College Hospital. Treatment records of 180 patients, who underwent surgery in Enam Medical College Hospital, were randomly selected. Data pertaining to pain medications prescribed from the day of operation to sixth postoperative day were recorded. 180 prescriptions containing analgesics were collected randomly from the period of July 2007 to June 2008. In the operation day 65. 6 % <b>patients</b> <b>received</b> Nalbuphine and 33. 3 % <b>patients</b> <b>received</b> Pethidine. Along with Nalbuphine and Pethidine 86. 7 % <b>patients</b> <b>received</b> Tramadol and 13. 3 % <b>patients</b> <b>received</b> Ketorolac. 0. 6 % <b>patients</b> did not <b>receive</b> any analgesic in the day of operation.

5|$|On 17 November, Major General Andrija Rašeta, the {{commander}} of the JNA 5th (Zagreb) Military District, notified the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) that the JNA accepted in principle the quick evacuation of vulnerable persons from Vukovar. At the time, it was estimated that there were about 400 people trapped in the city's hospital, but the actual number was later discovered to be about 450. This included about 40 <b>patients</b> <b>receiving</b> treatment for severe injuries sustained over the preceding few days and about 360 patients recovering from wounds suffered earlier on. In addition to these individuals, some civilians had taken shelter in the hospital {{in the final days of}} the battle. They moved there expecting to be evacuated from the city, even though the hospital itself was subjected to daily artillery attack. Furthermore, a number of Croatian troops took refuge in the hospital posing as patients or staff.|$|E

40|$|Retrospectively, we {{analyzed}} {{the use of}} blood products in Oncological Clinic of Clinical Center Nis in the period November 1 st 2007 -November 1 st 2008, and also {{the influence of the}} treatment on degree of anemia and thrombocytopenia and use of blood products. None of the <b>patients</b> <b>received</b> the whole blood. In this period, 324 <b>patients</b> <b>received</b> the transfusion of blood components, 302 <b>patients</b> <b>received</b> 983 units of red cells (red blood cell concentrate, resuspended, washed, filtered), 17 <b>patients</b> <b>received</b> 5050 ml of platelets (single-donor concentrate or pooled platelet concentrate) and 5 <b>patients</b> <b>received</b> 2200 ml of fresh frozen plasma.
