Internal audit of 5 <b>S</b> <b>Quality</b> (IAQ) has been introduced to ensure the organization can assess its strength and areas for improvement. This study attempt to measure the organizational factors that influence the effectiveness of internal audit of 5 <b>S</b> <b>Quality</b> such as number of resources, auditor competencies and audit report, as well as looking at how these factors give impact towards company operational performance. The questionnaire were administered to head of audit and internal auditor in Malaysian private companies. Our hypotheses {{on the impact of}} organizational factors (resources adequacy, staff competency and report quality) to the effectiveness of internal audit of 5 <b>S</b> <b>quality</b> are all positive. In addition, the results also show significant perception by internal auditors that an effective internal audit of 5 <b>S</b> <b>quality</b> can help influencing company operational performance...|$|R
