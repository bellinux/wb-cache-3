5|$|Early in its duration, Hurricane Florence {{produced}} large swells {{that affected}} the East Coast of the United States. Rip currents caused three deaths due to drowning in North Carolina, {{all in the}} southern portion of the state. Seven other <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> rescue, {{and at least two}} beaches were closed. Florence contributed to a locally high number of rip current-related deaths in 2000; in response, the National Weather Service office in Wilmington implemented a new rip current warning system for the summer of 2001.|$|E
5|$|Studios {{found their}} way around the {{restrictions}} and published increasingly racy imagery. Ultimately this backfired in 1934 when a billboard in Philadelphia was placed outside the home of Cardinal Dennis Dougherty. Severely offended, Dougherty took his revenge by helping to launch the motion-picture boycott which would later facilitate enforcement of the Code. A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned in the Code itself was {{the notion that the}} common <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> to be saved from themselves by the more refined cultural elite.Massey, pg. 71.|$|E
5|$|On St. Croix, waves up to 15ft (4.5m) from Omar sank about 47 boats, {{leading to}} a large oil spill around the islands. About 400 ships broke lose from the docks, 200 of which lost their anchors. Omar {{produced}} upwards of 7in (177.8mm) of rain on the island within a 24‑hour span. Although St. Croix was brushed by the eyewall, sustained winds reached 53mph (85km/h) with gusts to 72mph (116km/h). Three <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink. Most of the islands 55,000 residents were without power as over 100 utility poles were destroyed. Damages on the island were estimated at $700,000 with another $1million in clean-up costs. St. Thomas, {{one of the hardest}} hit islands, was left completely without power {{in the wake of the}} hurricane. All of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were either on the ground or without power. Damages on the island totaled to $5.3million.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm was}} {{initially}} expected {{to move into}} the Gulf of Mexico and affect people recovering from hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in the previous year, which caused hundreds of billion in damage and left thousands of houses damaged or destroyed. There were initial fears that Ernesto would make landfall days after Hurricane Katrina's one-year anniversary, and that the levees in New Orleans {{might not be able to}} withstand a strong storm surge. Officials in New Orleans prepared buses and trains in the event that <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> to evacuate but could not. A possible path over the Gulf of Mexico oil fields, as well as tension with Iran, caused the price of oil to increase, although the prices receded when the threat of the storm receded.|$|E
5|$|A {{little after}} two {{o'clock in the}} afternoon, Victorio and his Apaches slowly {{approached}} the springs. Victorio somehow sensed danger and halted his men. With the hostile Apaches in their sights appearing ready to bolt, the soldiers did not wait and opened fire on their own initiative; Victorio's men scattered and withdrew out of carbine range. Victorio's <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> water and believing that {{there were only a few}} soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon. Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm. The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed, Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains. Carpenter with his two companies remounted in pursuit until darkness halted the effort.|$|E

25|$|The notion for education-based {{workshops}} and displays developed {{out of a}} philosophical view; {{that the world was}} heading towards difficult times and that <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> to learn how to become more self-sufficient so that they would be less reliant on a system unable to provide spiritual and survivalist needs. If one was unable to access healthy food then the logical solution was to learn how to grow one's food. Nambassa was actively promoting widespread Counterculture, Sustainable living, Holistic health and environmentalism, 30 years before Green politics was integrated into mainstream popular culture.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August 1517, {{his first}} edition was {{released}} in the Old Belarusian (Old Ruthenian): “The Psalter”. “The Psalter” nearly comprises all, what was in other biblical books of Holy Scripture. “It contains everything <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> {{for the welfare of}} human life on earth.” Then he released a new book every two months (10 September, 6 October, 5 December, 2 January 1518, 9 January, 19 January). Then, on the 10th of August, he published four books at the same time. The culmination of his life's work was printing a translation of the Bible in twenty-two books during 1517 to 1519.|$|E
25|$|Ōkyo's {{first major}} {{commission}} came in 1768 from Yūjō, abbot of a temple in Ōtsu called Enman'in.

Ōkyo tried to find models for the people depicted in them, even for the shocking images such as a man being ripped in two by frightened bulls. His introduction to the work states that he believed that <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> to see reality, not imaginary images of Nirvana or Hell, if they were to truly believe in Buddhist principles.|$|E

25|$|Rousseau {{believed}} that the theatre took people away from the community, and replaced any patriotic, unifying spirit with artificial emotions. To have a prosperous state, Rousseau believed, <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> {{to work together and}} harmoniously. As an alternative to the theatre, Rousseau proposed open-air republican festivals, with a rich community atmosphere. One of Rousseau's pivotal points in the Letter is that customs, opinions and priorities which are common and well-accepted among all citizens should be those that make accepting laws in favour of respect, equality and harmony a pleasurable and natural experience. In other words, people have to share the concerns with legislators if a state is to be successful.|$|E
25|$|On 11 January 1554/5 Cleutin wrote a {{long letter}} to the Duke of Guise {{detailing}} the problems he perceived in Scotland that reduced revenue. The <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> to be ruled with a rod in the hand, desiring neither peace or justice. In frontier regions the heads of many families {{were no more than}} bandits, preying on Scots and English alike, of no value in peace or war. The many good islands were in poor estate, and French troops lightly armed in Scottish jacks would help the revenue of the Queen and Dowager. None of the Scottish fortresses would hold out for an hour against invasion, and he lacked men, a military engineer, wood, and lime for repairs.|$|E
25|$|One notable tactic was Kammhuber's {{offensive}} action. In {{keeping with}} the Luftwaffes defence by offensive action over enemy territory, Kammhuber suggested tracking bombers and attacking them as they took off from their bases in Britain. Hitler refused {{on the grounds that}} the German <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> to see the British bombers being brought down over Germany so as to be convinced they were being defended. After October 1941, the Luftwaffe stopped their mini offensive. Hitler's decision relieved Harris and Bomber Command. In 1940–1941 these intruders had been responsible for two-thirds of the RAF losses. The chance to wreak havoc on the bomber offensive was lost. In response, Kammhuber concentrated on building the Kammhuber Line.|$|E

25|$|In late 1905, Harry {{left the}} trio {{following}} {{an argument with}} Al. Harry had refused Al's request {{to take care of}} Joe Palmer, who was in a wheelchair, while he was dating. After Harry's departure, Al and Joe Palmer worked as a duo but were not particularly successful. By 1906 the two agreed to separate, and Jolson was on his own. Jolson became a regular at the Globe and Wigwam Theater in San Francisco, California, and remained successful nationwide as a vaudeville singer. He took up residence in San Francisco, saying the earthquake-devastated <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> someone to cheer them up. In 1908 Jolson, needing money for himself and his new wife, Henrietta, returned to New York. In 1909, Al's singing caught the attention of Lew Dockstader, the producer and star of Dockstader's Minstrels. Al accepted Dockstader's offer and became a regular blackface performer.|$|E
25|$|The Arabian Peninsula {{was largely}} arid and volcanic, making {{agriculture}} difficult except near oases or springs. Thus the Arabian landscape was dotted with {{towns and cities}} near those oases, two prominent of which were Mecca and Medina (then known as Yathrib). Communal life was essential for survival in desert conditions, as <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> support against the harsh environment and lifestyle. The tribal grouping was thus encouraged {{by the need to}} act as a unit. This unity was based on the bond of kinship by blood. People of Arabia were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly traveling {{from one place to another}} seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. The survival of nomads (or bedouins) was also partially dependent on raiding caravans or oases; thus they saw this as no crime. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many of the surrounding tribes.|$|E
