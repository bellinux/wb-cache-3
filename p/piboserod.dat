50|$|<b>Piboserod</b> is a {{selective}} 5-HT4 receptor antagonist which was marketed and manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) under the trade name Serlipet {{for the management}} of atrial fibrillation and irritable bowel syndrome. In 2007 the Norwegian company Bio-Medisinsk Innovasjon AS (BMI) completed a clinical phase II study to investigate the effect of <b>piboserod</b> in patients with chronic heart failure.|$|E
40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) is a {{naturally}} occurring excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS and a locally acting vasoactive signalling molecule with diverse {{effects in the}} human cardiovascular system. 5 -HT is suggested {{to be involved in}} the pathophysiological progression of heart failure (HF), due to previous studies indicating increased expression of 5 -HT 4 receptors in the left ventricle of failing hearts in both humans and animal models. In the human heart, stimulation of 5 -HT 4 receptors activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) and increases cAMP levels, thus activating a similar signalling pathway as the β-adrenoceptors, producing enhanced rate (chronotropic effect), force of contraction (inotropic effect) and hastening of contraction-relaxation cycle (lusitropic effect). New treatment of HF and atrial fibrillation with 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists has been suggested to be beneficial by recent studies. However, further development of 5 -HT 4 receptor ligands will require further studies of efficacy, as well as elimination of the potential harmful risk of hERG potassium channel binding causing QT prolongation with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia (TdP). With the aim of developing new 5 -HT 4 antagonists for further drug development, we have synthesised 19 novel acidic N-aryl sulfonamides based on three aromatic ring systems: Indole- 3 -carboxylic acid sulfonamides 5 - 8, 1, 4 -benzodioxane- 5 -carboxylic acid sulfonamides 13 - 19, and 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H-[1, 3]oxazino[3, 2 -a]indole- 10 -carboxylic acid (<b>piboserod)</b> sulfonamides 26 - 33. The new N-aryl sulfonamides were characterized by 1 H/ 13 C-NMR spectroscopy, HPLC analysis and the logarithmic distribution between phosphate buffer with pH 7. 4 and n-octanol (log Doct 7. 4). The compounds were also pharmacologically evaluated to determine h 5 -HT 4 (b) receptor binding affinity, in a [3 H]GR 113808 radioligand binding assay, and antagonist property, in an adenylyl cyclase assay. The reference compounds used were GR 113808 and SB 207266 (Piboserod®). The structure-affinity relationships were evaluated based on the various side-chain substituents introduced to the N-aryl sulfonamides. The <b>piboserod</b> sulfonamides and the benzodioxan sulfonamides seem to have higher affinity for the 5 -HT 4 receptor compared to the indole sulfonamides. The replacement of the hydrogen bond donor NH- in the indole ring by a hydrogen bond acceptor oxygen in the oxazino[3, 2 -a] ring of <b>piboserod</b> and in the benzodioxan ring, could be favourable for obtaining increased affinity for the 5 -HT 4 receptor, as indicated in earlier studies. Incorporating various side-chain groups to the <b>piboserod</b> and benzodioxan derivatives seem to alter the affinity for the 5 -HT 4 receptor, but increasing the side-chain length could not reveal any significant changes to the affinity. Electron withdrawing or electron donating side-chain groups seem to reduce the affinity for the receptor, compared to other substituents. More studies should be initiated to reveal any influence on the hydrophobic pocket and to the affinity for the 5 -HT 4 receptor, by using various substituents on N-aryl sulphonamides. Future studies should examine the hERG potassium channel affinity of the novel acidic N-aryl sulphonamides as well, since this will be critical for further clinical development...|$|E
40|$|The {{serotonin}} 4 receptor (5 -HT 4 receptor) {{is known}} to be involved in learning and memory. We evaluated {{for the first time the}} quantification of a novel 5 -HT 4 receptor radioligand, 11 C-SB 207145, for in vivo brain imaging with PET in humans. Methods: For evaluation of reproducibility, 6 subjects were scanned twice with 11 C-SB 207145 on the same day. A further 2 subjects were scanned before and after blocking with the selective 5 -HT 4 receptor inverse agonist <b>piboserod</b> (SB 207266). Arterial blood samples were drawn for the calculation of metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. Regions of interest were delineated automatically on the individual’s MR images coregistered to the PET images, and regional time–activity curves were extracted. Quantitative tracer kinetic modeling was investigated with 1 - and 2 -tissue-compartment models using plasma input functions and th...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The gut {{constitutes}} the main reservoir of the body&# 146;s serotonin. The latter has effects {{not only on}} colonic motility via activation of cholinergic or nitric oxide-dependent neurons {{but also on the}} modulation of sensation by excitation of intrinsic sensory neurons. The abundance of serotonin receptors within the enteric nervous system constituted a challenge, as the pharmacological intervention on these receptors could be the etiological treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). 5 -HT 3 and 5 -HT 4 are the main subtypes of serotonin receptors in the gut. Therapeutic blockade of 5 - HT 3 by alosetron in women with diarrhea- predominant IBS brought a revolution in the treatment of IBS. This drug acts both on colonic motility and the secretory function of the bowel but, despite the spectacular results, it had to be withdrawn due to 49 cases of ischemic colitis. 5 -HT 4 agonists have been used for the treatment of patients with constipation- prone IBS. In large comparative trials tegaserod was more effective than placebo although the therapeutic gain over placebo was small. Prucalopride is a potent 5 -HT 4 agonist but much concern has been raised by the report of carcinogenicity in animals. Other serotonergic modulators include <b>piboserod</b> (SB 207266) and MKC 733 but no clinical trials in humans are available. Sumatriptan, a 5 -HT 1 B/D agonist developed for the treatment of migraine, causes relaxation of the gastric fundus in man, but its intranasal administration limits its use. As abdominal pain {{constitutes the}} main complaint of IBS patients, future efforts must concentrate on medications acting on visceral hypersensivity.

30|$|Adrenergic {{receptor}} {{family has}} five major members, α 1, α 2, β 1, β 2 and β 3 receptors (Bang and Choi, 2015). And the 7 general 5 -HT receptor classes include {{a total of}} 14 known 5 -HT receptors, including 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 1 B, 5 -HT 1 D, 5 -HT 1 E, 5 -HT 1 F, 5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 2 B, 5 -HT 2 C, 5 -HT 3, 5 -HT 4, 5 -HT 5 A, 5 -HT 5 B, 5 -HT 6 and 5 -HT 7 receptors (Barnes and Sharp, 1999). We first selected other selective antagonists to assess which GPCRs antagonism of PBZ is responsible for HCV inhibition. Alfuzosin (a selective α 1 AR antagonist) (Wilde et al., 1993), atipamezole (a selective α 2 AR antagonist) (Vacher et al., 2010), and acebutolol (a βAR antagonist) (van den Meiracker et al., 1988), atenolol (a selective β 1 AR antagonist) (Baldwin et al., 1986) and (S)-timolol maleate (a β 1 AR and β 2 AR antagonist) (Weinstock et al., 1976) present no inhibition on HCV proliferation, suggesting HCV inhibition of PBZ is not correlated to its antagonism on adrenergic receptors (Figs.  1 A, 1 B and S 1 A). Similarly, agomelatine (a 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 2 C receptors antagonist) (Popoli, 2009), azasetron (a selective 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists) (Tsukagoshi, 1999), <b>piboserod</b> (a selective 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonist) (Brattelid et al., 2004), SB 742457 (a selective 5 -HT 6 receptor antagonist) (Upton et al., 2008) and SB 269970 (a selective 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonist) (Mahe et al., 2004) do not display HCV inhibition till 20  μmol/L (Figs.  1 A, 1 C and S 1 B). SB 699551, which is a selective 5 -HT 5 A receptor antagonist (Corbett et al., 2005), also did not present anti-HCV activity at the concentration with no cytotoxicity (Fig. S 1 C). Together hints the antagonism of 5 -HT 2 AR by PBZ is responsible for HCV inhibition.|$|E
