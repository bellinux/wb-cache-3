50|$|A <b>pan</b> <b>head,</b> {{also called}} <b>pan</b> and tilt <b>head,</b> allows {{independent}} {{rotation of the}} camera {{about two or three}} perpendicular axes, which normally do not intersect. Typical <b>pan</b> <b>heads</b> have lockable levers for each axis, a scale marked in degrees at least for the vertical axis, and one or more spirit levels. This construction is significantly more complicated than that of a ball head.|$|R

50|$|Some {{specialist}} <b>pan</b> <b>heads,</b> {{such as the}} Induro PHQ series, {{offer up}} to five axes of rotation, {{two of them in}} parallel with the other axes.|$|R
50|$|A geared <b>head</b> takes a <b>pan</b> and tilt <b>head</b> {{and adds}} gears {{to each of}} the axes. They {{typically}} have a release on each axis to allow for rough positioning the camera, and geared controls then allow small adjustments to finesse composition. They are typically heavier than ball or <b>pan</b> <b>heads</b> due to the weight of the mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pan</b> <b>heads</b> can be {{used for}} panoramas, but suffer from the {{deficiency}} that the axes of rotation normally do not go through the entrance pupil of the lens and thus can give rise to problems with parallax. A better choice for panoramas is a custom-built panoramic tripod head.|$|R

50|$|They {{are almost}} always {{provided}} with a #2 Phillips drive. Sometimes a Torx drive is used instead. Both Phillips and Torx patterns may also be combined with a slot for a flat-blade screwdriver. Usually they are provided with a 1/4 in (0.25 in) flanged hex head. Non-standard metricized 5.5 mm flanged hex heads can also be encountered. Also common are <b>pan</b> <b>head</b> screws - a low disk with a chamfered outer edge. Because they are used in places where high torque is not required and easy removal and replacement may be desirable (such as on the side panels of the PC case), they are frequently available as thumbscrews with larger, knurled heads that can be removed with one's fingers or tools.|$|R
5000|$|The {{international}} backlash to Banton's violently anti-homosexual [...] "Boom Bye-Bye", and {{the reality}} of Kingston's violence which saw the deaths of deejays <b>Pan</b> <b>Head</b> and Dirtsman saw another shift, this time back towards Rastafari and cultural themes, with several of the hardcore slack ragga artists finding religion, and the [...] "conscious ragga" [...] scene becoming an increasingly popular movement. A new generation of singers and deejays emerged that harked back to the roots reggae era, notably Garnett Silk, Tony Rebel, Sanchez, Luciano, Anthony B and Sizzla. Some popular deejays, most prominently Buju Banton and Capleton, began to cite Rastafari and turn their lyrics and music in a more conscious, rootsy direction. Many modern dancehall Rasta artists identify with Bobo Ashanti.|$|R

Conclusions: The 1 / 4 " ring does what‚Äôs commonly imagined, the upgrades to the Goodtime over the years are not merely cosmetic, and the Bacon ring‚Äôs biggest effect is to damp head ringing and suppress high harmonics. Detailed comparisons of the new Goodtimes with and without the Bacon ring suggest simple physics accounts of the differences. Conjectured mechanisms are energy dissipation by the vibrations of the Bacon horizontal flange, the added radial stiffness due to that flange, and the friction of air passing through the narrow flange-head gap...|$|R
