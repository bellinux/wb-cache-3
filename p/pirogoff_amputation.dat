40|$|Introduction: A gunshot injury {{can cause}} {{extended}} soft-tissue injury and traumatic contamination leading to infection. The {{aim of the}} <b>Pirogoff</b> <b>amputation</b> is to eliminate infection and remove as little of the extremity as possible. This {{will result in a}} functional stump with tissues capable of tolerating weight-bearing stress...|$|E
30|$|In 2000, Stiebel et al. {{described}} a sensate calcaneal flap in traumatic leg amputations. The authors performed a pedicled calcaneal flap with the calcaneum turned on at a 90 ° in its longitudinal axis and {{fixed to the}} tibia as in <b>Pirogoff</b> <b>amputation</b> [14]. They fixed the calcaneum to the tibia in an elegant way using two crossed lag screws [14].|$|E

Methods: Six patients with diabetic foot infections were operated on by the National University Hospital (NUH) diabetic foot team in Singapore between November 2011 and January 2012. All patients underwent a modified <b>Pirogoff’s</b> <b>amputation</b> for diabetic foot infections. Inclusion criteria included the presence of a palpable posterior tibial pulse, ankle brachial index (ABI) of more than 0. 7, and distal infections not extending proximally beyond the midfoot level. Clinical parameters such as presence of pulses and ABI were recorded. Preoperative blood tests performed included a glycated hemoglobin level, hemoglobin, total white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, and creatinine levels. All patients were subjected to 14 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy postoperatively and were followed up for a minimum of 10 months. Results: All six patients had good wound healing. Tibio-calcaneal arthrodesis of the stump was achieved in all cases by 6 months postoperatively. All patients were able to walk with the prosthesis. Conclusions: The modified <b>Pirogoff’s</b> <b>amputation</b> has been found to show good results in carefully selecte...|$|R

However, {{in contrast to}} hind foot amputations, such as Syme and especially Boyd and <b>Pirogoff</b> <b>amputations,</b> acute or late complications related to the amputated stump are frequent with the various described methods [2].|$|R
