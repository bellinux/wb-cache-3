40|$|This study investigates how {{individual}} policy actors {{can influence}} <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> and become catalysis of change. Its main proposition is that actors who heavily influence <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> and become <b>agents</b> for change are necessarily involved in specific activities and demonstrate particular characteristics. The study employs {{the concept of}} 'policy entrepreneurship' to analyse an episode of <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> which occurred in Australia between 1992 and 1994. The study concludes that in performing certain functions policy entrepreneurs help to affect change, but in doing so are at once constrained and enabled by contextual forces.

40|$|Indifference is a {{class of}} methods {{that are used to}} control a reward based agent, by, for example, safely {{changing}} their reward or <b>policy,</b> or <b>making</b> the <b>agent</b> behave as if a certain outcome could never happen. These methods of control work even if the implications of the agent's reward are otherwise not fully understood. Though they all come out of similar ideas, indifference techniques can be classified as way of achieving one or more of three distinct goals: rewards dependent on certain events (with no motivation for the agent to manipulate the probability of those events), effective disbelief that an event will ever occur, and seamless transition from one behaviour to another. There are five basic methods to achieve these three goals. This paper classifies and analyses these methods on POMDPs (though the methods are highly portable to other agent designs), and establishes their uses, strengths, and limitations. It aims to make the tools of indifference generally accessible and usable to agent designers...|$|R

50|$|<b>Policy</b> <b>making</b> in the EU can be {{extremely}} complex. It {{has been suggested that}} the <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> process is too densely populated with veto players (i.e. actors whose agreement is necessary for a policy to be adopted) for any single actor or group of actors (including the EU’s member states) to consistently control the direction of <b>policy</b> <b>making.</b> The result in environmental <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> has been widely depicted as being especially unpredictable, unstable and at times even chaotic. However, the European Commission, as a key player in the <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> process, has under pressure to develop ‘standard operating procedures’ for processing policy. This has led to a number of changes in <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> processes in recent years, including: adopting minimum standards of consultation; the impact assessment of all major policy proposals; and the earlier publication of its work programmes.|$|R

40|$|Macroeconomic <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> is {{a complex}} {{systematic}} process, which requires in-depth understanding of current economic situation, prediction of future economic trend, and proper policy evaluation measurements. Instruments of early warning, and policy simulation are often employed in macroeconomic <b>policy</b> <b>making.</b> However, {{no matter how well}} it is developed, any single instrument is often inadequate for <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> support, because of the gap between theories and practice. In this paper, macroeconomic early warning theories are integrated with the policy decision support concepts. Three stages are involved in the macroeconomic <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> process: monitoring, forecasting, and policy simulation. Based on this idea, an integrated alert–response framework is proposed with one corresponding module for each stage. Within this framework, not only information can be exchanged freely among these modules, but the monitoring–forecasting–simulation process can run smoothly to realize timeliness and efficient <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> support. Moreover, a knowledge base is incorporated into the framework to support the economic early warning and <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> support process. Therefore, this framework is featured in integration and a final all-round report, including current economic status, future trend prediction, <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> suggestions, external information, and expert opinions, can be generated. An implementation of this framework was developed for China's macroeconomic adjustment and has been put into practice since early 2006.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} nature and {{effectiveness}} of the New Labour government’s attempt to modernise <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> in Britain. This government had developed and sought to implement a new concept of modernised policymaking, claiming that it represented a significant advance on previous efforts to transform policymaking. The principles, logic and ambition of this new form of modernised policymaking were set out clearly {{in a number of}} government publications (Cabinet Office, 1999 a; Cabinet Office, 1999 b). The objectives of this study are, firstly, to explore and assess the nature of this new concept of <b>policy</b> <b>making,</b> contextualising its claims by reference to the long history of debates about policy-making and modernisation in Britain. Secondly, it will investigate the use of this new form of <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> through a case study. The data collected will be subjected to a detailed analysis to assess {{the extent to which the}} development of the 2009 Migration Impact Fund constituted an example of modernised <b>policy</b> <b>making,</b> as conceived by the New Labour government. The ideas contained in the Asymmetrical Power model advanced by Marsh (2003) are used to inform the understanding of the policy setting in which the case occurred. To construct the case study, multiple methods of data collection are used to form a thick narrative that covers a five-year period. This narrative begins with the <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> that took place in anticipation of new migration in the lead up to the enactment of the 2003 Treaty of Accession and culminates in an explanation of how the 2009 Migration Impact Fund was designed and implemented. The case study is then subjected to a detailed analysis designed to generate precise data about the extent to which the nine features of modernised <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> are present; how modernised <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> presents at different points in the case; the extent to which the features of modernised <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> operated synergistically; and the different explanations for the <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> that was observed in the case study. These are used to then come to a statement as to whether <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> in this case was completely modernised; significantly modernised; not particularly modernised; or not modernised. The investigation found that <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> in this case was not particularly modernised. This was so because although all elements of modernised <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> was observed to be consistently present throughout the case, directive and bargaining based <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> were predominant at all crucial points rather than modernised <b>policy</b> <b>making.</b> The investigation showed that <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> operated, for better or worse, in a traditional way with core government’s commitment to increased labour mobility around Europe shaping the response of policy makers. As well, the investigation raised questions about how we may research and come to understand the impact of modernisation reforms when looking at <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> with a high level of detail. This is because the modernised <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> observed was not identified to be a direct result of the Modernising Government reforms, something that calls for further research to better ascertain the basis of choices made by policy makers. Overall, the case study findings confirm the predominant conclusions about New Labour’s efforts to modernise <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> (see for example Massey & Pyper, 2005; Newman, 2005). This is that there was a distinct gap between the rhetoric and practice of policymaking in this period which fundamentally served to continue the advance of business orientated approaches to public administration within the traditional political context of British <b>policy</b> <b>making...</b>|$|R

Objectives: This study intended to explore and describe factors effecting on Involvement of nurse leaders in <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> for nursing in Iran. Method: A qualitative design involving face-to-face, semi-structured interviews by 20 nurse leaders and physicians who had key positions in <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> for nursing had been audio taped and transcribed. Using a conventional content analysis approach, data were analyzed. Results: After open coding and categorizing data three main categories created; include: performance of nurses and nurse leaders; opportunities face to nurse leaders; and conditions governing the healthcare system. Conclusion: Some factors effecting involvement of nurse leaders in <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> for nursing in Iran do not have wide differences with other studies in this field.   Although many factors had been mentioned in this study, frequency of codes showed that performance of nurses and nurse leaders acted as a barrier and have had the most effects on involvement.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{environmental}} <b>policy</b> <b>making,</b> {{the objectives}} {{are part of}} the decision-making problem. <b>Policy</b> <b>making</b> for sustainable development involves problems with lack of clear and definitive problem formulation which are to be solved by various stakeholders who judge the solutions with different values. In addition, risks and uncertainties involving future events and risks and uncertainties associated to the costs, benefits or effectiveness of a given policy add complexity to the decision making. Because of these characteristics, modeling and assessment methods alone are not enough to provide an adequate decision making support. In other words, <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> involves the existence of “wicked problems.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the {{successes and failures}} of different approaches to environmental <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> in contexts where the level of conflict are significant, both in intensity and complexity. In this thesis the term <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> is used to cover three elements: {{the way that a}} policy is formulated, the decision making process to select the policy instruments, {{and the nature of the}} policy instruments used or proposed to be used. The research question here is “what <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> approach is most likely to succeed in highly contested contexts where levels of conflict are significant, both in intensity and complexity?” This research is built on the key proposition that some <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> approaches are, by their nature, better suited to highly contested contexts than others. The communicative/deliberative turn in planning was the starting theoretical framework for understanding how <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> can be carried out in highly contested contexts. It was argued that this framework has great value in understanding the processes involved in dealing with conflict, but that there are shortcomings. In particular, conflict is seen largely as a social problem, but conflict in environmental <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> often involves so-called wicked problems, where the conflict is deeper, more complex and involving longer timeframes than most planning conflicts. This thesis constructs a framework that describes the nature of conflict, with three broad themes being defined: social, governance, and science and information. It is argued that conflict is most likely where the resources at the centre of the conflict are scarce. Three types of scarcity are identified — decreasing quantity of a resource, increasing demand on a resource, and reducing quality of a resource. Four broad <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> approaches are defined: * The traditional expert-driven approach — a highly centralised approach dominated by the expert regulators using predominately science-based technical and statutory policy mechanisms; * The ecological modern approach — a more participative but still largely sciencebased approach, favouring the use of either market-based or voluntary policy mechanisms; * The collaborative approach — a highly participative form of <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> that does not necessarily favour a particular type of policy mechanism; and * The adaptive–collaborative approach — a special case of collaborative <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> where adaptive management measures are adopted to deal with the uncertainty of the science and information. These four approaches are analysed for their likely capacity to be successful in contexts where conflict is significant, and it is proposed that the first two are unlikely to be successful, whereas the two collaborative approaches, especially the adaptive– collaborative approach, would be successful where all the types of conflict are present. A qualitative multiple case study methodology was adopted to address the research question and to test the finding of the literature review, focusing primarily on the <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> of Western Australian (WA) Environmental Protection Authority (EPA - the peak environmental agency in WA). A specific methodology to determine <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> success or failure (evaluation) has been developed and applied in this study, involving the use of four evaluation criteria. The review of <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> by the EPA showed that whilst its <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> in cases where conflict was low were successful, it failed in cases where conflict was significant. It was noted that in all cases the <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> approaches adopted were either traditional expert– driven or ecological modern and not either of the two collaborative approaches, which, it was noted, was consistent with the finding of the literature review and would explain the policy failures in cases where conflict was significant. It was argued that recent <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> of the EPA shows some promise in dealing with conflict. This was because it has developed its Environmental Protection Policies (EPPs) more collaboratively, involving an additional complementary policy: the EPP sets high level objectives and deals with specific non–negotiable issues; and the more prescriptive implementation policy contains the detailed policy and management measures that would achieve the objectives in the EPP. These are called concurrent–complementary policies. A key part of this thesis is an in–depth analysis of a particular <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> exercise (major case study) set in a context where the three elements of conflict were significant, and the three resource scarcity types were present. The case study was Cockburn Sound, a large marine embayment approximately 20 kms south of Perth. Two concurrent–complementary policies were developed, and it was shown that the <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> approach of the implementation policy was adaptive–collaborative, and it was evaluated as being successful on all the four criteria. It was also noted that the draft EPP was a traditional expert–driven policy approach (although with a much improved level of participation) and that, it was evaluated as being unsuccessful on two of the four criteria — performance effectiveness and political support. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the broader implications for environmental <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> that can be drawn from this work, notably: that five <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> scenarios can be identified based on the nature and extent of conflict present, and recommendations made as to which <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> approach should be applied in each scenario...|$|R
