50|$|The URM-1 {{consists}} of a liquid oxygen tank at the top, followed by an intertank structure containing flight control and telemetry equipment, with the kerosene tank below that. At {{the base of the}} module is a <b>propulsion</b> <b>bay</b> containing engine gimballing equipment for vehicle pitch and yaw and thrusters for roll control.|$|E
50|$|A {{section of}} the <b>propulsion</b> <b>bay,</b> engines and {{equipment}} {{can be found at}} the Solway Aviation Museum, Carlisle Lake District Airport. Only a few miles from the Spadeadam testing site, the museum carries many exhibits, photographs and models of the Blue Streak programme, having inherited the original Spadeadam collection that used to be displayed on site.|$|E
50|$|After {{the stage}} is exhausted, the engine module is jettisoned for reentry. At {{a certain point in}} the descent, Adeline would pull up using its small {{winglets}} and steer itself towards a runway whilst gliding. As it approaches the runway, landing gear and two small pusher configuration propellers would be deployed to perform a powered horizontal landing. The concept would allow for reusing 80% of the stages economic value: the engine, avionics and <b>propulsion</b> <b>bay.</b> The engines could be re-flown about 10 to 20 times. The approach could have several advantages over the SpaceX technology under development, specifically it avoids the high stresses their booster engines experience during deceleration for a vertical landing and for a geostationary flight it would only require around 2,000 kg of fuel to return safely to the ground against an estimated 35,000 kg for SpaceX.|$|E
50|$|The Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) was an {{expendable}} cargo spacecraft. Each vehicle {{consisted of}} two distinct sections, the systems bus and the integrated cargo carrier. The system bus contained the ATV's <b>propulsion</b> system, avionics <b>bays,</b> and solar arrays; it was principally used following the vehicle's detachment from the Ariane 5 launcher to automatically traverse the remaining distance and dock with the ISS, the system bus would be inaccessible to the astronauts on board. The integrated cargo carrier consisted of a pressurised module, external bays for fluid and gas cargoes, further avionics and rendezvous sensors, and the docking mechanism. The primary structure of the ATV is protected by a meteorite and debris protection system.|$|R
50|$|The Ariane 4 was the {{ultimate}} development from the preceding members of the Ariane rocket family. Compared with the Ariane 2 and 3, the Ariane 4 featured a stretched first (by 61 per cent) and third stages, a strengthened structure, new <b>propulsion</b> <b>bay</b> layouts, new avionics, and the SPELDA (Structure Porteuse Externe de Lancement Double Ariane) dual-payload carrier. The basic 40 version did not employ any strap-on motors, while the Ariane 42L, 44L, 42P, 44P, and 44LP variants all used various combinations of solid and liquid boosters. Originally designed to place 2-4.2 tonne payloads in geostationary orbit, the six Ariane 4 variants, aided by strap-on boosters, enabled the launch of payloads in excess of 4.9 tonnes on several occasions. According to Harvey, the Ariane 4 launcher had reduced the launch costs per kilo by 55 per cent {{in comparison to the}} original Ariane 1.|$|E
