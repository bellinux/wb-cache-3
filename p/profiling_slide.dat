Such studies assume trait differences in monozygous (MZ) twins {{are due to}} environmental factors and those in dizygous (DZ) twins are due to both genetic and environmental factors. This study quantitated facial profiles of twins using Fourier equations, determining their value in profile analysis and {{the assessment of the}} genetic contribution to facial shape. Standardized <b>profile</b> <b>slide</b> photographs of 79 pairs of 4 - 6 year-old twins (37 MZ pairs, 42 DZ pairs) were scanned and x and y coordinates were extracted from each profile using sellion and Camper's plane as references. The coordinates were subjected to Fourier analysis and the normalised vertex projection coefficients were studied. The means of the differences between coefficients for MZ co-twins did not differ significantly from that of DZ co-twins, although the DZ group showed higher mean differences in the higher harmonics. Subjective examination of superimposed reconstructions showed wider variation between DZ co-twins than MZ co-twins. Correct classification of twins by discriminant function analysis using Fourier coefficients was similar for both groups (MZ: 70. 3 %; DZ: 73. 8 %). Fourier analysis could quantitate facial profiles of young children and differentiate some details, but was unable to discriminate between genetic and environmental influences, and any possible interactions between these influences, on their overall facial profiles at this developmental stage.

To {{determine}} subglacial topography {{and internal}} {{features of the}} Fourcade Glacier on King George Island in Antarctica, helicopter-borne and ground-towed ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data were recorded along four profiles in November 2006. Signaturedeconvolution, f-kmigrationvelocity analysis, andfinite-difference depthmigration applied to the mixed-phase, single-channel, ground-towed data, were effective in increasing vertical resolution, obtaining the velocity function, and yielding clear depth images, respectively. For the helicopter-borne GPR, migration velocities were obtained as root-mean-squared velocities in a two-layer model of air and ice. The radar sections show rugged subglacial topography, englacial sliding surfaces, and localised scattering noise. The maximum depth to the basement is over 79 m in the subglacial valley adjacent to the south-eastern slope of the divide ridge between Fourcade and Moczydlowski Glaciers.
