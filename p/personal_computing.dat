5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the <b>personal</b> <b>computing</b> revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E

5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and <b>personal</b> <b>computing</b> was just barely on the horizon.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an architecture for a serverless distributed file system {{that does not}} assume mutual trust among the client computers. The system provides security, availability, and reliability by distributing multiple encrypted replicas of each file among the client machines. To assess the feasibility of deploying this system on an existing desktop infrastructure, we measure and analyze a large set of client machines in a commercial environment. In particular, we measure and report results on disk usage and content; file activity; and machine uptimes, lifetimes, and loads. We conclude that the measured desklop infrastructure would passably support our proposed system, providing availability {{on the order of}} one unfilled file request per user per thousand days.

40|$|As anybody knows, {{there is}} a {{fundamental}} difference between the newest CAD system and the conventional Numerical Control. As a matter of fact, almost every CAD Software allows programmers to use parametric 2 D or 3 D curves, whereas standard Numerical Control cannot perform anything more than linear or circular interpolations. NURBS are the most successful among all the proposed parametric curves, since they allow us to give an exact uniform expression to both the analytical and the free form curves. Nevertheless, this typical characteristic nowadays entails that in CAM systems a tool path is rounded down using a small movements and imposing a maximum acceptable gap. This approach leads up to a number of problems of machining quality and wastes machining time.
