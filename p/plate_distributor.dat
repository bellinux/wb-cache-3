Axial and radial dispersion coefficients and mixing times were determined in tap water for superficial gas velocities in the range 0. 6 - 5. 36 cm/s.

The object size and density differ from those of the inert solids that conform the bed. Examples of objects moving in a bubbling fluidized bed include passive particles, catalysts and reactants. The rotation modifies the bed dynamics in the surroundings of the distributor and affects the motion of the object within the bed. A set of experiments was carried out in a lab-scale cylindrical bed, equipped with a perforated <b>plate</b> <b>distributor</b> that can rotate at around 1 Hz, for different bed aspect ratios, gas velocities, and object characteristics. Sizes were far larger than that of the solids of the dense phase and densities ranged from half the bed density to values around it.

40|$|Fluidized bed dryers (FBDs) {{are used}} in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry to remove excess moisture from granule prior to tablet formation. As granule moisture content is reduced from its initial to final state, the velocity required to fully fluidize the granule decreases and the bed voidage decreases. The change in these fluidization properties are attributed to the decrease in the interparticle force load created by a reduction in liquid bridging as moisture is removed. During constant velocity drying, these fluidization properties result in a bubbling fluidization state, which evolves into a bubble coalescing regime as drying proceeds. This behaviour was identifiable using pressure fluctuation time-series analysis techniques. Distributor design studies using dry and wet granule in a conical fluidized bed suggest that the punched plate design limits bubble coalescence when compared to the perforated plate and Dutch weave mesh designs. Furthermore, the Dutch weave results in extensive segregation, which is undesirable from a fluidization perspective. Local drying hydrodynamic measurements using x-ray densitometry found that the punched and perforated plates generate a centralized bubbling core region during drying with a defluidized bed periphery. This fluidized core region grows as drying proceeds until the defluidized region disappears. Under the same operating conditions, a porous <b>plate</b> <b>distributor</b> creates extensive channelling and defluidization across the entire bed cross-section during the constant rate period of drying. These poor fluidization characteristics are a result of the porous plate introducing the gas into the bed as a fine dispersion. Lastly, the hydrodynamics associated with the conical vessel geometry improves the circulation and mixing patterns in fluidized bed dryers. This is especially the case in the entry region of the conical bed where the high inlet gas velocity prevents defluidization around the periphery of the bed. The straight walled geometry of the cylindrical bed resulted in defluidization in this area. As a result, the hydrodynamics associated with bubbling differ significantly between the geometries over the course of drying...|$|E

However, in fluidized bed chemical reactors axial gas back mixing can strongly decrease the conversion and selectivity. By insertion of membranes in fluidized beds large improvements in conversion and selectivity can be achieved, firstly by optimizing axial concentration profiles via distributive feeding {{of one of the}} reactants or selective withdrawal of one of the products, and secondly, by decreasing the effective axial dispersion via compartmentalization of the fluidized bed. Moreover, insertion of membrane bundles in a suitable configuration impedes bubble growth, thereby reducing reactant by-pass via rapidly rising large bubbles. In this work the influence of the presence and configuration of membrane bundles and the effect of gas addition via the membranes on the effective axial dispersion was studied experimentally. Steady state concentration profiles were measured where a CO 2 -tracer was injected at different locations through a probe (point injection) or via the membranes (line injection) into a square fluidized bed (0. 15 m × 0. 15 m × 0. 95 m) containing glass particles (75 - 110 µ m, 2550 kg/m 3) fluidized with nitrogen distributed via a porous plate. Different bed configurations, viz. without internals, with vertical or horizontal membrane bundles were investigated and the effects of overall fluidization velocity and gas flow ratio of gas fed through the membrane bundles and the porous <b>plate</b> <b>distributor</b> were studied. Experimental results revealed that the insertion of vertical and horizontal membrane bundles decreases the effective axial dispersion considerably compared to a bed without internals. The point injection experiments indicated the importance of a non-uniform lateral emulsion phase velocity profile. The line injection experiments clearly pointed out the importance of bubble-to-emulsion phase mass transfer limitations. Gas addition through the membrane bundles decreases the effective axial gas dispersion enormously by almost annihilating the solids down flow along the walls and by decreasing the average bubble size and bubble fraction. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the distributor configuration on the mass transfer and bubble sizes in a 2 -D FBR was studied for two types of distributor configurations: A novel multi-vortex (MV) distributor with tuyéres directed vertically and horizontally at different heights. A standard perforated <b>plate</b> <b>distributor</b> (baseline). The ozone decomposition reaction over FCC catalyst {{was used as an}} indirect meas-ure of the interphase mass transfer in the bed. The ranged between 0. 1 m/s and 0. 35 m/s, with air as a fluidizing medium at ambient conditions. The MV distributor displayed a significant improvement in the conversion cies (χmeasured / χPFR). For all velocities an improvement of between 0 % and 30 % was measured (average improvement of 14. 7 %). At Uo ≤ 0. 2 m/s the improvement distributed evenly about the mean improvement, with a minimum improvement of 10 %. The Uc for the respective distributors were determined using absolute pressure fluctuations (baseline distributor) and visual observations (MV distributor) and {{it was found that the}} Uc for the MV distributor was lower than that for the baseline: Uc Baceline = 0. 30 m/s. Uc MV distributor = 0. 25 m/s. The decrease in Uc indicated that the MV distributor induces faster onset of turbulent behaviour in the FBR which negates interphase mass transfer limitations in the FBR. The bubble sizes were measured visually and compared to a pressure signal decomposition technique. The bubble size growth for the MV distributor was estimated at. 14 times that of the baseline. Two models were compared to the experimental results, the Kunii-Levenspiel three-phase model and the Thompson generalized bubble-turbulent model. The fitting parameters showed that the mass transfer for the MV distributor is significantly larger than that of the baseline. In addition the MV distributor decreased the axial dispersion in the FBR as Uo → Uoo, which improved the reactor performance to that of an ideal PFR. This phenomenon was observed at Uo > 0. 33 m/s.

40|$|A {{particulate}} {{feeding system}} based on air flluidization principles was developed at the Thermal and Fluids Engineering Group at EESC-USP. The system is basically formed of a cylindrical chamber comprising two levels of fluid bed <b>distributor</b> <b>plates.</b> The performance of the system was addressed. Repeatability experiments were performed in order to check out {{for the possibility of}} solids feeding control through a sphere valve which controls the air feed rate. Silica sand particles of three different size were used, with mean diameters of 152, 287 and 484 µm. Experiments showed that the total particulate discharge depends on the primary air feeding rate, the distance between the exit of the feeding hopper and the primary air <b>distributor</b> <b>plate,</b> and the particulate diameter, but independs on the secondary air feeding rate. The system was observed to be of difficult control and showed poor repeatability. However, the system was found to be an excellent device for distributing the flow of solids throughout several discharge sections. For the operational conditions considered and air volumetric flowrates above 3 × 10 - 3 m³/s the deviation on the particulate mass flowrate through a given discharge section related to the average value through the four sections of the injector was always below 5 %...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. The South African coal {{industry}} produces a large quantity of coal per annum. The rejects from various unit operations, such as spirals, consist of fine coal that joins the plants tailings dam waste. As existing high quality resources become depleted, {{the need to}} improve recovery of this fine coal grows. This project investigates the use of a teetered bed separator (TBS); a hindered settling gravity concentration device for fine coal recovery. This device has proven successful in the United Kingdom and in Australian collieries for fine coal separation in the size range between 2 mm and 0. 3 mm. It has also been used for decades as a classifying device for silica sand and tin. The TBS operates in the size range of water-only cyclones and spiral concentrators, and could potentially be used to separate a broader size range of coal fines so as to offer a lower footprint device for the fines recovery section of a plant. Spiral concentrators cannot always be operated efficiently at a separating specific gravity of lower than 1. 6; a TBS may also extend the density range for separation and thus improve recovery. The objective of this project was to gain a full understanding of the TBS from fundamental particle interaction and develop a lab scale unit, which is capable of separation to about 0. 1 mm at optimum conditions. This involved the development of design parameters based on the various <b>distributor</b> <b>plates</b> and flow pattern modelling. The hydrodynamics of the separator were investigated using the Eulerian-Eulerian modelling approach of commercial CFD package, Fluent 6. 1. Seven <b>distributor</b> <b>plates</b> of varying aperture size and geometric arrangement were considered. Coal and shale particles, sized between 2 mm and 0. 038 mm with a specific gravity (SG) range of 1. 2 to 2. 0, were separated using the laboratory scale unit. The results of both the simulations and the laboratory tests were then compared. The simulations revealed that Plate 3 was the best option for implementation. It had an even upward velocity profile compared to the other plates, with minimum wall effects and disturbances. The upward water flow rate (teeter water) was varied experimentally and the composition of the teeter bed, underflow and overflow were analysed using 1. 5, 2 and Smm cubic density tracers with an SG range of 1. 2 - 2. 0. Analysis of the partition curves of the <b>distributor</b> <b>plates</b> revealed that Plate 3 had the lowest Ecart Probable (Ep) and cut- point densities. The comparison of simulated results and experimental results show that the simulator could predict the <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> design with the lowest Ep in practical tests. The simulator could be beneficial when optimising an industrial scale unit, by allowing prediction of improved segregation patterns and thus separation efficiency...|$|R
