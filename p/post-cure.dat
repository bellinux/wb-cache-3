40|$|Abstract. The polymer {{composites}} {{consist of}} phenolic resin, natural graphite, carbon fiber and copper powder, are fabricated by hot compression moulding or compression moulding followed by <b>post-curing.</b> The density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites are analyzed {{to determine the}} influences of <b>post-curing</b> temperature and preparing method on the physical, electrical and mechanical properties of composites. It is found that the density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites increase with increasing <b>post-curing</b> temperature for composites prepared by compression moulding followed by <b>post-curing.</b> The flexural strength is more strongly dependent on <b>post-curing</b> temperature. At 170 ℃, the density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites were 1. 85 g/cm 3, 2. 94 × 103 S/m and 40 MPa respectively. The cross-linking skeleton structure well established in the composites could be {{the main reason for}} the largely increasing of flexural strength as <b>post-curing</b> temperature increases.

50|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{applying}} pressure to the green tire in a mold in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the green tire is automatically transferred onto the lower mold bead seat, a rubber bladder is inserted into the green tire, and the mold closes while the bladder inflates. As the mold closes and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the green tire flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger tires cure in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the mold. The tire may be placed on a PCI, or <b>post-cure</b> inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic curing press types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.|$|E

The load increased linearly up to the maximum pull-out load, when the load reached the critical load, beyond which the load reduced rapidly under all <b>post-cure</b> conditions. Shear debonding occurred in the fiber/matrix interface at the maximum pull-out load. The maximum load increased with a longer embedded length under all <b>post-cure</b> conditions.

The mechanical and morphological properties of epoxy/ OMMT nanocompositeE were studied by flexural tests, fracture toughness (SENB), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The flexural modulus of epoxy was improved significantly by the incorporation of OMMT. This is attributed to the reinforcement and exfoliation/intercalation of the OMMT.

40|$|Analytical, numerical, and {{experimental}} modeling methods are presented to predict deformation after the cure process of thin unsymmetric laminates for piezoelectric actuation.

The present work has improved durability under cycled operation by thermal <b>post-curing</b> of cross-linked polybenzimidazole (PBI) -based membranes. The membranes were dried over 1, 2 and 3 h at 250 degrees C under air. Ex-situ experiments proved an increase in stability by <b>post-curing.</b> The liquid uptake and swelling in phosphoric acid increased with longer curing periods. The effect of thermal treatments on cycle stability, lifetime and begin-of-life performance of the membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) was investigated. Longer <b>post-curing</b> periods of the membranes had no influence on the MEAs' begin-of-life performance and constant current behavior over 2300 h. However, the 3 h post-cured MEAs showed enhanced cycle stability. Post-mortem analysis was carried out to identify the occurring degradation mechanisms. While a significant loss of phosphoric acid and a reduction of electrochemical surface activity on the cathode were observed for both post-cured MEAs, the 3 h dried membrane sample had a significantly higher resistance against pinhole formation during the long term test. Altogether, this work presents thermal <b>post-curing</b> as a promising method for the reduction of degradation determining effects in fuel cell membranes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract Physical {{property}} enhancement in light-cured resin composites from <b>post-cure</b> heating {{is attributed}} to free radicals created during initial photocuring, the number of which decreases following initial light-curing.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the microhardness test, three different groups were prepared in accordance with the <b>post-cure</b> treatments: control group (only light cure for 40 s), autoclave group (light cure for 40 s + autoclave for 15 min at 130 ºC); and microwave group (light cure for 40 s + microwave for 3 min at 450 W). To assess the marginal adaptation, the composite resin was inserted incrementally into a mesial-occlusal-distal cavity brass mold and each increment light-cured for 40 s. A previous reading in micrometers was taken at the cervical wall, using a stereomicroscope magnifying glass equipped with a digital video camera and image-analysis software. Subsequently, the specimens were subjected to the <b>post-cure</b> treatments (autoclave and microwave) and a reading was taken again at the cervical wall. Data were compared using ANOVA for the hardness test, split-plot ANOVA for the adaptation assessment and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons. A significance level of 5 % was adopted for all analyses. RESULTS: The <b>post-cure</b> treatments increased the hardness of conventional composites (p< 0. 001) and the gap values of inlay restorations (p< 0. 01).

The main conclusions (related to the manufacture of boats in the above range) are that in the short term it is cheaper to use additional energy for <b>post-curing</b> than to construct a more efficient build enclosure / oven where costs are being passed on to the customer and {{that it is difficult to}} combine an access structure for working on the mould with the enclosing structure of the temporary oven. Based on the spreadsheets developed by the author, graphs are provided as a ‘rule of thumb’ guide to power consumption and total costs for <b>post-curing</b> boats of various lengths. A detailed analysis of the spreadsheet results concludes that the key pointer is to find a practical way of fixing the insulation on the inside of a temporary structure in order to minimise the total mass to be heated. The report touches on the short-term nature of individual project-based yacht manufacturing and observes that it is difficult to justify long-term investment in more efficient production spaces for <b>post-curing</b> until tax-efficient incentives, such as capital allowances for plant & machinery can be applied to the use of temporary ovens. In the longer term, the report identifies the potential for further work on the development of a standard kit of parts for energy-efficient oven construction which could be erected and dismantled as required at minimum labour cost within a lightweight build enclosure. The incentive for this investment could be a radical shift in the real cost of energy – and a sea change in attitudes towards energy use and generation – over the next decade. Meanwhile, the boatbuilding industry appears to be on a plateau of efficiency for one-off post-cured products, based on the individual efforts of yacht manufacturers to deliver a quality product to their customers at a reasonable cost. ...|$|R
40|$|Ageing {{studies on}} {{composite}} rocket propellants (CRP), {{which are based}} on HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) binder systems, are often affected by the <b>post-curing</b> reaction. To obtain satisfying mechanical properties, the so called equivalent ratio NCO/OH for the curing reaction is set normally to values lower than 1. This means, there are more hydroxyl groups available from the binder (HTPB) than isocyanate groups from the curing agent are present in the mix. Nevertheless a complete conversion of the isocyanate groups during the curing reaction is hindered by the reduction of the mobility or in other words the increasing viscosity due to the curing progress. The knowledge of the curing reaction kinetics is important for ageing studies, for the assumptions of the stress-free temperature value and not at least for assessing the <b>post-curing</b> reaction. The value of stress-free temperature is also influenced by ageing effects. <b>Post-curing</b> increases the cross-link density at storage temperature, resulting in a new network part, which overlays and counteracts to the one of the main network formed at curing temperature. This effect should be minimized and the investigation of the time-temperature behavior of the curing reaction is used to determine optimal curing times. In order to separate the influence of filler particles on the curing reaction and to get basic information about the reaction, several formulations have been used: binder formulations with and without plasticizer as well as with and without curing catalyst, besides the curing of complete propellant formulations. The curing processes were followed by heat flow microcalorimetry using the heat of reaction as indicator and by pressure measurements with pressure-temperature transducers in closed pressure cells using the volume shrinkage of the material during curing as indicator...|$|R
