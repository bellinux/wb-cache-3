40|$|CIVINSIn the 1970 's and 1980 's, the Federal Government, {{especially}} the United States Military, {{did not have}} to worry about funding constraints. During this time, the United States and the Soviet Union were in the middle of the Cold War, racing to build up their military strength. Now that the Cold War is over, the United States Government is faced with a declining budget and smaller military force. Even with a reduced budget, the Government must continue to maintain and operate military facilities around the world. In order to accomplish this, the Government must be more innovative and efficient like the civilian sector. Presently the construction industry is making a move towards design build contracts because of several factors; i. e. reduced costs, one party responsibility, and shorter time frames. With the implementation of the Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1996, the Government is now using a two phase design build process that allows for the <b>pre-qualification</b> <b>of</b> <b>contractors</b> prior to submittal proposal and contract award. Southern Division (SOUTHDIV), Naval Facilities Engineering Command, located in Charleston, South Carolina has taken the two phase design build process one step further. SOUTHDIV has created the Design Build Order Contract (DBOC), which is a hybrid of the indefinite quantities (IDQ) contract and the two phase design build contract. This report will provide a better understanding of the Government's two phase design build and DBOC processes and also the current status of DBOC[URL]...|$|E
40|$|While {{construction}} industry practices are reasonably well developed, construction projects still witness widespread failures of many contractors due to varied reasons such as financial problems, poor management, over-commitment and or conflicts and disputes associated with construction activities. <b>Pre-qualification</b> <b>of</b> <b>contractors</b> {{is a common}} practice across projects, yet the investigation {{on the ability of}} the selected contractors in successful delivery of projects is not widespread. In an attempt to understand these pre-emptive qualification criteria and their links in contractors' performance in projects, a total of 43 influencing technical attributes were identified through a systematic research approach. The relative significance and impacts of the attributes have been determined based on a structured questionnaire survey in selected construction projects. By performing the factor analysis, a total of seven factors significant to contractors' performance were extracted, namely (1) soundness of business and workforce; (2) planning and control; (3) quality management; (4) past performance; (5) risk management; (6) organizational capability; and (7) commitment and dedication. Multiple linear regression models reveal that technical expertise, past success, time in business, work methods and working capital significantly impact on contractors' performance across time, cost and quality success. With a clear understanding of a contractor's performance, these findings could potentially contribute to development of a company's procedures or enhance existing knowledge in relation to the pre-qualification practices in contractor selection in projects.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to ascertain the pre-construction delays in state sector projects. Data were collected from a sample of 22 projects, where contract value were over Rs. 5. 0 million for the study, from 11 different state sector organisations. Also, preconstruction durations of 08 private sector projects were obtained and analysed to compare the results with state sector projects. Interviews and documentary research are the two methods adopted for data collection. From the state sector projects surveyed, {{it was evident that}} an average of 131. 9 weeks with a standard diviation of 55. 5 weeks, were taken for the preconstruction phase, where minimum time taken and maximum time taken were 24. 6 weeks and 226. 3 weeks respectively. In comparison, private sector projects had taken an average 38. 1 weeks with a standard diviation of 27. 2 weeks, for pre-construciton phase which has a minimum and maximum time of 12. 1 weeks and 81. 3 weeks respectively. The main conclusions of the research were that unnecessary delay was. resulted due to <b>pre-qualification</b> <b>of</b> consultants and <b>contractors</b> without selecting from ICTAD register/Data bases maintained by respective state sector orgainzations for projects below 10 Million in value. Also, the time delay caused by Consultants/ Technical Evaluation committee to submit the evaluation report and to obtain Cabinet Approval were prominent in the pre-construction stage in state sector projects...|$|R

40|$|The general {{benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>contractor</b> pre-qualification/ registration {{are common}} knowledge. Many large clients follow 'periodical pre-qualification', {{which is usually}} termed 'registration' and maintain a list <b>of</b> pre-qualified/ registered <b>contractors</b> over the pre-qualification/ registration period. The 'pre-qualified'/ 'registered' contractors are generally categorized into static bandwidths such as Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 or Group A, B, C and D. The classification <b>of</b> <b>contractors</b> into various groups depends on assessments (against <b>pre-qualification</b> criteria) <b>of</b> all 'interested' <b>contractors.</b> There is usually no further distinction or ranking <b>of</b> 'pre-qualified'/ 'registered' <b>contractors</b> within the group/ category {{in which they are}} banded. Furthermore, some 'registration' practices do not consider current workload levels <b>of</b> <b>contractors,</b> while financial qualifications and guarantees are given prime importance as contractors are assumed to have similar capacities in all circumstances. This paper presents a proposed new 'dynamic' contractor pre-qualification model for 'periodical prequalification' (normally, on an annual basis) / 'registration', by which 'registered'/ pre-qualified contractors will be assigned different capacity ratings. The proposed conceptual model envisages that contractors will be pre-qualified/ registered with 'dynamically' changing pre-qualification ratings (geared to current workloads and capacities) and that clients will advertise different rating levels required for every tender...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{demand for}} new in-field {{technology}} which can non-destructively evaluate the key material properties has been increased for safe and economic operations of industrial structures/facilities whose material properties can be significantly degraded during operation in hostile environments. As a promising method {{to meet the}} needs, an advanced indentation technique is suggested here. This novel technique can evaluate the true-stress-true-strain relationship and quantitative tensile properties (such as yield strength, tensile strength and work-hardening exponent) non-destructively by analyzing indentation load-depth curve. In this paper, two recent applications of the indentation technique to pre- and in-service-inspection (PSI and ISI) of industrial structures are introduced and discussed. First, <b>pre-qualification</b> <b>of</b> strength performance of welded joint in power plant pipes is successfully performed using this indentation technique while conventional <b>pre-qualification</b> <b>of</b> welded joints through other non-destructive techniques are just focusing on exact crack detection. Second, it was proved that the advanced indentation technique has the strong potential {{to be used for}} in-field periodic monitoring of strength change of oil/gas transmission pipeline, which is required by new regulations for safe maintenance and economical repair...|$|R

30|$|In this study, {{the five}} {{different}} types <b>of</b> <b>contractors,</b> namely: building, civil, mechanical, electrical, and specialist contractors were differentiated. However, this study only focuses on two categories <b>of</b> <b>contractors,</b> namely, building and civil contractors {{due to their}} big number of registration but with poor growth trends (National Bureau of Statistics 2013). For example, registered contractors for building and civil works were 5418 (which is 80 %) out of all registered 6762 contractors in Tanzania {{by the end of}} year 2012. The remaining 20 % of the registered companies belong to electrical, mechanical, and specialist contractors. It is important to consider the number <b>of</b> <b>contractors</b> registered until 2012 because the number <b>of</b> <b>contractors</b> does change at some points with some new companies being registered while others which are not complying with the CRB’s requirements are deleted from the list <b>of</b> <b>contractors.</b> Consequently, firms’ activities were determined by asking respondents to “indicate the firm’s main line of business” (Varukolu and Park-Poaps 2009), which is building works or civil works (or both) in this case.|$|R
