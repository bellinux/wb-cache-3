Thompson, backed by the missionaries, insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals, and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession's granting of [...] "full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure" [...] the mining yield. William Mzisi, a Fengu from the Cape, who {{had been to the}} diamond fields at Kimberley, pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined, and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it: [...] "You say you do not want any land, how can you dig for gold without it, is it not in the land?" [...] Thompson was then questioned as to where exactly it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country.|$|E

The pamphlets were ephemera themselves; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of Ferdinand into Valladolid, 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text.

40|$|Abstract Background Accurate {{measurement}} of household food purchase behavior (HFPB) {{is important for}} understanding its association with household characteristics, individual dietary intake and neighborhood food retail outlets. However, {{little research has been}} done to develop measures of HFPB. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the development of a measure of HFPB using annotated food <b>purchase</b> <b>receipts.</b> Methods Households collected and annotated food <b>purchase</b> <b>receipts</b> for a four-week period as part of the baseline assessment of a household nutrition intervention. Receipts were collected from all food sources, including grocery stores and restaurants. Households (n = 90) were recruited from the community as part of an obesity prevention intervention conducted in 2007 â€“ 2008 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Household primary shoppers were trained to follow a standardized receipt collection and annotation protocol. Annotated receipts were mailed weekly to research staff. Staff coded the receipt data and entered it into a database. Total food dollars, proportion of food dollars, and ounces of food purchased were examined for different food sources and food categories. Descriptive statistics and correlations are presented. Results A total of 2, 483 receipts were returned by 90 households. Home sources comprised 45 % of receipts and eating-out sources 55 %. Eating-out entrees were proportionally the largest single food category based on counts (16. 6 %) and dollars ($ 106 per month). Two-week expenditures were highly correlated (r = 0. 83) with four-week expenditures. Conclusion Receipt data provided important quantitative information about HFPB from a wide range of sources and food categories. Two weeks may be adequate to reliably characterize HFPB using annotated receipts. </p...|$|R

One {{of the most}} basic activity is the procurement, the procurement of both raw materials and other auxiliary materials. This study discusses on the internal control system of import purchases made at PT Kusumahadi Santosa. Import purchases made at PT Kusumahadi Santosa include purchases of raw cotton and the purchase of spareparts. Due to the purchase of imports made in large amounts or nominal, is greatly needed a sound internal control system. From the results, it can be concluded that internal control systems of import purchases made at PT Kusumahadi Santosa strong enough. This can be evidenced by the organizational structure that separates strictly the responsibility the existence of authorization system in each transaction, the use of forms printed serial numbered, and implementation of healthy practices. In addition, the purchase of the imported systems, there is still a weakness that can potentially cause recording errors and loss of company's properties. Internal control weaknesses identified is the existence of functions on the Warehousing Departement, which in addition to storage functions also perform the function of receiving the goods. From the identified weaknesses, the authors advise that the receiving function and the storage functions should be performed by different parts of the organizational structure to avoid any mistakes and the loss of company's properties. This advice is given on the basis that the receipt of goods made by companies occure every day for the local <b>purchase</b> <b>receipt</b> and acceptance of import purchases. Thus the separation of those functions from Warehousing Departement based on the acceptance of cost and the benefit consideration is likely to be performed.

Although coffee chains have grown in popularity in recent years, few data examine the calorie contribution of these drinks. We examined afternoon beverage purchases in New York City at 2 major coffee chains and estimated the mean calorie content of these beverages. MethodsWe collected <b>purchase</b> <b>receipts</b> and brief surveys from adult customers at 42 Starbucks and 73 Dunkin' Donuts stores {{during the spring of}} 2007. For each purchase, we obtained the calorie content from the company's Web site; these values were adjusted to account for self-reported customization of the drink. ResultsWe included 1, 127 beverage purchases at Starbucks and 1, 830 at Dunkin' Donuts in our analyses. Brewed coffee or tea averaged 63 kcal, and blended coffee beverages averaged 239 kcal. Approximately two-thirds of purchases at Starbucks and one-fourth of purchases at Dunkin' Donuts were blended coffee beverages. ConclusionCalories in blended coffee beverages are high; on average, customers bought 12 % of a 2, 000 -kcal diet. Policy changes to provide for calorie posting at the point of purchase could increase customer awareness of the calories in these beverages; modifying standard formulations of blended coffee beverages, such as using low-fat milk or smaller serving sizes, would also reduce calorie content...|$|R
