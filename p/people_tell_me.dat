Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. I liked it and I stayed. <b>People</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day.

[...] His race-blindness is a recurring joke, and this statement is often repeated on the show with different punch lines. For this same reason he believed that he was black when he had an emotional breakdown after watching Obama's inauguration video. He later qualified these statements in his book, stating, [...] "When I say I don't see race, I mean I don't see Black people. But I can spot a Mexican at a hundred paces." [...] Despite all these claims, Colbert often boasts {{that he has a}} large number of token minority friends (including Jon Stewart as [...] " [...] Jewish friend" [...] and Oprah Winfrey as [...] " [...] black friend"), although in the photos shown these friends appear decidedly uninterested in him. He has stated a similar inability to distinguish between the sexes, claiming to only [...] "see an American". This comes in contradiction of his at times sexist behavior, for instance, calling only on men during an open discussion with his audience on women's issues.|$|E
