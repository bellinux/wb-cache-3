40|$|Abstract ― To achieve color {{diversification}} of natural dyeing, color mixture dyeing with Indigo and Japanese pagoda tree {{is applied to}} wool and silk fabrics. After dyeing with Japanese pagoda tree extract solution of 5 ~ 25 %(o. w. f.), the indigo dyeing was carried out up to four times. Alternatively after repeat dyeing with indigo one to seven times, the dyeing with Japanese pagoda tree extract solution was applied in 5 steps(5 ~ 25 %). In color mixture dyeing, the dye uptake of wool fabrics appears {{higher than that of}} silk. The sequence of Japanese pagoda tree extract dyeing after Indigo dyeing was generally higher dye uptake compared with that of Indigo dyeing after Japanese pagoda tree extract dyeing. For wool and silk fabric, the <b>pre-dyeing</b> with Japanese pagoda tree solution was more effective for color diversification but the <b>pre-dyeing</b> with Indigo was more effective for the exhibition of intermediate color shade...|$|E

The coated textiles were tested for their electrochemical activity, electrical resistivity and resistivity {{in response to}} mechanical strain. <b>Pre-dyeing</b> the textile with poly(2 -methoxyaniline- 5 -sulfonic acid) (PMAS) prior to electroless metallization by electroless nickel and via chemical polymerization of polypyrrole {{was found to be}} beneficial in enhancing the resultant coating as well as stabilizing surface resistance responses when exposed {{to a wide range of}} strain. The mass gain due to the nickel coating was found to increase linearly with deposition time. The surface resistivity of the coated textile was found to decrease at longer nickel deposition times. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{foregoing}} paper of these series (XIII); the reverse order of resin treatments {{prior to the}} dyeing in the “Presiton Process" against the conventional one of <b>pre-dyeing</b> prior to 	resin-treatments was discussed. And {{it was found that}} the reactive dyeing thus obtained was made up for the substituted or lost resins， so that it seemed to be unacceptable so far as the resin and dyeing efficiencies are concerned. However, it was suggested that the method could be quite valid from the point of view of the “Presiton Process" which emphasizes on 	the core-resin instead of outer or skin layer resins. The next step of investigation， then， for the fulfillment of the “Presiton Process" is to launch for the study of peeling off those impervious and detrimental outer or skin layer resins without detracting much from the core 	reresin-effect，and these the present paper deals with. Several trials were made with some satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|Ag/TiO 2 {{nanocomposite}} {{were prepared}} through chemical reduction method and characterized by XRD to examine its formation. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) {{was used to}} evaluate its particle size and size distribution. The wool fabric was treated with Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposite then dyed with CI. Acid Orange 74 (AO 74). The Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposite <b>pre-dye</b> uptake was compared to conventional dyeing of wool. The existence of Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposite on wool fabric during acid dyeing increases the dye uptake. The dyeing kinetic of wool fabric was positively affected by treating with the nanocomposite. Also, the activation energy of AO 74 diffusion was calculated before and after the treatment. The Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposite-treatment leads to produce a wool fabric with excellent antibacterial and photocatalytic properties. Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposite-treatment has no adverse effects on fastness properties of the functionalized dyed wool fabric...|$|R
40|$|An {{appropriate}} {{method of}} <b>pre-dye</b> coating of TiO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) and a facile approach of a dip coating technique {{have been adopted}} for the fabrication of panchromatic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). A bi-layer photoanode consists of two distinct layers of TiO 2 films, which were individually sensitized with N 719 and N 749 dyes and then coated on a TCO substrate in a sequenced manner. The spectral response of panchromatic DSSCs has been investigated using monochromatic incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectroscopy. The IPCE spectrum of panchromatic DSSC revealed the absorption characteristics of each single dye cell. The broader absorption spectra were obtained up to 850 nm of near IR region and the higher quantum efficiency than those of single cells were recorded. The higher value of IPCE is correlated with the higher short circuit current density value of panchromatic cell (J(sc) = 13. 4 mA cm(- 2)). The tandem cell showed an average open circuit voltage (V-oc = 0. 79 V) of the single dye cells with an overall conversion efficiency of 7. 1 %. Moreover, the present approach does not require any high temperature sintering process; therefore it could be suitable for the fabrication of flexible panchromatic DSSCs. close 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how the mitochondrial membrane potential affects sperm motility using laser tweezers and a non-ratiometric fluorescent probe, DiOC 6 (3). A 1064 nm Nd:YVO 4 continuous wave laser was used to trap motile sperm at a power of 450 mW in the trap spot. Using customized tracking software, the curvilinear velocity (VCL) and the escape force from the laser tweezers weremeasured. Human (Homo sapiens), dog (Canis lupis familiaris) and drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus) sperm were treated with DiOC 6 (3) to measure the membrane potential in the mitochondria-rich sperm midpieces. Sperm from all three species exhibited an increase in fluorescence when treated with the DiOC 6 (3). When a cyanide inhibitor (CCCP) of aerobic respiration was applied, sperm of all three species exhibited a reduction in fluorescence to <b>pre-dye</b> levels. With respect to VCL and escape force, the CCCP had no effect on dog or human sperm, suggesting a major reliance upon anaerobic respiration (glycolysis) for ATP in these two species. Based on the preliminary study on drill sperm, CCCP caused a drop in the VCL, suggesting potential reliance on both glycolysis and aerobic respiration for motility. The results demonstrate that optical trapping in combination with DiOC 6 (3) is an effective way to study sperm motility and energetics. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Department of Chemical EngineeringDye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) have {{attracted}} great attention {{and one of}} the strong alternatives to conventional Si-based solar cells because of their advantages such as transparency, comparable efficiency, various colors, and simple processes with low costs, etc. In order to get high solar-toelectrical conversion efficiency, improved the spectral response of the sensitizer is necessary. At the principals of DSSCs, the dye molecules act as a primary active component for the absorption of the solar spectrum and generating electrons. If the dye molecules should absorb the sun’s spectrum as wide as possible, the number of generated electrons should be increased and higher conversion efficiency can be achieved with increased spectral response. However, the individual sensitizer can only absorb its own particular range of wavelength. To maximize energy harvesting of DSSCs, many researchers approaching to make a panchromatic system, which could absorb the photons over the entire range of wavelength. Here, I present the prominent way to fabricating panchromatic structured dye-sensitized solar cells. In order to fabricate working electrodes, newly method of <b>pre-dye</b> coating (PDC) of TiO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) and an approach of a dip coating have been adopted for the panchromatic DSSCs. A bi-layer photoanode with two distinct TiO 2 layer, which were individually sensitized with N 719 and N 749 dyes were coated on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) in a sequenced manner. The improvement of spectral response and efficiency of panchromatic DSSCs has been checked with the absorption characteristics of each dye. Furthermore, by using intensity modulated photovoltaic spectroscopy (IMVS), I could check the dynamic electron kinetic and calculate lifetime in ambient conditions with τn = 1 /(2 πƒmin(IMVS)). In addition, here I report a novel structure of DSSCs with reversely form by constructing all the components together as one substrate. With this new structure, comparable cell properties was achieved to the conventional structure. The electrochemical properties and photochemical properties were checked by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Moreover, the present approach could be an encouraging new direction in research while facilitating the fabrication of hybrid-tandem solar cells. Furthermore, I also present a systematic approach of carbon black in order to optimize the catalytic ability of iodide/tri-iodide electrolyte. Replacement of the Pt counter electrode with an inexpensive but electro-chemically stable alternative is one key technological challenge that must be overcome to make DSSCs more economical. Based on the electrochemical analysis, the chargetransfer resistance and photo-electrochemical properties were characterized. ope...|$|R
