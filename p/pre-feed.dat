Experiments with killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) in constant light and under alternating 12 -hour periods of bright and dim light showed that the timing of the <b>pre-feeding</b> activity is influenced by shifts in the light cycle and feeding time; when feeding time in constant light was shifted 6 hours, the <b>pre-feeding</b> activity shifted approximately 6 hours in 1 to 3 days.

40|$|Chemical {{stimulation}} can evoke complex behaviour {{patterns in}} sea anemones. In <b>pre-feeding</b> behaviour a diffusible component of food causes the oral disc {{to expand and}} the column to extend and bend from side to side. These movements may increase the chance of catching nearby food (Pollock, 1883). The response is coordinated by the ectodermal slow conduction system (SSI). In Urticina eques, food extracts that excite the <b>pre-feeding</b> response evoke a low-frequency series of SSI pulses; and electrical stimulation of the SSI, {{in the absence of}} food, causes <b>pre-feeding</b> move-ments (McFarlane, 1970). The SSI, the SS 2 (an endodermal slow system) and a through-conducting nerve net (TCNN) are the three known conducting systems that appear to coordinate sea anemone behaviour (McFarlane, 1982). Other conducting systems have been proposed (e. g. Lawn & Ross, 1982) but not confirmed. Although the SSI plays an important part in the coordination of many behaviour patterns, no chemical that stimulates it has been identified. We have investigated SSI excitation during the <b>pre-feeding</b> response of Urticina felina and U. eques (previously known as Tealia felina var. coriacea and var. lofotensis, Manuel...|$|R

40|$|Response rates {{typically}} change systematically within {{operant conditioning}} sessions. Proposed explanations for this phenomenon include habituation and satiation. The present study investigated these explanations. Six Sprague-Dawley rats {{were exposed to}} a series of variable interval (VI) schedules. Each schedule consisted of a baseline, same <b>pre-feed,</b> and different <b>pre-feed</b> condition. During the same <b>pre-feed,</b> the rats received the same food as was earned during the session, whereas in the different <b>pre-feed,</b> the rats received a food that differed from that earned during the session. A larger decrease in responding during a same food <b>pre-feed</b> condition would support habituation as the explanation. As predicted, there were greater decreases in responding in the same <b>pre-feed</b> conditions. These effects were seen at the higher VI schedules. The results support habituation theory and replicate earlier results from our lab. This research has implications for both habituation and satiation theories as well as eating disorders...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{investigate}} (1) whether colic cries are acoustically {{distinct from}} <b>pre-feed</b> "hunger" cries; (2) {{the role of}} the acoustic properties of these cries versus their other properties in accounting for parents' concerns about colic.  DESIGN—From a community sample, infants were selected who met Wessel colic criteria for amounts of crying and whose mothers identified colic bouts. Using acoustic analyses, the most intense segments of nine colic bouts were compared with matched segments from <b>pre-feed</b> cries presumed to reflect hunger.  RESULTS—The colic cries did not have a higher pitch or proportion of dysphonation than the <b>pre-feed</b> cries. They did contain more frequent shorter utterances, but these resembled normal cries investigated in other studies. There is no evidence that colic cries have distinct acoustic features that are reproducible across samples and studies, which identify a discrete clinical condition, and which are identified accurately by parents.  CONCLUSIONS—The most reliable finding is that colic cries convey diffuse acoustic and audible information that a baby is highly aroused or distressed. Non-acoustic features, including the prolonged, hard to soothe, and unexplained nature of the cries may be specific to colic cries and more important for parents. These properties might reflect temperament-like dispositions. ...|$|E
40|$|Evidence for the {{anticipation}} of competition at feeding time has been previously documented in both Pan species. Chimpanzees seem to cope with competitive tendency through behavioural mechanisms of tension reduction, and grooming {{is certainly one of}} these. Social play and grooming are often matched because they bring animals into close physical contact for long periods, and they have an important role in social cohesion. Our goal was to investigate the occurrence of play behaviour during the <b>pre-feeding</b> period, before a basic maintenance activity is about to take place, in the chimpanzee colony housed in the ZooParc de Beauval (St Aignan sur Cher, France). The group was composed of 10 adults and nine immature individuals. By scan animal sampling (344 h of observation), we recorded play and grooming interactions in all age-class combinations during four different periods (<b>pre-feeding,</b> feeding, post-feeding, control). We found peak levels of grooming interactions among adults during the <b>pre-feeding</b> time. A peak frequency at the <b>pre-feeding</b> time was also found in social play between adults and unrelated immature subjects. This finding suggests that during high tension periods, grooming and play might share similar functions in conflict management. Like grooming, play might have an important role to limit aggression and increase tolerance around food (immediate benefits). Immature animals showed a higher frequency of play in the <b>pre-feeding</b> than in any other condition (feeding, post-feeding, and control). During high excitement periods social play probably represents a safe mechanism for immature subjects to test their personal abilities (self-assessment), the strength/weakness of playmates, and the degree of cooperation/competition with them (social-assessment). In the light of this new evidence, we can assert that play behaviour is far from being a purposeless activity, at least in the chimpanzee colony under study...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{environment}} of the laboratory cat can be restrictive and may impact their welfare. Enrichment is often provided to alleviate welfare impacts but is seldom assessed or validated for efficacy. This study investigated the effect of novel room furniture (a screen) on the expression of agonistic and affiliative behaviours and space utilisation amongst colony-housed laboratory cats. Video footage of cats (N= 29) housed in social rooms (N= 4) was collected for 2 days before (baseline phase), 4 days during (test phase) and 2 days following (removal phase) introduction of the novel furniture. Space utilisation data were collected using scan sampling every 10 min and analysed using a generalised linear mixed effects model and Tukey’s HSD test. Behavioural data were collected using continuous sampling for 3 h a day in 6 × 30 min episodes and analysed using a Poisson generalised mixed effects model. Significantly more agonistic events occurred before the morning feed compared to after feeding within all phases (<b>pre-feed</b> mean= 0. 227; post-feed mean= 0. 026; P< 0. 0001). However {{no significant differences were}} observed before the morning feed compared to after feeding between phases indicating that the screen had no effect on reducing <b>pre-feed</b> aggression at the morning feed. Agonistic behaviours occurred significantly less following the morning feed during the test phase when compared to the baseline phase (test post-feed mean= 0. 011; baseline post-feed mean= 0. 029; P= 0. 0342). Significant differences were also observed on removal of the screen with agonistic behaviour increasing above baseline at the afternoon <b>pre-feed</b> time point, possibly indicative of aggression due to frustration or a rebound effect (removal <b>pre-feed</b> mean= 0. 151; baseline <b>pre-feed</b> mean 0. 048; P< 0. 0001). Affiliative interactions between phases were not significantly affected by screen presence. Given the ratio of the screen to existing shelving (0. 58 : 0. 42) a statistical significant proportion of cats were found to be on the screen in the test phase of the study (P< 0. 0001). This study suggests that exploiting the unused vertical space by the addition of stand-alone shelving should be considered a valuable resource for the cat by increasing useable space and reducing agonistic interactions...|$|E
30|$|Isomalk- 4 SM is {{the process}} used for the {{isomerization}} of C 7 + hydrocarbons. In the process, a robust platinum-containing mixed metal oxide SI- 2 catalyst works effectively at lower temperature range of around 120 – 140  °C for LSRN isomerization. The yield of naphtha increases over 90  wt% and with RON of about 95 – 98 using Isomalk- 4 SM. In addition, refiners can comprehend the maximum naphtha molecules, and reduce cracking and formation of benzene. The C 7 + stream is directed to Isomalk- 4 SM unit to attain the equilibrium quantity of di and trimethylbutanes, which have high-octane numbers [31].

40|$|Background: Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus is the commonest {{cause of}} {{diabetes}} presenting {{in the first}} week of life. Majority of infants recover by 3 months of age but are predisposed to developing type 2 diabetes later on in life. This condition is usually due to genetic aberrations at the 6 q 24 gene locus, and can be sporadic or inherited. This disorder has three phases: neonatal diabetes, apparent remission, relapse of diabetes. Case Presentation: Our case, a neonate presented with low birth weight and growth retardation along with the metabolic profile consistent with transient diabetes mellitus at birth. We report a novel clinical observation of recurrent asymptomatic hypoglycaemia detected on <b>pre-feed</b> blood glucose level monitoring in our case with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus at 6 weeks of age, 4 weeks after the remission of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that neonates in remission following transient diabetes mellitus can present with recurrent asymptomatic hypoglycaemia without any other obvious congenital malformations seen. This asymptomatic hypoglycaemia may persist for weeks and may be missed if <b>pre-feed</b> blood glucose level monitoring is not done in these infants. Also, these infants may require an aggressive enteral feeding regimen with high glucose delivery rate to maintain normoglycemia. <br/...|$|E

The aim of the study was to verify if plasma GAS and INS concentrations in adult does are affected by the physiological state, change in response to the meal and are correlated with feed intake and energy balance. Dry matter intake (DMI) and pre and post-prandial plasma concentrations of gastrin- 17 and insulin were recorded in 21 female goats fed hay and different quantities of concentrate (maize grain) twice daily in different physiological states. DMI was lower during the week of oestrous activity, compared to the period of anoestrus – progressively decreasing during pregnancy and increasing during the post-partum period, without significant differences between early and late lactation. PlasmaGASconcentrations were significantly affected by physiological status, being higher (P < 0. 05) during lactation than during pregnancy. Overall plasma GAS concentrations increased (P < 0. 01) from <b>pre-feeding</b> levels (169 ± 24 pg/ml), to 30 min after feed ingestion (185 ± 29 pg/ml). The increase occurred 10 and 20 min (P < 0. 05) after feeding, regardless of the diet composition. Both pre- and post-prandial GAS concentrations were related to DMI (P < 0. 001), but not to the energy intake. Plasma INS on the other hand was not significantly affected by the physiological status. The <b>pre-feeding</b> plasma INS concentration, across all physiological states,was 1. 36 ± 0. 32 ng/ml and increased (P < 0. 01) to 1. 45 ± 0. 38 ng/ml 30 min after feeding. <b>Pre-feeding</b> INS, but not post-prandial INS, increased with increasing proportions of maize in the diet and energy intake (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Large inter- and intra-individual {{variations}} {{exist in}} breastmilk composition, yet {{factors associated with}} these variations in the short-term are not well understood. In this study, the effects of breastfeeding on breastmilk cellular and biochemical content were examined. Serial breastmilk samples (~ 5 mL) were collected from both breasts of breastfeeding women before and immediately after the first morning breastfeed, and then at 30 -minute intervals for up to 3 hours post-feed on 2 – 4 mornings per participant. The infant fed from one breast only at each feed. Effects of pump versus hand expression for samples were evaluated. A consistent response pattern of breastmilk cell and fat contents to breastmilk removal was observed. Maximum fat and cell levels were obtained 30 minutes post-feed (P 0. 01), with up to 8 -fold increase in fat and 12 -fold increase in cell content compared to the <b>pre-feed</b> values, and then they gradually decreased. Breastmilk cell viability and protein concentration did not change with feeding (P> 0. 05), although large intra-individual variability was noted for protein. Expression mode for samples did not influence breastmilk composition (P> 0. 05). It is concluded that breastmilk fat content, and thus breast fullness, is closely associated with breastmilk cell content. This will now {{form the basis for}} standardization of sampling protocols in lactation studies and investigation of the mechanisms of milk synthesis and cell movement into breastmilk. Moreover, these findings generate new avenues for clinical interventions exploring growth and survival benefits conferred to preterm infants by providing the highest in fat and cells milk obtained at 30 min post-expression...|$|E
40|$|In South Australia, {{success in}} control of the European rabbit has been based on an {{understanding}} of rabbit biology and behavior. Drastic population reduction is obtained by use of Compound 1080. This method is much more effective when carried out during midsummer to late autumn. At this time, territorial boundaries are relaxed and the young have been weaned and are feeding aboveground. To ensure that the greatest number of rabbits can receive a lethal dose, it is necessary to <b>pre-feed</b> the population with un-poisoned bait over a period of 8 to 10 days. Oat grain has been chosen as the preferred bait material because of its acceptability and to minimize possible off-target effects. As warrens are an essential factor in rabbit survival, warren destruction is a vital part of any effective control program to prevent a resurgence of the population. Poisoning followed by ripping of warrens and then fumigation provided effective control in the most cost-efficient manner. Warrens can be destroyed with minimal disturbance to areas of valuable native vegetation. By promoting this system of integrated control and by explaining to landholders the biological reasons for its effectiveness, the major rabbit problems of South Australia 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural lands have been overcome. In addition to the improvements in farm productivity in both the short and long term, rabbit control often appears to be an essential tool in the management of native vegetation and native herbivores. In the low-rainfall parts of the state, the low productivity of the land makes it difficult to justify this system of integrated control in terms of cost-efficiency. Ripping of warrens by itself has been shown to provide reasonable control in hilly country with 250 to 300 mm of rainfall, when control takes place late in summer when rabbit numbers are low. However, biological control in the form of myxomatosis provides the most likely means of keeping rabbit numbers at a low level throughout the low-rainfall areas. European rabbit fleas from the arid parts of Spain are expected to be introduced soon to help spread myxomatosis more effectively in the arid parts of South Australia...|$|E

40|$|Motivating Operations (MOs) are a {{fundamental}} concept in behavioural psychology. Despite this, empirical research into MOs is lacking. The overall {{aim of this}} thesis is {{to contribute to the}} experimental literature base for MOs. Experiment 2. 1 used an already published video analysis methodology to assess the morphology of food motivated pecks made to a computer screen by hens, after the hens had been trained to emit the peck using either an autoshaping or handshaping procedure. The intention of this was to then {{be able to use the}} video analysis to assess the effect of altering two MOs related to two different reinforcers (e. g., food and water) at one time, on morphology. The study showed that both methods produced similarly formed pecks despite the variability inherent in the handshaping procedure. It was then concluded it is the nature of the reinforcer that gives rise to morphology not the autoshaping procedure per se which gives rise to a particular form of elicited responses. The aim of Experiment 3. 1 and 3. 2 was to develop a procedure for restricting access to water in laying hens, in order to motivate them sufficiently to respond for water reinforcers. Experiment 3. 1 assessed the effect that gradually decreasing time and amount of water access had on food-restricted hens’ water consumption and health. It was found that hens could be restricted to one hr access of water (restricted to the maximum amount that hens would consume when access was ad libitum) without adverse effects to health being apparent. However, when the hens were subsequently exposed to FR schedules with a low response requirement in Experiment 3. 2, they did not respond consistently. This indicated that the level of restriction was insufficient to motivate responding and this finding, combined with the difficulty of obtaining ethical approval, meant that the proposed experiments utilising water deprivation as an MO had to be abandoned. Experiment 4. 1 used the autoshaping paradigm to assess the acquisition of food motivated pecks to a stimulus, at two different levels of bodyweight (75 % and 95 %). An infra-red screen was used to analyse performance separately from learning effects by examining activity levels (location and amount of pecks). It was found that that higher numbers of effective pecks were made by hens maintained at 75 % free-feeding bodyweight than hens maintained at 95 % (different MO conditions). There were also higher levels of ineffective pecks in the 75 % group. Experiment 5. 1 investigated relative preference for stimuli correlated with different MO conditions: high deprivation (no <b>pre-feeding),</b> or low deprivation (<b>pre-feeding),</b> when subjects were maintained at either 75 % or 95 % of free-feeding bodyweight. The results showed that 6 / 10 hens demonstrated an increased preference for the stimulus paired with high deprivation conditions (no <b>pre-feeding)</b> when measured by log ratios of responses, and had faster response rates on this stimulus. Overall, the 75 % bodyweight hens had faster response rates than the 95 % hens (as in Experiment 4. 1), and 8 / 10 hens responded faster on the stimulus that was paired with no <b>pre-feeding.</b> It was also found, as per Experiment 4. 1, that higher numbers of effective pecks were made by hens maintained at 75 % free-feeding bodyweight than hens maintained at 95 % (different MO conditions). Experiments 6. 1 and 6. 2 extended the findings of the thesis thus far in that concurrent VI VI schedules were used to assess the effect of bodyweight and <b>pre-feeding</b> as MOs on steady state responding. In total 16 conditions were run exposing hens to three different VI pairs: VI- 12, VI- 60 (5 : 1); VI- 20, VI- 20 (1 : 1); and VI- 60, VI- 12 (1 : 5). Bodyweight values of 85 %, 95 %, 100 %, and 85 % with <b>pre-feeding</b> of 40 cc wheat delivered 40 minutes prior to experimental sessions were manipulated between hens finishing a series of the three VI pairs. It was found that 4 / 6 hens had higher absolute and relative response rates when bodyweight was made lower. For 3 / 6 of these hens, increasing bodyweight increased sensitivity as measured by the parameter a; this was more distinct when the Generalised Matching Law was applied to response rather than time locations for these hens. Frequency distributions of IRTs showed that for the hens that tended to show increasing sensitivity as bodyweights increased there were more IRTs in bins greater than 0. 4 s. This was reflected on the log-survivor plots as the limbs were shallower when bodyweights were higher, indicating that more between-bout responses were occurring. It was also found that <b>pre-feeding</b> increased sensitivity as measured by the parameter a for all hens; this was more noticeable when the GML was applied to response rather than time allocations. Although overall response rates tended to resemble those for the 85 % bodyweight condition and remain higher than the 95 % and 100 % bodyweight conditions, the distribution of left and right response rates showed that hens matched better to the prevailing reinforcer rates when they were pre-fed, than when they were not pre-fed. Overall, the main findings were: (1) that reducing bodyweights increased amounts of species-specific behaviour; and (2) that reducing bodyweight causes increases in response rate. These findings could explain why changes in preference for stimuli paired with high levels of deprivation are observed during SDVL procedures, and why increased sensitivity to available reinforcement at lower levels of deprivation found in studies utilising the GML have been observed in previous studies. These findings contribute to the empirical data informing the behavioural treatment of motivation and have applied implications. Reinforcement and punishment procedures such as extinction or differential reinforcement of alternative behaviours may no longer be necessary when MOs are manipulated...|$|R
