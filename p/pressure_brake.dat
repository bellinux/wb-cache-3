50|$|Brakes on a {{race car}} are {{imperative}} in slowing and stopping the car at precise times and wear quickly depending on the road or track on which the car is being raced, how many laps are being run, track conditions due to weather, and how many caution runs require more braking. There are three variables to consider in racing: brake pedal displacement, brake pedal force, and vehicle deceleration. Various combinations of these variables work together to determine the stiffness, sensitivity, and pedal force of the brakes. When using the brakes effectively, the driver must go through a buildup phase and end with a modulating phase. These phases include attaining maximum deceleration and modulating the brake <b>pressure.</b> <b>Brake</b> performance is measured in bite and consistency. Bite happens when the driver first applies the brakes {{and they have not}} warmed up to the correct temperature to operate efficiently. Consistency is measured in how consistent the friction is during the entire time of braking. These two measurements determine the wear of the brakes.|$|E

50|$|An {{air brake}} or, more formally, a {{compressed}} air brake system, {{is a type}} of friction brake for vehicles in which compressed air pressing on a piston is used to apply the <b>pressure</b> to the <b>brake</b> pad needed to stop the vehicle.

According {{to the best}} of the author's knowledge, {{it is the first time}} that the {{influence}} of acetone blends has been studied in a gasoline-fueled engine. The blended fuels were tested for their energy efficiencies and pollutant emissions using SI (spark-ignition) engine with single-cylinder and 4 -stroke. Experimental results showed that the AC 3 (3 vol. % acetone[*]+[*] 97 vol. % gasoline) blended fuel has an advantage over the neat gasoline in exhaust gases temperature, in-cylinder <b>pressure,</b> <b>brake</b> power, torque and volumetric efficiency by about 0. 8 %, 2. 3 %, 1. 3 %, 0. 45 % and 0. 9 %, respectively. As the acetone content increases in the blends, as the engine performance improved where the best performance obtained in this study at the blended fuel of AC 10. In particular, exhaust gases temperature, in-cylinder <b>pressure,</b> <b>brake</b> power, torque and volumetric efficiency increase by about 5 %, 10. 5 %, 5. 2 %, 2. 1 % and 3. 2 %, respectively, compared to neat gasoline. In addition, the use of acetone with gasoline fuel reduces exhaust emissions averagely by about 43 % for carbon monoxide, 32 % for carbon dioxide and 33 % for the unburnt hydrocarbons. The enhanced engine performance and pollutant emissions are attributed to the higher oxygen content, slight leaning effect, lower knock tendency and high flame speeds of acetone, compared to the neat gasoline. Finally the mechanism of acetone combustion in gasoline-fueled engines is proposed in this work; two main pathways for acetone combustion are highlighted; furthermore, the CO, CO 2 and UHC (unburnt hydrocarbons) mechanisms of formation and oxidation are acknowledged. Such acetone mechanism is employed for further understanding acetone combustion in spark-ignition engines...|$|E

A modeling {{study was conducted to}} investigate the impact of ethanol addition on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine fueled by diesel. One dimensional simulation was conducted using the renowned commercial software for diesel and its blend fuels with 5 % (E 5) and 10 % ethanol (E 10) (in vol.) under full load condition at variable engine speed ranging from 1000 to 2750 rpm with 250 rpm increment. The model was then validated with other researcher’s experimental result. Model consists of intake and exhaust systems, cylinder, head, valves and port geometries. Performance tests were conducted for volumetric efficiency, brake engine torque, brake power, brake mean effective <b>pressure,</b> <b>brake</b> specific fuel consumption, and brake thermal efficiency, while exhaust emissions were analyzed for carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC. The results showed that blending diesel with ethanol increases the volumetric efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency, while it decreases brake engine torque, brake power and brake mean effective pressure. In term of emission characteristics, the CO emissions concentrations in the engine exhaust decrease significantly with ethanol as additive. But for HC emission, its concentration increase when apply in high engine speed. In conclusion, using Ethanol as fuel additive blend with Diesel operating in HCCI shows a good result in term of performance and emission in low speed but not recommended to use in high speed engine.

The chemical energy release has been simulated using an improved version of a previously developed model {{that is based on}} the accumulated fuel mass approach. The in-cylinder pressure has been evaluated {{on the basis of the}} inversion of a single-zone model, using the net energy release as input. The latter quantity was derived starting from the simulated chemical energy release, and evaluating the heat transfer of the charge with the walls. NOx and soot emissions were simulated on the basis of semiempirical correlations that take into account the in-cylinder thermodynamic properties, the chemical energy release and the main engine parameters. The model is also referred to as "steady-state" as the main thermodynamic properties in the intake and exhaust manifolds, as well as the inducted mass flow rate, have been evaluated by means of cor relations that were calibrated under steady-state conditions. This has allowed a very low computational time to be obtained, so that the approach is suitable for implementation in an ECU for real-time applications. The model has been calibrated over several experimental tests carried out at a dynamic test bench at GMPT-E (General Motors powertrain-Europe).

40|$|The {{stringent}} emission laws, {{the depletion}} of petroleum reserves and the relation of fuels with politics have forced the world to find alternatives to fossil fuels. Biodiesel {{is one of the}} biofuels which is renewable and environmentally friendly and can be used in diesel engines with little or no modifications. For the last two decades, many researchers have reported extensive work on the performance and emission characteristics of engines running with biodiesel during steady state operation. However, there are numbers of knowledge gaps that have been identified which include limited information on biodiesel physio-chemical properties and their effects on combustion behaviour and performance and emission characteristics of the engine. In this study after an exhaustive literature review, the following four research areas have been identified and investigated extensively using available numerical and experimental means. The initial focus was to investigate the most important properties of biodiesel such as density, viscosity and lower heating value using experimental and numerical techniques. The effects of biodiesel blend content on the physical properties were analysed. For each property, prediction models were developed and compared with current models available in literature. New density and viscosity prediction models were developed by considering the combined effect of biodiesel content and temperature. All the empirical models have showed a fair degree of accuracy in estimating the physical properties of biodiesel in comparison to the experimental results. Finally, the effects of density and viscosity on the fuel supply system were investigated. This system includes the fuel filter, fuel pump and the engine combustion chamber in which air-fuel mixing behaviour was studied numerically. These models can be used to understand the effects of changes in the physical properties of the fuel on the fuel supply system. In addition, the fuel supply system analysis can be carried out during the design stage of fuel pump, fuel filter and injection system. The second research objective was the investigation into a CI engine’s combustion characteristics as well as performance and emissions characteristics under both the steady and transient conditions when fuelled with biodiesel blends. The effects of biodiesel content on the CI engine’s in-cylinder <b>pressure,</b> <b>brake</b> specific fuel consumption, thermal efficiency and emissions (CO 2, NOx, CO, THC) were evaluated based on experimental results. It has been seen that the CI engine running with the biodiesel resulted in acceptable engine performance as well as reduction in main emissions (except NOx). Following this study, a detailed analysis on the transient performance and emission output of the CI engine has been carried out. During this analysis, the emission changing rate is investigated during speed transient and torque transition stages. Further to this, a transient emission prediction model has been developed using associated steady and transient emission data. The model has been shown to predict the transient emission reasonably accurately. The third research objective was to develop a method for on-line measurement of NOx emission. For this purpose the in-cylinder pressure generated within a CI engine has been measured experimentally along with mass air flow and these parameters have been used {{in the development of a}} NOx prediction model. This model has been validated using experimental data obtained from a NOx emission analyzer. The predicted data obtained from NOx prediction model has been compared with measured data and has shown that the deviation is within acceptable range. The final research objective was to develop a simple, reliable and low-cost novel method to reduce the NOx emission of the CI engine when using biodiesel blends. A potential solution to this problem has been found to be in the form of direct water injection which has shown to be capable to reduce NOx emission. Using a water injection technique, the performance and emission(NOx and CO) characteristics of a CI engine fuelled with biodiesel has been investigated at varying water injection flow rates. Intake manifold water injection reduces NOx emission by up to 40 % over the entire operating range without compromising the performance characteristics of the CI engineEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
