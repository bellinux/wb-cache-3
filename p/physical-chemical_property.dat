A number of laboratory methods verifying the coal susceptibility to spontaneous combustion exist, e. g. the oxidation method under adiabatic conditions, method according to the author Olpinski, method of pulse calorimetry, and CPT (Crossing Point Temperature) method. Any versatile method has not been so far developed, which would become a generally respected and utilized laboratory procedure of objective assessment. The paper deals with the verification of the widely used adiabatic oxidation method. The modification of the method in question consists in the adjustment of the test process by increasing the initial temperature. This procedure enables shortening the test process. Shortening the laboratory test duration creates conditions for wider utilization of the method in practice.

40|$|Abstract Background Multiplex ligation-dependent probe {{amplification}} (MLPA) is {{an efficient}} and reliable technique for gene dosage analysis. Currently MLPA can be conducted on two platforms: traditional electrophoresis-based, and FlexMAP bead-coupled. Since its introduction in 2002, MLPA has been rapidly adopted in both clinical and research situations. However, MLPA probe design {{is a time}} consuming process requiring many steps that address multiple criteria. There exist {{only one or two}} commercial software packages for traditional electrophoresis-based MLPA probe design. To our knowledge, no software is yet available that performs bead-coupled MLPA probe design. Results We have developed H-MAPD, a web-based tool that automates the generation and selection of probes for human genomic MLPA.

The nanoparticles released from commercial products will enter WWTPs and can induce potential adverse effects on activated sludge. This paper focused {{on the effects of}} copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) on these specific <b>physical-chemical</b> <b>properties</b> of activated sludge. It was found that most of these properties were unaffected by the exposure to lower CuNPs concentration (5 ppm), but different observation were made at higher CuNPs concentrations (30 and 50 ppm). At the higher CuNPs concentrations, the sludge surface charge increased and the hydrophobicity decreased, which were attributed to more Cu 2 + ions released from the CuNPs. The carbohydrate content of EPS was enhanced to defense the toxicity of CuNPs. The flocculating ability was found to be deteriorated due to the increased cell surface charge, the decreased hydrophobicity, and the damaged cell membrane. The worsened flocculating ability made the sludge flocs more dispersed, which further increased the toxicity of the CuNPs by increasing the availability of the CuNPs to the bacteria present in the sludge. Further investigation indicated that the phosphorus removal efficiency decreased at higher CuNPs concentrations, which was consistent with the deteriorated <b>physical-chemical</b> <b>properties</b> of activated sludge.

The present review summarizes the main experimental evidence carried out by our research group {{over the past two}} decades, in the attempt to investigate systematically the relationships between structural properties and biological effects of bile acids in humans. Hydrophobic bile acids (chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid), but not hydrophilic acids (ursodeoxycholic acid), significantly suppressed hepatic activity of HMG-CoA reductase, the limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, and in vivo cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation, the limiting step of bile acid synthesis. The output of biliary cholesterol and phospholipid was also directly related to the hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool. Finally, treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, but not with ursodeoxycholic acid, significantly decreased gall-bladder emptying rates. When turning to the in vitro model of HepG 2 cells, hydrophobic bile acids were found to induce greater cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects.

Since the biology experiment methods are both time-consuming and expensive, it is highly desired to develop an in silicon method to address these problems. In this paper, two effective methods are taken into consideration to constitute the 2 -layer predictor: the 1 st layer prediction engine respectively extracts 188 -D features based on composition and <b>physical-chemical</b> <b>property</b> of protein and extract 20 -D features by using position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), for determining a query protein as an enzyme or a non-enzyme; the 2 nd layer prediction engine extracts 20 -D feature by PSSM and is designed for predicting the main family class of the enzyme.

The presence of brominated DBPs in chlorinated saline effluents may pose adverse implications for marine ecology. In this study, besides the detection and identification of another seven new aromatic halogenated DBPs in a chlorinated saline sewage effluent, their developmental toxicity was evaluated using the marine polychaete Platynereis dumerilii. For comparison, the developmental toxicity of some commonly known halogenated DBPs was also examined.

40|$|Maintaining soil {{physical}} properties and organic C {{is the goal}} for sustainable use of soil resources in agroecosystems. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the changes in soil structure and C pools and to quantify the availability of labile C pools. The study site was in Bengkulu Province Sumatra, Indonesia. Four common agroecosystems {{were used to determine}} soil {{physical properties}} including bulk density, porosity, and soil aggregates. Labile soil C pools examined were particulate organic C (POC), microbial biomass C (MBC) and C mineralization (C min). Farming practices significantly affected the bulk density, macro-porosity, micro-porosity, aggregate stability(AS), mean weight diameter (MWD) and aggregation ratio (AR). However, the responses from treatments depend upon the soil depth. In general, agroforestry and fallow fields provided lower bulk density, higher porosity, AS, MWD and AR compared to rubber tree plantation and grain cropping. As a general trend, the values of POC, MBC and C min decreased in the order of agroforestry > fallow field > rubber tree plantation > grain cropping. The order of labile C pools in all fields were POC > MBC > C min. Significant increases (32 – 62 %, p< 0. 05) in the soil organic C content was observed in agroforestry and fallow fields compared to rubber tree plantation and grain cropping systems at the depth of 0 – 20 cm. The highest available POC (43 to 82 %) and MBC (2 to 5 %) were found in agroforestry and fallow field. Mineralized C was about 2 % in all fields indicating similar amount of active C from soil organic matter. In conclusion, improvement in soil structure properties, TOC, POC and MBC in agroforestry andfallow fields indicates better soil C sequestration and soil quality in these agroecosystems.
