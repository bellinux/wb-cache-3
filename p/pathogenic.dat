5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} animals. <b>Pathogenic</b> bacteria cause diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax. Protozoa cause diseases including malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis. Microscopic fungi cause diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis and histoplasmosis. <b>Pathogenic</b> viruses cause diseases such as influenza, yellow fever and AIDS.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. <b>Pathogenic</b> bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A <b>pathogenic</b> cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} <b>pathogenic</b> care, or {{the type of}} care in which these {{behaviors}} are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to <b>pathogenic</b> care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include <b>pathogenic</b> bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by <b>pathogenic</b> viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, <b>pathogenic</b> {{mutations}} {{have been}} identified in the prion-like domains of heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 in familial cases of muscle, brain, bone and motor neuron degeneration. The wild-type form of all of these proteins show a tendency to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, while the <b>pathogenic</b> mutations exacerbate this behaviour and lead to excess accumulation.|$|E
5|$|A {{pathogen}} is only {{successful in}} infecting an organism {{if it can}} get past its defenses. <b>Pathogenic</b> bacteria and protozoa have developed {{a variety of methods}} to resist attacks by phagocytes, and many actually survive and replicate within phagocytic cells.|$|E
5|$|A prion like protein, called MAVS, {{has been}} shown to misfold as part of the innate immune {{response}} against <b>pathogenic</b> viruses, similarly the cellular prion, PrPC {{has been shown}} to have anti HIV properties, and it is hypothesized that the misfolding of the prion in TSEs may be an antiviral response against an unknown virus.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} 32 {{basidiomycete}} mushrooms showed that Mutinus elegans {{was the only}} species to show antibiotic (both antibacterial and antifungal) activity against all six microorganisms tested, namely, the human <b>pathogenic</b> bacteris Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and the yeast Candida albicans.|$|E
5|$|Beauveria bassiana (Hyphomycetes) is a <b>pathogenic</b> fungus that infects a {{wide range}} of insect species, {{including}} the Colorado potato beetle. It has shown to be particularly effective as a biological pesticide for L. decemlineata when used in combination with the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis.|$|E
5|$|DPB is idiopathic, {{which means}} an exact physiological, environmental, or <b>pathogenic</b> {{cause of the}} disease is unknown. However, several factors are {{suspected}} {{to be involved with}} its pathogenesis (the way in which the disease works).|$|E
5|$|During the {{reintroduction}} of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and {{ill health}} in pre-release birds {{was due to}} bacteria of a <b>pathogenic</b> Campylobacter species. Subsequently, microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|It is {{susceptible}} {{to a range of}} parasites including Cryptosporidium, Giardia, tapeworms, blood parasites and external feather lice, and is also affected by other avian diseases. It is often the dominant species in major mortality events from avian botulism and avian cholera, and can also contract avian influenza, the H5N1 strain of which is highly <b>pathogenic</b> and occasionally infects humans.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests show}} that fruit bodies have {{antimicrobial}} activity against several strains of drug-resistant bacteria that are <b>pathogenic</b> in humans. Extracts inhibit {{the growth of}} the Gram-negative bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes, and kill the Gram-positive species Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus agalactiae and S.pyogenes. A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against Proteus vulgaris.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos are in {{development}} as pharmaceutical therapeutics targeted against <b>pathogenic</b> organisms such as bacteria or viruses and genetic diseases. The Morpholino drug eteplirsen from Sarepta Therapeutics received accelerated {{approval from the}} US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of some mutations causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pathogenic</b> {{micro-organisms}} include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate {{their host}} and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, {{but may also}} be used as biological pesticides. When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only occur as insect populations become denser.|$|E
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and <b>pathogenic</b> microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E
5|$|The fungi {{have several}} {{unicellular}} species, such as baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Some fungi, {{such as the}} <b>pathogenic</b> yeast Candida albicans, can undergo phenotypic switching and grow as single cells in some environments, and filamentous hyphae in others.|$|E
5|$|Their {{reproduction}} is both rapid and profuse. The {{combination of a}} high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new environments, including outer space. They form {{an essential part of}} the planetary ecosystem. However, some microorganisms are <b>pathogenic</b> and can post health risk to other organisms.|$|E
5|$|Ustilago maydis is a <b>pathogenic</b> plant fungus {{that causes}} smut disease in maize and teosinte. Plants have evolved {{efficient}} defense systems against <b>pathogenic</b> microbes such as U. maydis. A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the oxidative burst where the plant produces {{reactive oxygen species}} {{at the site of}} the attempted invasion. U. maydis can respond to the oxidative burst with an oxidative stress response, regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen’s virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during mitosis and meiosis. The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant’s oxidative defensive response to infection.|$|E
5|$|Viruses and pests affect {{yield of}} Bt cotton varieties. Cotton leaf curl virus, {{which is a}} plant <b>pathogenic</b> virus of the family Geminiviridae, stunts plant growth seriously {{affecting}} yield. Pests like White Fly, Mealy Bugs, Aphids, Pink Boll Worm infect the plants reducing yield.|$|E
5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a <b>pathogenic</b> fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|Apicomplexa is a {{major group}} of {{unicellular}} eukaryotes that encompasses several important parasites, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium. Three species are known from the marsh rice rat, all of which belong to the Eimerina clade. Two are in the genus Eimeria, members of which cause the economically significant disease coccidiosis in poultry. The third {{is a member of}} Isospora, which includes species that are <b>pathogenic</b> in humans and pigs.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which <b>pathogenic</b> strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus agathosmus is edible, but {{considered}} bland. A {{study of}} the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: oxalic, citric, malic, quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown to inhibit the growth of various <b>pathogenic</b> bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis; it also inhibits {{the growth of the}} yeast Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E
5|$|Leucopaxillus giganteus {{contains}} a bioactive compound named clitocine that has antibiotic activity against {{a number of}} bacteria that are <b>pathogenic</b> to humans, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis; an earlier (1945) study showed antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi, and Brucea abortus. Clitocine {{has also been shown}} to promote apoptosis (cell death) in human cervical cancer cells in vitro (HeLa). The mycelia of L.giganteus, when grown in liquid culture, has been shown to produce phenols and flavonoids that have antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pathogenic</b> fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pathogenic</b> microbes, and toxins {{that they}} produce, have been {{developed}} as possible agents of warfare. Crude forms of biological warfare have been practiced since antiquity. In the 6th century BC, the Assyrians poisoned enemy wells with a fungus said to render the enemy delirious. In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors of the Golden Horde who had died of plague were thrown over {{the walls of the}} besieged Crimean city of Kaffa, possibly assisting the spread of the Black Death into Europe.|$|E
5|$|Research {{from the}} late 1990s {{indicated}} there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of <b>pathogenic</b> care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD. Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} entomopathogenic {{nematode}} are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a microscopic nematode that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a free-living, infective {{stage in the}} soil where it becomes associated with a <b>pathogenic</b> bacteria such as Moraxella osloensis. The nematode enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, {{but it is the}} bacteria that kill the slug. The nematode is available commercially in Europe and is applied by watering onto moist soil.|$|E
5|$|The EEHVs {{are members}} of the Proboscivirus genus, a novel clade most closely related to the {{mammalian}} betaherpesviruses that have been responsible for as many as 70 deaths of both zoo and wild Asian elephants worldwide, especially in young calves. There are currently six known species/types of the probosciviruses, and the most commonly encountered and most <b>pathogenic</b> form EEHV1 also has two chimeric subtypes, 1A and 1B., as well as numerous distinct strains.|$|E
5|$|The argasid tick Hyalomma marginatum {{was found}} in pale crag martin nests on a {{sarcophagus}} and an ancient tomb in Egypt. This tick has been implicated in the transmission of Bahig virus, a <b>pathogenic</b> arbovirus previously thought to be transmitted only by mosquitoes. Another argasid tick, Argas africolumbae, {{was found in}} a nest of the closely related rock martins in Kenya. The nasal mite Ptilonyssus echinatus {{was found in a}} pale crag martin in the Tibesti Mountains of northern Chad.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of T.floccosus {{produces}} oxylipin (biologically active lipids generated from fatty acids) that have antifungal activity against the plant pathogens Colletotrichum fragariae, C.gloeosporioides, and C.acutatum. Extracts of the fungus have shown in standard laboratory tests to have antimicrobial activity against several human <b>pathogenic</b> strains. T.floccosus also contains the spermidine derivative pistillarin, a bioactive compound that inhibits DNA damage by hydroxyl radicals {{generated by the}} Fenton reaction. Pistillarin {{is responsible for the}} green color obtained when iron salts are applied to the fruit body surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Urnula craterium allows for both an {{imperfect}} (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often happened in fungal taxonomy, the imperfect form was given a different name, because {{the relationship between the}} perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The imperfect stage of Urnula craterium is the plant <b>pathogenic</b> species Conoplea globosa, known to cause a canker disease (Strumella canker) of oak and several other hardwoods.|$|E
5|$|The use of fungi {{by humans}} {{dates back to}} prehistory; Ötzi the Iceman, a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old Neolithic man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of polypore {{mushrooms}} {{that may have been}} used as tinder (Fomes fomentarius), or for medicinal purposes (Piptoporus betulinus). Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources–often unknowingly–for millennia, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to the destruction of crops that were probably caused by <b>pathogenic</b> fungi.|$|E
5|$|Urnula craterium, when {{grown in}} liquid culture, {{produces}} bioactive chemicals that inhibit {{the growth of}} other fungi that are <b>pathogenic</b> to aspen; specifically, these chemical are antagonistic to aspen blue-stain fungi Ophiostoma crassivaginatum and O. piliferum, {{as well as the}} wood-decay fungus Phellinus tremulae. Chemicals produced by U.craterium include pestalotin, 5,6-dehydropestalotin, 4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-pyran-2-one, and (4S)-3,4-dihydro-4,8-dihydroxy-1(2H)-napthalenone. However, none of these isolated compounds inhibits the aspen pathogens in vitro, suggesting {{the true nature of the}} antifungal mechanism in the devil's urn has not yet been resolved.|$|E
25|$|Each virus subtype has mutated into {{a variety}} of strains with differing <b>pathogenic</b> profiles; some are <b>pathogenic</b> to one species but not others, some are <b>pathogenic</b> to {{multiple}} species.|$|E
