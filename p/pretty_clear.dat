Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

500|$|Hockey {{attempted}} to resolve his dilemma by declaring that as leader he {{would allow a}} conscience vote on the ETS legislation. Abbott rejected Hockey's declaration, and reneged on his earlier indication that he would withdraw his candidacy for Hockey. Abbott stated: [...] "It now seems <b>pretty</b> <b>clear</b> we could change the leader to Joe and these offensive bills could still go through the Parliament". On Hockey's candidacy, Turnbull claimed that Hockey had pledged {{his opposition to the}} spill motion. However, it was expected that if the spill motion succeeded, Hockey would stand for the leadership against Turnbull and Abbott. Hockey was generally expected to win the ballot and become leader. [...] To the end, Turnbull refused to stand aside as leader, insisting he would defeat the spill motion. Hockey later alleged that Turnbull had promised he would not stand against Hockey if the spill motion was successful. Turnbull denied that he had given, and therefore broken, any such undertaking.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{supposed}} {{to continue with the}} English plot of the first Blaster Master game. The Plutonium Boss originally intended to inject Jason and Fred with microbots that, even if Jason managed to defeat him, would kill both Jason and Fred, but he could only inject Fred. Jason and SOPHIA the 3rd are then shrunken and injected inside Fred to do battle with the microbots and their contraptions – something which Ireland described as [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>clear</b> video game spin on Fantastic Voyage kind of adventure". It was planned to be released for the Virtual Console on [...] for 500Wii points. IGN's Daemon Hatfield, after discovering nothing about Blaster Master: Destination Fred in any video game archives, suspected that this was an April Fools' Day hoax; he said, however, that after the release of Dark Void Zero it was possible for Sunsoft to release a new 8-bit title. Destructoid's Conrad Zimmerman strongly suspected that this was also a hoax; he said that there was no proof of the game's existence except for it temporarily being mentioned on Wikipedia and that [...] "Nintendo never lets anybody say when their games are coming out on Virtual Console". Sunsoft later confirmed on their website that the sequel was an April Fools' Day hoax.|$|E

Troops were rapidly concentrated at Klerksdorp.

500|$|Virginia's lay and {{religious}} leaders {{were more interested in}} prosecuting offenses such as gossip, slander, and fornication, seeing them as threats to social stability. They wished to avoid witchcraft prosecutions, which were divisive. Virginia courts were reluctant to hear accusations of witchcraft and were even more reluctant to convict. Unlike the Salem witch trial courts, where the accused had to prove her innocence, in Virginia courts the accuser carried the burden of proof. Further, Virginia courts generally ignored evidence said to have been obtained by supernatural means, whereas the New England courts were known to convict people based solely on it. Virginia required proof of guilt through either searches for witch's marks or ducking. Judges and magistrates would dismiss unsubstantiated cases of witchcraft and allow the accusers, who found themselves [...] "under an ill tongue", to be sued for slander. Frances Pollard of the Virginia Historical Society states: [...] "It was <b>pretty</b> <b>clear</b> that Virginia early on tried to discourage these charges being brought of witchcraft because they were so troublesome." [...] The southeastern corner of Virginia, around present-day Norfolk and Virginia Beach (where Pungo is located), saw more accusations of witchcraft than other areas. According to Leslie M. Newman, this may have been due to local poverty as there was no cultural elite to restrain such prosecutions.|$|E
500|$|Minority Report was {{the first}} film to have an entirely digital {{production}} design. Termed [...] "previz", as an abbreviation of previsualization (a term borrowed from the film's narrative), production designer Alex McDowell said the system allowed them to use Photoshop in place of painters, and employ 3-D animation programs (Maya and XSI) to create a simulated set, which could be filled with digital actors then used to block out shots in advance. The technology also allowed the tie-in video game and special effects companies to cull data from the previs system before the film was finished, which they used to establish parameters for their visuals. When Spielberg quickly became a fan, McDowell said [...] "t became <b>pretty</b> <b>clear</b> that [...] wouldn't read an illustration as a finished piece, but if you did it in Photoshop and created a photorealistic environment he focused differently on it." [...] Filming took place from March 22 to July 18, 2001, in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Los Angeles. Film locations included the Ronald Reagan Building (as PreCrime headquarters) and Georgetown. The skyline of Rosslyn, Virginia is visible when Anderton flies across the Potomac River. During production, Spielberg made regular appearances on a video-only webcam based in the craft services truck, both alone and with Tom Cruise; together they conferenced publicly with Ron Howard and Russell Crowe via a similar webcam {{on the set of}} [...] "A Beautiful Mind" [...] in New York.|$|E
500|$|Website reviewers deemed Soul Reavers {{gameplay}} too non-linear and {{its objectives}} too unclear. GameSpot criticized the warp system for using confusing symbols that did {{little or nothing}} to indicate the warp's destination, and weighed the fun of impaling vampires with the Soul Reaver against the lack of challenge presented by bosses and most enemies. Next Generation Magazine considered the game challenging due to [...] "difficult puzzles and lack of a map", requiring the player to backtrack. The Tampa Tribune also criticized the camera controls, though noted that the [...] "auto-facing" [...] feature made the difficulties negligible. PC Zone criticized the PC port of the game for [...] "chunky" [...] graphics and bad camera controls, stating [...] "it feels too much like a PlayStation release ported hurriedly on to the PC". Computer Gaming World similarly felt that the limitations of the PlayStation carried over in the PC port, rendering the latter's visuals [...] "mind-numbingly boring". The publication praised the Lucifer-based story for engaging players, but was disappointed that [...] "it peters out in an unsatisfying climax". Game Informer stated, [...] "Even after years in development, Soul Reaver doesn't feel finished. It feels rushed." [...] 1UP.com ranked Soul Reaver second on its [...] "Top 5 Games That Ended Halfway Through", stating [...] "it's <b>pretty</b> <b>clear</b> that the plot {{would have been a lot}} different if the money hadn't inconveniently run out." [...] GamesRadar placed Soul Reaver at #4 on a 2007 list of the top seven video game apocalypses, regarding the post-apocalyptic Nosgoth as [...] "one of the most fascinating wastelands we've ever explored".|$|E

A total loss of 251 lives from a country with a population of approximately 250,000 devastated families and communities.

[...] "It will <b>pretty</b> well <b>clear</b> out this place," [...] said one resident of the ship's loss.

60|$|We rose {{early in}} the morning, and reached the pretty quiet town of Castro by two o'clock. The old {{governor}} had died since our last visit, and a Chileno was acting in his place. We had a letter of introduction to Don Pedro, whom we found exceedingly hospitable and kind, and more disinterested than is usual {{on this side of}} the continent. The next day Don Pedro procured us fresh horses, and offered to accompany us himself. We proceeded to the south--generally following the coast, and passing through several hamlets, each with its large barn-like chapel built of wood. At Vilipilli, Don Pedro asked the commandant to give us a guide to Cucao. The old gentleman offered to come himself; but for a long time nothing would persuade him that two Englishmen really wished to go to such an out-of-the-way place as Cucao. We were thus accompanied by the two greatest aristocrats in the country, as was plainly to be seen in the manner of all the poorer Indians towards them. At Chonchi we struck across the island, following intricate winding paths, sometimes passing through magnificent forests, and sometimes through <b>pretty</b> <b>cleared</b> spots, abounding with corn and potato crops. This undulating woody country, partially cultivated, reminded me of the wilder parts of England, and therefore had to my eye a most fascinating aspect. At Vilinco, which is situated on the borders of the lake of Cucao, only a few fields were cleared; and all the inhabitants appeared to be Indians. This lake is twelve miles long, and runs in an east and west direction. From local circumstances, the sea-breeze blows very regularly during the day, and during the night it falls calm: this has given rise to strange exaggerations, for the phenomenon, as described to us at S. Carlos, was quite a prodigy.|$|R
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{is seen as}} a {{transitional}} stage for several characters in the series. The transformation of Rick Grimes to a dark character continues in the episode. He has changed from the person who wanted to save Merle Dixon (in Season 1) and find Sophia Peletier (first half of season 2), to the person who is willing to abandon any hope of finding Andrea. Furthermore, Rick yells at his group for being unappreciative of his sacrifices as a leader. This backlash and hostility has been interpreted as a foreshadowing event for future development for The Walking Dead. [...] "Rick is clearly in a much darker place now than he was {{at the start of the}} season," [...] concluded Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich. In a similar fashion, Lori Grimes is furious at Rick after he admits that he killed Shane Walsh. According to Kirkman, [...] "it looks <b>pretty</b> <b>clear</b> that he has lost [...] by doing this" [...] at the end of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire." [...] In response to the interactions between Rick and Lori, he opined: [...] "I think he feels that he has sacrificed for this group, and that sacrifice hasn’t really been appreciated. His confession to Lori did not get the reaction that he had hoped. He thought she would be supportive. Instead, she reacts in a particular way that he feels is hatred and disgust. I think that’s really affecting him. Let's not forget: This is taking place hours after he murdered his best friend. So he is still reeling. He’s trying to keep that a secret. He opens his heart to his wife, and it doesn’t go well. So I think that he’s just done with these people. I think he doesn’t want to be the leader. As he says: If they don’t like it, they’re free to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen James Walker, {{a writer}} of {{reference}} works on Doctor Who, gave an unfavourable review to Rose's return in [...] "Turn Left" [...] in his [...] "unauthorised guide to Doctor Whos fourth series," [...] Monsters Within. He thought that Billie Piper was [...] "distinctly below par", citing her gaunt and malnourished appearance, new hairstyle, and slight lisp as reasons why her acting was not her finest. He criticised {{her role in the}} episode, stating it had been [...] "far less well worked out" [...] than Donna's. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy also noted a change in Piper's enunciation; he compared her accent to [...] " [...] her mouth numbed with local anaesthetic". In Rawson-Jones' review of the series finalé he notes that whilst having the Doctor and Rose 'cop off' would be divisive with the shows audience, [...] "Davies wisely managed to please both parties" [...] by pairing her off with a human Doctor instead. However, IGN's Travis Fickett reacted unfavourably towards Rose's return and her pairing with the part human Doctor. He thought that it undermined her [...] "perfect send off" [...] in [...] "Doomsday" [...] as she was on the sidelines for much of [...] "Journey's End", and her ending up with the part human, part Time Lord Doctor [...] "feels like an insult to the character". Io9's Charlie Jane Anders also reacted unfavorably to Rose returning and wrote [...] "it was <b>pretty</b> <b>clear</b> that she was only there so she could get her pet faux-Doctor at the end." [...] Reviewers generally reacted positively to Piper's 2013 appearance in 50th anniversary episode [...] "The Day of the Doctor". Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph called her performance as the [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] Rose [...] "transfixing". Neela Debnath of The Independent praised the chemistry between Hurt and Piper and compared Piper's performance to Suranne Jones' portrayal of the TARDIS in [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] describing it as [...] "slightly eccentric", [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "off-the-wall". Daniel Martin of the Guardian praised Steven Moffat's decision not to extend Rose Tyler's story or re-unite her with the Tenth Doctor. He called Piper [...] "a true and unending legend of Doctor Who" [...] and stated that [...] "her wise rendition of the Bad Wolf avatar made a passable stab at the stealing of the show".|$|E

60|$|Similarly {{over at the}} Presbyterian Church, the {{minister}} says that his sacred calling will not allow him {{to take part in}} politics and that his sacred calling prevents him from breathing even a word of harshness against his fellow man, but {{that when it comes to}} the elevation of the ungodly into high places in the commonwealth (this means, of course, the nomination of the Conservative candidate) then he's not going to allow his sacred calling to prevent him from saying just what he thinks of it. And by that time, having <b>pretty</b> well <b>cleared</b> the church of Conservatives, he proceeds to show from the scriptures that the ancient Hebrews were Liberals to a man, except those who were drowned in the flood or who perished, more or less deservedly, in the desert.|$|R
50|$|The newly {{installed}} 999 kHz {{induction loop}} network was however much weaker {{than the original}} transmitter - 1 watt {{as opposed to the}} original 50 watts - and this allowed stations like Radio Tirana (from Albania) and Deutsche Welle (from Grigoriopol) a pretty much perfect interference pattern that silenced the station unless received close to an induction loop (located on each third floor of the towers). Accordingly, in 1983 URE applied to the Home Office to move to the <b>pretty</b> much <b>clear</b> and unoccupied channel of 319 meters (963 kHz). The unauthorised broadcaster Radio Caroline had the same idea and also promptly did so too. Because it was anchored just off the coast of Frinton-on-Sea (just a few miles from URE) it pretty much decimated any reception for the station. URE moved back to 999 kHz, and took 1602 kHz transmission off air at the same time.|$|R

40|$|Local {{spatial data}} {{infrastructure}} level (LSDI) covers managing of data in local administrative units (municipalities and cities). Precisely {{a local level}} is specific because the managed data are the most detailed, in the biggest scales, and therefore the most expensive to collect and update. The Zagreb City (capital city of Croatia) administration recognized in 2009 the importance of development of the area, and within work of the Coordination for creating Information system of the Zagreb City spatial management, started activities on the set-up of a Zagreb spatial data infrastructure (ZSDI). In the City of Zagreb many bodies of city administration use and create in their work daily various sets of spatial data and services.
