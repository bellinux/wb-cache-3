40|$|Offset journal {{bearings}} are an attractive design option for cross-head and <b>piston</b> <b>bearings</b> for two-stroke engines. Two-stroke engine design {{has seen a}} resurgence {{in the last few}} years due to potential gains in engine efficiency over their four-stroke counterparts. The cross-head and <b>piston</b> <b>bearings</b> comprising such engines, however, are characterized by non-reversing loads with limited oscillating journal motion, the combination of which provides poor bearing performance for conventional cylindrical bearings. The division of bearing journal and sleeve into offset segments allows for periodic load relaxation in the segments and development of squeeze-film action which substantially improves bearing performance. Offset bearings have been in production for the past 60 years, but there are no general design guidelines available to the engine analyst. This thesis provides predictions of the primary bearing performance factors, cyclic-minimum film thickness and cyclic-maximum film pressure, over a wide range of design parameters found in production-level, two-stroke engines...|$|E

50|$|The oiling system {{addresses}} {{the need to}} properly lubricate an engine when it’s running. Properly lubricating an engine not only reduces friction between moving parts but is also the main method by which heat is removed from <b>pistons,</b> <b>bearings,</b> and shafts. Failing to properly lubricate an engine will result in engine failure. The oil pump forces the motor oil through the passages in the engine to properly distribute oil to different engine components. In a common oiling system, oil is drawn out of the oil sump (oil pan, in US English) through a wire mesh strainer that removes {{some of the larger}} pieces of debris from the oil. The flow made by the oil pump allows the oil to be distributed around the engine. In this system, oil flows through an oil filter and sometimes an oil cooler, before going through the engine’s oil passages and being dispersed to lubricate pistons, rings, springs, valve stems, and more.|$|R

A comparison of data taken before and after the windtunnel tests (at room temperature) showed that both the effective spring rate and the piston friction had decreased during the wind tunnel tests. In neither the effective spring rate nor the piston friction was the magnitude of change great enough to cause significant impairment of overall system effectiveness. No major valve mechanical problems were encountered in any of the tests. During high temperature bench tests, piston frictional drag increased.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center is {{supporting}} {{the development of}} a Stirling converter with the Department of Energy (DOE, Germantown, Maryland) for an advanced Stirling Radioisotope Power System (SRPS) to provide spacecraft onboard electric power for NASA space science missions. A key technology assessment completed by Glenn and DOE has led to the SRPS being identified as a high-efficiency power source for such deep space missions as the Europa Orbiter and the Solar Probe. In addition, the Stirling system is now being considered for unmanned Mars rovers, especially where mission profiles may exclude the use of photovoltaic power systems, such as exploration at high Martian latitudes or for missions of long duration. The SRPS efficiency of over 20 percent will reduce the required amount of radioisotope by more than a factor of 3 in comparison to current radioisotope thermoelectric generators. This significantly reduces radioisotope cost, radiological inventory, and system cost, and it provides efficient use of scarce radioisotope resources. In support of this technology assessment, Glenn conducted a series of independent evaluations and tests to determine the technology readiness of a 55 -We Stirling converter developed by Stirling Technology Company (Kennewick, Washington) and DOE. Key areas evaluated by Glenn included: 1) Radiation tolerance of materials; 2) Random vibration testing of the Stirling converter in Glenn's Structural Dynamics Lab to simulate operation in the launch environment; 3) Electromagnetic interference and compatibility (EMI/EMC) of the converter operating in Glenn's EMI lab; Independent failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis, and life and reliability 4. Independent failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis, and life and reliability assessment; and 5) SRPS cost estimate. The data from these evaluations were presented to NASA Headquarters and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory mission office by a joint industry/Government team consisting of DOE, Glenn, and Lockheed Martin Astronautics. This team concluded that there are no technical reasons that would rule out using the Stirling converter for deep space missions. As {{a direct result of the}} successful testing at Glenn, the DOE/Stirling Technology Company 55 -We Stirling converter has been baselined for the SRPS.
