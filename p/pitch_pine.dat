Her coppering at Woolwich was finished on 12 October 1795 and she was fitted-out at a further cost of £9,390. The Admiralty ordered a second pair of Amazon-class ships on 24 January 1795. They were marginally smaller at 925 tons (bm) and were built from <b>pitch</b> <b>pine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nescopeck Mountain is one {{of several}} {{mountains}} in Columbia County to contain undisturbed oak/mixed hardwood forests. This forest is also an Appalachian Oak Forest. Specific tree species on the ridge in Columbia County include red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black birch, American chestnut, <b>pitch</b> <b>pine,</b> red maple, and serviceberry. Other plants on the ridge include black huckleberry, lowbush blueberry, mountain laurel, sheep's laurel, bracken fern, wild sarsaparilla, and Virginia creeper.|$|E
5|$|The fantail was made. Some of {{the small}} gears were replaced. The stocks were made from <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter {{included}} repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.|$|E
50|$|One ecosystem, {{located in}} Cattus Island Park, is a {{maritime}} upland pine/oak forest, which consists mostly of oak trees and pine trees, {{such as the}} <b>pitch</b> <b>pines</b> and the short leaf pines.

5|$|A two-week work-in {{was held}} at the end of July and {{beginning}} of August 1980. Thirty-three volunteers worked on the mill over the work-in. Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds. On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast-iron curb sections.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century {{interiors}} could {{often be}} lavish and eclectic. The origins of this style were in Scott's Abbotsford, where the author began {{the incorporation of}} actual old architectural fragments and pieces of furniture on a lavish scale (the effective beginning of 'antique' collecting in Scotland). He also initiated the treatment of new surfaces so as to resemble old ones, with new wood darkened to resemble old oak. The Adam solution of a castellated exterior with a neo-classical interior was abandoned and in Baronial revival houses this change was extended to create a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, such as plastered or rubble walls, unpainted stone fireplaces and <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> timberwork, with seventeenth-century style plaster ceilings. To this were added symbols of landed power and national affiliation, including displays of tartan, weaponry and stuffed animals' heads. Integrated into these traditional materials and styles were modern fittings such as sprung upholstery, gaslighting and water-closets.|$|E
5|$|The {{stocks and}} sails were {{made during the}} two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people {{attending}} over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.|$|E
50|$|This plant occurs {{mainly in}} coastal pine plant communities, such as pine barrens. It {{is common in}} the Pine Barrens of New Jersey and on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket in Massachusetts. It occurs on Long Island with <b>pitch</b> <b>pines.</b> The soils are dry and sandy. The plant grows easily on dunes and beaches. The climate is humid and windy. The plant does not {{tolerate}} shade.|$|R
40|$|To help {{understand}} {{the effect of}} short term climatic changes on ring width variations of trees on Long Island, time series were performed on 6 Liriondendrin tuliperfera (tulip poplars) and 1 white oak from Caumsett State Park, and 6 Pinus rigidas (<b>pitch</b> <b>pines)</b> from Sears Bellows and Hubbard County Parks. Prolonged drought periods on Long Island occur during years 1927 - 1932, 1960 - 1970 and 1980 - 1988. All trees document drought periods by marked decrease in growth ring width regardless of specie or location. In addition base cations were analyzed in two tulip trees and two <b>pitch</b> <b>pines.</b> Based on {{the limited number of}} trees in this study there is a suggestion that Ca concentration in tree rings may be increasing with time. According to studies done in other areas (Aberg 1995, Bondietti et al 1989, Likens et al 1996), the increase of available base cations such as Ca is a precursor to the impending decrease in its availability due to removal of base cations from the system by acid rain. The implications of an increase in Ca followed by a decrease in Ca available to trees may be detrimental to Long Island’s trees and the Pine Barrens ecosystem...|$|R
5000|$|Results {{illustrated}} that {{objects were}} multi-layer structured, the lacquer layer was mainly composed of aged laccol with some urushiol, drying oil and cedrol oil, the coating {{was based on}} oxidised shellac and oil-resinous varnish composed of linseed oil and Manila copal among the Chinese lacquers. Heat-bodied linseed oil, oxidised shellac, aged urushiol and soot or tar were also detected in the Japanese panels. As for the European ones, traces of <b>pine</b> <b>pitch</b> or <b>pine</b> resins were found in addition to linseed oil.|$|R
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E
5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, <b>Pitch</b> <b>Pine,</b> and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E
25|$|HMS Cameleon (or Camelion) was a Royal Navy Diligence-class brig-sloop, {{launched}} in 1795. She was built of fir (<b>pitch</b> <b>pine),</b> which allowed for rapid construction, {{but at the}} expense of durability. She captured some small vessels and a privateer, and served in the Mediterranean before being laid up in 1805, and broken up in 1811.|$|E
2500|$|The Pine Barrens, {{also known}} as the Pinelands or simply the Pines, is a heavily forested area of coastal plain {{stretching}} across more than seven counties of New Jersey. The name [...] "pine barrens" [...] refers to the area's sandy, acidic, nutrient-poor soil. Although European settlers could not cultivate their familiar crops there, the unique ecology of the Pine Barrens supports a diverse spectrum of plant life, including orchids and carnivorous plants. The area is also notable for its populations of rare pygmy <b>Pitch</b> <b>Pines</b> and other plant species that depend on the frequent fires of the Pine Barrens to reproduce. The sand that composes much of the area's soil is referred to by the locals as sugar sand.|$|R
60|$|Squirrels {{and wild}} mice disputed for my store of nuts. There were scores of <b>pitch</b> <b>pines</b> around my house, {{from one to}} four inches in diameter, which had been gnawed by mice the {{previous}} winter--a Norwegian winter for them, for the snow lay long and deep, and they were obliged to mix {{a large proportion of}} pine bark with their other diet. These trees were alive and apparently flourishing at midsummer, and many of them had grown a foot, though completely girdled; but after another winter such were without exception dead. It is remarkable that a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinner, gnawing round instead of up and down it; but perhaps it is necessary in order to thin these trees, which are wont to grow up densely.|$|R
50|$|The {{commercial}} use of fatwood from stumps stemmed from its {{use to make}} <b>pitch</b> and <b>pine</b> tar.

25|$|Efforts {{to battle}} forest fire attract {{debate over how}} to best {{preserve}} the Pine Barrens. While fires constitute a danger to property and inhabitants, preservationists argue that eliminating forest fires would cause the Pine Barrens to become dominated by oak trees. A few areas which had previously consisted of scrub and <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> have become dominated by oak trees because of intervention after settlement to reduce the frequency of forest fires.|$|E
25|$|In {{southern}} Michigan {{and northern}} Indiana, which are {{mainly in the}} oak-hickory and elm-ash-cottonwood cover types, trees utilized as roosts include green, white, and black ash (Fraxinus nigra), silver maple, shagbark hickory, and American elm. And finally, in the southern areas of the Indiana bat's range (primarily Tennessee, Arkansas, and northern Alabama), which include the oak-hickory and oak-pine cover types, Indiana bats utilize shagbark hickory, white oak, red oak, <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> (P. rigida), shortleaf pine (P. echinata), loblolly pine (P. taeda), sweet birch (Betula lenta), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis).|$|E
25|$|Forest fires play an {{important}} role in regulating the growth of plants in the Pine Barrens. Frequent light fires tend to reduce the amount of undergrowth and promote the growth of mature trees. Forest fires have contributed to the dominance of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> in the Pine Barrens. They can resist and recover quickly from fire by resprouting directly through their bark (something very unusual for pines). Their serotinous pine cones open only after having been heated by a fire. The prevalence of forest fire allows the pitch pines to dominate over oaks, which by comparison are usually killed outright by a moderate or intense fire. High air temperatures and dry plant undergrowth contribute to the intensity of the fire. While severe fires are uncommon, severe fires at fairly frequent intervals can eliminate species that do not bear seed at an early age. Frequent killing fires keep an area covered with small sprouts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{west end}} of Saratoga, within three miles of the Wisconsin River, was in the [...] "Indian strip," [...] sold by the Menominee to the U.S. {{government}} in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars. As such, it was logged and surveyed early. In 1839 a crew working for the U.S. government first surveyed what would become parts of Saratoga, walking through the woods and crossing the river, measuring with chain and compass. In 1851 a different crew surveyed the section lines. For the six mile square that now contains western Saratoga, see their description under Port Edwards. For the eastern six miles of Saratoga, they gave this general description:The Character of this town is easily described. It is a uniform pine barren. Soil white sand.

60|$|In {{one room}} they stored nuts and acorns, rose and holly berries, a dried apple or two, and many pine cones to burn; for Dart showed {{her a little}} fireplace, and told her the Kobolds kept {{themselves}} very warm and jolly at their work. In another room they spread moss and dry grass for beds, and there the seven little men would sleep like dormice. The empty cocoon of a caterpillar still hung in one corner, and Bud said that should be her hammock with a curtain made of woven yellow bindweed hung before the nook. They swept the floor with fir-needle brooms, and spread a carpet of red oak leaves, which gave a very gay air to the place. Then Dart left Bud to fill a row of acorn cups with water from a spring near by, while he ran off to nibble splinters from the <b>pitch</b> <b>pines</b> to make torches for the Kobolds, {{who worked in the}} evening and needed light.|$|R
25|$|The wood {{used for}} the {{planking}} varies depending on where in the ship it is laid and what structural purpose it serves: The inner layer is Scots pine while the 6-inch skin is made of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine,</b> Honduras mahogany or oak. The outer hull is made of English Elm and Greenheart. Oak beams run across the hull forming three decks - the lower deck beams are 11inches (27.9cm) square in cross-section and are placed less than three feet (0.9m) apart along the ship's length. Seven transverse bulkheads, also of wood, provide additional strength and ensured that any flooding caused by ice damage would not flood the entire ship. To prevent damage from ice floes or crushing the two-blade propeller could be hoisted {{out of the way}} and the rudder could be easily detached and stored aboard. Iron-shod bows were severely raked so that when ramming the ice they would ride up over the margin and crush the ice with deadweight. The coal bunkers on each side contained a steel tank, each of which could hold 60 tons of fresh water. On the long ocean trip to and from New Zealand these tanks could hold additional coal but for the Antarctic voyage the extra water capacity was more important. The metal tanks also contributed to the strength of the lower hull around the boiler and engine spaces.|$|E

500|$|New oak joists {{were laid}} on the dust floor and {{temporary}} boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs {{to the top of}} the mill tower. The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was repairable. A replacement main beam was made from <b>pitch</b> <b>pine,</b> and the oak beam was repaired. New oak joists were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail. Some of the joists were made from <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> from the Eastbridge Windpump, which, following its collapse on 19 February 1977, had been re-erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life, Stowmarket. [...] The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new lintels were made for some of the windows. A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed.|$|E
60|$|They all, however, {{appeared}} to gain patience and hardihood as they proceeded, and for fourteen days kept steadily on, making {{a distance of}} about three hundred and thirty miles. For some days, the range of mountains which had been near to their wigwam kept parallel to the river at no great distance, but at length subsided into hills. Sometimes they found the river bordered with alluvial bottoms, and groves with cotton-wood and willows; sometimes the adjacent country was naked and barren. In one place it ran for a considerable distance between rocky hills and promontories covered with cedar and <b>pitch</b> <b>pines,</b> and peopled with the bighorn and the mountain deer; at other places it wandered through prairies well stocked with buffaloes and antelopes. As they descended the course of the river, they began to perceive the ash and white oak here and there among the cotton-wood and willow; and at length caught a sight of some wild horses on the distant prairies.|$|R
