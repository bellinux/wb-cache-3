40|$|We {{describe}} {{a variant of}} a domain decomposition method proposed by Gleicher and Kass for intersecting and trimming <b>parametric</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Instead of using interval arithmetic to guide the decomposition, the variant described here uses affine arithmetic, a tool recently proposed for range analysis. Affine arithmetic is similar to standard interval arithmetic, but takes into account correlations between operands and sub-formulas, generally providing much tighter bounds for the computed quantities. As a consequence, the quadtree domain decompositions are much smaller and the intersection algorithm runs faster.

40|$|Capillarity functionals are {{parameter}} invariant functionals defined on {{classes of}} two-dimensionals <b>parametric</b> <b>surfaces</b> in R 3 as {{the sum of}} the area integral with an anisotropic term of suitable form. In the class of <b>parametric</b> <b>surfaces</b> with the topological type of S 2 and with fixed volume, extremals of capillarity functionals are surfaces whose mean curvature is prescribed up to a constant. For a certain class of anisotropies vanishing at infinity, we prove existence and nonexistence of volume- constrained, S 2 -type, minimal surfaces for the corresponding capillarity functionals. Moreover, in some cases, we show existence of extremals for the full isoperimetric inequality. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
