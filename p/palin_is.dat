In January 2009, Margery Eagan of the Boston Herald penned a column, [...] "Unbearable Mama Grizzly clawing way to Oval Office" [...] in which she noted that a YouTube interview of Palin had nearly three quarters of a million views, proving [...] "that mama 'grizzly,' as she called herself, remains irresistible." [...] The Vancouver, Washington newspaper, The Columbian, commented in January 2009 that, [...] "Sarah <b>Palin</b> <b>is</b> on the prowl, snorting that when the media poke fun at her family, it brings out the mama grizzly in her." [...] The connection between Palin and [...] "mamma grizzly" [...] was made internationally in July 2009 when the New Delhi, India-based Hindustan Times reported on a Palin tweet describing mama grizzly bears in Alaska.

A New York Times article explains, [...] "Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin have little in common beyond their breakout performances at the conventions and the soap opera aspects of their family lives. Mrs. Clinton always faces high expectations; Ms. Palin faced low expectations this week, and benefited from them. Mrs. Clinton can seem harsh when she goes on the attack; Ms. Palin has shown a knack for attacking without seeming nasty. Mrs. Clinton has a lot of experience; Ms. Palin, not so much. Mrs. Clinton is pantsuits; Ms. <b>Palin</b> <b>is</b> skirts." [...] Guy Cecil, the former political director of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said it was [...] "insulting" [...] for Republicans to compare Ms. Palin to Mrs. Clinton." [...] The Saturday Night Live skit [...] "A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton" [...] counterpoised Palin, played by Tina Fey, against Hillary Clinton, played by Amy Poehler. The skit pointed out their opposing political views and presented Palin as unversed in global politics, as emphasized by the line: [...] "I can see Russia from my house." [...] Ex-Hewlett-Packard chief executive and former McCain advisor Carly Fiorina blasted the Saturday Night Live sketch in a television interview: [...] "They were defining Hillary Clinton as very substantive and Sarah Palin as totally superficial," [...] and an ABC news blog headline soon after ran, [...] "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although she {{canceled}} the bridge, Palin spent $25 {{million from the}} $223 million earmark to build the road on Gravina Island to an empty beach where the bridge would have gone. State officials said [...] "they were going ahead with the $25 million road because the money would otherwise have {{to be returned to}} the federal government." [...] The cancellation of the bridge did not lead Palin to return any of the remaining $197 million in the earmark to the Federal Government. Palin's Ketchikan campaign coordinator Mike Elerding, says, [...] "She said 'thanks but no thanks,' but they kept the money." [...] According to Palin’s communications director Bill McAlister, the bridge [...] "isn't necessarily dead"; it may still be built with [...] "a less costly design". Palin changed her mind on the bridge, he said, when [...] "she saw that Alaska was being perceived as taking from the country and not giving, and that impression bothered her and she wants to change it. [...] I think that Sarah <b>Palin</b> <b>is</b> someone who has the courage to re-evaluate situations as they developed." [...] Palin said through her spokesperson that the road would open territory for development. A McCain-Palin spokesperson said that [...] "because the contract for the road was already signed before she got into office, the governor was left no viable alternative." [...] The Alaska Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration state that the contract could have been cancelled at minimal cost and that the federal money could have been returned to Congress for other uses, if the road had been cancelled when Palin took office in December 2006, but the bridge to the island was not cancelled until September 2007.|$|E
