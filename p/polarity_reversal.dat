40|$|We {{studied the}} {{remanent}} magnetization of a sedimentary core PC 2 (6. 48 m length) drilled during the MR 99 -K 05 cruise of JAMSTEC {{in the western}} Arctic Ocean. Discrete specimens and u-channel samples {{were used in the}} study. In the discrete specimens, the change of remanent magnetization with depth show many clear <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals</b> in both inclination and declination. Furthermore, most reversals in discrete specimens correlated well with those in the u-channel samples. Core PC 2 is characterized by distinct alternations of dark gray and brownish layers. Through comparison of lithostratigraphic cycles with glacial-interglacial cycles (referring to R. L. Phillips and A. Grantz, Geol. Soc. Am. Bull., 109, 1101, 1997), sedimentary cycles of core PC 2 are correlated to marine isotope stages up to MIS- 8. This indicates that <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals</b> of remanent magnetization in core PC 2 are geomagnetic excursions in the Brunhes epoch. Comparison with the previously known geomagnetic excursions shows that the <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals</b> are clear and have long duration in core PC 2.

40|$|Wnt and Netrin {{signaling}} regulate diverse essential functions. Using {{a genetic}} approach combined with temporal gene expression analysis, {{we found a}} regulatory link between the Wnt receptor MOM- 5 /Frizzled and the UNC- 6 /Netrin receptor UNC- 5. These two receptors play key roles in guiding cell and axon migrations, including the migration of the C. elegans Distal Tip Cells (DTCs). DTCs migrate post-embryonically in three sequential phases: {{in the first phase}} along the Antero-Posterior (A/P) axis, in the second, along the Dorso-Ventral (D/ V) axis, and in the third, along the A/P axis. Loss of MOM- 5 /Frizzled function causes third phase A/P <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals</b> of the migrating DTCs. We show that an over-expression of UNC- 5 causes similar DTC A/P <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals</b> and that unc- 5 deficits markedly suppress the A/P <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals</b> caused by mutations inmom- 5 /frizzled. This implicates MOM- 5 / Frizzled as a negative regulator of unc- 5. We provide further evidence that small GTPases mediate MOM- 5 ’s regulation of unc- 5 such that one outcome of impaired function of small GTPases like CED- 10 /Rac and MIG- 2 /RhoG is an increase in unc- 5 function.

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of subduction <b>polarity</b> <b>reversal</b> {{has been identified}} in the collision of an intra-oceanic subduction system, which is the collision of two oceanic plates. When two oceanic plates migrate towards each other, one subducts below the other. Generally, the oceanic plate with higher density subducts beneath {{and the other one}} overrides the down-going slab. The process continues until a buoyant continental margin sitting {{on the top of the}} subducting plate is introduced into the down-going slab. The subduction of the slab becomes slower and may even cease.

The LGE is characterized by gradual variation of <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals</b> in the initiation and abrupt shifting in the end in the latest publication based on a full-vector assessment (Lund et al. 2017). In the CLP, the VGPs of the LGE show two obvious <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals</b> (VGPs >[*] 45 °) separated by backward trends in Weinan section and abrupt <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals</b> in Gulang section.

Moreover, there is a similar chronology estimation of the LGE record between the BYH and Gulang loess. As illustrated in Sun et al.

The BYH section is located in the southern margin of the Gurbantunggut Desert, similar to the Gulang section that is situated in the southern margin of the Badain Jaran Desert. The higher sedimentary rate along with limited pedogenesis may possibly facilitate the record of LGE in the BYH section.|$|R
40|$|This paper extends {{an earlier}} {{investigation}} by Willis & Young (1987), {{in which an}} exact equation was derived for the magnetic field lines of the general axisymmetric magnetic multipole of arbitrary degree (n). Exact equations are derived for the magnetic field lines of two special non-axisymmetric magnetic multipoles of arbitrary degree, which may be classified as either symmetric or antisymmetric sectorial multipoles. These results have applications in studies of the possible nature of solar-terrestrial physics during geomagnetic <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals.</b> The magnetic-field-line configurations for these two non-axisymmetric multipoles are discussed in detail and are illustrated for low-degree (2 s n s 4) multipoles. It is shown {{that the existence of}} magnetic neutral lines is a characteristic feature of such non-axisymmetric rnultipoles. These neutral lines define localized regions of space (‘rnag-netospheric cusps’) through which charged particles can gain access to the inner magneto-sphere. Moreover, both non-axisymmetric magnetic fields are locally perpendicular to a set of meridional planes and one is locally perpendicular to the equatorial plane. Therefore, there exist classes of charged-particle trajectories for which motion is confined completely to these meridional planes, or the equatorial plane, and every particle executing such planar motion is scattered non-adiabatically when it encounters a neutral line. This result emphasizes the need for a more detailed study of the motion of charged particles in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric multipole magnetic fields before firm conclusions can be reached on possible changes in geomagnetically trapped radiation during <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals.</b> Key words: geomagnetic <b>polarity</b> <b>reversals,</b> magnetic field lines, non-axisymmetric magnetic multipoles, solar-terrestrial physics...|$|R
