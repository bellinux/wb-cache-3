Flue gas, from 1600 MW combined cycle <b>plant,</b> <b>addition</b> (4 – 5 % volume CO 2) not only increased biomass productivity but also improved efficiency of total nitrogen removal (TNRE) and total phosphorus removal (TPRE). The differences between the HRAP and HRAP + S were significant at all the flue gas injection flow rates tested. HRAP + S reached maximum TNRE, TPRE and biomass productivity (92. 15 ± 1. 45 %, 95. 10 ± 0. 84 % and 19. 77 ± 0. 38 g m− 2 d− 1, respectively) at a flow rate of 15 L min− 1, while the HRAP reached similar productivity levels at 20 L min− 1. TPBR showed an initial lower carbon limitation than HRAP and HRAP + S, but nevertheless a strong inhibition was observed in TPBR {{at the end of}} the test.

Ing.

It is also studied the possible effect of additives - complex agents and growth stimulators on uptake and translocation of contaminant from roots to shoot.

40|$|Abstract — Most {{systems that}} require the {{operator}} control {{can be considered as}} man-machine cooperative systems in whose functioning, humans, machines and other unintelligent parts play specific roles. Each role has a value. The recently developed machine intelligence quotient (MIQ) measures the contribution provided by the machines to a system. However, for a more practical decision making process, one needs to also consider the cost of improvements. We propose a simple measure cost-benefit criterion which enhances the aforementioned concept by adjusting it for cost, cost adjusted MIQ (CAMIQ). The method can be especially useful when trying to determine the best solution among several contenders which are similarly valued, but costwise different. working together. Human controller makes strategic choices; intelligent system executes the orders and generates subset of orders for non intelligent parts of the <b>plant.</b> <b>Addition</b> of a unit to the man-machine cooperative system involves cost of the added unit and the installation costs. Benefits of the added system appear as increase in performance, or reduction in complexity of the whole manmachine cooperative system which may be translated into some monetary terms. By determining the ratio of cost to benefit, one may assess the value of the addition.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} use of ozone and hydrogen peroxide promised a considerably improved oxidative {{attack on the}} organic contents of {{the water of the}} Ruhr and, related to this, an improved decomposition of the organic substances in the biologically functioning slow sand filters following the oxidative process. The research project was conducted on-line in the waterworks. The H_ 2 O_ 2 was added at various places in the installed ozone process and tests were made by means of single parameters and sum parameters to demonstrate improved ozone attack. Due to the mode of operation of the ozone <b>plant</b> <b>addition</b> of ozone per m" 3 of raw water was limited. At doses of > 1. 8 g/m" 3 free ozone escaped into the building so that the tests had to be limited to ozone doses of #<=# 1. 8 g/m" 3. No clearly reproducible proof of improved decomposition was obtained neither with the sum parameters (SAK 254, DOC or UV-CSB) nor with the single parameters (complexing agent NTA, EDTA, PBSM). The results of the tests showed an improved decomposition or a decrease of the parameters, however, the measured differences lay within the measuring accuracy so that we arrived at a postulation of a positive trend. Clear and reproducible improvements through the peroxone process were only yielded in the individual determination of pharmaceuticals. (orig.)

40|$|Predation by {{exotic species}} {{has caused the}} {{extinction}} of many native animal species on islands, whereas competition from exotic plants has caused few native plant extinctions. Exotic <b>plant</b> <b>addition</b> to islands is highly nonrandom, with an almost perfect 1 to 1 match {{between the number of}} naturalized and native plant species on oceanic islands. Here, we evaluate several alternative implications of these findings. Does the consistency of increase in plant richness across islands imply that a saturation point in species richness has been reached? If not, should we expect total plant richness to continue to increase as new species are added? Finally, is the rarity of native plant extinctions to date a misleading measure of the impact of past invasions, one that hides an extinction debt that will be paid in the future? By analyzing historical records, we show that the number of naturalized plant species has increased linearly over time on many individual islands. Further, the mean ratio of naturalized to native plant species across islands has changed steadily for nearly two centuries. These patterns suggest that many more species will become naturalized on islands in the future. We also discuss how dynamics of invasion bear upon alternative saturation scenarios and the implications these scenarios have for the future retention or extinction of native plant species. Finally, we identify invasion-motivated research gaps (propagule pressure, time-lags to extinction, abundance shifts, and loss of area) that can aid in forecasting extinction and in developing a more comprehensive theory of species extinctions...|$|E

40|$|Ehrharta erecta (panic veldt grass) is an {{actively}} spreading invasive {{grass in}} California with an uncommon capacity to invade forest understory. Greater {{understanding of the}} ecology, impacts, and potential for control of this invader is needed to set priorities and guide management. In a mixed-evergreen forest in Santa Cruz County, we measured impacts of E. erecta on native plant species richness and abundance, quantified the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical management methods, and tested whether this species forms a seed bank. We found lower percent cover of native species in plots invaded by E. erecta compared to nearby non-invaded plots, {{but we did not}} find significant differences in species richness, and we did not find a significant relationship between E. erecta cover and native cover in invaded plots. Strikingly, we measured nearly four times greater total vegetation cover in E. erecta invaded plots. Twenty-two months following management treatments, we found significant reductions in E. erecta using both mechanical and chemical methods. Herbicide application produced greater non-target effects. In a separate experiment, we tested the effects of native <b>plant</b> <b>addition</b> on restoration outcomes and regrowth of E. erecta. Transplanting native Clinopodium douglasii into management plots did not slow regrowth of E. erecta. Transplants did increase the percent cover native plants, but only by increasing C. douglasii itself. Finally, in a greenhouse experiment we compared the number of E. erecta germinants from duff and soil collected from two depths. Ehrharta erecta germinated from all three substrates, with the greatest number of germinants in the upper soil layer, suggesting that E. erecta seeds accumulate in the soil over time. The results of this research demonstrate that E. erecta drives ecological change in a mixed-evergreen forest community, effective management is possible using manual and chemical removal methods, and restoration of native species can be promoted through planting. Since we found evidence that E. erecta forms a seed bank, we recommend rapid response to E. erecta invasion and consideration of management methods that have low soil disturbance in treating established E. erecta populations...|$|E
