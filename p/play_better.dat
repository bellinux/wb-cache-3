5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and <b>play</b> <b>better</b> for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.|$|E
5|$|The 1920 Muncie Flyers {{season was}} the franchise's inaugural {{season in the}} American Professional Football League (APFA)—later named the National Football League. The Flyers entered the season coming off a 4–1–1 record in 1919. Several representatives from the Ohio League wanted {{to form a new}} {{professional}} league; thus, the APFA was created. The 1920 team only played in one game that counted in the standings: a 45–0 loss against the Rock Island Independents. This game and the Columbus Panhandles–Dayton Triangles on the same date is considered to be the first league game featuring two APFA teams. The Flyers tried to schedule other games, but the opponents canceled to <b>play</b> <b>better</b> teams. As a result, the Flyers had to play the rest of the season's game versus local teams. In week 10, the Flyers won a game against the Muncie Offers More AC for the Muncie City Championship. No players from the 1920 Muncie Flyers were listed on the 1920 All-Pro Team, and no player has been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

25|$|The {{modern era}} of fifing in America began in about 1880, with the popularizing of {{civilian}} fife and drum corps {{in a musical}} tradition {{that has come to}} be known as Ancient fife and drum (or simply Ancient). The rise of these corps led to a demand for fifes that were superior in intonation and better suited for group playing than those used during the Civil War. This call was answered by the Cloos Company of Brooklyn, New York, and their Crosby Model fife. These fifes were one piece, cylindrical bore instruments with six irregularly sized and placed tone-holes. Compared to fifes made before this time, Cloos fifes were easier to <b>play,</b> <b>better</b> tuned, and produced a much louder sound.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Jackets {{would get}} off to a solid start in 2003–04, winning three of their first four games, though the club would {{eventually}} go on a seven-game losing streak to quickly fall out of playoff contention. Columbus would continue to struggle, and General Manager and Head Coach Doug MacLean announced on January 1, 2004, that he would step down from head coaching duties, naming Blue Jackets assistant coach and former NHL player Gerard Gallant as his replacement. Columbus posted a 9–21–4–3 record under MacLean. While the Blue Jackets would <b>play</b> <b>better</b> hockey with Gallant behind the bench, the team would fail once again to earn a playoff spot, as they finished the season with a 25–45–8–4 record for 62 points—seven fewer than the previous season—and finish 29 points the Nashville Predators for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. Columbus, however, climbed out of the basement in the Central Division {{for the first time in}} franchise history after finishing ahead of the Chicago Blackhawks.|$|E
25|$|The Ducks {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season, going 1–5, but reversed the sluggish start with a sweep of a four-game road trip, winning games in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Columbus. The Ducks won eight of nine games from there before adversity struck. Defenseman Francois Beauchemin suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament after taking a slapshot off the ankle {{in a game against}} Nashville. Days later, Brian Burke resigned from his position as general manager, handing over the reigns to right-hand man Bob Murray as the former leave to take the same position with the Toronto Maple Leafs just days later. Young forward Bobby Ryan was then called up to the team from the Iowa Chops, the Ducks' AHL affiliate. Reports indicated Ryan was good enough to make the team out of camp but was sent down only due to salary cap restraints. The Ducks continued to <b>play</b> <b>better,</b> but went only 9–13–2 heading to the All-Star break. Three Anaheim Ducks players, Ryan Getzlaf, Jean-Sebastien Giguere and Scott Niedermayer, were all named starters for the All-Star Game, held in Montreal. The Ducks fortunes, however, did not change much after the break, as the team lost four out of their next six games.|$|E

25|$|With this {{domestic}} {{record of}} captaincy success, Deane was picked as captain for the South Africa side for the 1927–28 English tour of South Africa, ahead of Herbie Taylor who {{had led the}} 1924 tour of England, but whose form had reportedly suffered in the big matches from {{the pressures of the}} captaincy. Poor batting led to defeat in the first match of the series and in the second the South Africans had a first-innings lead of 117, with Deane contributing 41 to a total of 250, but still lost the match by 87 runs. The turnaround in the series started with third Test, which was drawn with the South Africans finally posting a respectable total. Deane was instrumental in this: in the first innings, with the score at 146 for seven, he and Buster Nupen both made scores of more than 50, with Deane going on to 77. In the second innings, an all-round better batting performance by the South Africans secured the draw with Deane making a further 73. A new fast-medium bowling combination allied to less brittle batting brought a South African victory in the fourth Test, with Deane batting when victory by four wickets was achieved. And the series was tied at two wins apiece with a South African victory in the final match by eight wickets. As captain, Deane won the toss five times out of five in the series; unusually for the time in which he played, he put the England team in to bat three times, claiming that his young side would <b>play</b> <b>better</b> if they knew the odds they had to face.|$|E

Having rehearsed and written enough material for an album, the group entered Island Studios in August 1973. As with Foxtrot, John Burns helped with production. Burns' technical skills resulted in a good recorded sound and environment, and this motivated the group to <b>play</b> <b>better</b> and tackle more complex arrangements. Banks recalled the sessions being difficult, adding [...] "it {{was hard to get}} things going".

The show received rave reviews and was followed by Grand Street Follies of 1929. These roles led to a part in George Kelly's Maggie the Magnificent, a play the critics disliked, though they liked Cagney's performance. Cagney saw this role (and Women Go on Forever) as significant because of the talented directors he met. He learned [...] "...what a director was for and what a director could do.

Elsewhere, Maguire whitewashed UK champion Matthew Stevens 5–0, outscoring him 427–68. O'Sullivan extended his unbeaten run to 12 matches when he defeated Parrott 5–2, in a match that lasted two hours and 28 minutes and which featured a lot of tactical, disjointed exchanges. He was not satisfied with his performance, however: [...] "I was awful—if I keep playing like that they'll have to call the nuthouse to come and collect me". 1997 world champion Ken Doherty, who was ranked seventh but had slipped to fifteenth in the provisional rankings, defeated Quinten Hann 5–1, after Hann had smashed the [...] from his [...] shot at 0–4 down, from which he fluked a red and made an 89 break.

Hendry beat Robert Milkins 5–1, and dismissed suggestions that the loss at the Grand Prix had inspired him to <b>play</b> <b>better</b> at this tournament. Murphy defeated world number four Paul Hunter 5–3 for his second last-16 appearance in a ranking event, and attributed the win to his happiness off the table; Murphy—a Christian since the age of 17—said, [...] "My girlfriend Claire is a wonderful woman.
