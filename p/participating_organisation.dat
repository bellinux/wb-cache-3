40|$|Although {{managers}} consider accurate, timely, {{and relevant}} information as {{critical to the}} quality of their decisions, evidence of large variations in data quality abounds. Over a period of twelve months, the action research project reported herein attempted to investigate and track data quality initiatives undertaken by the <b>participating</b> <b>organisation.</b> The investigation focused on two types of errors: transaction input errors and processing errors. Whenever the action research initiative identified non-trivial errors, the <b>participating</b> <b>organisation</b> introduced actions to correct the errors and prevent similar errors in the future. Data quality metrics were taken quarterly to measure improvements resulting from the activities undertaken during the action research project. The action research project results indicated that for a mission-critical database to ensure and maintain data quality, commitment to continuous data quality improvement is necessary. Also, communication among all stakeholders is required to ensure common understanding of data quality improvement goals. The action research project found that to further substantially improve data quality, structural changes within the organisation and to the information systems are sometimes necessary. The major goal of the action research study is to increase the level of data quality awareness within all organisations and to motivate them to examine the importance of achieving and maintaining high-quality data...|$|E

To keep participating organisations as autonomous entities in an inter-organisational business collaboration environment, however, it brings challenges in generating workflow tracking structures and manipulating instance correspondences between different participating organisations. Aiming to tackle these problems, this paper proposed a matrix based framework {{on the basis of}} our relative workflow model.

40|$|Business {{collaboration}} is about coordinating {{the flow of}} information among organisations and linking their business processes. It brings great challenge to keep participating organisations as autonomous entities in integrating business processes of these organisations seamlessly. To address this issue, we develop a new perspective on business collaborations with a novel concept called relative workflow, which defines what a <b>participating</b> <b>organisation</b> can perceive in collaboration. By incorporating a visibility control mechanism, relative workflows allow each organisation to define its own collaboration structure and behaviours. In this paper, we present a formal definition of relative workflows and related algorithms for generating relative workflows, along with a discussion on how to perform tracking over relative workflows...|$|E

40|$|Electronic Commerce is {{concerned}} with conducting business transactions electronically using information and communication technologies. In this globalization era, many organisations in various countries have rapidly adopted e-Commerce to enable efficient trading with other organisations located {{in various parts of}} the world. However, e-Commerce adoption is still unilaterally concentrated in developed countries which are attributable to some issues related to the relevance of e-Commerce for organisations in developing countries. Currently, there are limited detailed studies into the adoption of e-Commerce technologies in developing countries. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a multiple case study over an extended period of time, exploring the adoption of e-Commerce technologies that support business-to-business interactions within the supply chain of the grocery industry in Indonesia, as an example of a developing country.

40|$|Within {{the area}} of Information Retrieval (IR) the {{importance}} of appropriate ranking of results has increased markedly. The importance is magnified {{in the case of}} systems dedicated to XML retrieval, since users of these systems expect the retrieval of highly relevant and highly precise components, instead of the retrieval of entire documents. As an international, coordinated effort to evaluate the performance of Information Retrieval systems, the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) encourages <b>participating</b> <b>organisation</b> to run queries on their search engines and to submit their result for the annual INEX workshop.

Moreover it provides a system that is trying to facilitate the ranking of participating search engines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Research was {{conducted}} to examine engagement with the EU Culture Programme from the Irish perspec-tive {{with an emphasis on}} the performing arts sector. The research aimed to quantify actual levels of Irish participation and identify the barriers to, and benefits for, Irish performing arts organisations pursuing project funding from the EU Culture Programme. Extant statistical data was analysed to create a macro picture of overall Irish participation expressed through quantitative findings. These statistical findings were then examined through qualititative research conducted with individuals and organisations representing Irish international performing arts experience on either a practical or policy level. With an ultimate benefit to the artistic practice of the <b>participating</b> <b>organisation,</b> {{as well as to the}} Irish performing arts ecology as a whole, the research findings demonstrate the need for a clear national policy on the provision of support to organisations in a position to leverage EU cultural funds...|$|E
