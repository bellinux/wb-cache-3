5|$|The {{line was}} single tracked between Appledore and Ore on 1 October 1979, leaving a passing loop at Rye. At Winchelsea, the down {{platform}} was removed; trains {{in both directions}} now stop on the former up <b>platform.</b> <b>Line</b> speed was reduced from 85mph to 60mph, but there are additional long term speed restrictions in place, including 40mph between Doleham and Ore and 20mph across a half barrier level crossing at Winchelsea.|$|E
25|$|At the new City station {{there were}} two {{platforms}} and either {{could be used by}} an arriving train, reversing in the platform. The track connections at the approach were a double slip, not a scissors, so a train could not leave while another was arriving. The left hand <b>platform</b> <b>line</b> was extended by a train length and trains could be stabled in the extension. A large diameter Greathead shield was used to bore the section of tunnel where the track connections would be installed.|$|E
25|$|Train {{stops on}} open {{stretches}} without platform can outnumber train stops in railway stations by a 2:1 margin, but these stopovers on open stretches {{are usually not}} included, when railway stations are counted. There are 25 dedicated railway stations along the railway with 23 having a single platform for passengers to enter or to leave trains. These platforms allow access without having the need to use stairs. Only the Furi-Labu railway station (and the Awash railway station after completed expansion in 2018) have two platforms connected through a footbridge above the overhead catenary system. This footbridge also has elevators at both ends for mobility-reduced passengers. The platforms are roofed to protect passengers against sun, wind and rain. Railway stations for passenger trains always have a station building directly attached {{to the back of}} the principal platform. Consequently, all railway stations with a single platform have space for only one <b>platform</b> <b>line</b> and do not allow the presence of more than one train at the platform at the same time. In contrast, the Furi-Labu and Awash railway stations with their two platforms have the space for two (Furi-Labu) or three (Awash) platform lines. All platforms are around 330 meters long. The Awash railway station plays a special role as it sits at the junction of two railway lines.|$|E

500|$|In 1852 the Leeds Northern Railway (LNR) built a {{line from}} Northallerton to a {{junction}} with the Stockton to Hartlepool line and {{a section of the}} route ran parallel to the S alongside the Yarm to Stockton Road. The S was originally {{on the east side of}} the road, but the LNR built its line with four tracks on the other side of the road, leasing two to the S for a rental of 1s a year. On 25 January 1853 the LNR and SD opened a joint station at [...] with an island platform between the tracks, and one side was used by S trains and the other by the LNR. Rather than allow trains to approach the <b>platform</b> <b>line</b> from either direction, the Board of Trade inspecting officer ruled that trains approaching on a line without a platform must first pass through and then reverse into the <b>platform</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 2 April 1906 {{as part of}} the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway. The station layout was four tracks, with two through <b>lines</b> and two <b>platform</b> <b>lines.</b> British Rail removed the through lines early in 1974.As part of Chiltern Railways' Project Evergreen 2 the <b>platform</b> <b>lines</b> were {{upgraded}} to increase the line speed for through trains from 40 mph to 75 mph.|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} located at the {{intersection}} of Fuxing North Rd. and Nanjing East Rd. It has two side <b>platforms</b> (Brown <b>Line),</b> one island <b>platform</b> (Green <b>Line),</b> and eight exits. All platforms are equipped with platform screen doors.|$|R
50|$|The present {{station is}} located on a sharp curve on the south {{approach}} to the Boyne Viaduct. Formerly there were three lines through the station between the 'up' and 'down' platforms, but when the station was refurbished in 1997, up <b>platform</b> <b>line</b> was removed and the platform widened.|$|E
50|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} end of steam operation, the {{passenger}} train timetable involved two trains crossing at Coombe Junction, at a time a little after 10.00 a.m. The layout at Coombe in the 1950s had only the terminal <b>platform</b> <b>line</b> and the through Goods Line (with no platform) towards Moorswater.|$|E
50|$|Signals are {{controlled}} from the signal box at Truro.

50|$|The {{signal box}} and passing loop {{initially}} remained in use after the station closed, {{but after the}} lifting of the Caernavon line, these were decommissioned in 1967 and removed three years later (leaving only the old westbound <b>platform</b> <b>line</b> in use as the running line to Pwllheli). Demolition of the surviving buildings and westbound platform followed by the late 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Banff {{railway station}} was the railway station serving {{the town of}} Banff, Banffshire. The line from [...] opened in 1859 and a {{temporary}} terminus opened on 30 July 1859. A permanent station opened the following year. As originally built there was a single platform and a goods line through to the quayside at Banff harbour but this was cut back prior to 1900 when a second <b>platform</b> <b>line</b> was constructed.|$|E
