5000|$|From 1840 to {{the late}} 19th century, large, voltaic cells using a zinc {{electrode}} and a sulfuric acid electrolyte were widely used in the printing industry. While copper electrodes like those in lemon batteries were sometimes used, in 1840 Alfred Smee invented a refined version of this cell that used silver with a rough platinum coating instead of a copper electrode. Hydrogen gas clinging {{to the surface of}} a silver or copper electrode reduces the electric current that can be drawn from a cell; the phenomenon is called [...] "polarization". The roughened, [...] "platinized" [...] surface speeds up the bubbling of the hydrogen gas, and increases the current from the cell. Unlike the zinc electrode, the copper or platinized silver electrodes are not consumed by using the battery, and the details of this electrode do not affect the cell's voltage. The Smee cell was convenient for electrotyping, which produced copper plates for letterpress <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> <b>newspapers</b> and books, and also statues and other metallic objects.|$|E

In Bangladesh, the Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1973 requires the <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> <b>newspapers</b> to be registered, and the government had sealed Amar Desh's printing office. Police searched the premises of Sangram in the late evening and confiscated over 6,000 copies of the Amar Desh and then arrested 19 workers. The court sent the printers directly to jail and denied their petitions for a remand and bail. Rahman's mother is the acting head at Amar Desh in Rahman's absence. Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu said Amar Desh could resume printing from another site once it had an order from Dhaka's magistrate.|$|E

5000|$|Shaw {{traces the}} name of forty {{printers}} in and around Calcutta in the period 1770-1800. It {{would be interesting to}} note that most of the printers he documents meticulously were associated with the <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> <b>newspapers.</b> S. Natarajan [...] studies these early Calcutta newspapers and the antagonistic relationship they often shared with the official authorities which led to certain restrictions laid by the Wellesley Regulations. The most widely circulated papers were the weeklies The India Gazette (Monday), Hickey's Bengal Gazette(Saturday), The Calcutta Chronicle (Tuesday), The Calcutta Gazette(Thursday), The Asiatic Mirror (Wednesday) and The Recorder (Sunday). Other than newspapers, the printers also took up certain commissions like both legal and mercantile advertisements as well as printing stationery to supplement their incomes. However, the most substantial revenue was generated by the printing of almanacs. Calendars and almanacs were prepared according to the Christian, Hindu and Muslim eras. These were often also combined with exhaustive lists of the East India Company's servants and the list of European residents in Calcutta outside the employ of the Company, thus making the almanacs of considerable historical interest. Most notable of these were the 1784 almanac compiled by Reuben Burrow, an early enthusiast of Hindu astrology, the regular India Calendar by the Honorable Company's Press, The Bengal Kalendar and Register by the Chronicle Press and The Civil and Military Register by The India Gazette Office. Other than official publications, the imprints of early Calcutta were designed to meet the immediate and more practical requirements of the small European community - maps, grammars and lexicons of the local vernaculars, treatises on medicine, law and land revenue, and so on. A small amount of creative literature and scholarly interest in Persian and Sanskrit traditions was also generated.|$|E

40|$|Halftoning {{breaks the}} {{continuous}} tone image into a pattern of black dots and makes an illusion of a continuous image to the observer. Halftoned image is a binary version of the continuous toned image. Halftoning techniques have been widely accepted for the <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> <b>newspapers,</b> magazines as well as fax machines and printers. ^ Inverse halftoning is the reconstruction of continuous toned image from its halftoned version. The need for inverse halftoning arises from the need to manipulate the images, rotation or zooming etc In this thesis we deal with inverse halftoning of images halftoned by error diffusion algorithms. ^ Analysing the spectrum the low frequencies of the halftoned and original image are similar, but the halftoned image contains quantization noise in the higher frequencies. So {{the first step in}} our inverse halftoning method is the removal of high frequency quantization noise by Gaussian lowpass filtering. The second stage of our inverse halftoning algorithm is the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) algorithm which alternatively projects the image onto the two convex sets, repeats and converges in the intersection of the two convex sets.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{thought that the}} water pick-up rate and {{capacity}} of an ink may have a profound affect on the press performance of an ink. As the water content of ink changes so do the Theological characteristics of the ink and this effects ink performance attributes such as ink transfer, drying, rub resistance, set-off and strength. An emulsification curve can {{shed some light on}} how ink might perform on a press but this alone is not enough. The objective of this thesis research was to study the interaction of fountain solution and ink as used in the <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> <b>newspapers,</b> in terms of ink water pick-up rates and capacity. Further, this is a study of the effect of the fountain solution and ink interaction on ink transfer, drying, rub resistance, set-off and strength. In this study, three different black news inks and three different fountain solutions have been used to make a total of nine different ink and fountain solution combinations. One set was a specific black news ink and fountain solution combination, Flint Low Rub Black and Anchor Neutral Fountain Solution, used in the printing of USA Today at Boston Offset in Norwood, MA. The paper, a 30 # newsprint, was the only newsprint used throughout the testing. Water pick up rates have been determined and emulsification curves have been developed {{with the use of a}} Duke Tester for all nine ink and fountain solution combinations. The effect of these water pick-up rates on the rheological characteristics has been studied with the use of a Brookfield Rotational Viscometer. With the use of a motorized Little Joe printability tester, ink was laid down on the newsprint at a constant volume and any changes in ink strength were measured with a densitometer. Rub resistance was examined with a Rub Tester and a densitometer. The experimental data from this study show a direct correlation between the water pick-up capacity of an ink and the affect this has on the ink rheology and ink performance. The tests and data revealed that each ink had a tendency to pick-up more of the alkaline fountain solution than the neutral solution. The least was picked up with the acid fountain solution. The more fountain solution the inks picked up, the greater the changes in viscosity, strength, dryback and rub-off. With the low-rub premium and the dense black, the viscosity rose higher as the ink picked-up more fountain solution. The soy low-rub ink reacted differently. The soy ink had an initial drop in viscosity then, as the ink began to pick up more fountain solution, the viscosity seemed to stabilize. The more fountain solution the ink picked-up the weaker the strength became. At the same time, the more fountain solution that was picked-up, the less density was lost due to dryback and rub-off...|$|E
