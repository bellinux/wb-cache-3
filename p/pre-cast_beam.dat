However, the short reinforced concrete corbel is an important structural element to support the pre-cast structural system, such as <b>pre-cast</b> <b>beam</b> and pre-stressed beam. Most of the structures in Civil Engineering fit the current safety standards or have excessive cracks. Steel corrosion may also cause the occurrence of high deflection or instability of the structure itself. It is generally manifested by poor performance under service loading in the form of excessive deflections or cracking. The technique of strengthening compensates the loss of stiffness and cracking development. In fact, this technique improves the performance and durability of the structures.|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} 1000 {{reinforced}} concrete <b>pre-cast</b> <b>beam</b> elements {{that have been}} exposed since 1943 to a harsh sea-spray environment immediately adjacent the North Sea at Arbroath, Scotland. Most (> 90 %) show no obvious signs of reinforcement corrosion. However, the few elements that were replaced, in about 1968 and in 1993, have nearly all resulted in severe longitudinal cracking and extensive reinforcement corrosion, despite the later concretes being superficially of better quality than the original 1943 concrete. This paper will report statistics for maximum crack width {{for each of the}} three concrete populations, based on measurements made in 2004 and in 2006, as well as in-situ and laboratory measurements that indicate the 1943 concrete shows contradictory properties, having both high permeability and high electrical resistivity. Also, the 1943 and 1993 concretes were found to have similar chloride profiles and similar chloride concentrations at the reinforcement bars, which, again, is inconsistent with the 1943 elements showing much less reinforcement corrosion than their later replacements. These observations, and some other un-reported cases in the literature, cast doubt on the conventional notion that durable reinforced concrete structures requires reduced concrete permeability, denser concretes or greater cover...|$|E

This {{axles and suspension}} systems are mainly required for transportation of heavy duty and Over Dimension Consignment (ODC) cargo, which is exceeding legal limit in terms of length, width and height. Presently, in Indian transportation industry, ODC movement growth rate has increased in transportation of bridge sections (<b>pre-cast</b> <b>beams),</b> transformers, heavy machineries, boilers, gas turbines, windmill blades etc. However, current Indian standard road transport vehicles are facing lot of service and maintenance issues due to non availability of suitable axle and suspension to carry the ODC cargoes. This in turn will lead to increased number of road accidents, bridge collapse and delayed deliveries, which finally result in higher operating cost. Understanding these requirements, this work was carried out.

40|$|The {{load testing}} method has {{considerable}} possibilities in bridges {{with the objective}} of their safety assessment. One type of load tests is proof load. Proof load testing is a full-scale and non-destructive examination of load-carrying capacity. Proof-load testing has been applied to various types of structure {{in many parts of the}} world. Originally, it provided a way to check the design assumptions and quality of construction. Later, it became an effective approach to assessing load-carrying capacity of existing structures. The aim of the proof load test is to discover hidden mechanisms of response that can not appear under “normal” levels of load, but that develop at higher ratios of load and may increase the bridge load capacity. For this reason, in such test, the load introduced in the bridge is relatively high and due to the risks of damaging the structure, this type of tests is restricted to bridges that have failed to pass the most advanced theoretical assessment or when such theoretical assessment is not possible due to the lack of bridge documentation. The objective of this test is to directly obtain the maximum allowable load in the bridge with a required safety level. Acoustic emission has been identified as a useful technique in the follow up of the loading process in proof load tests in order to stop the load increase before any damage can be inflicted to the bridge. In the paper the results of field-test of Barcza bridge, a three span concrete bridge made of pre-stressed <b>pre-casted</b> <b>beams,</b> are presented.

50|$|Structures {{consisting}} of both materials utilize {{the benefits of}} structural steel and reinforced concrete. This is already common practice in reinforced concrete in that the steel reinforcement is used to provide steel's tensile strength capacity to a structural concrete member. A commonly seen example would be parking garages. Some parking garages are constructed using structural steel columns and reinforced concrete slabs. The concrete will be poured for the foundational footings, giving the parking garage a surface to be built on. The steel columns will {{be connected to the}} slab by bolting and/or welding them to steel studs extruding {{from the surface of the}} poured concrete slab. <b>Pre-cast</b> concrete <b>beams</b> may be delivered on site to be installed for the second floor, after which a concrete slab may be poured for the pavement area.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 142 - 148). Concrete composites {{consisting of}} precast pre-stressed standardized beams and a cast in-situ deck slab {{have been used}} for the construction of short to medium span bridges for the past four decades in South Africa and worldwide. The <b>pre-cast</b> <b>beams</b> and cast in-situ slab are commonly connected using shear connectors. Failure of these connectors would compromise the composite action of the structure, thus reducing the load carrying capacity and hence its efficiency. This study seeks to assess the integrity of such shear connectors using dynamic testing and Finite Element (FE) analysis. The main objective of the work is to assess the practicality of vibration-based techniques to detect damaged shear connectors using experimental and analytical modal data. A scaled bridge model was constructed and 10 mm bolts connected the beams and slab to simulate shear connectors in the prototype bridge. Different damage scenarios were introduced by loosening some of the connectors and vibration testing was done to detect the artificial damage. An FE model of the system was also developed. The shear connectors were modelled as non-linear spring elements capable of simulating the composite action between the slab and beams. Damage of shear connectors was simulated by reducing the spring stiffness. The updating of the FE model was done manually by adjusting appropriate spring stiffnesses. The experimental and analytical results show that the natural frequencies are sensitive to this damage. The frequencies dropped from undamaged to severe damaged structure. Very little information was deduced from the damping ratios, modal assurance criteria (MAC) and coordinate modal assurance criteria (COMAC) values. The experimental and analytical first bending, torsion and transverse modes were sensitive to the damaged shear connectors. 65 % of damaged connectors were located using these modes. Using experimental modal data, the mode curvatures and flexibility changes were able to locate the damaged region when more than 35 % of shear connectors were loosened. However, using numerical data, the mode curvatures and flexibility changes were able to localize the damaged region for 6 % damage introduced. 75 % of the loosened connectors were identified. The stiffness change technique could only identify less than 10 % of damaged shear connectors using experimental modal data. The same technique was applied on analytical data and over 75 % of damaged shear connectors were located. The FE modelling of shear connectors used in this work was applied on an existing bridge. Van der Kloof bridge (South Africa) was constructed using precast pre-stressed beams and a cast in-situ slab. Extended beam web stirrups were used as shear connectors. The main aim was to develop a robust FE model for this bridge {{that could be used in}} future to investigate the condition of shear connectors. Using 6 - 0 non-linear spring elements to model the shear connectors, a maximum difference of 0. 98 % was observed between the measured and theoretical frequencies after manual updating. This is quite a small difference. This model could therefore be used as a true representative of the physical structure for future investigations...|$|R

The scope of the paper is to present an effective and easy to use method for the estimation of service life of pre-cast concrete structural members. A stochastic approach using stochastic finite element method was applied during the analysis. The effect of creep, shrinkage, relaxation, carbonation induced corrosion and deterioration of cross-sectional sizes on the mean value and standard deviation of bending moment resistance, as well as the change of load effect in time were taken into account during the calculations. The results of probabilistic analysis were compared to results of bending tests that were carried out on pre-stressed concrete beams. The use of the introduced method for the purposes of service life estimation is also presented in case of a long-span, <b>pre-cast,</b> pre-stressed concrete <b>beam.</b> Initial stochastic parameters of material properties and structural geometry were derived from destructive material tests and geometry measurements on appropriate beams.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The success of any project depends upon accurate and timely information, and most construction related companies utilize computer systems for this purpose. However, these systems fail to provide {{a link to the}} physical movements of materials. Effective materials management is vital because of the contribution of materials' elements to the total cost of a construction project. Despite this the construction industry has a poor record in materials management. The reasons for this include delays in the delivery of materials to site and poor identification of materials on site. The severity of these problems and their impact on the construction industry highlighted the need for research in this area. At the initial stage, the research studied the clljTent systems of materials management in the manufacturing and construction industries. It was concluded that Automatic Identification offered advantages over other systems for controlling the physical movements of materials and related information. The traditional flow of materials and related information in the construction industry was examined and schematic diagrams were developed. The typical process of materials management through the life cycle of a typical project was determined. Automatic Identification technologies were reviewed with particular emphasis on bar coding techniques. These are widely used in other industries and provide significant benefits. Furthermore, they have greater flexibility over other Automatic Identification techniques. The potential applications of bar coding techniques in construction were identified {{as a result of a}} pilot study conducted with a local company. In order to determine the current status of bar coding techniques in the construction industry a questionnaire survey was undertaken. This survey revealed a high degree of interest from the respondents in implementing these techniques for applications such as material identification, stock control and delivery ticket automation. The research developed a generic barcoded delivery ticket, a goods received note and a standard bar code label for product identification. To investigate the feasibility of using bar coding techniques in construction, a case study was conducted with a local company to monitor and control <b>pre-cast</b> concrete <b>beams</b> from production through to delivery to the customer site. The study findings showed considerable benefits could be gained from the implementation of these techniques. To realize the full benefits of bar coding techniques, electronic data interchange, (EDI), was also considered. The proposed integration of these techniques produced in an improved methodology for materials management. This methodology was validated by a series of interviews, and evaluated during trials with the collaboration of a local company. The main outcomes of the research are: • A concepmal framework for an improved methodology for managing construction materials using automatic identification and in particularly bar coding techniques. • An understanding of the problems and benefits of the design, implementation, and verification of an Automatic Identification system. • An examination of how Automatic Identification and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) could be linked to improve the flow of materials information. • A generic bar code standard format for Delivery Ticket and Goods Received Notes. • A generic bar code standard label for product identification throughout the supply chain. • The identification of potential applications of bar coding techniques in construction...|$|R
