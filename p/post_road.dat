5|$|Once White Plains {{became the}} county seat of Westchester in 1759, the road between this village {{and the city of}} New York (then {{encompassing}} only Manhattan) became an important route and was established as the White Plains <b>Post</b> <b>Road.</b> Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via Kingsbridge along the old Boston <b>Post</b> <b>Road.</b> A new bridge over the Harlem River (the original Harlem Bridge) was opened in 1797, shortening the route out of Manhattan. This also relocated the Boston and White Plains Post roads to a new alignment along Third Avenue and Boston Road. The White Plains <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> separated from the Boston <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> in Bronxdale, with the road to Boston heading east and the road to White Plains heading north. The old White Plains <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> roughly followed the alignment of modern-day White Plains Road, which was laid out in 1863. (The original <b>post</b> <b>road</b> was to the east of the modern-day avenue). The White Plains <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> continued north through Olinville, Wakefield, and Mount Vernon, where the route shifted east to modern-day White Plains <b>Post</b> <b>Road,</b> going through Bronxville and Scarsdale to White Plains.|$|E
5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> from Trenton to Princeton. However, {{off to the}} right of this road, there was an unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the <b>Post</b> <b>Road,</b> and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British had left it undefended.|$|E

50|$|The United States House Committee on Post Office and <b>Post</b> <b>Roads</b> was {{a congressional}} {{committee}} which existed until 1946. A Select Committee on the Post Office and <b>Post</b> <b>Roads</b> was established in 1806 and made a standing committee in 1808 during the 10th Congress. The early membership of the committee consisted of one Member from each state.|$|R

The district achieved State Register status on August 6, 1984, National Register district status on September 7, 1984, and local landmark status on January 5, 1988.|$|E
5|$|The Upper Boston <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> was {{established}} in 1673 between New York and Boston via New Haven, Hartford, Springfield, and Worcester. From New Haven to Hartford, it ran at various times via Middletown (now roughly Route 17 and Route 99) and via Meriden (now very roughly US 5). North of Hartford, the road remained {{on the west side}} of the Connecticut River, following the general path of present Route 159.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} road to reach {{what was then}} Wheeling, Virginia, was a <b>post</b> <b>road</b> linking it with Morgantown, to the southeast. The <b>post</b> <b>road</b> was completed in 1794. The National Road was the first interstate road that served Wheeling, linking the town to Cumberland, Maryland, in the east. The National Road started construction under order of then President Thomas Jefferson in 1806 and was completed in 1818. In 1926 the United States Numbered Highway System was established, and the National Road through the Northern Panhandle was designated US40. US40 linked Vallejo, California, {{in the west to}} Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the east. Passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 formed the Interstate Highway System, designating as I-70 a then unconstructed controlled-access highway across the panhandle by 1957. Since it was constructed as a separate controlled-access highway, much of I-70 is separate from the old National Road and US40.|$|E

5000|$|The Act of August 24, 1912, {{establishing}} {{the joint committee}} required {{the creation of a}} 6-member committee, consisting of three senators and three representatives. Membership was to come from the Senate Committee on Post Offices and <b>Post</b> <b>Roads</b> and the House Committee on the Post Office and <b>Post</b> <b>Roads.</b> The committee was ordered to [...] "make inquiry into the subject of postage on second-class mail matter and compensation for the transportation of mail and to report at the earliest practicable date." ...|$|R

5|$|The second {{concurrency}} between US9 and NY9A {{runs for}} 0.65 miles (1km), with NY9A leaving the Croton Expressway at Croton Point Avenue in Croton-on-Hudson. The highway heads north along Riverside Avenue and eventually joins old Albany <b>Post</b> <b>Road.</b> After crossing US9 {{once more in}} Cortlandt, NY9A ends at the Welcher Avenue interchange in southern Peekskill.|$|E
5|$|The southernmost {{section of}} the road {{was known as the}} White Plains <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a major highway {{connecting}} New York City to White Plains, the Westchester county seat. Route22 in its modern form was established in 1930 as one of the principal routes from New York City to Canada.|$|E
5|$|US 5 roughly {{follows the}} route {{used by the}} Upper Boston <b>Post</b> <b>Road,</b> an early colonial highway for {{transporting}} mail between New York City and Boston. The route was first improved in 1798 as the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike, which ran in a nearly straight line between the court houses of New Haven and Hartford. In 1922, the Upper Boston <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> corridor was designated as Route 2 of the New England road marking system, crossing {{to the east of}} the Connecticut River in Hartford before continuing north to the Massachusetts state line. In 1926, Route 2 was redesignated as U.S. Route 5. Several realignments {{have been made in the}} cities of New Haven and Hartford with the opening of several expressways in these areas. Because it is closely paralleled by Interstate 91 between New Haven and Hartford, US 5 serves mainly as a secondary route today.|$|E

5|$|US113 {{follows the}} {{corridor}} of a <b>post</b> <b>road</b> {{established in the}} late 18thcentury to connect the aforementioned towns on the Delmarva Peninsula with Wilmington and Philadelphia. The highway was improved as an all-weather road in the 1910s. In Maryland, the <b>post</b> <b>road</b> was designated {{one of the original}} state roads established by the Maryland State Roads Commission (MDSRC) in 1909. In Delaware, the highway was the Selbyville–Dover portion of the DuPont Highway, a roadway whose construction was a grand philanthropic measure of Thomas Coleman DuPont. The DuPont Highway, which was started by DuPont's company and finished by the Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD), spurred economic growth in the tourism and agriculture sectors in southern Delaware. The economic growth resulted in heavy traffic; US113 was widened in both states in the early 1930s and again in the late 1940s. Bypasses of Dover and Pocomoke City were built in the mid-1930s; the bypassed section of highway in Dover became US113Alternate.|$|E
5|$|By 18 March, Jourdan {{had formed}} his {{headquarters}} at Pfullendorf, on the heights above Ostrach. In {{front of him}} stood the largest part of his cavalry and half of his infantry. The center, including the 4th Regiment of Hussars, the 1st of Chasseurs à Cheval, and two squadrons of the 17th Dragoons, lay behind Ostrach, under command of General Klein. Jourdan distributed them in three columns, the strongest on the <b>post</b> <b>road</b> by Saulgau, another {{on the road in}} the direction of Altshausen, and a third at the hamlet of Friedberg.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Croton Expressway, {{the only}} {{piece of the}} failed Hudson River Expressway project that was ever built, began in the mid-1960s. It became part of a realigned US9 when it was {{completed}} by 1967. The former surface routing of US9 along Albany <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> between Croton-on-Hudson and Buchanan became a northward extension of NY9A, which reached the old alignment by way of an overlap with US9 from {{the north end of}} the Briarcliff–Peekskill Parkway to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E

50|$|Two notable <b>post</b> <b>roads</b> {{built in}} the late 1700s and early 1800s were Dundas Road (The Governor's Road) and Kingston Road (Lakeshore Road or York Road) to provide a route of mail and stagecoaches between key {{settlements}} in Upper Canada.|$|R
5|$|During the American Revolution, {{the road}} was an {{important}} artery over which the British and the colonists fought. In January 1777, the colonists brought a cannon {{to the top of}} a hill and fired at the British. The hill, now inside Woodlawn Cemetery, was locally called Gun Hill afterwards. The road was known as Kingsbridge Road (part of the original Boston <b>Post</b> <b>Road)</b> until 1875, when it was renamed Gun Hill Road. It did not originally extend east of White Plains Road but was extended by segments to the Hutchinson River, by 1938.|$|E
5|$|NY120 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US1 (Boston <b>Post</b> <b>Road)</b> {{in the city}} of Rye. The route proceeds northward along Purchase Street as a two-lane street through the Locust Avenue Business District, intersecting a handful of local streets and serving Rye's station on the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line. Past the station, the highway passes under the New Haven Line, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line, and I-95 in quick succession ahead of the Purchase Street Business District. The commercial surroundings give way to residential neighborhoods after three blocks as NY120 winds northward through the northern part of Rye to the adjacent village/town of Harrison.|$|E
5|$|The road, {{also known}} as Old <b>Post</b> <b>Road,</b> was {{incorporated}} in 1813 as the Elk and Christiana Turnpike {{in order to get}} more money for repairs. The turnpike was completed in April 1817. As a turnpike, tolls were collected to pay for the maintenance of the road. The construction of the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad lowered the revenues of the turnpike and it became a public road again in 1838. The road historically went through agricultural areas; however, the surroundings have become more developed over the years. Much of the Old Baltimore Pike remains two lanes.|$|E

5|$|Ostrach {{was a small}} village, with a {{population}} of 300. The village belonged to the Cistercian Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance. The village was largely dedicated to farming, although a stretch of the imperial <b>post</b> <b>road</b> connected it and Pfullendorf. A wide, flat plain, marshy in places, stretched between the base of the Pfullendorf heights and the village; low lying hills ringed the valley, which was creased by a small stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern end of this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. The two armies faced each other across this small and, at that time of that year, very soggy valley.|$|E
5|$|State {{highways}} {{were first}} formally {{defined by the}} state legislature in 1909 and given numeric designations, although these initial designations were not publicly signed. Portions of modern Route22 were defined as part of legislative routes1 and 22. Legislative route1 went from the New York City line north along the White Plains <b>Post</b> <b>Road</b> to White Plains, then detoured to Harrison (via Westchester Avenue), before proceeding north to Armonk (via modern NY120). Legislative route1 continued north along modern NY22 to Austerlitz, where it then turned northwest to Valatie (via modern NY203 and NY980B), then followed US9 to Albany. Legislative route22 had two segments. The southern segment began in Troy, following NY7 to Hoosick, then went north along modern NY22 up to Putnam Station (south of Ticonderoga).|$|E
5|$|The Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway {{served as}} a <b>post</b> <b>road</b> {{in the years that}} followed. At some point, the section of the highway between Palmyra and Marion, {{initially}} a corduroy road, was rebuilt as a plank road and tolled. The highway fell into disrepair over the years, leading travelers to conceive ways to avoid paying toll. The toll booths were eventually removed, and the road was later covered with dirt and converted into a stage road. By the 1920s, the state of New York had assumed ownership of the Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway. In the mid-1920s, it became part of NY72, a north–south highway extending from NY52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by way of the western side of Canandaigua Lake.|$|E
