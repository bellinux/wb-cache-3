50|$|A {{preliminary}} study was being conducted concerning the existing terminal building in planning for future growth and construction. Adding an extension {{to the terminal}} would have allowed Lafayette Regional Airport to handle more air traffic, which could entice international carriers {{to use it as}} a connecting airport. This would require a U.S. Customs department office stationed at the airport, which would bring Lafayette Regional Airport to an 'international airport' status. However, international service from Lafayette appears unlikely at this time due to the relatively small population base in the area as well as the presence of large international and domestic <b>passenger</b> <b>hubs</b> located relatively nearby in Atlanta (Delta Air Lines), Dallas/Fort Worth (American Airlines) and Houston (United Airlines).|$|E

At the end of 1978, still under U.S. route regulation, Piedmont's routes reached north to New York, west to Denver, Colorado, and south to Miami, Florida. Flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth began in 1979 followed by Houston in 1980 and New Orleans in 1982. [...] In 1984, Los Angeles and San Francisco {{were added to the}} route system followed by Minneapolis/St. Paul in 1985, Montreal and Ottawa in Canada in 1986 and Seattle in 1987. [...] By 1988, the airline was serving Phoenix and San Diego in addition to a new international destination being Nassau, Bahamasand by 1989 was operating flights to Bermuda as well as nonstop service between Los Angeles and Baltimore, Charlotte, Dayton and Tampa; nonstop service between San Francisco and Charlotte, Dayton and Kansas City; nonstop service between Phoenix and Baltimore and Charlotte; and nonstop service between Seattle and Charlotte [...] Shortly before the merger with USAir in 1989, Piedmont was operating connecting <b>passenger</b> <b>hubs</b> located at Baltimore (BWI), Charlotte (CLT), Dayton (DAY) and Syracuse (SYR).

40|$|Abstract. Although traffic {{development}} brings convenience to citizen, {{problems such}} as parking, traffic transferring, caused by <b>passenger</b> transport <b>hub</b> have aroused extensive attention from society. Based on teasing parking demand hierarchy and willingness choice, concept of expected utility is introduced to uncover logical relationship among transport hub, influence factors, and parking demand. Data about parking facilities and their characteristics, parker desire, characterization parameters related with hub, are surveyed and collected to analyze and confirm the key influence factors {{on the basis of}} urban comprehensive <b>passenger</b> transport <b>hub</b> oriented high-speed rail, for setting up the relation model between parking demand at synthesis <b>passenger</b> <b>hub</b> and its impact factors, which is used to propose the forecasting method of parking demand at the comprehensive <b>passenger</b> transport <b>hub</b> oriented high-speed rail...|$|R
