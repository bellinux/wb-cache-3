40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{technological}} process of unloading the potato tubers from the piles, the feeder to the <b>pick-up</b> <b>attachment</b> and heap of potato after the winter storage. The {{purpose of the}} work: the improvement of capasity of the <b>pick-up</b> <b>attachment</b> of potato from the piles of the tubers become compressed and germinated, and the investigaition of influence of the different parameters and operating conditions of the feeder {{on the process of}} pick-up and damage to the potato. Theoretically grounded and experimentally approved has been the efficiency of application of the potato <b>pick-up</b> <b>attachment</b> provided with the parallelogram dram feeder; the kinematics of motion of the fork blades and its interaction with the heap of potato has been studied; the mathematical models of the technological process of the tubers unloading have been obtained. The operating organ of the drum type has been created to the potato <b>pick-up</b> <b>attachment</b> from the heap, nesuring the increase of its capacity at unloading of the compressed and germinated heap. The <b>pick-up</b> <b>attachment</b> with the suggested operating organ has been introduced in production in sovkhozes Krasnogvardeisky and named after Kommunarov, the St. -Leningrad region. The results of the investigations have been used by the DB of the SPA "Nechernozemagromash". The labour has been reduced by 58, 6 %, the reduced expenditures by 50, 8 %, energy cosumption by 2 times. The capacity at the unloading of the potato being compressed and germinated is 25 to 30 t/h, the tuber damage is not more than 1, 5 percent. The field of application: the development of machines intended for the potato unloading from the heap storage premisesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
50|$|The Home-O-Nize Company {{began in}} the {{production}} of kitchen cabinets; first in Davenport, Iowa, and then in the old US Button Company factory in downtown Muscatine. Following the short-lived production of kitchen cabinets, the company began manufacturing aluminum gas-bottle hoods on contract for Stampings, Inc. With the scrap left over from the hoods, they made flower-identification labels, beverage coasters and recipe card file boxes. For a brief period, The company also produced <b>pick-up</b> <b>attachments</b> for John Deere / Deere & Company combines, Iowa Corn Pickers for Associated Manufacturers Inc., and did contract work for local companies such as Red Jacket, Carver Pump, Collins Radio, G.W. Timmerman and Peter Products. In the end, it was the recipe-file boxes that paved the way for The Home-O-Nize Companyâ€™s entry into the office furniture and supply industry.|$|R
40|$|This associational study {{examines}} Maternal Separation Anxiety {{in a sample}} of at least college educated, employed mothers with young children in non-maternal care selected from Phase I of the National Institutes of Child Health and Development study of early child care. The study provides descriptive data on maternal separation anxiety from 6 months to 24 months after birth of a child, its association with indices of mother-child relations, and whether these associations are merely a manifestation of general neuroticism/anxiety or depressive symptoms, or if there is something unique about maternal separation anxiety of relevance to mother-child relations. Self-report and observational data on 147 mothers indicated that maternal separation anxiety showed high individual stability, but on average decreased over time. Maternal personality characteristics and maternal education level showed modest associations with MSA. However, MSA was associated with neither observed maternal behavior at day care drop-offs and <b>pick-ups,</b> nor infant-mother <b>attachment</b> in the expected patterns. Results suggest that MSA may not be a fruitful approach to thinking about parenting in a White, well-educated sample of women...|$|R
