40|$|Multivariate mixed <b>Poisson</b> <b>processes</b> {{are special}} multivariate {{counting}} processes whose coordinates are, in general, dependent. The {{first part of}} this thesis is devoted to properties which multivariate counting processes may possess. Such properties are, for example, the Markov property, the multinomial property and regularity. With regard to regularity we study the properties of transition probabilities and intensities. The second part of this thesis restricts the class of all multivariate counting processes by additional assumptions leading to different types of multivariate mixed <b>Poisson</b> <b>processes</b> which, however, are connected with each other. Using a multivariate version of the Bernstein-Widder theorem, it is shown that multivariate mixed <b>Poisson</b> <b>processes</b> are characterized by the multinomial property. Furthermore, regularity of multivariate mixed <b>Poisson</b> <b>processes</b> and properties of their moments are studied in detail. Throughout this thesis, two types of stability of properties of multivariate counting processes are studied: It is shown that most properties of a multivariate counting process are stable under certain linear transformations including the selection of single coordinates and summation of all coordinates. It is also shown that the different types of multivariate mixed <b>Poisson</b> <b>processes</b> under consideration are in a certain sense stable in time...|$|R

25|$|Simple point {{processes}} are completely characterized by their void probabilities. In other words, complete information {{of a simple}} point process is captured entirely in its void probabilities, and two simple {{point processes}} have the same void probabilities if and if {{only if they are}} the same point processes. The case for <b>Poisson</b> <b>process</b> is sometimes known as Rényi's theorem, which is named after Alfréd Rényi who discovered the result for the case of a homogeneous point process in one-dimension.|$|E
25|$|Although models {{based on}} these and other point {{processes}} come closer to resembling reality in some situations, for example in the configuration of cellular base stations, they often suffer from a loss of tractability while the <b>Poisson</b> <b>process</b> greatly simplifies the mathematics and techniques, explaining its continued use for developing stochastic geometry models of wireless networks. Also, {{it has been shown}} that the SIR distribution of non-Poisson cellular networks can be closely approximated by applying a horizontal shift to the SIR distribution of a Poisson network.|$|E
25|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the exponential distribution (also known as negative exponential distribution) is the probability distribution {{that describes the}} time between events in a <b>Poisson</b> <b>process,</b> i.e. {{a process in which}} events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is a particular case of the gamma distribution. It is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution, and it has the key property of being memoryless. In addition to being used for the analysis of Poisson processes, it is found in various other contexts.|$|E

25|$|A slotted Aloha {{wireless}} network employs the Aloha MAC protocol where the channels access the medium, independently at each time interval, with some probability p. If the underlying channels (that is, their transmitters for the point-to-point case) are positioned {{according to a}} <b>Poisson</b> <b>process</b> (with density λ), then the nodes accessing the network also form a Poisson network (with density pλ), which allows {{the use of the}} Poisson model. ALOHA is not only one of the simplest and most classic MAC protocol but also was shown to achieve Nash equilibria when interpreted as a power control schemes.|$|E
25|$|The {{tractability}} of the <b>Poisson</b> <b>process</b> {{means that}} {{sometimes it is}} convenient to approximate a non-Poisson point process with a Poisson one. The overall aim is to approximate the both number of points of some point process {{and the location of}} each point by a Poisson point process. There a number of methods {{that can be used to}} justify, informally or rigorously, approximating the occurrence of random events or phenomena with suitable Poisson point processes. The more rigorous methods involve deriving upper bounds on the probability metrics between the Poisson and non-Poisson point processes, while other methods can be justified by less formal heuristics.|$|E
25|$|This {{approximation}} {{is sometimes}} {{known as the}} law of rare events, since each of the n individual Bernoulli events rarely occurs. The name may be misleading because the total count of success events in a <b>Poisson</b> <b>process</b> need not be rare if the parameter np is not small. For example, the number of telephone calls to a busy switchboard in one hour follows a Poisson distribution with the events appearing frequent to the operator, but they are rare {{from the point of}} view of the average member of the population who is very unlikely to make a call to that switchboard in that hour.|$|E

We use empirical histogram estimates to characterize the intensity function of the neural response. A critical factor in determining the histogram estimates is selection of binwidth. In this work we analytically derive the KullbackLeibler distance between two <b>Poisson</b> <b>processes</b> and two dead time modified <b>Poisson</b> <b>processes</b> in terms of the binwidth selected. Our results show that for constant intensity processes having the same number of expected counts, the distance between the dead time modified processes will be larger than between the <b>Poisson</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
