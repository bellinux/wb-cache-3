40|$|In the {{standard}} optical interference fringes approach, by measuring {{shift of the}} interference fringes due to step edge of thin film on substrate, thickness of the layer has already been measured. In order to improve the measurement precision of this popular method, the interference fringes intensity curve was extracted and analyzed {{before and after the}} step preparation. By this method, one can measure a few nanometers films thickness. In addition, using the interference fringes intensity curve and its fluctuations, the roughness of surface is measured within a few nanometers accuracy. Comparison of our results with some direct methods of thickness and roughness measurements, i. e. using surface <b>profilemeter</b> and atomic force microscopy confirms the accuracy of the suggested improvements...|$|E
40|$|Most field erosion {{studies in}} {{agricultural}} areas provide little {{information on the}} probable errors involved. Here, for the first time, we compare the accuracy, time and cost of conventional and new methodologies for gully surveying, and provide a model to estimate the effort required to achieve a specified accuracy. Using a terrestrial LiDAR survey of a 7. 1 -m-long gully reach as a benchmark data set, the accuracies of different measurement methods (a new 3 D photo-reconstruction technique, total station, laser <b>profilemeter,</b> and pole) are assessed for estimating gully erosion at a reach scale. Based on further field measurements performed over nine gullies (> 100 m long), a simulation approach is derived to model the expected volume errors when 2 D methods are used at the gully scale. All gullies considered were located near Cordoba, Spain. At the reach scale, the field measurements using 3 D photo-reconstruction and total station techniques produced cross-sectional area error values smaller than 4 %, with other 2 D methods exceeding 10 %. For volume estimation, photo-reconstruction proved similar to LiDAR data, but 2 D methods generated large negative volume error (E V) values (<- 13 % for laser <b>profilemeter</b> and pole). We show that the proposed error expressions derived from the model {{are in line with}} the reach-scale field results. A measurement distance factor (MDF) is defined that represents the ratio between cross-section distance and the gully length, and thus reflects relative survey effort. We calculate the required MDF for specified values of E V, illustrating how MDF decreases with increasing gully length and sinuosity. © Soil Science Society of America. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Unique {{observations}} {{delivered by}} space X-ray imaging telescopes have been significantly contributing to important discoveries of current astrophysics. The telescopes’ most crucial part {{is a high}} throughput, heavily nested mirror array reflecting X-rays and focusing them to a detector. Future astronomical projects on large X-ray telescopes require novel materials and technologies {{for the construction of}} the reflecting mirrors. The future mirrors must be lightweight and precisely shaped to achieve large collecting area with high angular resolution of a few arc sec. The new materials and technologies must be cost-effective as well. Currently, the most promising materials are glass or silicon foils which are commercially produced on a large scale. A thermal forming process was used for the precise shaping of these foils. The forced and free slumping of the foils was studied in the temperature range of hot plastic deformation and the shapes obtained by the different slumping processes were compared. The shapes and the surface quality of the foils were measured by a Taylor Hobson contact <b>profilemeter,</b> a ZYGO interferometer and Atomic Forced Microscopy. In the experiments, both heat-treatment temperature and time were varied following our experiment design. The obtained data and relations can be used for modelling and optimizing the thermal forming procedure...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare microhardness, {{roughness}} and micromorphology of the examined materials of a newly developed glass carbomer dental filling material to two different resin modified glass ionomers and a glass ionomer dental filling material. Specimens tested were prepared from a glass carbomer without gloss (Glass Carbomer, GCP), a glass carbomer (Glass Carbomer, GCP) with gloss, two different resin modified glass ionomers (Fuji II LC, GC and Riva LC, SDI) and a glass ionomer (Equia, GC). Seven specimens of each material were prepared according to manufacturer’s recommendations. After setting, samples were polished and stored in 37 ◦C distilled water for 24 h. Indentation microhardness of examined restorative materials was measured using the Vickers indenters. In addition surface roughness of the materials was measured using surface <b>profilemeter.</b> Surface morphology was analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy. There was a significant difference in microhardness and roughness between the restorative materials (p < 0. 05). The highest microhardness was measured for Equia and lowest for glass carbomer with gloss. The roughness was fully definite for the glass carbomer with gloss and indefinite for the glass carbomer without gloss. Small cracks and voids were observed in all groups. High viscosity glass ionomer cement Equia exhibits the high physical strength than RMGIC. Gloss application does not influence the hardness behavior of GCP...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{transport}} phenomena, analyte adsorption on the detector surface can be hindered, {{which increases the}} detection limit. Therefore, this work aims the simulation, production and tests of a simple miniaturized structure that favors mixing on detector surfaces. The conception of the manufactured device is based on passive mixers. Mixing is improved by changing the surfaces properties of plasma deposited thin films. Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and nonafluoro(iso) butyl ether (HFE) and co-deposited HMDS/HFE plasma films were modified by ultraviolet (UVC) or beta radiation exposure (electron beam, 2 MeV, from 10 nA to 100 nA). Silicon, acrylics and piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) were used as substrates. Film characterization used <b>profilemeter</b> for thickness and ellipsometer for refractive index determinations; Raman, infrared (FTIR) and x-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies determined chemical composition. Optical, scanning electron (SEM) and atomic force (AFM) microscopies evaluated the film resistance toward ultraviolet light or beta radiation and cluster formation; cluster size were estimated using ImageJ software. Contact angle measurements tested hydrophobicity and the adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Simulations of detector surfaces (based on PQC detection) and respective package used FEMLAB 3. 2 software. All films are hydrophobic and adsorbent, even after exposition to ultraviolet radiation. HMDS films exposed to ultraviolet form a silicone-like structure whereas beta radiation exposure leads to carbon nodules formation. HFE films act as passive layer, even for beta radiation. Best design for surface modification has approximately a sinoidal shape. Key words: HMDS, HFE, miniaturized structure, mixing, plasma film...|$|E
40|$|Polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) {{solar cells}} are {{attractive}} because low cost techniques {{can be used}} to obtain high efficiency thin film photovoltaic devices. Several research groups around the world have developed CIGS/CdS solar cells with efficiencies larger than 15 % [1] using evaporation, making it an attractive and reliable technique for thin film deposition. Our PVD system is provided with MBE-type Knudsen cells to deposit CIGS thin films on glass/Molibdenum (Mo) substrates. The deposition conditions for each metal source have been established by doing a deposition profile of temperature data vs. growth rate by co-evaporation to obtain CIGS thin film for solar cells. Characterization of the co-evaporated CIGS thin films was performed by X-ray diffraction (X-RD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. Good quality polycrystalline films were obtained as shown by X-RD patterns. SEM micrographs show films having a very uniform appearance with large grain sizes (» 1 ¹m). Photoluminescence (PL) studies on CIGS samples with different Ga and Cu concentrations (Ga/Ga+In) = 0. 25 and 0. 34 and (Cu/In+Ga) = 0. 83, 0. 88 and 0. 94) have been performed. The EDS results have shown that is possible to control very precisely the CIGS thin film composition using these Knudsen cells. Film thicknesses of » 3 - 4 ¹m, were measured with an Ambios <b>profilemeter</b> XP 100 stylus type. A conversion efficiency of 10. 9 % has been achieved for solar cells made from the co-evaporated absorbers...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: Neste trabalho, investigou-se a influência da implantação iônica sobre as propriedades de filmes finos de polímero depositados a partir de plasmas de radiofrequência (40 MHz, 70 W) de dois compostos orgânicos (acetileno e benzeno) e de suas misturas com gases nobres. As irradiações foram {{realizadas}} em um implantador iônico, com íons He+, N+ e Ar+, à fluências entre 1018 e 1021 íons/m 2 e energias de 50 a 150 keV. As propriedades estruturais e ópticas dos filmes foram analisadas por espectroscopias no infravermelho e no ultravioleta-visível, respectivamente. Através de Ressonância Paramagnética de Elétrons, foi verificado que o bombardeamento iônico produz radicais livres na estrutura polimérica. A concentração destas espécies no filme foi investigada em função da energia e da fluência do feixe iônico. Variações nas concentrações dos elementos químicos presentes nas amostras com o bombardeamento iônico foram investigadas por Espectroscopia de Retro-espalhamento Rutherford. A espessura dos filmes foi medida com um perfilômetro, e associada aos dados obtidos por RBS, permitiu a determinação da densidade dos polímeros. Medidas de dureza dos filmes foram realizadas com a técnica de nanoindentação. Usando o método de duas pontas foi determinada a resistividade elétrica dos filmes e, através da exposição a plasmas de oxigênio, foi avaliada a resistência à oxidação. A interpretação dos resultados foi baseada nos perfis de perda de energia dos íons obtidos com o programa TRIM (TRansport of Ions in Matter) Abstract: This work {{reports the}} influence of the ion implantation on the properties of thin plasma polymer films deposited from radiofrequency (40 MHz, 70 W) plasmas of two organic compounds (acetylene and benzene) and from their mixtures with noble gases. The irradiations were performed with an ion implanter, using He+, N+ and Ar+ ions, in the fluence and energy range of 1018 to 1021 ions/m 2 and 50 to 150 keV, respectively. Infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopies were employed to characterize the structural and optical properties of the films, respectively. Using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, the formation of free radicals in the film structure was investigated {{as a function of the}} ion beam energy and fluence. Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples and its change induced by the irradiation. Thicknesses of the films were measured with a <b>profilemeter.</b> Combination of the RBS and film thickness data allowed the determination of the density of the films.
