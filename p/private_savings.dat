The total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed <b>private</b> <b>savings</b> because the bank system {{is in a position}} to create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E

In this study, we investigate {{the determinants of}} the <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> rate in Turkey, with a special focus {{on the role of}} mortgage debt.

Non-mortgage consumer credit growth also has a negative and robust effect on <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> rate, though its effect is smaller than that of mortgage credit. Business credit growth, on the other hand, has a positive impact on <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> rate. Our results provide strong support for the argument that the high growth rate of consumer credit is a primary reason for the recent decrease in <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> rate in Turkey.

25|$|The most {{dramatic}} and successful policy event was the currency reform of 1948. Since the 1930s, prices and wages had been controlled, but money had been plentiful. That meant {{that people had}} accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy {{and more than half}} of all transactions were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new Deutsche Mark at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as <b>private</b> <b>savings.</b> Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in Marshall Plan money coming in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.|$|E
25|$|One {{narrative}} {{for explaining}} {{the economic and}} budgetary performance during President Obama's tenure uses sectoral balances. By definition, a country running a trade deficit (capital surplus) and where <b>private</b> <b>savings</b> exceeds business investment (private sector surplus) must run a government budget deficit, as the three must net to zero. Both Martin Wolf and Paul Krugman explained that as the Great Recession hit, the saving (deleveraging) {{of the private sector}} significantly increased, while business investment declined in the face of reduced consumer spending. This created an enormous private sector surplus. Since the trade deficit did not change significantly, the offset was a large increase in the government budget deficit. The record drop in tax revenue and large increases in automatic stabilizer expenditures (such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments) were the mechanism for much of the additional deficit and debt increases, even before new economic policies were implemented. The significant reduction in demand implied by the increase in the private sector surplus (i.e., consumers and businesses saving rather than spending or investing) created a severe recession.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{estimates}} of consumption functions for 13 {{developing countries to}} analyze the effectiveness of public policy in raising saving. First, it provides evidence from time-series and panel data on how liquidity constraints affect consumption functions. This suggests that a rise in public saving does not produce an equal reduction in <b>private</b> <b>saving.</b> Second, it presents direct evidence of thelink between private consumption and government saving. These show that indirect effects of public policies on <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> are negligible, but that cuts in current public spending and current tax hikes significantly affect <b>private</b> <b>saving.</b> Increasing public saving by cutting current-period public expenditures by $ 1 reduces <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> by only 16 to 50 cents. Permanent cuts in public spending reduce <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> by 47 to 50 cents. A higher permanent tax hike has less of an effect on <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> than a transitory tax hike. For each $ 1 increase in permanent taxes, <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> declines only 23 to 26 cents. Increasing only current-period taxes reduces <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> between 48 and 65 cents. Increasing taxes and improving tax compliance are the most efficient ways to reduce public deficits when traditional tax revenue is low and inefficient tax levies are high and widespread. Finally, public policy can help raise <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> and make their use more efficient by providing a macroeconomic framework in which inflation is low and incentives are predictable.

By conventional (unadjusted) measures of <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> - the total investment not financed by public or foreign <b>savings</b> - <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> did decline sharply between 1987 and 1990. But that diagnosis does not hold true when private, public, and foreign savings are corrected (as they are here) to account for shifts in portfolio composition from foreign to domestic assets, for the effects of inflation on foreign and domestic interest income (the inflation tax), for fluctuations in the real exchange rate, and for other factors.

The following are among the conclusions: When conventional measures of <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> are corrected, the recent decline in <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> appears less important than it did before. Most variations in <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> between 1980 and 1990 are ascribable to fluctuations in disposable income.

This was a recipe for {{economic}} disaster that was largely avoided because Americans—cajoled daily by their government to do so—were also saving money at an all-time high rate, mostly in War Bonds but also in <b>private</b> <b>savings</b> accounts and insurance policies. Consumer saving was strongly encouraged through investment in war bonds that would mature after the war. Most workers had an automatic payroll deduction; children collected savings stamps until they had enough to buy a bond. Bond rallies were held throughout the U.S. with famous celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond advertising effectiveness. Several stars were responsible for personal appearance tours that netted multiple millions of dollars in bond pledges—an astonishing amount in 1943. The public paid ¾ of the face value of a war bond, and received the full face value back after a set number of years. This shifted their consumption from the war to postwar, and allowed over 40% of GDP to go to military spending, with moderate inflation. Americans were challenged to put [...] "at least 10% of every paycheck into Bonds". Compliance was very high, with entire factories of workers earning a special [...] "Minuteman" [...] flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the [...] "Ten Percent Club".
