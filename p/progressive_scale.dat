The family quotient can take into account family responsibilities and, according to them, eases the effects of progressive taxation since the progressive rate is applied to a partial income (the taxable income). This process consists of dividing the taxable income of the household tax into a number of units (or parts) equal to the number of individuals. The <b>progressive</b> <b>scale</b> of tax is then applied to taxable income per share. Finally, this partial tax is multiplied by the number of units to determine the taxable base.|$|E
5000|$|Later, Alexandru Toma's {{position}} as a supporter of internationalism came to clash with the official discourse: nationalism was reintroduced by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and especially by his successor Nicolae Ceaușescu. In 1984, under Ceaușescu's national communist leadership, literary critic Mircea Scarlat spoke of [...] "illogical overbidding" [...] in respect to Toma's encouragement during the 1950s. Also according to Scarlat, Marin Sorescu, a critically acclaimed poet who debuted in the post-1955 years, was [...] "irritated by the method" [...] of official poets such as Toma and Eugen Frunză, and contributed ironic pastiches of their work. Toma's Cîntecul bradului enjoyed more genuine success, and was famous for a while. The Romanian Revolution of 1989, which toppled the communist regime, was closely followed by open reevaluations of Toma's work and its entire context. In one such comment, written in 1990, writer Bujor Nedelcovici argued {{in favor of a}} <b>progressive</b> <b>scale</b> of guilt, on which the [...] "naïve opportunism" [...] of the 1950s ranked lower than the [...] "shameful opportunism" [...] of the 1970s and 1980s.

He also believed that nothing in Toma's work as an official poet could be recovered: [...] "A.

40|$|Summary. The {{international}} MRI expert {{subgroup of}} the International Prophylaxis Study Group (IPSG) {{has developed a}} consensus for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scales for assessment of haemophilic arthropathy. A MRI scoring scheme including a 10 step <b>progressive</b> <b>scale</b> and a 20 step additive scale with identical definitions of mutual steps is presented. Using the <b>progressive</b> <b>scale,</b> effusion/haemarthrosis can correspond to progressive scores of 1, 2, or 3, and synovial hypertrophy and/or haemosiderin deposition to 4, 5, or 6. The progressive score can be 7 or 8 if there are subchondral cysts and/or surface erosions, and it is 9 or 10 if there is loss of cartilage. Using the additive scale, synovial hypertrophy contributes 1 – 3 points to the additive score and haemosiderin deposition contributes 1 point. For osteochondral changes, 16 statements are evaluated {{as to whether they}} are true or false, and each true statement contributes 1 point to the additive score. The use of these two compatible scales for progressive and additive MRI assessments can facilitate international comparison of data and enhance the accumulation of experience on MRI scoring of haemophilic arthropathy...|$|E

The article grounds the need for institutional change to facilitate transition to progressive taxation and redistribution of the tax burden from the poor and middle classes to the super rich.

Subthreshold slope (SS) variations resulting from each variation source is studied: RDD and LER generate most of the SS variation and are primarily responsible for its skew. Drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) is examined against each intrinsic variation source, and RDD and LER are found to cause most of the DIBL variability. The correlation of DIBL with threshold-voltage is fully analysed with respect to each source of statistical variability and reliability.

The stripped ammonia is recovered by absorption with sulfuric acid, producing a 30 % solution of ammonium sulfate (reused as a base fertilizer).

Far from all MTS have been reorganized and the {{question of}} retaining machine operators in agriculture is very vital. They went willingly to work for the economically strong collective farms because such farms guaranteed high and stable earnings. Payments per labor day in 1957 in the strong collective farms of the Moscow regions varied from 13 to 27 rubles per labor day and tractor drivers were getting from 4 to 7 labor days for the actual work day, depending upon the complexity of the machines. For the MTS combine operators the pay per unit of work was the same throughout the USSR; but as conditions differed, their earnings differed too. They harvested 12. 1 ha per machine per day in Kazakhstan in 1957 (where the weather is favorable and the fields are large) and only 4. 2 ha in Latvia, so that the average earnings of combine operators varied from 138. 8 rubles in Kazakhstan to 34. 45 rubles in Estonia.

By mixing flickering red/green/blue (RGB) lights of different intensity like what the LCD panels with LED backlights have been doing, one can embed invisible VEP stimuli into color displays and use those stimuli for various brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of inducing steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEPs) using polychromatic LED lights flickering above the critical flicker fusion and color fusion frequencies of human vision. Jiang et al. showed that polychromatic lights flickering above human color/flicker fusion frequencies can activate distinct visual cortical areas observable using fMRI [1]. This study performed a parallel experiment to compare the SSVEP responses induced by the same combination of red and green lights. Leveraging on high temporal resolution of EEG signals, this study compared the SSVEP responses towards red/green stimuli with different duty cycles (20 %, 50 %) and relative phases (0 °, 90 °, 180 °).
