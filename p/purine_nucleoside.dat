5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Amanita exitialis contain a unique <b>purine</b> <b>nucleoside</b> that is {{coupled with an}} amino acid {{derivative}} named N2-(1-methoxycarbonylethyl)guanosine. The discovery and identification of this chemical was the first report of a naturally occurring nucleoside in which an amino acid derivative is bonded through its α-amino nitrogen (the nitrogen bonded to the α-carbon) to a nucleobase aglycone by a C-N (carbon to nitrogen) bond. The new compound {{was determined to be}} toxic in the brine shrimp lethality test, but it did not have cytotoxic activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines. Other compounds isolated from the fungus include β-carboline and russulaceramide (a ceramide formerly found in some Russula mushrooms).|$|E

25|$|There are {{two major}} forms of arsenic that can enter the body, arsenic (III) and arsenic (V). Arsenic (III) enters the cells though aquaporins 7 and 9, which {{is a type of}} aquaglyceroporin. Arsenic (V) {{compounds}} use phosphate transporters to enter cells. The arsenic (V) can be converted to arsenic (III) by the enzyme <b>purine</b> <b>nucleoside</b> phosphorylase.

40|$|Fifteen <b>purine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> {{and their}} O-acetylated ester {{derivatives}} were examined for in vitro antitrypanosomal activity against the LAB 110 EATRO isolate of Trypanosoma brucei brucei and two clinical isolates of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Initial comparisons of activity {{were made for}} the LAB 110 EATRO isolate. Three nucleoside analogs exhibited no significant activity (50 % inhibitory concentrations [IC 50 s] of > 100 microM), whether they were O acetylated or unacetylated; three nucleosides showed almost equal activity (IC 50 s of or = 3 -fold) upon O acetylation; of these nine analogs, six displayed activity at least 10 -fold {{greater than that of}} their parent nucleosides. The most significant results were those for four apparently inactive compounds which, upon O acetylation, displayed IC 50 s of < or = 25 microM. When the series of compounds was tested against T. brucei rhodesiense isolates (KETRI 243 and KETRI 269), their antitrypanosomal effects were comparable to those observed for the EATRO 110 strain. Thus, our studies of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> have determined that O acetylation consistently improved their in vitro antitrypanosomal activity. This observed phenomenon was independent of their cellular enzyme targets (i. e., S-adenosylmethionine, polyamine, or purine salvage pathways). On the basis of our results, the routine preparation of O-acetylated <b>purine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> for in vitro screening of antitrypanosomal activity is recommended, since O acetylation transformed several inactive nucleosides into compounds with significant activity, presumably by improving uptake characteristics. O-acetylated <b>purine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> may offer in vivo therapeutic advantages compared with their parent nucleosides, and this possibility should be considered in future evaluations of this structural class of trypanocides...|$|R
