5|$|Aiello plotted to {{eliminate}} both Lombardo and Capone, and {{starting in the}} spring of 1927 made several attempts to assassinate Capone. On one occasion he offered money to the chef of Diamond Joe Esposito's Bella Napoli Café, Capone's favorite restaurant, to put <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> in Capone's and Lombardo's soup; reports indicated he offered between $10,000-$35,000. Instead, the chef exposed the plot to Capone, who responded by dispatching men to destroy one of Aiello's stores on West Division Street with machine-gun fire. More than 200 bullets were fired into the Aiello Brothers Bakery on May 28, 1927, wounding Joe's brother Antonio. During the summer and autumn of 1927 a number of hitmen Aiello hired to kill Capone were themselves slain. Among them were Anthony Russo and Vincent Spicuzza, who Aiello had offered $25,000 each to kill Capone and Lombardo. Aiello eventually offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who eliminated Capone. At least 10 gunman tried to collect on Aiello's bounty, but ended up dead. Capone ally Ralph Sheldon attempted to kill both Capone and Lombardo for Aiello's reward, but Capone henchman Frank Nitti's intelligence network learned of the transaction and had Sheldon shot in front of a West Side hotel, although he didn't die.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the name}} <b>prussic</b> <b>acid,</b> HCN {{has been used}} as a killing agent in whaling harpoons. From the middle of the 18th century it was used in a number of {{poisoning}} murders and suicides.|$|E
25|$|Amygdalin {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1830 from bitter almond seeds (Prunus dulcis) by Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Antoine Boutron-Charlard. Liebig and Wöhler found three hydrolysis products of amygdalin: sugar, benzaldehyde, and <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> (hydrogen cyanide). Later research showed that sulfuric acid hydrolyzes it into D-glucose, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid; while hydrochloric acid gives mandelic acid, D-glucose, and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his joint recognition for the discovery of oxygen, Scheele is argued {{to have been the}} first to discover other chemical elements such as barium (1772), manganese (1774), molybdenum (1778), and tungsten (1781), as well as several chemical compounds, including citric acid, lactic acid, glycerol, hydrogen cyanide (also known, in aqueous solution, as <b>prussic</b> <b>acid),</b> hydrogen fluoride, and hydrogen sulfide (1777). In addition, he discovered a process similar to pasteurization, along with a means of mass-producing phosphorus (1769), leading Sweden {{to become one of the}} world's leading producers of matches.|$|E
500|$|Zyklon B ( [...] ; {{translated}} Cyclone B) was {{the trade}} {{name of a}} cyanide-based pesticide invented in Germany in the early 1920s. It consisted of hydrogen cyanide (<b>prussic</b> <b>acid),</b> {{as well as a}} cautionary eye irritant and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth. The product is infamous for its use by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust to murder approximately one [...] million people in gas chambers installed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and other extermination camps.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{became the}} target of a {{campaign}} by James Douglas, editor of the Sunday Express, who wrote, [...] "I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> than this novel." [...] Although its only sexual reference consists of the words [...] "and that night, they were not divided", a British court judged it obscene because it defended [...] "unnatural practices between women". In the United States the book survived legal challenges in New York state and in Customs Court.|$|E
500|$|During his lifetime, Poe {{was mostly}} {{recognized}} as a literary critic. Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him [...] "the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America", suggesting—rhetorically—that he occasionally used <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> instead of ink. Poe's caustic reviews earned him {{the reputation of being}} a [...] "tomahawk man". A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called [...] "The Longfellow War". Poe accused Longfellow of [...] "the heresy of the didactic", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized. Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, [...] "We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future".|$|E
500|$|Douglas's {{campaign}} against The Well of Loneliness began on 18 August, with poster and billboard advertising and a teaser in the Daily Express promising to expose [...] "A Book That Should Be Suppressed". In his editorial the next day, Douglas wrote that [...] "sexual inversion and perversion" [...] had already become too visible {{and that the}} publication of The Well brought home the need for society to [...] "cleans itself from the leprosy of these lepers". For Douglas the sexological view of homosexuality was pseudoscience, incompatible with the Christian doctrine of free will; instead, he argued, homosexuals were damned by their own choice– which meant that others could be corrupted by [...] "their propaganda". Above all, children must be protected: [...] "I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> than this novel. Poison kills the body, but moral poison kills the soul." [...] He called on the publishers to withdraw {{the book and the}} Home Secretary to take action if they did not.|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying {{on the table in front}} of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogen cyanide (HCN), {{sometimes}} called <b>prussic</b> <b>acid,</b> is a chemical compound with the chemical formula HCN. It is a colorless, extremely poisonous and flammable liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at [...] HCN is produced on an industrial scale {{and is a}} highly valuable precursor to many chemical compounds ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals.|$|E
2500|$|In 1787, the French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet {{showed that}} <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> {{did not contain}} oxygen, an {{important}} contribution to acid theory, which had hitherto postulated that acids must contain oxygen (hence the name of oxygen itself, which is derived from Greek elements that mean [...] "acid-former" [...] and are likewise calqued into German as Sauerstoff). In 1811, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac prepared pure, liquified hydrogen cyanide. [...] In 1815, Gay-Lussac deduced Prussic acid's chemical formula. The radical cyanide in hydrogen cyanide was given its name from cyan, not only an English word for a shade of blue but the Greek word for blue (...) , again owing to its derivation from Prussian blue.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 August 1942, the Riegner Telegram to New York {{described}} the Nazi plan to murder all the Jews {{in the occupied}} states by deporting them to concentration camps in the east, to be exterminated in one blow, possibly by <b>prussic</b> <b>acid,</b> starting at autumn 1942. It was released in the United States by Stephen Wise of the World Jewish Congress in November 1942 after a long wait for permission from the government. This led to attempts by Jewish organizations to put President Roosevelt under pressure to act {{on behalf of the}} European Jews, many of whom had tried in vain to enter either Britain or the U.S.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogen cyanide {{was first}} {{isolated}} from a blue pigment (Prussian blue) {{which had been}} known since 1704 but whose structure was unknown. It is now {{known to be a}} coordination polymer with a complex structure and an empirical formula of hydrated ferric ferrocyanide. In 1752, the French chemist Pierre Macquer made the important step of showing that Prussian blue could be converted to iron oxide plus a volatile component and that these could be used to reconstitute it. The new component was what we now know as hydrogen cyanide. Following Macquer's lead, it was first prepared from Prussian blue by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1782, and was eventually given the German name Blausäure (lit. [...] "Blue acid") because of its acidic nature in water and its derivation from Prussian blue. In English, it became known popularly as <b>prussic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At Auschwitz, {{after the}} {{chambers}} were filled, {{the doors were}} shut and pellets of Zyklon-B were dropped into the chambers through vents, releasing toxic <b>prussic</b> <b>acid,</b> or hydrogen cyanide. Those inside died within 20 minutes; the speed of death depended on how close the inmate was standing to a gas vent, according to the commandant Rudolf Höss, who estimated that {{about one-third of the}} victims died immediately. Johann Kremer, an SS doctor who oversaw the gassings, testified that: [...] "Shouting and screaming of the victims could be heard through the opening and it was clear that they fought for their lives." [...] The gas was then pumped out, the bodies were removed, gold fillings in their teeth were extracted, and women's hair was cut. The work was done by the Sonderkommando, or work groups of Jewish prisoners. At first at Auschwitz, the bodies were buried in deep pits and covered with lime, but between September and November 1942, on the orders of Himmler, they were dug up and burned. In early 1943, new gas chambers and crematoria were built to accommodate the numbers.|$|E
2500|$|Poe had an {{assistant}} editor who aided in corresponding with contributors, allowing him enough free {{time to write}} his own stories. Poe also had a decent relationship with Graham and {{took advantage of the}} editorial control he was granted. The magazine was the first to publish [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", [...] "A Descent into the Maelström", [...] "The Island of the Fay", [...] "The Mask Of The Red Death - A Fantasy", and others. He also reviewed Charles Dickens's The Old Curiosity Shop, Nathaniel Hawthorne's Twice-Told Tales, and works by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Washington Irving and many others. He also further built up his reputation as a harsh literary critic, causing James Russell Lowell to suggest Poe sometimes mistook [...] "his phial of <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> for his inkstand". With Graham's, Poe also launched his Literati of New York series, which purportedly analyzes the signatures of well-known figures in the New York scene, but which featured Poe taking pot-shots at their personalities. The Philadelphia Inquirer in October 1841 called Poe's article [...] "the most singular, and at the same time, the most interesting article" [...] in the magazine.|$|E
2500|$|It was the Obscene Publications Act 1857 {{which made}} the sale of obscene {{material}} a statutory offence, for the first time, giving the courts power to seize and destroy offending material. The origins of the Act itself were in a trial {{for the sale of}} pornography presided over by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Campbell, {{at the same time as}} a debate in the House of Lords over a bill aiming to restrict the sale of poisons. Campbell was taken by the analogy between the two situations, famously referring to the London pornography trade as [...] "a sale of poison more deadly than <b>prussic</b> <b>acid,</b> strychnine or arsenic", and proposed a bill to restrict the sale of pornography; giving statutory powers of destruction would allow for a much more effective degree of prosecution. The bill was controversial at the time, receiving strong opposition from both Houses of Parliament, and was passed on the assurance by the Lord Chief Justice that it was [...] "... intended to apply exclusively to works written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth and of a nature calculated to shock the common feelings of decency in any well-regulated mind." [...] The House of Commons successfully amended it so as not to apply to Scotland, on the grounds that Scottish common law was sufficiently stringent.|$|E

6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} {{it was not an}} accident, Dorian, though it must be put in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had {{forgotten}} something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but she did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don't know what it was, but it had either <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> or white lead in it. I should fancy it was <b>prussic</b> <b>acid,</b> as she seems to have died instantaneously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Rayner," [...] she said, after a pause, [...] "do you {{remember}} at lunch {{one day at}} Mrs. Elphinstone's refusing parsnips? You said that, so far as you were concerned, parsnips were first by a mile, and that <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> and strychnine also ran." ...|$|E

6000|$|... [11] Thus; by {{considering}} <b>prussic</b> <b>acid</b> as {{a compound of}} hydrogen and cyanogen rather than of hydrogen and the elements of cyanogen (carbon and nitrogen), it is assimilated to a whole class of acid compounds between hydrogen and other substances, and a reason is thus found for its agreeing in their acid properties.|$|E
