The reactions have been developed on laboratory scale by academia over the last two centuries and subsequently adapted to industrial scale, for instance for the manufacture of dyestuffs & pigments. The most comprehensive handbooks describing organic synthetic methods is Methods of Molecular Transformations. About 10% of the 26,000 synthetic methods described in are currently used on an industrial scale for fine chemicals production. Amination, condensation, esterification, Friedel-Crafts, Grignard, halogenation (esp. chlorination), and hydrogenation, respectively reduction (both catalytic and chemical) are most frequently mentioned on the websites of individual companies. Optically active cyanohydrins, cyclopolymerization, ionic liquids, nitrones, oligonucletides, peptide (both liquid- and solid-phase), electrochemical reactions (e.g., <b>perfluorination)</b> and steroid synthesis are promoted by {{only a limited number of}} companies. With the exception of some stereospecific reactions, particularly biotechnology, mastering these technologies does not represent a distinct competitive advantage. Most reactions can be carried out in standard multipurpose plants. The very versatile organometallic reactions (e.g., conversions with lithium aluminum hydride, boronic acids) may require temperatures as low as -100 °C, which can be achieved only in special cryogenic reaction units, either by using liquefied nitrogen as coolant or by installing a low-temperature unit. Other reaction-specific equipment, such as filters for the separation of catalysts, ozone or phosgene generators, can be purchased in many different sizes. The installation of special equipment generally is not a critical path on the overall project for developing an industrial-scale process of a new molecule.|$|E

40|$|The {{applicability}} of the perfluoro effect to the X-ray spectra (300 – 800 eV) of unsaturated organic molecules is explored. The C 1 s and F 1 s (and Ols where appropriate) oscillator strength spectra of five fluoroethylenes, octafluorocyclopentene, formyi fluoride, carbonyl fluoride, hexa-fluorobutadiene, trifluoroacetic acid, hexafluorobutyne- 2, hexafluoroacetone, and octafluorona-phthalene were derived from electron impact energy loss spectra recorded under electric-dipole scattering conditions. These spectra are analyzed and {{compared with those of}} their perhydro analogs, several of which (naphthalene, acetic acid, butyne- 2) are reported for the first time. In unsaturated systems in which all the atoms lie in the molecular plane, such as ethylene, formaldehyde, benzene, etc., <b>perfluorination</b> results in approximately 10 eV shifts of the inner-shell energy loss spectra to higher energies, yet the term values for the C 1 s→ 1 π* excitations are shifted by only 1 eV and often less. In direct contrast, the term values for the equivalent C 1 s→ 1 π* excitations in unsaturated systems having atoms out of the molecular plane, such as butene- 2 and acetone, are shifted upward by up to 3 eV upon <b>perfluorination.</b> These different spectral behaviors of planar and nonplanar systems on fluorination quantitatively parallel those which were observed earlier for valence-level ionization potentials (10 – 20 eV) and attributed to the perfluoro effect. It is observed {{for the first time that}} the C 1 s→ 1 π* excitation energies in planar hydrocarbons are only very weakly dependent on the spatial extent of the π-electron system. An explanation involving a localized C 1 s hole is proposed to rationalize this behavior. The perfluoro effect also predicts that excitations to σ* MO's will become relatively low-lying in highly fluorinated planar systems. Such low-lying inner-shell excitations induced by fluorination are observed in the fluoroethylene series and in the fluorocarbonyls. When the negative-ion spectra of the fluoroethylenes are assigned in a self-consistent manner, a σ* MO is found to drop into the vicinity of 1 π* upon fluorination. A similar intrusion of the lowest σ MO among the π* MO's is also observed upon fluorinating benzene, while evidence for this in the case of naphthalene is less clear, on account of the complex pattern of multiple C 1 s→nπ* transitions in this molecule. Inner-shell oscillator strength distributions are reported for all the spectra considered herein. In general, <b>perfluorination</b> increases the oscillator strengths of C 1 s→ 1 π* transitions by up to a factor of two. Variation of the C 1 s→ 1 π* and O 1 s→ 17 π* oscillator strengths in the series H 2 CO, HFCO, F 2 CO shows clearly how the 17 π* MO becomes more polarized toward C as fluorination proceeds.

The key conformers of both families exhibit a six-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bond (IMHB) interaction. A significant enhancement in the strength of the IMHB is observed in ?-fluoro-o-cresols, owing to a simultaneous increase in the hydrogen bond (HB) basicity of the aliphatic fluorine and the HB acidity of the aromatic hydroxyl relative to that observed for o-fluorobenzyl alcohols, which are characterized by aromatic fluorine atoms and aliphatic hydroxyl groups. In the cases of the di- and trifluorinated derivatives, the occurrence of a three-centered HB is emphasized, and its features are discussed. The impact of these structural predilections on the HB properties of o-cresol was characterized from the estimation of the HB acidity parameter, pKAHY, weighted according to their conformational populations.

The observed Raman excitation profiles and the decay rate constants of triplet excited states of FA satisfactorily reproduce, respectively, the absorption spectra and decay rate constants reported previously from transient absorption studies.

We begin with an overview of charge transport in organic electronic materials with a focus on electronic polarization while discussing recent models, followed by a review of the computational methods employed throughout our investigations. We provide a bottom-up approach to the problem of describing electronic polarization by first laying the framework of our model and comparing calculated properties of bulk materials to available experimental data and previously proposed models. We then explore the effects of changing the electronic structure of our systems though <b>perfluorination,</b> and investigate the effects of modifying the crystalline packing through the addition of bulky functional groups while investigating how the non-bonded interactions between molecular neighbors change in different packing motifs. As interfaces are common in organic electronics and important processes such as charge transport and charge separation occur at these interfaces, we model organic-vacuum and organic-organic interfaces to determine the effect changing the environment from bulk to interface has on the electronic polarization.

40|$|Semiconductor {{manufacturing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} advancing, growing and evolving industries. The production of semiconductors presents several challenges, both technologically and environmentally. The amount and complexity of the chemical substances utilized in the manufacturing process has been growing exponentially, and new chemicals are often introduced to the process and the environment. Two steps of this process play a special important role in the introduction of new chemical and demand of natural resources: Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) and Photolithography. Wastewaters from the semiconductor manufacturing are complex and have several chemicals in different concentrations. Heavy metals, acids, chelators, surfactants and other chemicals are found in semiconductor effluents. Part of the scope of this study is to evaluate and remediate wastewaters produced in semiconductor manufacturing. During the development of this project it was found that copper can be successfully removed and recovered from CMP wastewaters by the use of a sulfate reducing bioreactor and a crystallization reactor, promoting precipitation of copper sulfides on the surface of silica sand. High removal and recovery efficiencies were found as result of the study. Another finding include that citrate is a readily biodegradable compound which can be successfully utilized as electron donor for anaerobic processes such as methanogenesis and sulfate reductions. However other important chelator, like EDTA, can cause toxicity to these microorganisms and affect important biological processes. PFOS is an important chemical for the semiconductor industry; however, the physical and chemical properties make this compound persistent in the environment and bioaccumulative. New substitutes for PFOS were tested and evaluated for their environmental impact. It was found that <b>perfluorination</b> plays an important role in the chemical properties of PFOS and removal of this characteristic improves the environmental performance of the new substitutes. Evaluation of these new chemicals was also performed by simulation and modeling. The software utilized in this study identified properties like toxicity and octanol-water partition coefficient accurately. On the other hand biodegradability was poorly estimated and new models are suggested for evaluation of this property for compounds with characteristics similar to the ones studied here (specifically high fluorination) ...|$|E
40|$|Non-covalent {{interactions}} (NCIs) play vital {{roles in}} many areas of chemistry and materials science. Although there has {{been a great deal of}} progress understanding the nature of non-covalent interactions in recent years, many aspects of these phenomena are still unclear. Modern DFT methods have become a valuable tool for organic chemists in studies of systems in which dispersion-driven NCIs are vital. The role of non-covalent interactions in two organocatalyzed reactions and two novel organic materials were studied by means of these and other computational tools. The two organocatalyzed reactions presented are the allylation and propargylation reactions catalyzed by a bipyridine N,N?-dioxide catalyst and a hetero-Diels ? Alder reaction catalyzed by a cage-shaped borate catalyst. In the first case, the reaction was used as an example to benchmark DFT methods against high accuracy ab initio calculations. It was shown that B 97 -D/TZV(2 d, 2 p) provides the best compromise of accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the original transition state model used to explain the stereoselectivity of these reactions is flawed. We developed a simple model based on non-covalent electrostatic interactions that explains the stereoselectivity of these reactions as well as the fact that the propargylation reaction is less stereoselective than the allylation. For the second reaction, preliminary results provide some support that ?-stacking interactions between the substrate and the catalyst are responsible for the selective reaction of aromatic over aliphatic aldehydes, as observed experimentally. In an effort to better control the properties of organic materials based on discotic systems, stacking interactions between contorted hexabenzocoronene (c-HBC) homodimers and complexes of c-HBC with C 60 fullerene were studied using DFT methods. It was found that the preference to stack as homo or heterodimers can be tuned by controlling the curvature of the c-HBC. To achieve this, different substituents on the c-HBC were tested. However, only <b>perfluorination</b> imparts sufficient curvature to the c-HBC to lead to tip the balance towards heterodimer formation over homodimer formation. Finally, an additional explanation was provided for the rotational speed difference between the ?OH and ?OMe substituted pillar[5]arenes. It is shown that in addition to the hydrogen bond explanation for the ?OH substituted case provided by Ogishi and coworkers (J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2010, 817), non-covalent CH/? interactions contribute significantly to the TS stabilization of the ?OMe substituted case, enhancing the rotational speed...|$|E
