The market {{offers a lot of}} variants for <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tartrate elimination, which includes electrodialysis. The aim of this work was to process 4 types of wines with the electrodialysis technique, of which at least 2 white and 2 red wines were preferentially unstable in terms of formation of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> crystals. These wines were processed by the electrodialysis laboratory machine EDR [...] Z/ 10 which was from the MemBrain company.

The samples of wine processed by electrodialysis were analysed by the sensory technique, for the content of tartaric acid and potassium, and for the saturation temperature of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tartrate. The work dealt with the relation between the level of demineralization of wine, by electrodialysis, and its organoleptic properties (color, smell, taste, harmony).

50|$|To avoid {{contamination}} and suppress {{the formation of}} by-products (which are difficult to remove) the reaction must be performed under careful control of mass ratios and process conditions. Excess sulfite (SO32−) or bisulfite (HSO3−) lead to an unpleasant odor of the downstream product, higher levels of ethylene glycol or glycol ethers (formed by the hydrolysis and ethoxylation of ethylene oxide) give hygroscopic and greasy surfactants. Concentrated ethylene glycol-containing sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate solutions can subsequently mostly be freed from ethylene glycol by continuous extraction with e.g. isopropanol (<0.5%). Therefore, in the continuous industrial process an aqueous sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfite</b> solution is prepared in a first reactor by mixing a sodium hydroxide solution and sulfur dioxide. In a second reactor the sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfite</b> solution is mixed with a slight excess of ethylene oxide to obtain sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate in almost quantitative yields at elevated temperature and pressure with a precise control of pH. The reaction has to take place under the exclusion of oxygen and under precise control of the stoichiometry of the reactants, the temperature, the pH and the throughput.|$|R
