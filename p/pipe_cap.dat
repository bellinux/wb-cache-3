50|$|Each closed-head {{sprinkler}} is held {{closed by}} either a heat-sensitive glass bulb (see below) or a two-part metal link {{held together with}} fusible alloy such as Wood's metal and other alloys with similar compositions. The glass bulb or link applies pressure to a <b>pipe</b> <b>cap</b> which acts as a plug which prevents water from flowing until the ambient temperature around the sprinkler reaches the design activation temperature of the individual sprinkler. Because each sprinkler activates independently when the predetermined heat level is reached, the number of sprinklers that operate is limited to only those near the fire, thereby maximizing the available water pressure over the point of fire origin.|$|E

Forty seven homes were constructed and monitored. Forty two were located in counties designated as Zone 1 by the EPA's Map of Radon Zones. All homes contained passive vent pipes to vent soil gases from beneath the foundation, up through the roof, and to the outdoors. Two-week tests were conducted in each home with the <b>pipe</b> <b>capped</b> and uncapped. Nineteen homes yielded radon concentrations exceeding the EPA action level of 4 pCi/l when <b>pipes</b> were <b>capped.</b> Radon concentrations in thirteen of these homes fell below the EPA action level when pipes were uncapped.

50|$|So {{that the}} entire {{locomotive}} cylinder block {{does not have to}} be changed when the valves are damaged, they are housed in special chests. The valve chest consists of two elements which are forced into the cylinder block from the front and rear. Using special boring tools this chest can be bored out several times during maintenance. In the last illustration the junction of the two halves of the chest and the right-angled ports can be seen towards the rear. These are steam admission ports. Steam is admitted to the pistons of the steam engine through the front diagonal slits. The front area, outside the valve chest, is called the exhaust chest and discharges, via the exhaust pipe, the riser (Standrohr) and the blast <b>pipe</b> <b>cap</b> (Blasrohrkopf) centrally, underneath the chimney of the locomotive. The motion of the valve heads alternately opens and closes the diagonal slits or steam ports, thus controlling the admission and exhausting of steam in the steam engine.|$|E

The double containment vessels are relatively simple designs using pipe and <b>pipe</b> <b>cap</b> in conjunction with the Chalfont closure to provide a leak-tight vessel. The fabrication appears simple in nature, but the history of fabrication tells us there are pitfalls in the different fabrication methods and sequences.

As shown in the photo, beavers will quickly move to dam the flowing water over and around the pipes. As they do this, the water level will rise behind the pipes. After the beavers have a good seal established over and around the pipes, remove the end caps and the water level upstream will reach equilibrium {{with the level of}} the upstream pipes. Remember it is the sound of running water that will attract beavers to build a dam, so the further downstream you divert the water, the better.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring the {{extraction}} {{process of the}} top coal caving working face, the fierce looseness, deformation as well as fracture of the surrounding rocks would usually occur because the slots will get strong disturbance. Meanwhile, anchored bolt and cable-bolt shall deform accordingly. When the deformation of the anchored bolt or cable-bolt comes to the extreme extent, they will crack. Then the catapulting and wounding incident will easily happen if the fractural part of the anchored bolt and cable-bolt is not fully griped by the rocks. In the paper, based on the dynamic mechanism analysis on fracture phenomenon about the anchored cable-bolt, the formulas of the kinetic energy and speed of the fractural catapult of the horizontally anchored cables in the ribs and the vertically anchored cables in the roof have been established. And a bolt support theory “small pretightening force & large expected anchorage strength” has been put forward, which is useful for seriously deformed roadways to prevent anchored cable-bolts from breaking. In addition, a technological method to stop anchored cable-bolt ejecting by means of <b>pipe</b> <b>cap</b> has been put forward...|$|E
40|$|The feeds in {{this chapter}} are those that don’t fit {{in any of the}} other categories. One thing they seem to have in common is a lack of design methodology: no {{explanation}} is given for why they should work, so {{there is no way of}} telling how the dimensions given were derived. In most cases, the dimensions were arrived at empirically, but performance data is sketchy or nonexistent, so we can’t tell if some of these feeds really work. Where possible, I used NEC 2 computer modeling for the feeds, but some of the arcane topologies make modeling very difficult. For those feeds, I include published data where available. Finally, for the popular “Penny ” feed, data was not available and good modeling seemed unlikely, so I built one and measured the pattern. 6. 7. 1 Clavin Feed A feed described by Clavin 1 in 1974 is a cavity antenna fed by a resonant slot. Probes on either side of the slot excite the TM waveguide mode in addition to the dominant TE mode to broaden the 11 11 E-plane pattern to match the H-plane — this is a dual-mode feed. The feed is physically small and can be built with hand tools; Figure 6. 7 - 1 is a photograph of a 10 GHz version that I made from a 1 -inch copper plumbing <b>pipe</b> <b>cap.</b> Dimensions are shown in Figure 6. 7 - 2, and a photograph of a 5760 MHz version made by K 1 DPP is shown in Figure 6. 7 - 3. The resonant slot makes this feed rather narrowband — if you are building one, make the slot slightly short and file it for good VSWR. I’ve used the Clavin feeds successfully on small dishes at 10 GHz 2 and 5760 MHz 3. Figure 6. 7 - 4 is a plot of Clavin’s original published data, with best efficiency at an f/D around 0. 35 to 0. 4. Peak efficiency is not as high as some other feeds. However, on small dishes the efficiency of the better feeds would be reduced by feed blockage. I measured 2 53 % efficienc...|$|E

40|$|A {{system of}} inelastic hard disks {{in a thin}} <b>pipe</b> <b>capped</b> by hot walls is studied {{with the aim of}} {{investigating}} velocity correlations between particles. Two effects lead to such correlations: inelastic collisions help to build localized correlations, while momentum conservation and diffusion produce long ranged correlations. In the quasi-elastic limit, the velocity correlation is weak, but it is still important since it is of the same order as the deviation from uniformity. For system with stronger inelasticity, the pipe contains a clump of particles in highly correlated motion. A theory with empirical parameters is developed. This theory is composed of equations similar to the usual hydrodynamic laws of conservation of particles, energy, and momentum. Numerical results show that the theory describes the dynamics satisfactorily in the quasi-elastic limit, however only qualitatively for stronger inelasticity.

Additionally, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Subsection NB compliance along with the benefits compared to typical welding of containment vessels will be discussed. SRNL has completed fabrication development and the testing on flow formed containment vessels to demonstrate the use of flow forming as an alternate method of manufacturing a welded 6 -inch diameter containment vessel currently used in the 9975 and 9977 radioactive material shipping packaging. Material testing and nondestructive evaluation of the flow formed parts demonstrate compliance to the minimum material requirements specified in applicable parts of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section II. Destructive burst testing shows comparable results {{to that of a}} welded design. The benefits of flow forming as compared to typical welding of containment vessels are significant: dimensional control is improved due to no weld distortion; less final machining; weld fit-up issues associated with <b>pipes</b> and <b>pipe</b> <b>caps</b> are eliminated; post-weld non-destructive testing (i. e., radiography and die penetrant tests) is not necessary; and less fabrication steps are required. Results presented in this paper indicate some of the benefits in adapting flow forming to design of future radioactive material shipping packages containment vessels...|$|R
