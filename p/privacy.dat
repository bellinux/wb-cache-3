5|$|In March 2016, the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the New York City {{office of}} the American Civil Liberties Union, {{wrote a letter to}} Mayor de Blasio {{outlining}} their <b>privacy</b> concerns. In the letter, representatives for the NYCLU wrote that CityBridge could be retaining too much information about LinkNYC users. They also stated that the <b>privacy</b> policy was vague and needed to be clarified. They recommended that the <b>privacy</b> policy be rewritten so that it expressly mentions whether the Links' environmental sensors or cameras are being used by any NYPD or city systems.|$|E

5|$|On 15 July 2010, despite Octopus' {{claims to}} have never sold data, a former {{employee}} of the CIGNA insurance company claimed CIGNA purchased records for 2.4 million Octopus users. On 20 July, Octopus acknowledged selling customers' personal details to Cigna and CPP, and started an internal review of their data practices. Octopus Holdings made 44 million Hong Kong dollars ($5.7M USD) over 4.5 years. Roderick Woo Bun, Hong Kong's <b>Privacy</b> Commissioner for Personal Data, gave radio interviews and called for transparent investigation, but his term expired {{at the end of}} July 2010. Allan Chiang Yam-wang was announced as the incoming <b>Privacy</b> Commissioner. This news was met with protests and international outrage, due to his prior history of <b>privacy</b> invasions involving cameras used to spy on his employees at the Post Office, and disclosing hundreds of job applicants' personal data to corporations. Outgoing <b>Privacy</b> Commissioner Woo pledged to finish a preliminary report on the Octopus <b>privacy</b> abuse before his term ends, and called for a new law making it a criminal offence for companies to sell personal data.|$|E

5|$|Related to <b>privacy,</b> the ACLU {{engaged in}} several battles {{to ensure that}} {{government}} records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 Family Educational Rights and <b>Privacy</b> Act, which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 <b>Privacy</b> Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.|$|E

5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} <b>privacy</b> {{is one area}} of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications <b>Privacy</b> Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a <b>privacy</b> invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{counter-terrorism}} agency NCTb {{said that}} it had started a probe into where the suspect originated. Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from <b>privacy</b> advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over the <b>privacy</b> of the individuals being scanned, but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual's <b>privacy,</b> as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E

The update to Google’s <b>privacy</b> policy has alarmed both public and private sectors. The European Union has asked Google to delay the onset of the new <b>privacy</b> policy {{in order to ensure that}} it does not violate E.U. law. This move is in accordance with objections to decreasing online <b>privacy</b> raised in other foreign nations where surveillance is more heavily scrutinized.

25|$|In 1998, {{the company}} faced heavy {{criticism}} because <b>privacy</b> groups {{alleged that the}} RealJukebox software program incorporated spyware to track unsuspecting users' listening patterns and download history.

Subsequently, RealNetworks submitted to independent outside audits of its <b>privacy</b> practices. Several lawsuits regarding the alleged <b>privacy</b> violations were settled out of court.

25|$|Google {{has long}} been {{attacked}} for their lack of <b>privacy</b> in the U.S. as well as abroad. In 2007, however, the tables began to turn. Peter Fleischer, a Google representative, addressed the U.N. in France regarding <b>privacy</b> issues and expressed that the current international <b>privacy</b> policies were not adequately protecting consumers. Instead of continuing to enforce broken and ineffective Internet <b>privacy</b> laws, the Google representative proposed that the United Nations establish a global <b>privacy</b> policy that would efficiently protect consumers <b>privacy</b> while causing the least possible amount of negative impact on web browsers such as Google. At that time, Google was {{under investigation by the}} European Union for violating the global <b>privacy</b> policies that were already in place.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{and digital}} <b>privacy</b> are viewed {{differently}} from traditional expectations of <b>privacy.</b> Internet <b>privacy</b> is {{primarily concerned with}} protecting user information. Law Professor Jerry Kang explains that the term <b>privacy</b> expresses space, decision, and information. In terms of space, individuals have an expectation that their physical spaces (i.e. homes, cars) not be intruded. <b>Privacy</b> {{within the realm of}} decision is best illustrated by the landmark case Roe v. Wade. Lastly, information <b>privacy</b> is in regards to the collection of user information from a variety of sources, which produces great discussion.|$|E

25|$|Turkle {{talks about}} the nature of <b>privacy</b> in the post 9/11 world, arguing that <b>privacy</b> was sacrificed in {{exchange}} for safety. Turkle argues that because they have grown up as part of a world in which <b>privacy</b> is regarded as increasingly tenuous, children do not always appreciate the full value of <b>privacy,</b> which in turn causes them to share even more personal details on the web. This further depreciates the value of <b>privacy</b> in a self-perpetuating cycle.|$|E
