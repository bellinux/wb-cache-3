'Buckling temperature magnification factor of the first kind, eta' is established for the fixed <b>panel</b> <b>edges</b> to scale up the buckling solution of uniform temperature loading case to give the buckling solution of the humped temperature profile loading cases.

5000|$|<b>Panel</b> <b>edge</b> {{staining}} is {{a naturally}} occurring problem that occurs to anodized aluminium {{and stainless steel}} paneling and facades. It is semi-permanent staining that dulls the panel or facades surface (in particular {{the edges of the}} paneling), reducing the natural luster and shine produced by the anodizing processes used on the aluminium. <b>Panel</b> <b>edge</b> staining may also appear on powder coated aluminium, painted aluminium, stainless steel and titanium surfaces.|$|E

50|$|The other {{feature that}} made the Devin bodies popular was the high quality of the finish. Devin used {{fibreglass}} cloth for the outer layer of their bodywork rather than the coarser glass mat often used by other manufacturers. This produced a very smooth surface finish on the bodies.

50|$|Since {{the core}} {{material}} of a VIP {{is similar in}} thermal characteristics to materials used in conventional insulation, VIPs therefore achieve a much lower thermal conductivity (k-value) than conventional insulation, or in other words a higher thermal resistance per unit of thickness. Typically, commercially available VIPs achieve a thermal conductivity of 0.004 W/(m·K) across {{the centre of the}} panel, or an overall value of 0.006-0.008 W/(m·K) after allowing for thermal bridging (heat conduction across the <b>panel</b> <b>edges)</b> and the inevitable gradual loss of vacuum over time.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{the facade}} {{systems that are}} {{suspended}} or attached to the precast concrete slabs will be made from aluminium (powdercoated or anodized) or stainless steel.

50|$|After {{moving the}} panel {{to the proper}} {{deployment}} location as indicated on the Panel Layout Diagram for the project, the panel is unfolded or unrolled from the shipping pallet. The pallet is usually on a front-end loader or forklift which moves backwards to facilitate unfolding or unrolling of the panel. Pulling the geomembrane panel off the pallet or the roll by a chain is not recommended because it may damage the geomembrane. Deployment personnel are then positioned approximately 4.6 m apart {{along the edges of}} the panel to unfold and move the panel into the proper location. If the edge to be gripped is to be subsequently welded or bonded, the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> is folded back about 0.6 to 1.0 m, creating a fold. The fold is gripped using the 0.3 m long by 10 mm (1-foot long by 2 inch) diameter smooth wooden dowel or a smooth grade stake rather than the edge itself. This is to avoid stretching the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> where it is to be bonded to another panel. As the panel is pulled out, it is necessary to maintain air under the geomembrane to reduce friction with the ground surface. This can be accomplished by holding the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> and advancing at a rate fast enough to create air under the geomembrane as it is unfolded. Another method is to “fan” air under the geomembrane by raising and lowering the edge of the panel to create a wave-like action across the liner as it is being spread. After the panel is set in the exact position, it is welded or bonded to adjacent panels.|$|E

50|$|The nut {{is usually}} {{slightly}} {{loose in the}} cage to allow for minor adjustments in alignment. This reduces {{the likelihood that the}} threads will be stripped during equipment installation and removal. The dimensions of the spring steel clip determines thickness of the panel to which the nut may be clipped. In the case of square-hole cage nuts, the clip dimensions determine the range of hole sizes to which the clip will securely hold the nut. In the case of slide-on cage nuts, the clip dimensions determine the distance from the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> to the hole.|$|E
50|$|When light waves, water waves, {{or sound}} waves {{encounter}} {{the edge of}} an object, the wave bends around the edge; it is called diffraction. There is no rating for this phenomenon but it can be calculated when necessary. It is most important with furniture panels in the open office. The line from a talker to the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> and then to a listener creates an angle. The greater the angle the more sound reduction. A large bending angle occurs when the talker or the listener is closer to the panel and when the panel is high.|$|E
40|$|The {{shape of}} {{tensioned}} fabric structures is realised via {{a process of}} patterning, which involves ‘flattening’ of sections, or panels, of a 3 D membrane, onto a plane. The patterning method proposed here uses bicubic spline descriptions of surfaces undergoing flattening, followed by elastic analysis of strains arising from this process and from membrane pre-stress. The results, which ensure stress compatibility along <b>panel</b> <b>edges,</b> produce a cutting pattern and stress variation within it when the panel is assembled into the 3 D form. They confirm a general relationship between panel width and stress deviation from the intended pre-stress reported in [1]...|$|R
40|$|Considering growing {{population}} and decreasing mineral resource reserves, {{the issue of}} undermining has been and shall remain very topical. This study aims to identify the mutual connections between mined out panels of a deposit and the final manifestations on the ground surface related to deep black coal mining. On {{the grounds of the}} identified connections, the study describes a method to simplify a common evaluation of undermined areas according to building site categories. Within the study, a demarcation of the areas was conducted in two localities in Czech Republic influenced by the effects of undermining in the Upper-Silesian Basin. In the allotment of the CSM Mine, an area unsuitable for founding structures was defined from the centre of the worked out workings to the distance of 175 m from the <b>panel's</b> <b>edge,</b> for which the corresponding break angle is 78. 3 °. Similarly, in the allotment of the Paskov Mine, an area unsuitable for founding structures was determined to the distance of 500 m from the <b>panel's</b> <b>edge,</b> for which the corresponding break angle is 50. 2 °. This demarcation may be implemented prior to deposit mining being aware of several physical-mechanical parameters of rocks in the deposit's overburden. Having mined out a particular section of a deposit, it is recommended to verify the values of break angle using the method described herein. The study may be applied as a relatively fast and effective method to evaluate future land use for planning. Web of Science 185152250...|$|R

5000|$|The re-installation of the {{repaired}} or renewed panels {{requires that}} the panels be trial fitted and aligned, to check their fit, that their shape 'flows' and the gaps between panels are correct. Consistent gaps {{are very important to}} a quality finish. Gapping gauges are available for this. The doors, hood, and trunk should open and close properly, and there should be no interference or rubbing. Steel or aluminium door skins and wing/fender edges can generally be adjusted with a hammer and dolly, in extreme cases a pulsed MIG weld bead on a <b>panel</b> <b>edge,</b> that is shaped with a grinder and file, can be good solution. At one time it was common practice to use lead loading to achieve tight panel gaps, especially in the coachbuilding business, but also on the production line. Lead loading is highly skilled, and requires safety precautions because ingested lead or fumes are toxic. The panels have to 'look right' together. This is a process of repeated adjustment, because the adjustment of one panel often affects the apparent fit of another. If there are multiple styling lines {{on the side of a}} car, it is generally best to align doors on the most prominent one. When the panels on the car are satisfactory, they should be primed and painted a correct historical color for the vehicle if the restoration is striving for historical accuracy. An owner might want to have the car painted to look like a particular specialty vehicle such as a police car, or a delivery van painted to look like it would have in grandfather's company colors, etc. Individual painting of the panels is generally the correct approach, as this will result in all parts of the panel being painted as opposed to partially re-assembling and then painting, leaving parts of the assembly that are touching or [...] "blind" [...] unpainted. It is useful to mark in some way, if possible, where the panels fit before removal for painting, to aid re-fitting. The separate painting approach should also result in no overspray on other parts of the since they will not be on the car at that point. It is important when re-assembling painted panels to be aware that the paint is at its thinnest, and most easily damaged on corners, edges, and raised styling lines, and to take extra care with them, such as temporarily taping with masking tape. This is also important when using ultra fine wet flatting paper before polishing, (or when using an electric polishing mop) for the best mirror like finish.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the "interior noise" produced by high, subsonic turbulent flow over a thin elastic plate partitioned into "panels" by straight edges transverse to the mean flow direction. This configuration models a section of an aircraft fuselage that may be regarded as locally flat. The analytical problem can be solved in closed form to represent the acoustic radiation in terms of prescribed turbulent boundary layer pressure fluctuations. Two cases are considered: (i) the production of sound at an isolated <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> (i. e., in the approximation in which the correlation between sound and vibrations generated at neighboring edges is neglected), and (ii) the sound generated by a periodic arrangement of identical panels. The latter problem is amenable to exact analytical treatment provided the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> conditions are {{the same for all}} panels. Detailed predictions of the interior noise depend on a knowledge of the turbulent boundary layer wall pressure spectrum, and are given here in terms of an empirical spectrum proposed by Laganelli and Wolfe. It is expected that these analytical representations of the sound generated by simplified models of fluid-structure interactions can used to validate more general numerical schemes...|$|E
