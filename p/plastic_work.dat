O'Leary {{returned}} from a family fishing trip on July 24, the day of Loeser's arrest, and had read in the newspapers that the Department of Justice was looking for two doctors and another man in connection with some <b>plastic</b> <b>work</b> that was done on Dillinger. O'Leary left Chicago immediately, but returned two weeks later, learned that Loeser and others had been arrested, phoned Piquett, who assured him everything was all right, then left again.

60|$|But while art remains {{dumb and}} {{immobile}} in its passionless serenity, with {{the beauty of}} this face it is different: the grey eyes lighten into blue or deepen into violet as fancy succeeds fancy; the lips become flower- like in laughter or, tremulous as a bird's wing, mould themselves at last into the strong and bitter moulds of pain or scorn. And then motion comes, and the statue wakes into life. But the life is not the ordinary life of common days; it is life with a new value given to it, the value of art: and the charm to me of Hester Grazebrook's acting in the first scene of the play {43} last night was that mingling of classic grace with absolute reality which is the secret of all beautiful art, of the <b>plastic</b> <b>work</b> of the Greeks and of the pictures of Jean Francois Millet equally.|$|E

50|$|It is {{necessary}} to include some basics of plastic deformation to understand the link between heat produced and the <b>plastic</b> <b>work</b> done. If we carry out a compression test on a cylindrical specimen to, say, 50% of its original height, {{the stress of the}} work material will increase usually significantly with reduction. This is called ‘work hardening’. During work hardening, the micro-structure, distortion of grain structure and the generation and glide of dislocations all occur. The remainder of the <b>plastic</b> <b>work</b> done - which can be as much as 90% of the total, is dissipated as heat.|$|E

50|$|After World War II, {{the factory}} was expanded, and {{production}} of plastic was initiated in 1946. In the People's Republic of Poland, the plant, called Zakłady Tworzyw Sztucznych ERG Pustków (<b>Plastic</b> <b>Works</b> ERG Pustków), manufactured glue, polyester resin, bakelite, laminates and other plastics. Together with the plant, the settlement expanded, with new blocks of flats, hostel for workers, house of culture with a cinema, health center, swimming pool and sports facilities of sports club Chemik, established in 1954. In 1992, <b>Plastic</b> <b>Works</b> ERG Pustków were privatized. In 2009, the plant was renamed into Lerg SA.|$|R

50|$|For a work {{hardening}} material, the yield surface can expand with increasing stress. We assume Drucker's second stability postulate {{which states that}} for an infinitesimal stress cycle this <b>plastic</b> <b>work</b> is positive, i.e., The above quantity is equal to zero for purely elastic cycles.

40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} focused {{to the effects}} of plastic working on the fatigue {{strength}} of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy with notch. In general, the fatigue strength of <b>plastic</b> <b>worked</b> specimen is higher than that of non-worked one. However, the potential of hardening ability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy is very limited. Accordingly, the effect of work hardening on fatigue strength about this material is very small. In addition, the surface of the worked part becomes rougher with increasing plastic deformed value and the fatigue cracks initiate at this part. Consequently, the fatigue limit of the <b>plastic</b> <b>worked</b> specimen is lower than that of the non-plastic-worked one...|$|R

50|$|The {{fidelity}} to individualism of own {{ideas and the}} commitment to construct an increasingly cohesive <b>plastic</b> <b>work,</b> without losing the lyricism and a distinguished poetic, ensure Ferreira's position as an authentically naïve artist. The compositions with mountains, forests and rivers or inlets establish a plastic balance, in terms of formal elements and, above all, philosophical, since Ferreira's canvases don't transmit disquiet. They are a manifestation of serenity in the troubled universe of the 21st century.|$|E

50|$|Curators {{and historians}} now regard Kauffman’s {{works from the}} late 1960s in {{relation}} to the art movement known as Minimalism. Susan L. Jenkins wrote:…his works, as well as others associated with the L.A. Look, can nevertheless be thought of as possessing a relatively Minimalist sensibility. Like Judd’s ‘specific objects’, Kauffman’s vacuum-formed <b>plastic</b> <b>works</b> exist in a space between painting and sculpture.|$|R

50|$|Falguière was {{a painter}} {{as well as}} a sculptor, but {{somewhat}} inferior in merit. He displays a fine sense of colour and tone, added to the qualities of life and vigour that he instils into his <b>plastic</b> <b>work.</b> His Wrestlers (1875) and Fan and Dagger (1882; a defiant Spanish woman) were in the Luxembourg, and other pictures of importance are The Beheading of St John the Baptist (1877), The Sphinx (1883), Acis and Galatea (1885), Old Woman and Child (1886) and In the Bull Slaughter-House.|$|E

Canales presents himself as a technologist, writer and painter His pictorial and <b>plastic</b> <b>work</b> was exhibited in numerous museums and galleries such as the Museum of Glass in Monterrey, Monterrey Museum, Gallery of Mexican Art, Tamayo Museum of Contemporary Art, Chapultepec Museum, Museum José Luis Cuevas, {{all three of them}} located in Mexico City, Gallery quetzalli in Oaxaca, the Amparo Museum in Puebla (which has an extensive collection of Canales) and Museum of Contemporary Art in Monterrey, among others, he also exhibited his work in Bogota and Paris and developed a <b>plastic</b> <b>work</b> out of glass and clay. He had long stays in Brasil and the United States; in his journeys he found the diversity which has been projected in his work. He started working as an artist when he was 45 years old and without previous studies he started developing experimental methods in order to become self-educated. Five of his most beautiful stained glass windows are found in the Escuela Superior de Música y Danza de Monterrey. He is considered the artista of both, colors and rebellion.|$|E
50|$|Other {{plastics}} may {{be successfully}} engraved, but orderly experimentation on a sample piece is recommended. Bakelite {{is said to}} be easily laser-engraved; some hard engineering <b>plastics</b> <b>work</b> well. Expanded <b>plastics,</b> foams and vinyls however are generally candidates for routing rather than laser engraving. Plastics with a chlorine content (such as vinyl, PVC) produce corrosive chlorine gas when lasered, which combines with Hydrogen in the air to produce vaporized hydrochloric acid which can damage a laser engraving system. Urethane and silicone <b>plastics</b> usually don't <b>work</b> well—unless it is a formulation filled with cellulose, stone or some other stable insulator material.|$|R
