40|$|Coffee varietal {{differentiation}} {{based on}} NIR spectroscopy {{has been widely}} investigated in the last 20 years [1 - 3]. In this work, we have applied hyperspectral imaging in the NIR range (900 - 1700 nm) for the classification of Arabica and Robusta coffee varieties, considering coffee beans subjected to different processing methods, i. e., the so-called dry method (to produce natural coffee), wet method (to produce washed coffee) and a somewhat intermediate processing method, referred to as polishing method (to produce <b>polished</b> <b>coffee).</b> PCA {{has been used as}} an exploratory technique both on the image mean spectra and on the hyperspectrograms obtained from the images. The hyperspectrograms are built by compressing the useful information contained in each hyperspectral image into a signal composed by the frequency distribution curves of quantities calculated by PCA [4]. This procedure allows to compress the information conveyed by the hyperspectral images, maintaining at the same time both spatial- and spectral-related features. The PCA models obtained showed a clear clustering of Arabica and Robusta samples, whereas, considering the technological treatment, the <b>polished</b> <b>coffee</b> samples are clearly distinguishable from the others, while natural and washed coffee samples are quite superimposed. Image mean spectra and hyperspectrograms were then subjected to PLS-DA classification after preprocessing using SNV followed by meancentering or meancentering only. Concerning the discrimination of coffee samples between Arabica and Robusta categories, the same value of classification efficiency in prediction (EFFPRED = 86. 3...|$|E

At the end of the 18th century, the [...] "Poolsche Koffiehuis" [...] (<b>Polish</b> <b>Coffee</b> House) was established, which began offering guest accommodation in 1857. In 1891, the Hotel Polen was established by the [...] "Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van het Poolsche Koffiehuis" [...] (<b>Polish</b> <b>Coffee</b> House Society), after the adjacent space on the Rokin was bought, and a building was constructed there which was possibly designed by the architect Pierre Cuypers, who also designed the Amsterdam Central Station and the Rijksmuseum. Another source lists Eduard Cuypers as the architect. The hotel was five stories high and on the ground level of the building a café-restaurant was opened.|$|R

In contemporary times, tea {{is perhaps the most}} popular, drunk sometimes with a slice of lemon and sweetened with sugar. Tea came into Poland from England shortly after its appearance in Western Europe, mainly due to the Dutch merchants. However its prevalence is attributed to the Russian invaders in the 19th century – at this time samovars imported from Russia become commonplace in <b>Polish</b> homes. <b>Coffee</b> is also widely drunk in Poland since the 18th century. Frequently consumed beverages also include: buttermilk, kefir, soured milk, instant coffee, various mineral waters and juices. Following the fall of communism in 1989, numerous brands of soft drink have also become popular.|$|R
40|$|To study luminescence, reflectance, {{and color}} {{stability}} of dental composites and ceramics. Materials and Methods: IPS e. max, IPS Classic, Gradia, and Sinfony materials were tested, both unpolished (as-cast) and <b>polished</b> specimens. <b>Coffee,</b> tea, red wine, and distilled water (control) {{were used as}} staining drinks. Disk-shaped specimens were soaked in the staining drinks for up to 5 days. Color was measured by a colorimeter. Fluorescence was recorded using a spectrofluorometer, in the front-face geometry. Time-resolved fluorescence spectra were recorded using a laser nanosecond spectrofluorometer. Results: The exposure of the examined dental materials to staining drinks caused changes in color of the composites and ceramics, with the polished specimens exhibiting significantly lower color changes as compared to unpolished specimens. Composites exhibited lower color stability as compared to ceramic materials. Water also caused perceptible color changes in most materials. The materials tested demonstrated significantly different initial luminescence intensities. Upon exposure to staining drinks, luminescence became weaker by up to 40 %, dependent on the drink and the material. Time-resolved luminescence spectra exhibited some red shift of the emission band at longer times, with the lifetimes {{in the range of}} tens of nanoseconds. Conclusions: Unpolished specimens with a more developed surface have lower color stability. Specimens stored in water develop some changes in their visual appearance. The presently proposed methods are effective in evaluating the luminescence of dental materials. Luminescence needs to be tested in addition to color, as the two characteristics are uncorrelated. It is important to further improve the color and luminescence stability of dental materials...|$|R
40|$|MastersStatement of Problem: The {{potential}} for color changes in dental ceramics clinically {{can affect the}} prognosis of dental restorations. Therefore, color stability of dental ceramic systems needs to be thoroughly investigated. Purpose: This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the color changes of two dental ceramic systems after being subjected to staining solutions. Material and Methods: Two dental ceramic systems (veneered IPS e. max and conventional porcelain fused to metal) were used. Fifty four specimens 15 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness were fabricated for each material (Total 108). Disks from each material were divided into three groups (18 disks each) according to the surface finishing technique applied (autoglazing, overglazing, polishing). Color measurement of disks was performed by using a spectrophotometer. Each group was then divided into three subgroups (6 disks each). Each subgroup was immersed for 24 hours at 37 °C in one of the two staining drinks: (coffee, strawberry juice) as test groups and distilled water as a control. Color measurements were recorded after immersion. Color differences were characterized using the CIE l*a*b* color space. The total color difference (ΔE) was statistically compared between groups of the same ceramic material and between the two ceramic materials using Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, α = 0. 05) between-unit factors (two materials, three surface finishing techniques, and three staining solutions) to verify the main effects and possible interactions between factors. Where significant differences were found, one-way ANOVA and Post Hoc and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were applied to each betweenunit factor. Results: Porcelain fused to metal group showed no significant difference between staining solutions or surface finishing techniques used (p= 0. 05), except for the autoglazed group which was more affected than overglazed and <b>polished</b> ones with <b>coffee</b> stain. For IPS e. max group, no significant difference was found between staining solutions, while for the effect of surface finishing technique used, overglazed surfaces gave the lowest ΔE values and where significantly difference from autoglazed and polished ones (p= 0. 05) with both coffee and strawberry juice stains. Most of the recorded ΔE values are perceptible (> 1) and are considered clinically acceptable (< 2. 75). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the results show that minimal color change was observed when porcelain samples were subjected to staining solutions, regardless of the ceramic material used or the surface finishing technique applied. Porcelain surface polishing can be considered as efficient as autoglazing or overglazin...|$|R
