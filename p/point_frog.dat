50|$|The {{conventional}} way {{to increase}} turnout speeds is to lengthen the turnout and use a shallower frog angle. If the frog angle is so shallow that a fixed frog cannot support a train's wheels, a swingnose crossing (US: moveable <b>point</b> <b>frog)</b> will be used. Higher speeds are possible without lengthening the turnout by using uniformly curved rail and a very low entry angle; however, wider track centers may be needed.|$|E

Smaller flange and tyre dimensions were also unsuccessful, as the narrow tyres tended to detach from the wheel centres.

5000|$|... "Basket arch" [...] {{turnouts}} (Korbbogenweichen) {{were built}} in 1988 at Saalbach junction so that trains could branch at 200 km/h. They were initially the most elaborate turnouts in Germany. As {{the continuation of the}} high-speed line to Stuttgart was then under construction, the points were initially fixed in the branching position. Their length is 154 m and their weight (including the concrete sleepers) is 210 t. The point blades are 40 m-long, the moveable <b>point</b> <b>frogs</b> are 15 m long. The radius of the branching track is initially 7,000 m and reduces at the frog to 6000 m. The two sets of point blades are operated by two turnout motors with eight points of activation and closed with eight clamps. Separate test contacts are used to monitor the position of the points. The moveable <b>point</b> <b>frogs</b> are activated by a motor and secured by three clip fasteners. In the points area, two points signals are installed at the approaches and a third in the centre of the turnout. Another innovation was the use of slide chairs that require little lubrication. The two turnouts are still among the fastest in terms of operating speeds in Germany.|$|R

50|$|It {{was clear}} that the {{signalling}} technology was the responsibility of the individual Reichsbahn divisions. While the Ludwigsfelde-Dennewitz section, which was controlled by the Berlin Reichsbahn division, was equipped until 1978 with track plan interlockings (including the first interlocking of the GsIIISp68 class in Jüterbog station) and automatic block signalling, the Niedergörsdorf-Leipzig section, which was controlled by the Halle Reichsbahn division, continued to be signalled with conventional systems. As part of its resignalling with the Punktförmige Zugbeeinflussung train protection system the remaining semaphore signals were replaced by colour light signals. During the upgrade to 200 km/h, the whole line was equipped with electronic interlockings between 1992 and 1999. Since then continuous two-way working has been possible, using only Kombinationsignale(combination signals). During the remodelling of Muldenstein station, moveable <b>point</b> <b>frogs</b> were inserted into the continuous track at the northern end of the station. In addition, all level crossings were eliminated and new bridges were built. These included the northern Mulde flood bridge near Muldenstein, the Mulde bridge and the Leine bridge.

40|$|Transportation Technology Center, Inc., {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of the Association of American Railroads, has developed a double rail model for special trackwork simulation in the NUCARS® 1 vehicle/track interaction multi-body dynamic simulation program. The double rail model consists of a primary rail and a secondary rail {{on each side of}} the track. it It permits one wheel to contact two rails so that the effects of their relative movements on wheel/rail contact can be investigated. It also allows rail profile and track suspension stiffness and damping to vary on the track. This paper presents simulation results of a freight car running on a No. 20 turnout. Simulation results showed that the double rail model improved the integration stability and simulation accuracy for high frequency wheel/rail (W/R) impacts by capturing the simultaneous multiple W/R contact point situations and transitions under various discontinuous track running surface conditions. Parametric studies of W/R impacts on <b>frog</b> <b>points</b> showed the <b>frog</b> <b>point</b> geometry designs have conflicting requirements for dynamic performance for vehicles equipped with with new wheels and hollow-worn wheels; the NUCARS double rail model provides a useful tool for <b>frog</b> and switch <b>point</b> geometry optimization...|$|R

40|$|When {{rhodopsin}} is bleached by light, its prosthetic group, retinene, {{is broken}} {{away from its}} original sites of attachment on the protein, opsin.

Indeed it has been recognized that the bleaching of rhodopsin possesses some of the characteristics of a protein denaturation (Wald, 1935 - 36; Mirsky, 1936; Wald and Brown, 1951 - 52).

The main aspects studied were: richness, relative abundance, daily and seasonal activity, and substrate use. We also provide additional information on natural history of the snakes. A total of 282 snakes, distributed over 24 species, belonging to 16 genera and four families, has been found within the area of the Núcleo Picinguaba. Species sampled more frequently were Bothrops jararaca and B. jararacussu. The methods that yielded the best results were time constrained search and opportunistic encounters. Among the abiotic factors analyzed, minimum temperature, followed by the mean temperature and the rainfall are apparently the most important in determining snake abundance. Most species presented a diet concentrated on one prey category or restricted to a few kinds of food items.

40|$|The low {{temperatures}} encountered by overwintering frogs {{result in a}} large downregulation of metabolism and behaviour. However, {{little is known about}} acid–base regulation in the extreme cold, especially when frogs become exclusive skin-breathers during their winter submergence. Blood and muscle tissue acid–base parameters (pH, PCO 2, bicarbonate and lactic acid concentrations) were determined in submerged frogs exposed to a range of {{low temperatures}} (0. 2 – 7 °C). At overwintering temperatures between T 0. 2 and 4 °C plasma pH and PCO 2 were maintained constant, whereas intracellular pH regulation resulted in larger pH-temperature slopes occurring in the presumably more active heart muscle (DpH:DT 0. 0313) than in the gastrocnemius muscle (DpH:DT 0. 00799). Although blood pH was not significantly affected by submergence between 0. 2 and 4 °C (pH 8. 220 – 8. 253), it declined in the 7 °C frogs (pH 8. 086), a decrease not linked to the recruitment of anaerobiosis. Plasma PCO 2 and pH in the cold appear to be regulated at constant levels, implying that cutaneous CO 2 conductance in submerged frogs is adjusted within the range of overwintering temperatures. This is likely geared toward facilitating the uptake of oxygen under conditions of greater metabolic demand, however there remains the possibility that acid–base balance itself is maintained at a constant set <b>point</b> at the <b>frog’s</b> natural overwintering temperatures. © 1999 Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|Frog {{erythrocytes}} dedifferentiate {{in vitro}} {{when exposed to}} a suitable electromagnetic field in a chemically potentiated microenvironment. These electrochemical stimuli are able to induce a chromatin decondensation, as previously shown by measuring the chromatin accessible sites for acridine orange intercalation by means of flow cytometry (acridine orange green fluorescence). Automated absorption image cytometry of Feulgen stained smeared erythrocytes has been performed to further elucidate the above processes. After measuring or computing the area A of the nucleus, which is related to its volume, the nucleic integrated optical density D, which {{is related to the}} DNA content, the average optical density DA = D/A, which is related to chromatin conformation, and the accessible chromatin sites SA = D 2 / 3 A 1 / 3, the following results have been obtained: (a) electromagnetically exposed cells progress to stages which correspond to values of D equal to those of controls, in the potentiating solution, whereas A increases, so that DA is smaller in exposed erythrocytes than in control ones, confirming that chromatin decondensation is occurring as an early dedifferentiation step. (b) By using the electromagnetic signal that is most effective in promoting dedifferentiation, erythrocytes further progress toward more advanced stages, which correspond to larger values of both D and A than in controls, i. e. to larger DNA content. (c) In all cases, the histograms of SA are in agreement with those previously obtained by flow microfluorometry of chromatin conformation (acridine orange green fluorescence). Finally, flow microfluorometric measurements of acridine orange red fluorescence give an increase of RNA content for case (a), as compared with controls, and for case (b) as compared with (a). These results <b>point</b> out that <b>frog</b> erythrocytes can be electromagnetically reactivated, resuming both RNA and DNA syntheses after initial chromatin decondensation.
