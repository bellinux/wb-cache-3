5|$|In 1959 Rohm and Haas, {{the first}} <b>private</b> <b>investor</b> {{to build on}} the Independence Mall, first {{commissioned}} Philadelphia-based George M. Ewing Co. to design their new headquarters. Ewing's design was met with a poor response from the City Art Commission, and Rohm and Haas decided on using a leading architect and approached Pietro Belluschi. At the time the dean of architecture and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Belluschi worked with George M. Ewing Co. to redesign Ewing's original plan. The new design was completed in a few months and was approved by Rohm and Haas, the City Planning Commission, the Redevelopment Authority, and the City Art Commission. Construction began in 1963 and was completed in 1964, costing close to US$10 million. Rohm and Haas moved from their old Washington Square headquarters into the new building in 1965.|$|E

40|$|Despite their {{apparent}} interest, <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> {{are surprisingly}} disengaged from sustainable investing, an observation {{that has received}} limited scholarly attention. This theory building study draws on the theory of planned behaviour to conceptualize the decision-making process of <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> towards sustainable investing. Findings from literature provide some insights but do not yield a comprehensive answer as to why <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> refrain from sustainable investing. Interviews with wealthy <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> led us to identify a generally high interest in sustainable investing and dominant barriers that prevent actual engagement. Barriers are the perception of high volatility within sustainable investments in combination with, first, a short investment time horizon and, second, recent financial losses. Third, we find that investment advisors withhold required information from their clients. We suggest a decision-making framework that facilitates {{a better understanding of}} the engagement of <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> in sustainable investing and outline avenues for future research and implications for practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. From the {{perspective}} of quasi-public goods, this paper studies the investment of the farmland water infrastructure, and uses game theory to analyze government and <b>private</b> <b>investors.</b> It is found that {{in the presence of}} investment constraints, the government can not complete quasi-public goods investment in farmland water infrastructure independently, so the government needs to provide appropriate policies to increase the marginal benefit of <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> to attract <b>private</b> cooperation. Then this paper compares spontaneous investments and incentive investment from <b>private</b> <b>investors,</b> and concludes with policy recommendations...|$|R
