5|$|The ZNDH {{maintained}} a flying training school equipped with gliders and trainers, originally at Rajlovac airfield near Sarajevo {{and then at}} Velika Gorica and Pleso airfields in Zagreb. Its parachute and <b>paratroop</b> school was located in Koprivnica.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Netherlands {{saw some}} of the {{earliest}} mass <b>paratroop</b> drops, to occupy tactical points and assist the advance of ground troops. The German Luftwaffe used paratroopers in the capture of several airfields in the vicinity of Rotterdam and The Hague, helping to quickly overrun the nation and immobilise Dutch forces.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it could}} not be {{considered}} a large air arm in the wider context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge {{at one time or another}} some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and <b>paratroop</b> units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Redesignated 64th Troop Carrier Group in July 1942. Moved to England in August 1942 and {{received}} additional training. Became part of Twelfth Air Force. Moved to the Mediterranean theater, November-December 1942. Flew first mission on 11 November, landing <b>paratroops</b> at Maison Blanche Airport. Dropped <b>paratroops</b> to capture airfields {{during the battle}} for Tunisia. Released <b>paratroops</b> near Gela and Catania when the Allies invaded Sicily in July 1943. Dropped <b>paratroops</b> near Avellino during the invasion of Italy in September 1943 to destroy a bridge on the enemy’s supply line to Salerno. Participated in the assault on southern France in August 1944 by releasing gliders and <b>paratroops</b> in the battle zone. Supported the partisans in northern Italy early in 1945 by dropping <b>paratroops,</b> supplies, and propaganda leaflets behind enemy lines.|$|R
5000|$|A {{convergence}} of factors {{led to the}} rather quick displacement of glider-borne infantry by regular <b>paratroops.</b> Larger capacity post war cargo plane designs enabled <b>paratroops</b> to carry heavier equipment. High speed four engined transports made the former wooden glider unsafe. Improvements in parachute infantry training and tactics reduced the scattering when <b>paratroops</b> disembarked. Newer anti-aircraft technology like radar and radar directed guns made gliders readily detectable [...]|$|R
5000|$|In March 1945, {{the whole}} 114-strong Italian <b>paratroops</b> [...] "F" [...] Recce Squadron (12 squads under Captain Carlo Gay), and 112 volunteers - four platoons, each {{made up by}} three squads, led by Lieutenant Guerrino Ceiner - from the Italian Nembo <b>Paratroops</b> Regiment, were picked for Operation Herring. They {{received}} a rapid but thorough training update {{under the supervision of}} the British <b>paratroops</b> Major Ramsay, who was reportedly pleased by the paratroopers' excellent performance.|$|R
5|$|The German <b>paratroop</b> rearguard {{tried to}} delay the British advance with several ambushes and {{roadblock}}s. At a roadblock beside the town of Castellaneta, Major-General Hopkinton, the GOC, {{was hit by a}} burst of German machine gun fire while observing the 10th Parachute Battalion's attack. He died of his wounds the following day. Hopkinson was replaced as the divisional commander by Brigadier Ernest Down, previously the commander of the 2nd Parachute Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the week}} of 11–18 December, the 1st Parachute Battalion from the German 1st Parachute Division—with {{supporting}} units—had prepared strong defences within the Italian coastal town of Ortona. <b>Paratroop</b> engineers and infantry had destroyed much of Ortona itself, turning the streets into a debris-filled maze. Major streets were mined, with demolition charges throughout the main piazza, and booby traps littered the town. German forces had also buried tanks in the rubble, leaving only the turrets exposed.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Belgian pre-war émigrés {{and former}} {{soldiers}} who had escaped occupied Belgium were formed into units within the British military which later fought in the European and Mediterranean Theatres. These included an infantry formation, which later became the Brigade Piron, as well as Commando and <b>paratroop</b> units. Belgians also served in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, serving in Belgian-only units {{as well as in}} majority-British units. Significant numbers of soldiers from the Belgian Congo fought on the Allied side against the Italians in East Africa. After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, the Free Belgian forces formed the foundations of the new Belgian army.|$|E
50|$|The unit dropped <b>paratroops</b> near Ste-Mere-Eglise on D—Day 1944 {{and flew}} a {{reinforcement}} mission on 7 June, receiving a third DUC for these operations. During Operation Market Garden, they dropped <b>paratroops</b> and released gliders carrying reinforcements. Again they dropped <b>paratroops</b> near Wesel on 24 March 1945 when the Allies made the airborne assault across the Rhine. They also provided transport services in Europe while {{not engaged in}} airborne operations, hauling supplies such as ammunition, gasoline, water, and rations; along with evacuating wounded personnel to rear-zone hospitals.|$|R

5|$|Initially {{stationed}} at Maadi, the regiment {{was moved to}} Garawla in July and participated in the defence of the Baggush Box two months later. In January 1941, it moved to Helwan for training. In March, the regiment became part of W Force, the British contingent sent to Greece to defend the country from Nazi Germany. It took up positions on the Aliakmon Line before the regiment was scattered during the British retreat from the country. Most of the regiment ended up in Crete, where it faced a German <b>paratroop</b> attack in May and evacuated with {{the remainder of the}} British force.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli forces {{amounted}} {{to less than}} a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a <b>paratroop</b> battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a second one was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to be lifted by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack.|$|E
5|$|Đính {{saved the}} life of Colonel Cao Văn Viên, the {{commander}} of the Airborne Brigade, who was a Diệm loyalist. Viên's fate had been discussed during the planning phase. Đính, who played mahjong with Viên's wife, convinced Minh to spare the <b>paratroop</b> commander, saying that Viên would not oppose the coup. At the JGS meeting, Viên, who had not known of the plot, removed his insignia and resigned, and was arrested for refusing to join the coup. Viên was allowed to return to his command a month later, and later became the chief of JGS for eight years.|$|E

5|$|By 20 March, Jordan had {{identified}} {{parts of the}} Israeli 7th Armored Brigade, 60th Armored Brigade, 35th <b>Paratroop</b> Brigade, 80th Infantry Brigade, a combat engineer battalion and five artillery battalions between Allenby and Damia bridges. The Jordanians assumed the Israelis were planning an attack with a drive on Amman, and the army took up positions near the bridges, with the 60th Armored Brigade joining the 1st Infantry Division. Jordan also added most of its armored car, antitank and artillery units to the 1st Infantry Division. The total firepower was 105 Patton tanks and 88 artillery pieces. The infantry divisions were deployed near the bridges, each with a tank company. The artillery was mostly deployed on the higher Jordan Valley ridges overlooking Karameh for topological advantage.|$|E
5|$|Like the British Army, Australia did {{not have}} a {{parachute}} operations capability at the outbreak of the Second World War; however, the demonstration of the effectiveness of such forces by the Germans {{in the early stages of}} the conflict soon provided the impetus for their development. Efforts to raise an operational parachute capability in the Australian Army began in November 1942, with 40 volunteers being selected for initial training with the newly formed <b>Paratroop</b> Training Unit. The first descents were made at Tocumwal in New South Wales, with the initial parachute courses consisting of four jumps. By March 1943 enough personnel had been trained for the Army to consider forming a full parachute battalion. As a result, the 1st Parachute Battalion was raised at this time at RAAF Station Richmond near Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gang Toi (8 November 1965) {{was fought}} during the Vietnam War between Australian {{troops and the}} Viet Cong. The battle {{was one of the}} first engagements between the two forces during the war and {{occurred}} when A Company, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) struck a Viet Cong bunker system defended by Company 238 in the Gang Toi Hills, in northern Bien Hoa Province. It occurred during a major joint US-Australian operation codenamed Operation Hump, involving the US 173rd Airborne Brigade, to which 1 RAR was attached. During the latter part of the operation an Australian rifle company clashed with an entrenched company-sized Viet Cong force in well-prepared defensive positions. Meanwhile, an American <b>paratroop</b> battalion was also heavily engaged in fighting on the other side of the Song Dong Nai.|$|E

5|$|The Tupolev OKB {{began work}} in September 1946 on a {{military}} transport version of the Tupolev Tu-70 airliner and this was confirmed by the Council of Ministers on 11 March 1947 with state trials to begin in August 1948. To expedite the process, maximum use was made of components of the Tu-70. Its engines were the uprated Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version. A new, narrower fuselage was designed, which included a rear cargo hatch, a vehicle loading ramp and <b>paratroop</b> exit doors. Three gun turrets (dorsal, ventral and tail), were to be adapted from the Tu-4, although they were not fitted on the prototype. It had a crew of six (two pilots, three gunners, a radio operator, and a navigator).|$|E
5|$|Anwar Sadat was {{convinced}} that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as <b>paratroop</b> regiments. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo, including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and {{had no sense of}} loyalty or nationhood. He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment be sent to the Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{kept the}} control of the nation firmly within the hands of his {{brothers}} and their in-laws, and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Diệm; in 1960, a <b>paratroop</b> revolt was quashed after Diệm stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt, while a 1962 palace bombing by two air force pilots failed to kill him. South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Diệm's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US economic assistance, business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform. In the countryside, Catholics were de facto exempt from performing corvée labour. Discontent with Diệm and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha.|$|E

5|$|The French had {{committed}} 10,800 troops, with more reinforcements totaling nearly 16,000 men, {{to the defense}} of a monsoon-affected valley surrounded by heavily wooded hills that had not been secured. Artillery as well as ten M24 Chaffee light tanks and numerous aircraft were committed to the garrison. The garrison included French regular troops (notably elite <b>paratroop</b> units plus artillery), Foreign Legionnaires, Algerian and Moroccan tirailleurs, and locally recruited Indochinese infantry. All told, the Viet Minh had moved 50,000 regular troops into the hills surrounding the valley, totaling five divisions including the 351st Heavy Division, which was made up entirely of heavy artillery. Artillery and antiaircraft guns, which outnumbered the French artillery by about four to one, were moved into positions overlooking the valley. The French came under direct and sporadic Viet Minh artillery fire {{for the first time on}} 31 January 1954, and patrols encountered the Viet Minh in all directions. The French were surrounded.|$|E
5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{declared}} on 18 June 1948, after three estate managers were murdered {{by members of}} the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). Australian involvement began in June 1950, when in response to a British request, six Lincolns from No. 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force (FEAF). The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs, troop movement, as well as <b>paratroop</b> and leaflet drops, while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist (CT) jungle bases. The RAAF were particularly successful, and in one such mission known as Operation Termite, five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps, killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender, in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops. The Lincolns were withdrawn in 1958, and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing. Based at RAAF Base Butterworth they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|Tuyen's group {{ended up}} being led by Thảo but his initial coup plans were shelved when American CIA agent Lucien Conein {{instructed}} Thảo's superior, General Khiêm, to stop the coup {{on the grounds that}} it was premature. Thảo's motivation for involvement in the plotting is generally attributed to communist instructions for him to cause infighting within the ARVN whenever possible. He resumed plotting, intending to stage the coup on 24 October. He had recruited various infantry, marine and <b>paratroop</b> units for his scheme, totalling 3,000 men. Thảo's group did not carry out the coup after senior generals persuaded him to integrate his forces into their larger group, which was more likely to succeed. Thảo reasoned that aligning himself with a group of officers that were likely to successful would yield more influence in the resulting junta. The coup was successfully executed on 1 November 1963 under the leadership of Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn.|$|E
