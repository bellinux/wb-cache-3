40|$|Three {{dimensional}} coordinate metrology is a {{firmly established}} technique in industry. Scanning technology is now {{widely used in}} coordinate metrology and is increasingly used for the measurement of small features. This paper presents a new real shape approach to closest point inspection involutes curve of gear tooth by coordinate measuring machinery (CMM). This method aims to select the most likely contact point for each successive arc by applying geometrical criteria and a fuzzy logic estimator. This method is particularly, but not exclusively, suitable for the metrology of features with small radii as well as metrological discontinuities. It does not require obtaining the normal vector traditionally used for probe tip correction. Elapsed time is 144. 09 s.

This modern 1.5 L (1489 cc/90 in3) engine produced a respectable 50 hp (37 kW) and allowed the Oxford to reach 74 mph (119 km/h).

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{steering system}} inevitably presents internal friction that affects its response. This is why internal friction phenomena are carefully monitored either by OEMs and by vehicle manufacturers.

50|$|Harold Dew {{left the}} company in February 1914 {{and set up a}} new concern at Charlotte Place, Clapham, London {{registered}} as D.U. Manufacturing Co making a car called the D'Ultra. This was available as either a two-seat car or delivery van and used a water-cooled Chater-Lea 8 hp 50-degree V-twin engine with 4-speed friction transmission. This transmission involved a prop-shaft to which was attached a friction disc driving a countershaft and thence by a single roller chain to the cantilever sprung rear axle, which was not fitted with a differential. The front suspension was by a transverse semi-elliptic leaf spring, and the steering was of the rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>type.</b> As was common with cycle cars the braking was only on the rear wheels, and while this was initially described as being both by internal expanding and contracting types operating on two drums the reality was rather different (see below). The ladder frame is described as being 'made of re-inforced ash, and is of quite simple design with only three cross-members'. Price was £115 complete with head lamps, hood, and wind screen.|$|R

5000|$|Professional {{grass-cutting}} equipment (used {{by large}} establishments such as universities, sports stadiums and local authorities) usually {{take the form}} of much larger, dedicated, ride-on platforms or attachments that can be mounted on, or behind, a standard tractor unit (a [...] "gang-mower"). Either type may use rotating-blade or cylindrical-blade <b>type</b> <b>cutters,</b> although high-quality mowed surfaces demand the latter. Wide-area mowers (WAMs) are commercial grade mowers which have decks extended to either side, many to 12 ft. These extensions can be lowered for large area mowing or raised to decrease the mower's width and allow for easy transport on city roads or trailers. Commercial lawn-mowing companies have also enthusiastically adopted types such as the zero-turn mower (in both ride-on and stand-on versions), which allow high-speed over the grass surface, and rapid turn-around at the end of rows, as well as excellent maneuverability around obstacles.|$|R

40|$|Calculation of the {{swept volume}} of a cutter {{is the heart}} of any {{numerical}} controlled (NC) simulation system. In NC machining, a wide variety of cutter shapes are used such as flat end mills, dome end mills, ball nose end mills, angle cutters, face mills and side-and-face cutters. There are also many <b>types</b> of <b>cutter</b> paths along which the cutter is guided by the NC controller: rapid motion, linear motion and circular motion are the most commonly used cutter paths among them. Furthermore, the kinematics of the NC machines also differ leading to 2. 5 -axis, 3 -axis and a variety of 5 -axis configurations. The swept volume algorithms {{have to take into account}} all these variations of <b>cutter</b> shapes, motion <b>types</b> and machine kinematics. In this paper, first the parametric definition of a generic cutter is presented that can emulate all <b>types</b> of <b>cutter</b> shapes. Subsequently, the motions are classified into six <b>types</b> considering the <b>cutter</b> path and kinematic variations for ease of swept volume calculations.

40|$|Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is particulary {{difficult}} {{in patients with}} previous Billroth II gastrectomy, when a reverse approach to enter and cut the papilla must be used. A further method using a diathermic needle <b>type</b> <b>cutter</b> has been proposed by us in Billroth II patients in 1984.

So the phincterotomy can be performed by a diathermic needle using the catheter as a guide. In this way the risk of perforation of the posterior duodenal wall and of pancreatitis are avoided because the cutting direction {{and the depth of}} the section are well controlled maintaining the diathermic needle upward respect to the position of the catheter.

40|$|Based on rock compression-shear damage theory, the {{mechanical}} characteristics of an arc blade wedged hob were analyzed {{to study the}} rock fragmentation mechanism of hob during excavation, and rock fragmentation forecasting model of the arc blade wedged hob was improved. A spoke <b>type</b> <b>cutter</b> model {{which is similar to}} the tunnel boring machine (TBM) cutter head was designed to study the rock fragmentation efficiency in different cutter spacing by adjusting the bearing sleeve size to obtain different distances between the hobs. The results show that the hob-breaking rock force mainly comes from three directions. The vertical force along the direction of the tunnel excavation, which is associated with uniaxial compressive strength of rock mass, {{plays a key role in}} the process of rock fragmentation. Field project data shows that the prediction model’s results of rock fragmentation in this paper are closer to the measured results than the results of the traditional linear cutting model. The optimal cutter spacing exists among different cutter spacings to get higher rock fragmentation rate and lower energy consumption during rock fragmentation.

5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>type.</b> These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|R
