5|$|The ships {{carried a}} {{secondary}} battery of twelve 15cm SK C/28 L/55 quick-firing guns. The guns were mounted in four Drh L. C/34 twin turrets and four MPL/35 pedestal mounts. Both the turrets and pedestal mounts enabled barrel depression to −10°; the turrets allowed elevation to 40° while the <b>pedestals</b> limited it to 35°. These guns fired 45.3kg (99.87lb) shells {{at a rate}} of 6–8 per minute. They were expected to fire 1,100rounds before barrel wear made repair or replacement necessary. The guns in <b>pedestals</b> had a range of 22,000m (24,060yd), while those in the turrets, capable of 5more degrees of elevation, had a slightly longer range, at 23,000m (25,153yd). They were supplied with between 1,600–1,800shells, or 133–150 shells per gun.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent DIII-D <b>pedestal</b> studies provide {{improved}} {{characterization of}} <b>pedestal</b> scaling for comparison with models. A new <b>pedestal</b> model accurately predicts the maximum achieved <b>pedestal</b> width and height in TYPE-I ELMing discharges {{over a large}} range of DIII-D operational space, including ITER demonstration discharges. The model {{is a combination of}} the peeling-ballooning theory for the MHD stability limits on the <b>pedestal</b> with a simple empirical <b>pedestal</b> width scaling, which is proportional to the square root of the <b>pedestal</b> poloidal beta. Width scalings based on the ion toroidal or poloidal gyroradius are much poorer descriptions of DIII-D data. A mass scaling experiment in H and D provides additional support for a poloidal beta scaling and is not consistent with an ion poloidal gyroradius scaling. Studies of <b>pedestal</b> evolution during the inter-ELM cycle provide evidence that the <b>pedestal</b> width and height increase during <b>pedestal</b> buildup. These studies show a correlation of <b>pedestal</b> width with both the square root of the <b>pedestal</b> poloidal beta and the square root of the <b>pedestal</b> ion temperature during the <b>pedestal</b> buildup. 1...|$|R

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} potbelly monuments {{is that they}} were representations of rulership. This is suggested by the body position represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the <b>pedestals</b> on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, Antigua Guatemala, Kaminaljuyu, Santa Cruz del Quiché, Takalik Abaj, Tikal, Ujuxte, El Balsamo, Los Cerritos and La Nueva in Guatemala, Chalchuapa in El Salvador, and Copán in Honduras. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If <b>pedestals</b> are equivalent to thrones then Bilbao Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it.|$|E

5|$|In Abzû, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of a diver in a vast ocean—after waking up {{floating}} on the ocean's surface, the diver begins exploring the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins. In a few areas, the diver is also able to explore land-based environments above the water. As the game progresses, the diver unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment. The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and sit on <b>pedestals</b> within each area to observe the surrounding sea life. The diver can accelerate, and interact with marine life using sonar chimes. The diver can grab onto the bodies of larger marine animals and ride on them.

40|$|We used a dual-masking {{paradigm}} {{to study}} how contrast discrimination can {{be influenced by the}} presence of adjacent stimuli. The task of the observer was to detect a target superimposed on a <b>pedestal</b> in the presence of flankers. The flankers (i) reduce the target threshold at zero <b>pedestal</b> contrast, (ii) shift the target threshold versus <b>pedestal</b> contrast (TvC) function horizontally to the left on a log-log plot at high <b>pedestal</b> contrasts, and (iii) reduce the size of <b>pedestal</b> facilitation at low <b>pedestal</b> contrasts. The horizontal shift at high <b>pedestal</b> contrasts suggests that the flanker effect is a multiplicative factor that cannot be explained by previous models of contrast discrimination. We extend the divisive inhibition model of contrast discrimination by implementing the flanker effect as a lateral multiplicative sensitivity modulation. This extended model provides a good account of the data...|$|R

40|$|Models for the {{prediction}} of ion and electron <b>pedestal</b> temperatures {{at the edge of}} type I ELMy H-mode plasmas are developed. These models are based on theory motivated concepts for <b>pedestal</b> width and pressure gradient. The <b>pedestal</b> pressure gradient is assumed to be limited by high n ballooning mode instabilities, where both the first and second stability limits are considered. The effect of the bootstrap current, which reduces the magnetic shear in the steep pressure gradient region {{at the edge of the}} H-mode plasma, can result in access to the second stability mode of ballooning. In these <b>pedestal</b> models,. the magnetic shear and safety factor are calculated at one <b>pedestal</b> width away from separatrii.

5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and <b>pedestals.</b> Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E
5|$|After the shakyōjo {{closed at}} the end of the 8th century, the {{imperial}} family and leading aristocrats continued to sponsor sutra copying. Because of an enhanced belief in the powers of the Lotus Sutra, more Heian period copies of this sutra exist than of all other sutras combined. Starting in the early Heian period, styles became flowery and ornate with lavish decorations as sutras were not used only in recitation but for dedication and sacrifice. Devotional sutra copying was more often undertaken by the initiator than in the Nara period. New forms of decoration came in fashion by the early-11th century including placing each character in the outline of a stupa, on lotus <b>pedestals</b> or next to depictions of Boddhisattvas. Sutras were increasingly furnished with frontispieces starting in the 11th century. Calligraphy shifted from Chinese to Japanese style. Sutra copying continued into the Kamakura and subsequent periods, but only rarely to comparable artistic effect. With the import of printed Song editions in the Kamakura period, hand-copying of the complete scriptures died out and sutra copying was only practiced for its devotional aspect. Forty-six sutras or sets of sutras from the 6th century Western Wei to 14th century Nanboku-chō period have been designated National Treasures. Some of the oldest items in this list originated in China.|$|E

40|$|The <b>pedestal</b> {{effect is}} the large {{improvement}} in the detectabilty of a sinusoidal signal grating observed when the signal is added to a masking or pedestal grating of the same spatial frequency, orientation, and phase. We measured the <b>pedestal</b> effect in both broadband and notched noise - noise from which a 1. 5 -octave band centred on the signal frequency had been removed. Although the <b>pedestal</b> effect persists in broadband noise, it almost disappears in the notched noise. Furthermore, the <b>pedestal</b> effect is substantial when either high- or low-pass masking noise is used. We conclude that the <b>pedestal</b> effect {{in the absence of}} notched noise results principally from the use of information derived from channels with peak sensitivities at spatial frequencies {{different from that of the}} signal and <b>pedestal.</b> The spatial-frequency components of the notched noise above and below the spatial frequency of the signal and <b>pedestal</b> prevent the use of information about changes in contrast carried in channels tuned to spatial frequencies that are very much different from that of the signal and <b>pedestal.</b> Thus the <b>pedestal</b> or dipper effect measured without notched noise is not a characteristic of individual spatial-frequency tuned channels...|$|R

In Axially Symmetric Divertor Experiment (ASDEX) Upgrade, information about the edge density profile has been obtained in H-mode plasmas both with Thomson scattering and by combining lithium beam and interferometry measurements.

The values of the <b>pedestal</b> width (around 4 – 5 cm) measured in-between ELMs are similar to those obtained previously in similar ASDEX Upgrade discharges.
