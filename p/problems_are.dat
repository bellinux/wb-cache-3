40|$|Three {{partition}} <b>problems</b> <b>was</b> {{proposed and}} the fact that these <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> NP-complete was shown. The first problem constitutes the security basis of the identification scheme. The second was introduced in order to prove that the scheme functions correctly. The third <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> a combination of the first and second problem. The proof of the NP-completeness was given and some particular cases of the <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> discussed.

5|$|Most {{multiple}} sequence alignment methods try {{to minimize}} the number of insertions/deletions (gaps) and, as a consequence, produce compact alignments. This causes several problems if the sequences to be aligned contain non-homologous regions, if gaps are informative in a phylogeny analysis.

5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E
