5000|$|It is now {{overwhelmingly}} {{accepted that}} {{the release of}} GHG, predominantly from the anthropogenic {{burning of fossil fuels}} and the release of direct emissions from agricultural activities, is accelerating the growth of these gases in the atmosphere resulting in climate change. Over the last few decades emissions have grown at an increasing rate from 1.0% yr−1 throughout the 1990s to 3.4% yr−1 between 2000 and 2008. These increases have been driven not only by a growing global population and per-capita GDP, but also by global increases in the energy intensity of GDP (energy per unit GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (emissions per unit energy). These drivers are most apparent in developing markets (Kyoto non-Annex B countries), but what is less apparent is that a substantial fraction of the growth in these countries is to satisfy the demand of consumers in developed countries (Kyoto Annex B countries). This is exaggerated by a process known as Carbon Leakage whereby Annex B countries decrease domestic production in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> increased <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> products from non-Annex B countries where emission policies are less strict. Although this may seem the rational choice for consumers when considering local pollutants, consumers are inescapably affected by global pollutants such as GHG, irrespective of where production occurs. [...] Although emissions have slowed since 2007 {{as a result of the}} global financial crisis, the longer term trend of increased emissions is likely to resume.|$|R

The improvement in variables of marketing potentials to enhance performance and competitive advantage <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> companies with impact of moderating role of risk management are necessarily assumed as the reasons for selection of the subject of this study.

40|$|Background: Given the {{interconnectivity}} of Brazil {{with the}} rest of the world, Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have the potential to spread rapidly around the world via viremic travellers. The extent of spread depends on the travel volume and the endemicity in the exporting country. In the absence of reliable surveillance data, we did mathematical modelling to estimate the number <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> ZIKV from Brazil into Europe. Design: We applied a previously developed mathematical model on <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> dengue to estimate the number <b>of</b> ZIKV <b>importations</b> into Europe, based on the travel volume, the probability of being infected at the time of travel, the population size of Brazil, and the estimated incidence of ZIKV infections. Results: Our model estimated between 508 and 1, 778 imported infections into Europe in 2016, of which we would expect between 116 and 355 symptomatic Zika infections; with the highest number <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> being into France, Portugal and Italy. Conclusions: Our model identified high-risk countries in Europe. Such data can assist policymakers and public health professionals in estimating the extent <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> in order to prepare for the scale up of laboratory diagnostic assays and estimate the occurrence of Guillain–Barré Syndrome, potential sexual transmission, and infants with congenital ZIKV syndrome...|$|R

40|$|All {{mitochondrial}} tRNAs in kinetoplastid protozoa are {{encoded in}} the nucleus and {{imported from the}} cytosol. Incubation of two in vitro-transcribed tRNAs, tRNA(Ile) (UAU) and tRNA(Gln) (CUG), with isolated mitochondria from Leishmania tarentolae, {{in the absence of}} any added cytosolic fraction, resulted in a protease-sensitive, ATP-dependent importation, as measured by nuclease protection. Evidence that nuclease protection represents importation was obtained by the finding that Bacillus subtilis pre-tRNA(Asp) was protected from nuclease digestion and was also cleaved by an intramitochondrial RNase P-like activity to produce the mature tRNA. The presence of a membrane potential is not required for in vitro <b>importation.</b> A variety <b>of</b> small synthetic RNAs were also found to be efficiently imported in vitro. The data suggest that there is a structural requirement for <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> RNAs greater than approximately 17 nt, and that smaller RNAs are apparently nonspecifically imported. The signals for <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> folded RNAs have not been determined, but the specificity of the process was illustrated by the higher saturation level <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> the mainly mitochondria-localized tRNA(Ile) as compared to the level <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> the mainly cytosol-localized tRNA(Gln). Furthermore, exchanging the D-arm between the tRNA(Ile) and the tRNA(Gln) resulted in a reversal of the in vitro importation behavior and this could also be interpreted in terms of tertiary structure specificity...|$|R
