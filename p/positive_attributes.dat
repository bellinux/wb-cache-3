5|$|Periyar {{hailed the}} Thirukkural as a {{valuable}} scripture which contained many scientific and philosophical truths. He also praised the secular nature of the work. Periyar praised Thiruvalluvar for his description of God as a formless entity with only <b>positive</b> <b>attributes.</b> He also suggested that one who reads the Thirukkural will become a Self-respecter, absorbing knowledge in politics, society, and economics. According to him, though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate to today, it permitted such changes for modern society.|$|E

25|$|The Saccharomyces (sugar mold) yeast genus {{is favored}} for {{winemaking}} (for both grapes {{as well as}} other fruit wines in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and raffinose and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, maltose and ethanol. However, Saccharomyces cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as arabinose) which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars.|$|E

25|$|Amulets in general, {{were very}} popular. They were worn for many magical purposes. Health related amulets are {{classified}} as homeopoetic, phylactic and theophoric. Homeopoetic amulets portray an animal or part of an animal, from which the wearer hopes to gain <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> like strength or speed. Phylactic amulets protected against harmful gods and demons. The famous Eye of Horus was often used on a phylactic amulet. Theophoric amulets represented Egyptian gods; one represented the girdle of Isis and was intended to stem {{the flow of blood}} at miscarriage. They were often made of bone, hanging from a leather strap.|$|E
25|$|Saadia Gaon's {{commentary}} on the Bible bears the stamp of the Mutazilites; and its author, while not admitting any <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> of God, except these of essence, endeavors to interpret Biblical passages {{in such a way}} as to rid them of anthropomorphism. The Jewish commentator, Abraham ibn Ezra, explains the Biblical account of Creation and other Scriptural passages in a philosophical sense. Nahmanides (Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman), too, and other commentators, show the influence of the philosophical ideas current in their respective epochs. This salutary inspiration, which lasted for five consecutive centuries, yielded to that other influence alone that came from the neglected depths of Jewish and of Neoplatonic mysticism, and which took the name of Kabbalah.|$|E
25|$|The task of {{producing}} iPS cells {{continues to be}} challenging due to the six problems mentioned above. A key tradeoff to overcome is that between efficiency and genomic integration. Most methods that do not rely on the integration of transgenes are inefficient, while those that do rely on the integration of transgenes face the problems of incomplete reprogramming and tumor genesis, although {{a vast number of}} techniques and methods have been attempted. Another large set of strategies is to perform a proteomic characterization of iPS cells. Further studies and new strategies should generate optimal solutions to the five main challenges. One approach might attempt to combine the <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> of these strategies into an ultimately effective technique for reprogramming cells to iPS cells.|$|E

25|$|This {{leads to}} Maimonides’ notion that God cannot be {{described}} in any positive terms, but rather only in negative conceptions. The Jewish Encyclopedia notes his view that “As to His essence, {{the only way to}} describe it is negatively. For instance, He is not physical, nor bound by time, nor subject to change, etc. These assertions do not involve any incorrect notions or assume any deficiency, while if positive essential attributes are admitted it may be assumed that other things coexisted with Him from eternity.” Unrestrained anthropomorphism and perception of <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> is seen as a transgression as serious as idolatry, because both are fundamental errors in the metaphysics of God’s role in the universe, and that is {{the most important aspect of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|The Sri Vaishnavas {{identify}} Vishnu {{with the}} Brahman, while Krishna-centered traditions will associate Para Brahman with Krishna as Svayam Bhagavan. According to Ramanujacharya, Brahman is personal. Indeed, {{he is the}} supreme person, creator and Lord, who leads souls to salvation. Far from having no (<b>positive)</b> <b>attributes,</b> as some Advaita Vedanta followers maintain, Brahman {{is the sum of}} all “noble attributes” — i.e. omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and all-merciful, all qualities attributed to Vishnu by all Vaishavas. According to South Indian traditions he is also advitya (Sanskrit meaning without rival). To Vaishnavas, Shiva, Brahma, and the other gods of the Hindu pantheon are viewed as Brahman's agents or servants, created and commissioned by him. Some Vaishnavas consider them to be or see that they have the same status that of angels have in the western religious traditions.|$|E

Her friends are amazed and happily welcome her change, while Celestia announces that Twilight is no longer her student, but a princess who has demonstrated leadership and other <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> from her friends during her stay in Ponyville. Twilight becomes concerned that {{she has no idea}} what to do now as she is no longer Celestia's student, but Celestia promises that they will all help each other to learn what may come in the future. Twilight is officially crowned in a grand celebration in Canterlot, and she thanks her friends for being there to help her.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{having an}} {{internal}} locus of control is not always a <b>positive</b> <b>attribute</b> in the workplace. In his meta-analysis, Avtgis (1998) found that workers with an {{internal locus of}} control were less susceptible to influence, less easily persuaded, and less likely to conform than their co-workers with an external locus of control. This is likely to be an advantage in some contexts, but a disadvantage in others.|$|R
25|$|A {{player can}} select {{numerous}} Advantages and Disadvantages to differentiate the character; the system supports both mundane traits (such as above-average or below-average Wealth, Status and Reputation) {{as well as}} more exotic special abilities and weaknesses. These are categorized as physical, mental or social, and as exotic, supernatural, or mundane. Advantages benefit the character and cost points to purchase. Selecting Disadvantages returns character points and allows players to limit their characters in one way in exchange for being more powerful or gifted in other areas. Disadvantages include such <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> as honesty and truthfulness which limit the way a character is played. There are also many Perks and Quirks to choose from which give a character some personality. Perks (minor Advantages) and Quirks (minor Disadvantages) benefit or hinder the character a bit, but they mostly add role-playing flavor.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works {{as symbols of}} service, suffering, peace and humility, most notably in their inclusion in the New Testament Nativity narrative. Donkeys are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the Old Testament story of Balaam's ass, and are seen {{in a positive light}} through the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> by popular authors. William Wordsworth portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem , using the donkey as a Christian symbol. Robert Louis Stevenson in Travels with a Donkey (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in Juan Ramon Jimenez's Platero and I. The melancholy Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh (first published in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature.|$|E

500|$|Mary's erotic {{relationships}} with both Ann and Henry challenge traditional {{conceptions of the}} marriage plot. Most of Mary's <b>positive</b> <b>attributes,</b> such as her rationality, her ability to reject convention, and her sexuality would have been read in the 18th century as masculine traits. Eliza, Ann, and Henry embody the feminine weakness and passivity, often associated with sentimentality, that Wollstonecraft was criticizing. Although the novel critiques sentimentality, the text appears, in the end, to be unable to resist those very conventions as Mary begins to pine for Henry. Furthermore, the book does not present an alternative {{way of life for}} women—it offers only death. Yet, at the same time, the last few lines of the novel hold out the promise of a better world [...] "where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's).|$|E
500|$|The Broadway {{production}} received largely positive reviews that praised its melodrama and {{the acting}} of Nolan and Pidgeon. Commonweal {{described it as}} [...] "well constructed, well enough written, admirably directed... and excellently acted". The Brooklyn Daily Eagle said the action came in [...] "fits and starts", but praised the acting and the novelty {{of the use of}} a jury. New York Post critic John Mason Brown said the play had some flaws, but was an exciting, above-average melodrama. Brooks Atkinson gave it a negative review in The New York Times, calling it [...] "the usual brew of hokum". A review from Theatre Arts Monthly was also dismissive, calling the play a [...] "fashionable game" [...] that would be [...] "fun in a parlor" [...] but seemed [...] "pretty foolish" [...] on stage. Some reviews focused on Woods as the source of the play's <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> because he had had many previous theatrical successes. Time said Woods was repeating a successful formula from The Trial of Mary Dugan. Reviews that praised these elements were an embarrassment to Rand, who considered Woods' changes to be negative. Again, reviewers ignored the broader themes that Rand considered important.|$|E

Richard Meyers, a novelist who also wrote about science-fiction films, described Laserblast as [...] "basically repetitive and predictable", but included some redemptive qualities in the animation of Dave Allen and the makeup effects of Steve Neill. Science fiction literary scholar Peter Nicholls called it the worst of Charles Band's films, calling it [...] "badly scripted, badly paced rubbish," [...] describing Allen's [...] "o.k. aliens" [...] as [...] "the only plus". Likewise, film essayist Dennis Fischer said Allen's stop motion animation provides the film's [...] "sole moments of interest", and Cinefex publisher Don Shay called it the film's [...] "only viable selling points". In their DVD & Video Guide, Mick Martin and Marsha Porter called it a [...] "dreadful low-budget film with some excellent special effects by David Allen". Doug Pratt, who criticized the poor acting and dull dialogue, said the special effects and stop motion animation [...] "are well executed, but the sequences without effects are fairly dumb". The authors of The DVD-Laser Disc Newsletter called the film [...] "a dull and padded revenge-against-bullies tale", but said the stop motion animation were enjoyable enough that [...] "fans are likely to be pleased with the low-budget film's <b>positive</b> <b>attributes</b> and willing to ignore the rest".|$|E
