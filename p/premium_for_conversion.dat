40|$|Faced with an {{economic}} slowdown, the Austria federal government implemented two economic stimulus packages in 2001 and 2002 respectively. These packages provide for additional public expenditure, {{most of which}} has been advanced by one or two years, particularly with regard to public transportation infrastructure as well as the construction sector. Moreover, various tax incentives aiming to improve the supply-side conditions were introduced or expanded. A survey conducted by WIFO found a remarkably high number of enterprises indicating that they were adequately informed of the most important tax incentives (tax allowance and <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> R&D, <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> apprentices, <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> external and internal training measures, <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> incremental investment).

In a questionnaire survey, this group rated attitudes on organic and conventional farming more similar to organic farmers than other conventional farmers did. For farmers considering or planning to convert, additional organic farming payments, organic farming laws and regulations and price <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> organic products were more important sources of risk than for other conventional farmers.

I introduce a compensating differential for pregnancy risk as a novel source of this price premium through a simple model that predicts the price for unprotected sex increasing with the probability of pregnancy through decreased unprotected sex. I empirically test this using a rich panel dataset of 19, 041 sexual transactions by 192 sex workers in Busia, Kenya collected during 2005 and 2006. I use the probability of pregnancy as an instrument for unprotected sex and run two-stage least-squares (2 SLS) regression and find that a compensating differential for pregnancy risk is a source of the price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> unprotected sex. The price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> pregnancy risk is as high as USD 122 or about 16 times average price. I also test for a compensating differential for STI risk and clients' disutility for condoms, the other competing theories, and find that a compensating differential for STI risk is also a source of the price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> unprotected sex, however, I do not find evidence for clients' disutility for condoms as a source of the price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> unprotected sex. Identifying and estimating sources of the price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> unprotected sex will allow policymakers to implement interventions that will reduce both the supply and the demand for unprotected sex. ...|$|R

In addition, based on the affect-based complementarity proposition, this study also examined the effect of hotel type on WTP in the U.

However, significant variation exists among geographic locations; price <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> organic over conventional eggs in Dallas are almost {{twice as high as}} those in San Francisco. Estimates indicate that about 42 % of the typically observed <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> cage-free eggs over conventional eggs (and 36 % of the <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> organic eggs) can be attributed to egg color rather than differences in hens’ living conditions. Despite the large implicit price <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> cage-free and organic, our data reveal that most shoppers are not willing to pay such high prices for cage-free and organic attributes. animal welfare, cage-free, eggs, free-range, hedonic, organic, Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
