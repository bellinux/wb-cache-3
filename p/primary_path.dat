40|$|Abstract — In label-switched {{networks}} such as MPLS, pro-tection routing involves computing {{and setting}} up the backup paths {{at the same time}} when the <b>primary</b> <b>paths</b> are routed. It has previously been shown that two or more backup paths may share bandwidth along common links if such backup paths will never be activated simultaneously. Such sharing between the backup paths leads to reduced bandwidth reservations and, hence improved performance in terms of number of path requests that can be accommodated on the network [1], [2]. We present a novel idea that backup paths may also share bandwidth with certain <b>primary</b> <b>paths,</b> thereby further reducing the overall bandwidth reservations on the network. This results in even more path requests being accommodated on the network. Sharing with <b>primary</b> <b>paths</b> is possible with any protection routing framework. To demonstrate this sharing, we use the NPP protection routing framework as an example [1]. We provide the enhancements to the NPP framework needed to exploit sharing with the <b>primary</b> <b>paths.</b> For the enhanced NPP framework, simulation results on various networks confirm that sharing with <b>primary</b> <b>paths</b> indeed results in better network utilization. This increased performance is achieved with bounded local state information and without requiring any additional routing or signaling overhead. I...|$|R

50|$|Shared backup path {{protection}} (SBPP) for multicast connections:The SBPP technique can be {{used for}} multicast connections at the optical layer because of its resource efficiency, {{due to the fact that}} the backup paths can share wavelength channels on links while their corresponding <b>primary</b> <b>paths</b> are link disjoint.

40|$|International audienceWith the {{widespread}} use of real-time applications (VoIP, IPTV, Video conference, etc.) in Internet, protection and resource optimization become increasingly desired. Network protection aims to decrease the interruption time of communications by precomputing backup paths capable to receive and route traffics of affected <b>primary</b> <b>paths</b> upon failures. Resource optimization is achieved by improving data routing and resource sharing: data routing is often optimized by following the shortest paths whereas resource sharing is applied between the backup paths protecting against different failure risks. Two strategies of resource sharing are defined in literature: (1) backup sharing which limits the resource sharing to the backup paths and (2) global sharing which extends the resource sharing to the <b>primary</b> and backup <b>paths.</b> In this paper, we compared the effects of resource sharing strategies on the resource utilization when the <b>primary</b> <b>paths</b> correspond to the shortest ones according to a static metric. With the single failure assumption, we show formally that the resource sharing between <b>primary</b> and backup <b>paths</b> is limited to some few links which cannot form a backup path. Thus, independently of the amount of resources (for instance: bandwidth) that can be shared between the <b>primary</b> and backup <b>paths,</b> the maximum number of backup paths is bounded. In our simulation, we comfort our formal result by showing that the two strategies have close acceptance rates of backup paths and protection bandwidth utilizations...|$|R

5000|$|Routing is a {{key control}} and {{operational}} aspect of optical mesh networks. In transparent or all-optical networks, routing of connections is tightly linked to the wavelength selection and assignment process (so-called Routing and Wavelength Assignment, or [...] "RWA"). This {{is due to the}} fact that the connection remains on the same wavelength from end-to-end throughout the network (sometimes referred to as wavelength continuity constraint, in the absence of devices that can translate between wavelengths in the optical domain). In an opaque network, the routing problem is one of finding a <b>primary</b> <b>path</b> for a connection and if protection is needed, a backup path diverse from the <b>primary</b> <b>path.</b> Wavelengths are used on each link independently of each other's. Several algorithms can be used and combined to determine a <b>primary</b> <b>path</b> and a diverse backup path (with or without sharing of resource along the backup path) for a connection or service, such as: shortest path, including Dijkstra's algorithm; k-shortest path, such as Yen's algorithm; edge and node-diverse or disjoint routing, including Suurballe's algorithm; and numerous heuristics. In general, however, the problems of optimal routing for Dedicated Backup Path Protection with arbitrary Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs), and for Shared Backup Path Protection are NP-complete.|$|E

40|$|Fast {{restoration}} is {{an important}} feature of both MPLS and optical networks. The main mechanism for achieving fast restoration is by locally routing around failures using pre-setup detour paths. Signaling and routing protocol extensions to implement this local bypass ability are currently being standardized. To make use of this ability, dynamic schemes that jointly route <b>primary</b> <b>paths</b> and all link detours for links used by the <b>primary</b> <b>paths</b> have been previously proposed. These schemes also permit sharing of reserved restoration capacity for achieving efficiency. However, this joint computation places a significantly larger computational load on the network elements than that imposed by the shortest path computation variants typically used for unprotected network connection routing. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that is operationally much simpler, shares capacity used for restoration, and permits the network to route the <b>primary</b> <b>paths</b> {{in a manner that}} is oblivious to restoration needs. Restoration of all carried traffic is guaranteed by a new link capacity partitioning scheme that maximizes the working capacity of the network without requiring any knowledge of the traffic that will be imposed on the network. Being traffic independent for a priori link capacity partitioning and being oblivious to restoration needs for on-line network routing makes this scheme operationally simple and desirable in the sense of placing no additional routing load on the constrained computing resources at the network nodes. To compute the link capacity partitions, we develop a fast combinatorial algorithm that uses only iterative shortest path computations, and is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS), i. e., it achieves a (1 + #) -factor approximation for any #> 0 and ru [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}}   This work {{focuses on}} the problem of managing an energy aware resilient network. A network and a set of available links are given. A set of demands have to be routed and must be protected against single edge failure. Share protection mechanism is considered: for each demand, a primary and a edge-disjoint backup path are provided. Backup paths are used only when a failure occurs. As failures are quickly restored, edges used only by backup paths are active for short periods. Energy consumption is due only to edges used by <b>primary</b> <b>paths,</b> but both <b>primary</b> and backup <b>path</b> contribute to link capacity consumption. The problems asks to route all the demands with the aim of minimizing the overall link device energy consumption.
