The steel is magnetised {{by a large}} electric current that flows in the coils of wire wrapped around the poles.

Electromagnets of similar conceptual design (called quadrupole magnets) are commonly used to focus beams of charged particles in particle accelerators and beam transport lines, a method known as strong focusing.

The octant shower detectors were outside the time-of-flight detectors {{in each of}} the octants. Each octant detector had 44 layers of proportional tubes, alternating parallel and perpendicular to the beampipe. Wires were ganged together {{to reduce the number of}} readout channels for a total of 774 gangs. The octant end shower detectors were sixteen layer devices placed at either end of the dE/dx chambers. The layers followed an azimuthal, positive stereo, azimuthal, negative stereo pattern. The stereo wires were parallel to the slanted sides of the detector. The layers were ganged in a similar fashion as the octant shower detectors. The pole tip shower detector was placed between the ends of the drift chamber and the <b>pole</b> <b>tips</b> of the magnet flux return. The pole tip shower detector had 21 layers, with seven groups of vertical, +120°, -120° layers. The shower detector on each side was built in two halves to allow access to the beampipe.|$|E

The surfaces of different materials are set at different heights below the air-bearing surface of slider. This paper presented a {{plasma dry etching}} process for <b>Pole</b> <b>Tip</b> Recession (PTR) based on an ion beam etching system. Ar and O 2 mixed plasma at small incident angles have a high removal rate to the nonmagnetic material. It was utilised to etch the reference surface until it reaches the MT value. Low-energy Ar plasma at a small incident angle removes materials with selective ratios of 1  :  1. 6  :  2. 5  :  2. 9 (AlTiC/Al 2 O 3 /NiCoFe/NiFe). It was selected to form the PTR. High-energy Ar plasma at a large incident angle exhibits almost same removal rates for all materials. It was adopted to make overall removal while keeping the recessed profile.

40|$|Analysis of the {{magnetic}} data obtained during {{the magnetic}} field mapping of Kolkata superconducting cyclotron showed imperfections in the main magnetic field. Since the main magnet of the superconducting cyclotron is three fold rotationally symmetric, any deviation from this symmetry creates imperfections in the magnetic field. Generally, 1 st and 2 nd harmonic components are inherently present in the field due to assembling errors in iron/coil. A major portion of these imperfections is attributed to the misplacement/tilting of the iron <b>pole</b> <b>tip</b> with respect to coil. The error in positioning of main superconducting coil with respect to surrounding iron produces another imperfection. <b>Pole</b> <b>tip</b> deformation due to rise of temperature produces field imperfection.

40|$|<b>Pole</b> <b>tip</b> {{recession}} in magnetic recording thin film heads contributes to spacing loss, {{which leads to}} a degradation in the readback signal. As manufacturers improve the performance of magnetic recording devices, this recession will become more sig-nificant to the performance of future products. <b>Pole</b> <b>tip</b> recession can be measured by several techniques, including stylus profilometry, optical profilometry, andatomic force microscopy. Stylus profilometry is generally not used since it has several problems in this application. In this study, good correlation was found between optical prof ilometry and atomic force microscopy measurements, provided that the optical measurements were corrected for phase shift. This is necessary because of the dissimilar materials in the thin film head. There are several methods for making this correction. One method is an analytical correction using known optical constants for the head materials. These constants should be well characterized as the meas-urements are quite sensitive to them. Overcoating the head with a thin film provides two other methods for getting around the material differences problem. However, these methods require an optimum film thickness. The film must be thick enough so that it behaves as a substrate, but not so thick that it fails to replicate the head. PACS numbers: 85. 70. Kh, 06. 90. + v, 42. 72. +h, 78. 65. Pi...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2010. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Randall H. Victora. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 134 pages. Ill. (some col.) A multi-scale fast Fourier transform (FFT) based micromagnetic {{model has been}} developed to simulate erase after write (EAW) for a 2. 4 T FeCo solid pole writer. The simulated remnant state of the writer shows vortices at the <b>pole</b> <b>tip,</b> break and paddle regions that qualitatively matches an experimental MFM image. Dynamic responses show that EAW worsens with a longer breakpoint. Sensitivity of EAW with breakpoint is in good agreement with the experimental data. Modeling suggests that cross track anisotropy reduces EAW risks; however, perpendicular anisotropy {{is found to be}} detrimental to EAW. Simulations show that EAW risks are substantially reduced when a uni-polar demagnetization pulse of polarity opposite to that of the last write is applied to the writer. Using the model, the response functions of uni-polar demagnetization pulses have been modeled for reducing EAW events. Simulations show that the value of the initial field created by the demagnetization current is the most effective parameter in reducing <b>pole</b> <b>tip</b> remanence. To avoid driving the head in the opposite direction with the demagnetization pulse, it is important to ramp down quickly with a time constant of about 500 psec. In-plane exchange is found to affect EAW quite significantly; just 25 % lower exchange reduces EAW fields by 30 %. Modeling shows that introduction of antiferromagnetic coupling in the write pole reduces EAW significantly. Modeling also suggests that non-magnetic holes with in plane dimensions of 35 nm {{in the middle of the}} breakpoint region reduce EAW by ~ 35 %. The underlying mechanism to reduce EAW is to make vortex formation in the <b>pole</b> <b>tip</b> energetically inexpensive. Micromagnetics is used to design an unshielded perpendicular writer for an areal density of 1 Tb/in 2. The head consists of a probe-type tip protruding from a collar. The tip has saturation magnetization (M S) of 24 kG while the collar has lower M S. The magnitude and orientation of anisotropy field (H k) in the tip is varied to obtain the best recording performance. The combination of high anisotropy write tip with low M S collar is shown to produce effective write fields in excess of 19 kOe and less than 20 % track erasure for 10 7 passes. Introduction of in-plane anisotropy within the <b>pole</b> <b>tip</b> reduces head remanence sufficiently that on-track erasure exceeds a benchmark of 10 8 passes. The damping constant in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is varied to improve the frequency response. With damping constant equal to 1. 0, simulations show that the head is capable of switching in approximately 0. 15 ns...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} record spacing on track edge noise are studied for CoCrTa and CoCrPt/CoCrTa media. Variations in record {{spacings}} (seperation from magnetic media to write head <b>pole</b> <b>tips)</b> are accurately achieved {{by using an}} identical set of disks {{for each type of}} media, with different overcoat thicknesses. Track edge noise is characterized using track profiles of the media noise. An integrated spectral technique is used to measure media noise, and the effects of the different playback spacings (seperation from magnetic media to read head <b>pole</b> <b>tips</b> or read element) are removed by dividing the spectral playback loss factor from the media noise spectra. On track transition noise is studied as a function of linear density at three different record spacings for each media type. Transition noise is found to increase with linear record density as expected, as well as with record spacing for a given linear density. Track profiles were performed at three linear record densities for each record spacing to observe the density dependence of similar effects on track edge noise. For both media, on-track noise and track edge noise are found to decrease with reduced record spacing, and the amount of decrease are found to be record density dependent. Acknowledgment...|$|E
