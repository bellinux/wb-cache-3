Simultaneous switching capacitance is a major consideration in coarse-grain power gating implementation. In order to limit simultaneous switching, gate control buffers can be daisy chained, and special counters can be used to selectively turn on blocks of switches.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With the {{technology}} {{moving into the}} deep sub- 100 -nm region, the increase of leakage power consumption necessitates more aggressive power reduction techniques. <b>Power</b> <b>gating</b> is a promising technique. Our research emphasizes that with the latest and future technologies, <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> operates frequently in its transition mode, especially for aggressive leakage reduction. The dynamic characteristics of <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> during its mode transition is critical for making design decision. Hence we derive a fast, accurate, and temperature-aware model to characterize the dynamic behavior of <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> during mode transition. The applications of this model include the estimation of several key design parameters for <b>power</b> <b>gating,</b> such as dynamic virtual ground voltage, dynamic leakage variation and energy break-even time. It provides an efficient estimation engine for <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> design optimization. The accuracy of the model has been verified by extensive HSPICE experiments.

40|$|Leakage {{power is}} a growing concern in modern {{technology}} nodes. In some current and emerging applications, speed performance is uncritical but many of these applications rely on untethered power making energy a primary constraint. Leakage power minimisation is therefore key to maximising energy efficiency for these applications. This thesis proposes two new leakage power minimisation techniques to improve the energy efficiency of embedded processors. The first technique, called sub-clock power gating,can be used to reduce leakage power during the active mode. The technique capitalises on the observation that there can be large combinational idle time within the clock period in low performance applications and therefore <b>power</b> <b>gates</b> it. Sub-clock <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> is the first study into the application of <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> within the clock period, and simulation results on post layout netlists using a 90 nm technology library show 3. 5 x, 2 x and 1. 3 x improvement in energy efficiency for three test cases: 16 -bit multiplier, ARM Cortex-M 0 and Event Processor at a given performance point. To reduce the energy cost associated with moving between the sleep and active mode of operation, a second technique called symmetric virtual rail clamping is proposed. Rather than shutting down completely during sleep mode, the proposed technique uses a pair of NMOS and PMOS transistors at the head and foot of the <b>power</b> <b>gated</b> logic to lower the supply voltage by 2 Vth. This reduces the energy needed to recharge the supply rails and eliminates signal glitching energy cost during wake-up. Experimental results from a 65 nm test chip shows application of symmetric virtual rail clamping in sub-clock <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> improves energy efficiency, extending its applicable clock frequency range by 400 x. The physical layout of <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> requires dedicated techniques and this thesis proposes dRail, a new physical layout technique for <b>power</b> <b>gating.</b> Unlike the traditional voltage area approach, dRail allows both <b>power</b> <b>gated</b> and non-power gated cells to be placed together in the physical layout to reduce area and routing overheads. Results from a post layout netlist of an ARM Cortex-M 0 with sub-clock <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> shows standard cell area and signal routing are improved by 3 % and 19 % respectively.
