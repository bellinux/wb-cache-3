Methods: A core biopsy of the proximal femoral physis was performed in nine <b>patients</b> with slipped <b>capital</b> femoral epiphysis, and the specimens were compared with five specimens from the normal distal femoral and proximal tibial and fibular physes of age-matched patients treated surgically for a limb-length inequality.

Results: Downregulation of both type-II collagen and aggrecanwas found in the growth plates of the subjects with slipped capital femoral epiphysis when compared with the levels in the age-matched controls.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the role of {{progressive}} tax rules on the steady state and the stability properties in a Ramsey economy with heterogeneous households and borrowing constraints. Since labor supply is elastic, considering different tax rates on capital and labor incomes matters. Showing the existence of steady states where only the most <b>patient</b> households hold <b>capital,</b> we argue that working could not be optimal for them. Dynamics are addressed through a local analysis. In contrast to many contributions, progressive tax rules can promote expectation-driven fluctuations and endogenous cycles. Hence, progressivity can be an inopportune device to stabilize macroeconomic volatility.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to share cost analysis methodology and to obtain cost estimates for posterior restorations in public sector dental clinics. Two urban and 2 rural dental clinics in Selangor state were selected. Only cases of 1 posterior restoration per visit by dental officers were included over 6 months. One capsulated amalgam type, 1 capsulated tooth-colored, and 1 non-capsulated tooth-colored material were selected. A clinical pathway form was formulated to col-lect data per <b>patient.</b> Annual <b>capital</b> and recurrent expenditures were collected per clinic. The mean cost of an amalgam restoration was RM 30. 96 (sdRM 7. 86); and tooth-colored restorations ranged from RM 33. 00 (sdRM 8. 43) to RM 41. 10 (sdRM 10. 61). Wherein 1 USD = RM 2. 8. Restoration costs were 35 % to 55 % higher in clinics in rural areas than in urban areas. The find-ings demonstrate economy of scale for clinic operation and restoration costs with higher patient load. Costs per restoration were higher in rural than in urban dental clinics.

We obtained data from the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) regarding 5, 013 <b>patients</b> from <b>capital</b> cities who started ESRD treatment between 1 April 1993 and 31 December 1998.

We calculated standardised incidence ratios with 95 % confidence intervals for each region. The standardised incidence ratios were examined in relation to the SEIFA Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD), derived from the 1996 Census. Low IRSD values indicate more disadvantaged areas. Results: There is significant {{variation in the}} standardised incidence of ESRD within capital cities.

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{indirect costs}} through human capital approach and intangible costs through willingness-to-pay (WTP), and identify factors potentially affecting these costs in multiethnic Asian patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Data were collected through face-to-face interviews among knee OA <b>patients.</b> Human <b>capital</b> approach {{was used to}} estimate indirect costs by multiplying: 1) days of absence from work because of OA, with average earnings per capita per day for working patients; or 2) productivity loss with the market price of housekeeping for retirees/homemakers. A closed-ended iterative bidding contingent valuation method was used to elicit willingness-to-pay for a hypothetical cure of OA {{as a proxy for}} intangible costs. Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis H-tests were performed in univariate analyzes, and linear regression in multivariate analyses. Results: Indirect costs per year and intangible costs were estimated at US$ 1. 008 and US$ 1200, accounting for 2. 8 % and 3. 3 % of annual household income, respectively. The indirect costs were significantly higher for male or working patients, while intangible costs were higher for Chinese, working patients, with higher income, or worse global well-being. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that eliciting indirect costs through human capital approach and intangible costs through WTP are acceptable and feasible in Asian patients with knee OA.
