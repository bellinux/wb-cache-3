The paper reviews literature of the subject and applicable regulations and uses the methods of deduction and induction, analysis of the contents of non-financial reports and the author's own observations. The initial part is a review of relevant literature concerning causes of nonfinancial reporting. The second section describes the unique nature of insurance companies as public trust organisations and its effects on management systems of insurers and qualitative characteristics of nonfinancial reports.

This recording aims to examine the potential of these school headmasters to exercise their role and work within the highly bureaucratic and hierarchical Greek educational system. These activities include (a) establishment and realization of a common vision and mission of the school unit as well as its culture identification and formation, (b) teaching and tutoring of students, (c) management and development of the educational personnel, (d) conducting of administrative affairs and management of resources, and (e) good relations with <b>parents,</b> <b>entities</b> of external environment of the school unit, and the local community. The study found that the headmasters consider activities concerning their bureaucratic/conductive role as well as their leading behaviour as “very important” at very high percentages (over 70. 0 %). However, tasks involving them in administrative issues are, according to them, “less” up to “least important” so that their role is effectively fulfilled.

50|$|Entity (noun)An entity {{is defined}} as {{something}} that is uniquely identifiable and can exist by itself. There are only 12 <b>parent</b> <b>entities</b> in LML: Action, Artifact, Asset, Characteristic, Connection, Cost, Decision, Input/Output, Location, Risk, Statement and Time. Several child entities have been defined to capture information that stakeholders need. The child entities have the attributes and relationships of the parents plus additional attributes and relationships that make them unique. Child entities include: Conduit (child of Connection), Logical (child of Connection), Measure (child of Characteristic), Orbital (child of Location), Physical (child of Location), Requirement (child of Statement), Resource (child of Asset), and Virtual (child of Location). Every entity has a name or number or description attribute or combination of the three to identify it uniquely. The name is a word or small collection of words providing an overview {{of information about the}} entity. The number provides a numerical way to identify the entity. The description provides more detail about that entity. Attribute (adjective)The attributes work in the same way an adjective. Entities (the nouns) can have names, numbers, and description attributes. The inherent characteristic or quality of an entity is an attribute. Every attribute has a name that identifies it uniquely within an entity. Attributes names are unique within an entity, but may be used in other entities.

It is used for official purposes, by individual taxpayers and by the overwhelming majority of business enterprises. Business enterprises may opt to use a financial year that ends at the end of a week (e.g., 52 or 53 weeks in length, and therefore is not exactly one calendar year in length), or opt for its financial year to end on a date that matches the reporting cycle of its foreign <b>parent.</b> All <b>entities</b> within the one group must use the same financial year.|$|R

The paper commences with a review of the key concepts from the MNE and conglomerates literature with respect to core MNE strategies. The paper then discusses what the "governance roles" are that must be performed in MNE subsidiaries. We propose four governance frameworks for subsidiary corporations. These frameworks are: (1) Direct Control; (2) Dual Reporting; (3) Advisory Board; (4) Local Board. We consider {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each model in relation to international strategy theory. We conclude with recommendations for the conditions under which the various models may be appropriate and practical guidelines for the utilisation of corporate governance theory to improve MNE performance...|$|R

The sanctions also increase if the ultimate <b>parent</b> company of <b>entities</b> involved in the FCPA violation is foreign and if foreign regulators {{are involved in the}} action. At the country level we report evidence that the SEC and DOJ impose greater aggregate sanctions for violations in countries with a lower GNI per capita and weaker local anti-bribery institutions. The SEC and DOJ also impose disproportionately greater aggregate sanctions for violations where the home country of the ultimate parent company of FCPA defendants has a greater GNI per capita, stronger anti-bribery institutions, and a cooperation agreement with U.
