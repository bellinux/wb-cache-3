2500|$|Despite the {{closeness}} in the ordering {{of the contents}} of the first and second English editions, there are numerous differences between them, and even more between them and the Paris edition that appeared in between. The Paris edition, the only one to credit Hazlitt as the author, omitted some material and added some. The essays (in order) were as follows: [...] "Lord Byron", [...] "Sir Walter Scott", [...] "Mr. Coleridge", [...] "Mr. Southey", [...] "Mr. Wordsworth", [...] "Mr. Campbell and Mr. Crabbe" [...] (the portion on Campbell was here claimed by Hazlitt to be [...] "by a friend", though he wrote it himself), [...] "Jeremy Bentham", [...] "William Godwin", [...] "Rev.

2500|$|During transmission, single byte errors can be {{replaced}} by a white space which can appear {{at the beginning of the}} program.

Uncorrectable byte errors within the teletext <b>page</b> <b>header</b> will cause whole captions to be dropped. EIA-608, due to using only two characters per video frame, sends these captions ahead of time storing them in a second buffer awaiting a command to display them; Teletext sends these in real-time.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Page</b> <b>headers</b> and <b>page</b> footers, the {{contents}} of which are usually uniform across content pages and thus automatically duplicated by layout software.

50|$|In typography, a <b>page</b> <b>header</b> (or simply header) is {{text that}} is {{separated}} from {{the main body of}} text and appears {{at the top of a}} printed page.
