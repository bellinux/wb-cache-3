Heat transfer in a <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> reactor was also investigated for hot air streaming upward through the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> to heat the particles, which dependent on position and size experience different heat transfer rates.

40|$|AbstractThe {{majority}} {{of articles on}} Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) so far have focussed {{on the use of}} indirect-contact heat exchangers and a thermal fluid in which to store the compression heat. While <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> have been suggested, a detailed analysis of A-CAES with <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> is lacking in the available literature. This paper presents such an analysis. We develop a numerical model of an A-CAES system with <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> and validate it against analytical solutions. Our results suggest that an efficiency in excess of 70 % should be achievable, which is higher than many of the previous estimates for A-CAES systems using indirect-contact heat exchangers. We carry out an exergy analysis for a single charge–storage–discharge cycle to see where the main losses are likely to transpire and we find that the main losses occur in the compressors and expanders (accounting for nearly 20 % of the work input) rather than in the <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> The system is then simulated for continuous cycling and it is found that the build-up of leftover heat from previous cycles in the <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> results in higher steady state temperature profiles of the <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> This leads to a small reduction (< 0. 5 %) in efficiency for continuous operation...|$|R

The applications of <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> are in chemical reactors, distillation, catalysis, thermal energy storage, food processing, {{solar power plants}} and several other areas. They act as enhancement devices for different transport processes. In the present study, the behavior of wall heat transfer coefficient with randomized packing of uniformly sized spheres is investigated. In the present work, the local wall heat transfer coefficient is estimated from local wall temperature data obtained using infrared (IR) thermography for the <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> with randomized <b>packing</b> of uniformly sized spheres under steady state conditions with water as the working fluid. Hie experiments are conducted for bed to particle diameter ratios of 6, 3 and 2 using random packing of mono dispersed glass spheres. The two-layer model theory for heat transfer in <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> is examined in terms of contribution or core zone and wall zone in <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> The comparison of heat transfer enhancement aspects with different insert configurations is done and <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> are found effective.

25|$|Furthermore, {{the dynamic}} column method can be used. The {{particles}} are contacted with a solvent {{until they are}} completely soaked. This can be done prior or after packing into the column. The <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> is then rinsed with the liquid extractant until inlet and outlet concentrations are the same. This approach is particularly interesting when particles are already packed in a column and shall be reused for a SIR application.|$|E
25|$|Only {{recently}} {{also other}} extraction applications have been investigated, e.g. the large scale recovery of apolar organics on offshore oil platforms using the so-called Macro-Porous Polymer Extraction (MPPE) Technology.

Additional investigations, mostly done in an academic environment, include polar organics like amino-alcohols, organic acids, amino acids, flavonoids, and aldehydes on a bench-scale or pilot-scale.

Randomly <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> are widely used {{in a variety of}} industries, because of their low cost and ease of use compared with other packing methods. However, the pressure drops in such <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> are usually much higher than those in other packings, and the overall heat transfer performances may be greatly lowered. In order to reduce the pressure drops and improve the overall heat transfer performances of <b>packed</b> <b>beds,</b> structured packings are considered to be promising choices. In this paper, some of our recent contributions on the hydrodynamic and heat transfer characteristics in some novel structured <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> are introduced, where the effects of packing form and particle shape are carefully investigated, and the numerical and experimental results are also compared in detail. Firstly, it is found that, with proper selection of packing form and particle shape, the pressure drops in the structured <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> can be greatly reduced and the overall heat transfer performances will be improved. The traditional correlations of flow and heat transfer extracted from random packings are found to overpredict the pressure drops and Nusselt numbers for all the structured packings, and some modified correlations are obtained. Secondly, it is revealed that, both the effects of packing form and particle shape are significant on the flow and heat transfer in structured <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> With the same particle shape (sphere), the overall heat transfer efficiency of SC packing is the highest. With the same packing form, such as FCC or SC packings, the overall heat transfer performance of ellipsoidal particle model is better.
