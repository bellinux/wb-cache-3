40|$|Background/Aims: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} whether the advanced techniques have influenced the minor <b>papilla</b> approach. Methods: We studied the success rate of guide wire insertion by using ordinary techniques and advanced techniques (rendezvous meth-od and precut method) in 30 patients via the minor <b>papilla.</b> We compared {{the selection of the}} access routes between before (52 patients) and after (28 patients) the introduction of the Soehendra stent retriever. Results: In 19 out of 30 patients (63 %), guide wire insertion via the minor <b>papilla</b> could be achieved by using ordinary techniques. In total, the guide wire could be inserted in 27 patients (90 %) by using the advanced techniques. Before introduction of the Soehendra stent retriever, the major <b>papilla</b> approach was chosen in 38 cases (73 %), and the minor <b>papilla</b> approach in 14 cases (27 %). After intro-duction of the Soehendra stent retriever, the major <b>papilla</b> approach was used in 26 cases (93 %) and the minor <b>papilla</b> in 2 cases (7 %).

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare interproximal fill and <b>papilla</b> height between different embrasures. Material and methods: One hundred and fifty non-smoking consecutive patients (mean age 54, range 32 – 73; 63 males and 87 females) without periodontal disease were selected in a multidisciplinary practice during regular supportive care. All had been treated for multiple tooth loss in the anterior maxilla at least one year earlier by means of a fixed restoration on teeth (n = 50) or implants (n = 100) using straightforward procedures (without hard and/or soft tissue augmentation). Embrasure fill was assessed by means of Jemt’s <b>papilla</b> index and <b>papilla</b> height was registered following local anesthesia by means of bone sounding by one clinician. Results: Tooth-pontic and tooth-implant embrasures demonstrated comparable interproximal fill and <b>papilla</b> height (≥ 58 % Jemt’s score 3; mean <b>papilla</b> height ≥ 4. 1 mm). Between missing teeth, embrasure fill and <b>papilla</b> height were lower regardless of the embrasure type. The implant-implant and implant-pontic embrasure demonstrated comparable outcome (≤ 42 % Jemt’s score 3; mean <b>papilla</b> height ≤ 3. 3 mm; p ≥ 0. 416), which was significantly poorer when compared to the pontic-pontic embrasure (82 % Jemt’s score 3; mean <b>papilla</b> height 3. 7 mm; p ≤ 0. 019). Overall, <b>papilla</b> index and <b>papilla</b> height demonstrated a weak correlation (Spearman’s correlation coefficient: 0. 198; p = 0. 002). Conclusions: The reestablishment of a <b>papilla</b> is difficult when there is no tooth involved. In that scenario a short <b>papilla</b> should be expected and implant-borne restorations demonstrate the poorest outcome. Moreover, an implant with a pontic may not perform better than adjacent implants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The anuran ear is {{frequently}} used for studying fundamental properties of vertebrate auditory systems. This {{is due to}} its unique anatomical features, most prominently {{the lack of a}} basilar membrane and the presence of two dedicated acoustic end organs, the basilar <b>papilla</b> and the amphibian <b>papilla.</b> Our current anatomical and functional knowledge implies that three distinct regions can be identified within these two organs. The basilar <b>papilla</b> functions as a single auditory filter. The low-frequency portion of the amphibian <b>papilla</b> is an electrically tuned, tonotopically organized auditory end organ. The high-frequency portion of the amphibian <b>papilla</b> is mechanically tuned and tonotopically organized, and it emits spontaneous otoacoustic emissions. This high-frequency portion of the amphibian <b>papilla</b> shows a remarkable, functional resemblance to the mammalian cochlea...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purposes}} of this study were to quantify some clinical parameters that are useful as esthetic guidelines when the gingival contour is modified and to compare the left and right sides of the six maxillary anterior teeth. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and forty interdental <b>papilla</b> sites in 20 healthy patients were evaluated. Interdental <b>papilla</b> heights of maxillary anterior teeth were measured from the gingival zenith, along with clinical crown lengths. Percentages of <b>papilla</b> height to crown length were computed and defined as <b>papilla</b> proportion, mesial <b>papilla</b> proportion (MPP) and distal <b>papilla</b> proportion (DPP). Results: Mean interdental <b>papilla</b> heights of maxillary teeth was 3. 83 mm mesially and 3. 8 mm distally. Mean MPP was 43. 69 % (n = 120) and DPP was 44. 57 % (n = 120).

40|$|Androgen {{exposure}} {{stimulates the}} growth of beard hair follicles. The follicle dermal <b>papilla</b> {{appears to be the}} site of androgen action; however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this process are not well understood. In an attempt to identify genes that contribute to the androgen-responsive phenotype, we compared gene expression patterns in unstimulated and androgen-treated cultured human dermal <b>papilla</b> cells isolated from beard (androgen-sensitive) and occipital scalp (androgen-insensitive) hair follicles. Through this analysis, we identified three genes that are expressed at significantly higher levels in beard dermal <b>papilla</b> cells. One of these genes, sfrp- 2 has been identified as a dermal <b>papilla</b> signature gene in mouse pelage follicles. Two of these genes, mn 1 and atp 1 β 1, have not been studied in the hair follicle. A fourth, fibulin- 1 d, was slightly upregulated in beard dermal <b>papilla</b> cells. The differences in the expression of these genes in cultured beard and scalp dermal <b>papilla</b> cells reflected similar differences in microdissected dermal <b>papilla</b> isolated from intact beard and scalp follicles. Our findings introduce potentially novel signaling pathways in dermal <b>papilla</b> cells. In addition, this study supports that cultured dermal <b>papilla</b> cells provide a cell-based model system that is reflective of the biology of in vivo hair follicle cells...|$|R

40|$|Retention of the {{capacity}} to induce the growth of hair by cultured adult rat vibrissa dermal <b>papilla</b> cells has been investigated. Small pellets of serially cultured <b>papilla</b> cells were implanted into the bases of the exposed follicular epidermis of amputated adult rat vibrissa follicles. Amputated follicles that received no cell implants or implants of cultured dorsal skin fibroblasts were used as controls. Over 50 % of follicles implanted with cultured <b>papilla</b> cells in the passage range 1 - 3 grew hairs. In contrast none of the follicles that received late passage cells (range 6 - 15) produced hairs; and spontaneous regeneration of hair occurred in only 3 % of the control follicles. These results demonstrate that cultured <b>papilla</b> cells of early passage numbers retain their ability to induce hair growth. Histological examination confirmed that the implanted <b>papilla</b> cells interacted with follicular epidermis to organize the development of new, hair-producing bulbs, each containing a discrete dermal <b>papilla.</b> An important observation was that aggregative behaviour leading to <b>papilla</b> formation was only manifested by early passage <b>papilla</b> cell implants.
