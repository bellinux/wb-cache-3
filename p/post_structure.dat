2500|$|Greatham Church is a tiny, primitive, unrestored {{building}} {{dating from}} the [...] "Saxo-Norman overlap" [...] period when Anglo-Saxon architecture was giving way to the Norman style. [...] The writer Arthur Mee was once told not to mistake the church for a haystack: set {{in the middle of}} fields and on its own apart from the manor house, it has an extremely basic and modest feel—amplified by its lack of electricity and piped water. [...] The walls, of unequal length and thickness, are principally of ironstone with some chalk, flint, Roman-era masonry and rubble, local (Pulborough) sandstone and Horsham Stone. [...] Ian Nairn described them as having [...] "a wonderful texture". [...] At one corner, the Pulborough sandstone quoins have a set of roughly carved crosses. [...] These are believed to be consecration crosses, which were blessed when the church was completed and consecrated. [...] The building has a single room with no division between the nave and chancel. [...] There is also a slate-hung bell-turret with a small spire.

30|$|Surfaces with {{controllable}} micro {{structures are}} significant in fundamental development of superhydrophobicity. However, preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces with array structures on metal substrates is not effective using existing methods. A new method {{was presented to}} fabricate super-hydrophobic post arrays on aluminum (Al) substrates using mask electrochemical machining and fluoridation. Electrochemical etching was first applied on Al plates with pre-prepared photoresist arrays to make the <b>post</b> array <b>structures.</b> Surface modification was subsequently applied to reduce the surface energy, followed by interaction with water to realize superhydrophobicity. Simulation and experimental verification were conducted to investigate how machining parameters affect the array structures. Analysis of the water contact angle was implemented to explore the relationship between wettability and micro structures. The results indicate that superhydrophobic surfaces with controllable <b>post</b> <b>structures</b> can be fabricated through this proposed method, producing surfaces with high water static contact angles.|$|R

Yuchanglou has been nicknamed the [...] "zigzag building", because the {{vertical}} wooden <b>post</b> <b>structure</b> is not straight and perpendicular, but zigzags left and right. It was built that way due to an error measuring the building materials. But in spite of this apparent infirmity, this tall tulou withstood 700 years of natural elements and social turmoil.

50|$|The Mount Tenjo Fortifications are a {{historic}} defensive gun battery site on Mount Tenjo, a hill overlooking Apra Harbor, the principal deep-water port {{on the island}} of Guam. The site includes concrete mounting pads for seven guns and the crumbling remains of a concrete command <b>post</b> <b>structure.</b> These facilities are located just below {{the crest of the hill}} on its west side. A defensive trench also extends along the top of the plateau-like hill. Unlike most early 20th-century fortifications on Guam, these facilities were built in the late 1910s by the United States Navy, and not by Japanese forces during the World War II occupation period. These are the only known surviving pre-World War II defensive fortification sites on the island. They were functionally abandoned as a result of the 1922 Washington Naval Conference. Mount Tenjo was the site of battle during the 1944 liberation of Guam.|$|E

50|$|The {{mouth of}} Popes Creek is plugged by a flood-tide delta {{making it an}} {{efficient}} trap for sediment and enriched run-off from three primary sources: farmed watersheds consisting of broad terraces and open upland slopes, erosion of the bluffs and beaches of the Potomac, and the creek bluff erosion itself. Agriculturally derived fill deposited in adjacent ravines {{to a depth of}} 2 meters is found covering stumps from the 17th century. Beaver dams and ponds dot the flood plains as well as several old mill ponds which interrupt the flow. Historically, the navigation of the creek has been limited to shallow-draft vessels with present depth up to one meter augmented by 0.3 to 0.4 meter tide. The tributary continues to shoal as the sea level rises driving Potomac silt more than a kilometer inland. Core drilling in the delta has indicated 15 meters of mollusk-bearing sediment, over peat and sand deposits dating back over 6000 years. The taking of oysters is abundantly evident. Aboriginal shell middens were found during archeological excavations, <b>post</b> <b>structure</b> and land preparation for the Visitors’ Center at the site of George Washington’s birthplace. The 18th century refuse pit at the birthplace containing food garbage yielded shucked oyster shells as well. Fishing at the creek mouth is highlighted by the white perch run. In Captain John Smith’s explorations the fish were so thick their heads stuck out of water, prompting his men to attempt to catch them in a frying pan. The entrance to the smaller estuaries would be clogged during spring migrations including shad runs. Later colonial inventories of the Popes Creek plantation list seine corks, lead, seine rope, a knot of perch lines, yielding to the more than adequate kitchen utensil, or fish kettle, serving up the local delicacy.|$|E

30|$|Post {{debonding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} unfavorable situations for post-restored teeth and the use of different resin cements can influence the results [6, 32, 33]. A prerequisite for the use of fiber posts is their adhesive cementation, which creates a bond between the post and the root canal dentin and form a structurally and mechanically homogeneous complex. The combination of an adhesive bond to the root canal dentin with a resin core build-up allows the restoration of nonvital teeth while preserving the remaining tooth structure [3, 11, 13]. However, the goal is not only to achieve a high retentive bond strength of the fiber post, but also to avoid any microbiologic leakage along the root canal or post and to avoid degradation of the fiber <b>post</b> <b>structure</b> [34]. The purpose of the push-out test applied to the specimens in this study was to cause fracture of the dentin/cement and cement/post interface. This occurs because the cement has a lower elasticity modulus than the root dentin and the fiber post, creating a location of high stress concentration [2].|$|E
