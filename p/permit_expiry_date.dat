50|$|Article 31 The {{first day}} is not covered within the terms stipulated by the Chinese Copyright Protection Center. The <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is the {{corresponding}} {{day of the}} last month if the term is counted by year or by month; the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is the last day if no corresponding day in the month. If <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is in the legal holiday, the first working day after the holiday is the <b>expiry</b> <b>date.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{overnight}} trades, the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is {{the next}} week-day after the horizon date, and the delivery date is calculated from the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> {{in the same way}} as spot is calculated from the horizon date. This will result in an <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> that is before the spot date.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{trade with}} time to expiry of y months, the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is found by first calculating the spot date, then moving forward y months from the spot {{date to the}} {{delivery}} date. If the delivery date is a non-business day or a US holiday, move forward until an acceptable delivery date is found. Finally, calculate the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> using an [...] "inverse spot" [...] operation; e.g., find the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> for which the delivery date would be its spot. When finding the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> from the delivery date, there must be one clear business day and one weekday (not including 1 January) in any applicable non-USD/non-CAD, non-USD/non-TRY, non-USD/non-PHP, non-USD/non-RUB, non-USD/non-KZT and non-USD/non-PKR currency. If one leg of the currency pair is a non-deliverable currency, the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> must be a business day of that currency.|$|R
40|$|When {{setting an}} <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> on fresh food {{products}} producing {{companies have to}} buffer against two major uncertainties. The initial number of microbes is unknown in practice, and will be variable. Moreover the storage and transport temperatures until consumption will be uncertain and variable too, which will make microbial growth uncertain and variable. In order to cope with these two uncertainties, <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> are set at a rather cautious level, resulting into high numbers of product losses or out of stock (lost sales) at retail. In this {{paper we propose a}} so-called dynamic <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> (DED) as an alternative for the fixed <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> (FED) as applied nowadays. On the basis of a quality decay model that describes the growth of the number of microbes as a function of time and temperature, the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> can be dynamically adjusted depending on the measured temperature profile along the distribution chain and the initial number of microbes on the product. We present computer simulation experiments that quantify the effect of a dynamic <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> on product losses and out of stock at retail outlets. For this purpose, a logistics simulation model of a Dutch pork supply chain was developed. Simulation results show that the DED concept is a promising concept. We predict that a dynamic <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> decreases opportunity losses by almost 80 %. Moreover, advantages are higher when having lower shelf temperatures. Therefore, implementing DED may be an incentive for retailers to optimize their climate control...|$|R

5000|$|In 1937 the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> {{was changed}} to March 31, the design was changed in 1937, by placing Alberta on the top, and the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> on the bottom.

In 1942 the slogan was {{replaced}} with [...] "Canada", but was removed after that. In 1943 and 1944, plates with an expiry of March 31, 1944 were issued, but this was extended to March 31 1945 with a window sticker. This series used the 123-456 serial format.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the debate}} between {{cognitive}} individualism and cognitive universalism, some aspects of thinking are neither solely personal nor fully universal. Cognitive sociology proponents argue for intersubjectivity—an intermediate perspective of social cognition that provides a balanced view between personal and universal views of our social cognition. This approach suggests that, instead of being individual or universal thinkers, human beings subscribe to [...] "thought communities"—communities of differing beliefs. Thought community examples include churches, professions, scientific beliefs, generations, nations, and political movements. This perspective explains why each individual thinks differently from each another (individualism): person A may choose to adhere to <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> on foods, but person B may believe that <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> are only guidelines {{and it is still}} safe to eat the food days past the <b>expiry</b> <b>date.</b> But not all human beings think the same way (universalism).|$|R

40|$|Maintaining {{the safety}} and quality of {{manufactured}} food is an important concern for producers, government and consumers in Bangladesh. The nutritional value of food gradually reduces over time, until it finally becomes unsafe to consume and may cause harm to health. Then again, consumers throw out {{a large amount of}} manufactured food after the <b>expiry</b> <b>date,</b> believing it is not safe to consume. Thus, proper labelling of manufacturing and <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> of food on packet can protect both {{the safety and}} quality of food and save a large amount of food from being wasted. The legislators of Bangladesh do not prescribe any rules or regulations for food producers, which obliges manufacturers to use scientific methods for identifying <b>expiry</b> <b>dates.</b> Moreover, food producers, importers and suppliers use unspecific and confusing terms to indicate the manufacturing and <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> of food. This study finds that the date labelling of manufactured food issue in Bangladesh is inadequately regulated, triggering confusion among consumers, manufacturers, sales staff and regulatory authorities. Regulatory loopholes in date labelling contribute to food waste and threaten public health. These issues warrant the enacting of a comprehensive law establishing an effective regulatory body to oversee date labelling of manufactured and processed food...|$|R
