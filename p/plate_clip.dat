50|$|The takumbo is a parallel-stringed tube zither {{made from}} bamboo, and {{is found in}} the Philippines. It is made from a heavy bamboo tube about 40 cm long, with both ends closed with a node. Two strands of strings, about 5 cm apart, are {{partially}} etched out from the body of the bamboo. Small wooden bridges are inserted beneath the strings at both ends. At the center of the bamboo tube, below the strings, a small hole is bored. The small hole is covered with a bamboo <b>plate</b> <b>clipped</b> to the strings.|$|R
50|$|Advance Steel has {{a library}} of more than 300 preset {{parametric}} steel connections to connect Advance elements grouped in the following categories: beam end to end joints, base plate joints, general bracing joints, cantilever beam to column joints, <b>plate</b> joints, <b>clip</b> angle joints, pylon joints, tube brace joints, purlin joints, stiffener joints, turnbuckle bracings, etc.|$|R
5000|$|As before, Beyl {{wanted a}} US-sounding name {{for his new}} binding, and {{selected}} [...] "Nevada". The binding was released in 1950, along with a Nevada-branded cable binding of conventional design. The Nevada toe was the first modern ski binding that worked safely with any unmodified boot, eschewing attempts to attach to the sole or use add-on <b>plates</b> or <b>clips.</b> The basic two-pivot design has become universal, and used with only minor modifications to this day.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Onychomycosis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} onychopathy and it requires a correct early diagnosis. Currently, the diagnostic gold standard is the association of direct mycological test with culture; however, it shows variable sensitivity. The histopathological examination of the distal nail <b>plate,</b> called <b>clipping,</b> has shown to be an adjuvant in diagnosing onychomycosis. This is an easy-to-perform, relatively cheap examination that is little dependent of the examiner, rapidly provides results, has high sensitivity, and for patients it is painless and harmless...|$|R
60|$|Schultz toed {{the plate}} and watched the Rube pitch a couple. There {{seemed to be no}} {{diminution}} of the great pitcher's speed and both balls cut the <b>plate.</b> Schultz <b>clipped</b> the next one down the third-base Line. Bogart trapped it close to the bag, and got it away underhand, beating the speedy runner by a nose. It was a pretty play to start with, and the spectators were not close-mouthed in appreciation. The short, stocky Carl ambled up to bat, and I heard him call the Rube something. It was not a friendly contest, this deciding game between Buffalo and Worcester.|$|R
50|$|Rotary presses {{were used}} for {{high-speed}} work. In the oscillating press, the form slid under a drum around which each sheet of paper got wrapped for the impression, sliding back under the inking rollers while the paper was removed and a new sheet inserted. In a newspaper press, a papier-mâché mixture called a flong {{used to make a}} mould of the entire form of type, then dried and bent, and a curved metal plate cast against it. The <b>plates</b> were <b>clipped</b> to a rotating drum and could print against a continuous reel of paper at the enormously high speeds required for overnight newspaper production.This invention helped aid the high demand for knowledge during this time period.|$|R
30|$|Samples were light-aged in an Atlas Ci 65 A weatherometer using {{simulated}} daylight through {{plate glass}} at 75, 000  lx (the {{equivalent of a}} very bright sunny day). Paper swatches affixed to aluminum <b>plates</b> using metal <b>clips</b> were removed at time intervals ranging from 1 to 70  h (by which time one sample had bleached completely) and the color measured. Two swatches of each sample were used. Temperature and RH were not controlled.|$|R
40|$|Currently, most of {{railway track}} {{inspections}} are manually conducted by railroad track inspectors. Practically, {{it is not}} possible to inspect the thousand of miles of railway track by trained human inspector. This inspection takes too much time to inspect the defected railway track and then inform to the railway authority people. In this way it may lead to disaster. Hence to avoid delay and improve the accuracy, our propose system will automatically inspect the railway track by using vision based method and vibration based method. This method proposes continuous monitoring and assessment of the condition of the rail tracks which prevent major disasters. Our proposed system will inspect the rail track component such as missing bolts, tie plates, anchors etc by using vision based method and simultaneously do the calibration of railway track by using vibration based method. The system provides real-time monitoring and structural condition for railway track using vision based method and calibration to search the fault location on the track. Inspections include detecting defects on tracks, missing bolts, anchor, tie <b>plate</b> and <b>clips</b> etc. In vision based method camera we will use to capture the images or videos. In vibration based method some sensors we will use to detect the vibrations on the railway track. We will extract the signal from 2 -D...|$|R
50|$|Alpine: One {{problem with}} 1960s release {{bindings}} {{was that the}} boots were not standardized, and a binding that worked well on one boot might be dangerous on another, or might become dangerous over time as the boot shifted about. This led {{to the introduction of}} plate bindings, which used a metal <b>plate</b> firmly <b>clipped</b> to the sole of the boot, and bindings that clamped onto the plate. The plate could be easily removed for walking about. Plate bindings were popular in the US in the 1970s, notably the BURT Retractable Bindings and Spademan binding, but never caught on in any major way in Europe. As {{more and more of the}} alpine skiing market came under control of European companies, the plate bindings disappeared, in spite of their excellent safety records. The disappearance of the plate and alternate systems was due to a combination of factors, notably the introduction of standardized hard plastic boots. Plastic was first introduced by Lange as a way of improving existing leather designs. As the new material spread through the industry, the sole piece was standardized to allow toe-and-heel bindings to clip on. Plastic had the advantages of being much firmer than leather, not changing shape over time, and having predictable friction characteristics wet or dry. Although plate bindings of the era had much better safety records, notably the Spademan design, the new boots and bindings could be easily adapted to any ski for any skier.|$|R
5000|$|After {{taking a}} ride with Muntz in a 4-track player-outfitted car, Bill Lear, maker of the Lear Jet, {{modified}} the 4-track technology to create the Stereo 8 cartridge, widely known as the 8-track. Most notably, eight tracks were squeezed onto the same ¼" [...] tape, reducing potential audio quality, but allowing twice as much music to be put onto the same length of tape. The pinch roller was also {{an integral part of}} the 8-track cartridge, although many early rubber rollers would suffer from deterioration because the rubber had not been fully cured. Once this was discovered, all later rubber pinch rollers were [...] "fully cured" [...] (hard) rubber, or plastic rollers (introduced by RCA in 1970) were used instead. Thanks to his connection to Motorola, which made radios for Ford Motors cars, Lear was able to ensure that 8-track players would be included in many Ford cars, and they became popular mainly during the early- to mid-1970s. 4-track tapes gradually faded away and were gone by late 1970, as most people switched to 8-tracks, although players compatible with both 4-track and 8-track tapes were sometimes made. Inexpensive adapters were available that permitted 4-track tapes to be played in 8-track players. The adapter was a rubber pinch roller attached to a small metal <b>plate</b> that would <b>clip</b> into the opening in the 4-track cartridge. 4-track tapes are still in-demand by collectors.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Alchornea cordifolia (Schumach and Thonn) Müll. Arg. (Euphorbiaceace) {{is used in}} {{traditional}} African medicine {{for the treatment of}} painful and inflammatory disorders. This study was carried out to investigate the antinociceptive effect of aqueous root extract of Alchornea cordifolia in mice. The antinociceptive activity of the oral doses of 100 – 400 mg/kg of Alchornea cordifolia was assessed using the acetic acid-induced mouse writhing reflex, formalin-induced paw licking, hot <b>plate</b> and tail <b>clip</b> models of pain. The extract (100 – 400 mg/kg) produced significant (P 0. 05) dose dependent inhibition of writhing reflex as well as significant dose-dependent inhibition of the neurogenic and inflammatory pains associated with the formalin test. The formalin test result showed that the extract (100 - 400 mg/kg, p. o) increased pain threshold in a dose dependent manner in both phases but the effect is more prominent against the inflammatory phase (second phase). This findings showed that A. cordifolia possesses both central and peripheral analgesic activity, as shown by its ability to significantly (p Alchornea cordifolia in mice revealed that it has a wide margin of safety as it well tolerated by the animals. The results of the study suggest an analgesic property demonstrated by the aqueous root extract of Alchornea cordifolia possibly mediated by central and peripheral mechanisms and thus confirm the folkloric uses of the plant in painful disorders. Industrial relevance. In the recent past there has been a growing interest in Traditional medicine/Complementary and Alternative Medicine (TCAM) and their relevance to public health both in developed and developing countries. Diversity, flexibility, easy accessibility, broad continuing acceptance in developing countries and increasing popularity in developed countries, relative low cost, low levels of technological input, relative low side effects and growing economic importance are some of the positive features of traditional medicine. In this context, there is a critical need to mainstream traditional medicine into public health care to achieve the objective of improved access to healthcare facilities. Medicinal plants are largely used worldwide by the population and have proved to be a rich source of new active compounds, especially to treat pain and inflammatory processes. Alchornea cordifolia could be a potential source of cheap phytotherapeutic in the management of painful disorders. Keywords.
