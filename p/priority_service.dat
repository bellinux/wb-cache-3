At the butchers shop the best cuts of meat would go into their baskets. A helper or nurse was assigned by the government to help them take care of the brood and arrived first thing in the morning". An annuity was also considered for a recipient mother of the decoration, but due to government budget constraints, this proved unworkable. Members of the Hitler Youth organization were also instructed; a wearer of the Mother’s Cross was to be honourably greeted (saluted) when encountered. The Völkischer Beobachter (People’s Observer) national newspaper (1938 Issue No. 25) stated: [...] "…the holder of the Mother’s Cross of Honour will in future enjoy all types of privileges that we by nature have accustomed to our nation's honoured comrades and our injured war veterans." ...|$|E

This paper analyses and presents routine health facility record data to show trend correlations across <b>priority</b> <b>services.</b> Methods Review of district office and health facility client records for 39 health facilities in three districts of Zambia, covering four consecutive years (2004 - 07). Intra-facility analyses were conducted, service and coverage trends assessed and rank correlations between services measured to compare service trends within facilities. Results VCT, ART and PMTCT client numbers and coverage levels increased rapidly. There were some strong positive correlations in trends within facilities between reproductive health services (family planning and antenatal care) and ART and PMTCT, with Spearman rank correlations ranging from 0. 33 to 0. 83. Childhood immunisation coverage also increased. Stock-outs of important drugs for non-HIV <b>priority</b> <b>services</b> were significantly more frequent than were stock-outs of antiretroviral drugs. Conclusions The analysis shows scale-up in reproductive health service numbers in the same facilities where HIV services were scaling up. While district childhood immunisations increased overall, this did not necessarily occur in facility catchment areas where HIV service scale-up occurred. The paper demonstrates an approach for comparing correlation trends across different services, using routine health facility information.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to reduce the media access delay in a WiMAX mesh network. We observe that as the number of {{subscriber}} stations (SS) in a neighborhood increases, the processes of transmission opportunity (TO) competition and 3 - way handshake are easy to fail. This may degrade transmission efficiency and increase packet transmission delay. Besides, the minislot allocation defined in the WiMAX mesh mode may cause many lower <b>priority</b> <b>services</b> reserve earlier minislots than that of higher <b>priority</b> <b>services</b> like rtPS. This may cause great negative impact on delay-sensitive traffic. In this paper, we design a QoS classifier to enqueue packets according to different QoS service classes, present a dynamic holdoff exponent mechanism to reduce control subframe delay, and propose a Neighborhood-Based Minislot Allocation (NBMA) mechanism to reduce data subframe delay. Simulations show that the proposed methodology outperforms that of IEEE 802. 16 and Baye's DynExp in delay, jitter and throughput...|$|R

40|$|Progressive {{realisation}} is invoked as {{the guiding}} principle for countries {{on their own}} path to universal health coverage (UHC). It refers to the governmental obligations to immediately and progressively move towards the full realisation of UHC. This paper provides procedural guidance for countries, that is, how they can best organise their processes and evidence collection to make decisions on what services to provide first under progressive realisation. We thereby use 'evidence-informed deliberative processes', a generic value assessment framework to guide decision making on the choice of health services. We apply this {{to the concept of}} progressive realisation of UHC. We reason that countries face two important choices to achieve UHC. First, they need to define which services they consider as high priority, {{on the basis of their}} social values, including cost-effectiveness, priority to the worse off and financial risk protection. Second, they need to make tough choices whether they should first include more <b>priority</b> <b>services,</b> first expand coverage of existing <b>priority</b> <b>services</b> or first reduce co-payments of existing <b>priority</b> <b>services.</b> Evidence informed deliberative processes can facilitate these choices for UHC, and are also essential to the progressive realisation of the right to health. The framework informs health authorities on how they can best organise their processes in terms of composition of an appraisal committee including stakeholders, of decision-making criteria, collection of evidence and development of recommendations, including their communication. In conclusion, this paper fills in an important gap in the literature by providing procedural guidance for countries to progressively realise UHC...|$|R
