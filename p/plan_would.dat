5|$|On May 11, 2007, GO Transit {{announced}} {{a plan to}} put dedicated bus lanes on the centre median of the parkway, to allow its buses to bypass traffic congestion and promote buses {{as an alternative to}} automobiles.

5|$|On January 27, 2010, {{the day of}} President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Ryan reintroduced a {{modified}} version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010. The modified <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E

50|$|Then, in January 1917, Jackson {{had plans}} of {{rebuilding}} the Hampton Terrace Hotel. The full <b>plans</b> <b>would</b> not be released until February 1917, and the <b>plans</b> themselves <b>would</b> never {{come into being}} a reality.|$|R
50|$|In one study, {{participants}} were asked to judge which of two road improvement <b>plans</b> <b>would</b> be more efficient in reducing mean journey time. Respondents preferred a <b>plan</b> that <b>would</b> increase the mean speed from 70 to 110 km/h more than a <b>plan</b> that <b>would</b> increase the mean speed from 30 to 40 km/h, although the latter actually saves more time (Svenson, 2008, Experiment 1).|$|R

5|$|A plan {{welcomed by}} then mayor of Cologne Fritz Schramma to build shorter minerets was dropped after the architects said the <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> leave the minarets out of {{proportion}} {{with the rest of}} the building and surrounding structures. Construction of the opposed higher minerets will continue.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of the belief that the Balcerowicz <b>Plan</b> <b>would</b> quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be politically unrealistic.|$|E
5|$|In May 1922, John Hylan {{launched}} a new plan for the freight and passenger tunnel, and the Board of Estimate recommended that $4,080,000 be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority {{refused to accept the}} plan, as they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than the original plan. The original <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> have had the tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a freight yard to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a trunk line would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> only cover the Narrows Tunnel, and a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard.|$|E

5|$|Rademacher {{envisioned the}} {{founding}} of a European bank that would ultimately liquidate all European Jewish assets {{to pay for the}} plan. This bank would then play an intermediary role between Madagascar {{and the rest of the}} world, as Jews would not be allowed to interact financially with outsiders. Göring's office of the Four Year <b>Plan</b> <b>would</b> oversee the administration of the plan's economics.|$|E
5|$|A plan {{to widen}} the Narrows Bridge was {{announced}} on 13 April 1998 by the Court Liberal State Government. The $70 million <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> involve the addition of four extra traffic lanes, and {{was part of a}} $230 million package upgrading and extending {{the southern end of the}} Kwinana Freeway. Alannah McTiernan, then the Opposition Transport spokesperson, attacked the plan, saying that the government should instead build a railway to Rockingham.|$|E
5|$|After its {{announcement}} in 1995, the project stalled because P Associates {{was unable to}} find investors to finance the project. Investors were skeptical that luxury residential apartments outside the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in Center City could be successful. The delay allowed another developer to announce an agreement to acquire the property. In March 1999, Chicago-based developer the Barton Group announced its plan to build a 37-story, 322-unit luxury residential tower. The Barton Group's <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> also incorporate the PSFS headquarters building and York Row into the tower.|$|E

5|$|Between 1941 and 1945, {{approximately}} three million Ukrainian and other gentiles were killed {{as part of}} Nazi extermination policies in present-day Ukraine. More Ukrainians were killed fighting the Wehrmacht in the Red Army than American, British and French soldiers combined. Original Nazi plans called for the extermination of 65 percent of the nation's 23.2million Ukrainians, with the survivors treated as slaves. Over two million Ukrainians were deported to Germany as slave labor. The ten-year <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> have exterminated, expelled, Germanized or enslaved most (or all) Ukrainians.|$|E
5|$|DM's {{expansion}} {{would require}} the construction of 281 miles (452km) of new track, upgrading 598 miles (962km) of existing track (including all of the railroad's mainline track in Minnesota), new mainline connections Owatonna and Mankato, Minnesota, and three new rail yards. The <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> be the largest new railroad construction in the United States since the completion of Milwaukee Road's Pacific extension to Seattle, Washington, in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a school}} {{desegregation}} suit in 1972, the court required St. Louis to accept a busing plan in 1980. Judge William L. Hungate declared that a mandatory <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> go into effect unless other arrangements were made {{to adhere to the}} terms of the suit. In 1983, an unprecedented voluntary busing plan was put into place, integrating the schools without a mandated plan being required.|$|E

5|$|If Mirs main {{computer}} {{had failed}} after Progress M1-5 had docked, then the flight <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> have been modified to use either the station's BUPO rendezvous system, or the Progress for control. Under this plan, the third deorbit burn {{would have been}} conducted 24 hours after the first two burns, with the station being spin-stabilised again between {{the second and third}} burns. Controllers also planned for a failure of Mirs power system, which would have resulted in the deorbit being delayed one day, with all guidance and control functions being handled by the Progress spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|In the Adler {{variation}} 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after White {{has moved}} f2–f4, the e3-pawn becomes a backward pawn {{on an open}} file. Black can then apply pressure on the e-file in general, against the e3-pawn and the e4-square in particular. Typical moves in this <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> include the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f6, followed by putting the heavy pieces on the e-file with Rf8–e8 and Qd8–e7 (see diagram at right). The Bc5 is already well placed to pressure the e3-pawn. Depending on circumstances, the Bc8 may be involved either on b7 or on f5, in both cases to assert control over the central e4-square.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new federal government should be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the federal government should be more powerful than the states.|$|E

It would {{also include a}} diesel light rail line between Camden and Glassboro via Woodbury over an existing railroad right-of-way (as opposed to the expanded PATCO line via Route55), improvements to New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Line, and enhanced connections to the Atlantic City International Airport.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 2010, WMATA {{adopted a}} six-year capital {{spending}} plan totalling $5 billion.

He said it could have been paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|E
