40|$|In {{developing}} countries, smallholder farmers face many constraints including lack of information, {{and lack}} of access to credit and markets. To overcome these constraints, smallholder farmers can engage in contract farming. However, contract farming needs to meet farmers' preferences in order to be sustainable. This study aimed to analyze rice farmers' preferences for contract farming in Benin. Stated choice data were collected from 574 rice farmers. To account for heterogeneity, data were analyzed using a mixed logit model. Producers preferred contracts with seven major attributes: short term, <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>delivery,</b> collective selling, agreement on quantity, no provision of credit, application of the market price, and no control by the partner. However, there was heterogeneity in the contract preferences of rice farmers. The study suggests that these differences and the preferred attributes are important in the design of best-fit contract farming models by agribusiness firms and policy-makers...|$|E

To eliminate uncertainties {{as regards the}} expected currency gain/loss of S_t/E [S_t+m^*], the covered version of interest parity relies on financial markets, on which currencies can be traded for future delivery against <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>delivery</b> at a prearranged exchange rate. However, for most currencies, such forward markets did not develop until after the First World War (Einzig 1962, pp. 182 – 183, 1967, pp. 7 – 8) 4. Instead, early strategies to exploit international differences in interest rates relied heavily on long-bill investments (see, e.g. Clare 1895, ch. 14 – 16; Spalding 1915, pp. 80 ff.; Thomas 1921, pp. 78 ff., Einzig 1967, p. 6). Although they give rise to an implicit forward exchange rate, {{it is important to}} recognise that long-bills differ from a modern forward contract in terms of also encapsulating a short-term credit by requiring an immediate payment from the buyer, who is promised to receive a certain amount of foreign currency back upon maturity (see Clare 1895, ch. 12). Hence, interest-parity conditions involving long-bills differ from their modern counterparts (see Juhl et al. 2006).|$|E
40|$|Paper [I] models a game, {{where two}} {{temporary}} work agencies (TWAs) compete {{to fill a}} vacancy at a client firm (CF). They simultaneously choose how much effort to expend, based on their expectation of how good their opponent’s best candidate will be. I then show that this will make the TWAs overconfident, as the rational way of judging your own probability of winning is {{not looking at the}} opponents expected best, but comparing how much effort your opponent will expend. Paper [II] examines the misaligned incentives in the temporary work agency sector, where we first look at pure recruiting contracts, that either require <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>delivery,</b> or payment on some specified point in time. We then look at the incentives of recruit-and-rent contracts, where the worker is leased to the client firm. We assume that the better the worker, the higher the probability that the client firm {{is going to want to}} hire him/her. If that happens then the TWA will no longer get revenues from said worker, incentivizing the TWA to not always deliver the first match it finds, if it is too good. Lastly we look at how competition can dampen this perverse incentive. Paper [III] models the waiting behavior that can occur if a TWA is contracted to find a worker for a specific time far in the future; the TWA will postpone effort. This behavior is modeled for two types of TWAs; one that is rational and plans ahead, and another that does not plan ahead at all, but instead only looks at the immediate future. I find that the one that only looks at the immediate future starts exerting effort earlier than the planner. After looking at optimal contracts under perfect monitoring and hidden action I provide two extensions. I first show that for the principal to want to delegate search to a rational TWA, the agent has to be better than the CF, by some factor, as it has to make up in efficiency what the principal loses in moral hazard, when the agent waits longer than the principal would like it to. Lastly I prove that it is profit maximizing for the principal to contract one agent and give it a deadline earlier than when the principal would need the worker, and then replace that agent with a competitor if the first one has not succeeded by that earlier deadline. Paper [IV] estimates at the effect of family experience on relative transition probability into the temporary work agency sector. Using register data for all of Sweden we run a bias-reduced logistic regression, where we include various factors that affect the probability of young adults (aged 18 - 34) entering the sector. This paper ties in to the literature on occupational inheritance, as well as the literature on changing social norms. We find that having had a parent, sibling or partner in the TWA sector increases your probability of entering...|$|E

5000|$|Research of Nöldeke & Schmidt (1995) {{argued that}} the underinvestment problem due to the hold-up problem is {{eliminated}} if parties are able to write a simple option contract.

Thus, this contract {{does not depend on}} renegotiation or complicated mechanisms, but its crucial feature {{is that one of the}} parties can unilaterally decide whether the trade takes place. However, such a contract is unachievable unless it is possible to enforce the <b>payments</b> conditional <b>on</b> the <b>delivery</b> decision of the seller. That means that the court must be able to verify delivery of the good to the buyer by the seller.

The third section provides a brief definition and classification of electronic payment systems. The fourth section presents a survey analysis using payment preferences of the Czech e-shops to see what payment methods they offer, which one they prefer and why.

Soon, it started publishing up-coming new writers {{of the time and}} identified itself with the ‘modernist’ Navya movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The journal Saakshi that Akshara Prakashana published from 1968 to 1978 provided voice to that historic literary development. By 1975, Akshara Prakashana became a widely known organisation and it was reconstituted as a private trust and since then it has been running under Akshara Trust. K.V. Subbanna was its sole-trustee until 2005, and Akshara K.V. is its chief since then. Between 1957 and 2011, Akshara Prakashana has published more than fifty thousand pages of literature and several prominent writers and thinkers have joined hands with it. The publication has been working as a non-profit-oriented concern and has so far published more than 800 books, the subjects of which range from literature to theatre, from Cinema to Culture studies, from philosophy to humanities. Though a separate organisation, Akshara Prakashana has been working in coordination with Ninasam, supporting Ninasam’s activities with relevant publications. Some of the works published included those by T.P. Ashok and U.R. Anantha Murthy. In 2013, Akshara Prakashana has started its website www.aksharaprakashana.com where people can buy all of its books with the options of online <b>payment</b> and cash <b>on</b> <b>delivery.</b>|$|R
40|$|Stabilization {{schemes for}} the Australian wheat industry, or {{marketing}} schemes {{as they are}} now called, first came into existence in 1914 when the Commonwealth Government exercised powers under the War Precautions Act and set up an Australian Wheat Board to acquire the crop, fix purchase prices, allocate shipping and make advance <b>payments</b> to growers <b>on</b> <b>delivery</b> of wheat. This first scheme was replaced by voluntary co-operatives and private trading between the two World Wars. A new Australian Wheat Board was set up again in 1939. The experience from compulsory pools during the two World Wars, incorporating the payment of fixed prices, help growers appreciate some of the advantages of centralised marketing and encouraged them to seek a compulsory national marketing scheme after the Second World War. Growers did not want a return to the depressed conditions of the 1930 's and perceived that the Australian Wheat Board would protect them from the vagaries of the international market. Thus, in 1948, national marketing schemes for wheat became a permanent feature of Australian rural policy with the commencement of the first Stabilization Plan covering the five-year period 1948 / 49 to 1952 / 53.
