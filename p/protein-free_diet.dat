40|$|Although protein {{turnover}} in skeletal muscle is increased in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism, a deficient protein intake tends to increase serum T 3 (tri-iodothyronine) while decreasing muscle protein turnover. To determine whether this diet-induced decrease in protein turnover can occur independent of thyroid status, we have examined muscle protein turnover and nitrogen conservation in hyperthyroid rats fed on a <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet.</b> After inducing hyperthyroidism by giving 20 micrograms of T 3 / 100 g body wt. daily for 7 days, groups of euthyroid and hyperthyroid animals {{were divided into}} subgroups fed on basal and protein-free diets.

Urinary nitrogen output of euthyroid and hyperthyroid animals fed on the <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> was also measured. Although hyperthyroidism increased the baseline rates of muscle protein synthesis and degradation, it did not prevent a decrease in these values in response to protein depletion.

In addition, the effect of xylanase on endogenous amino acid flow was studied. In experiment one, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats (190. 92. 0 g) were fed one of four <b>protein-free</b> <b>diets,</b> based on cornstarch, sucrose and soybean oil that contained 0, 20, 30, or 40 g kg 1 of water-extractable soluble non-starch polysaccharides. In experiment two, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats (204. 31. 6 g), were randomly allotted to one of four <b>protein-free</b> <b>diets</b> in a 2 x 2 factorial design with the diets containing 30 g kg 1 of either water-extractable or alkali-extractable soluble non-starch polysaccharides.

Both experiments lasted 8 d. The rats were killed on day 8 and the digesta contained in the final 20 cm of the ileum was obtained for assay. The results of experiment one revealed that adding graded levels of water-extractable soluble non-starch polysaccharides significantly increased (linear and quadratic effect; p 1 increase in water-extractable soluble non-starch polysaccharides in the diet. Putrescine and spermine levels in the ileum increased (linear and quadratic effect; p< 0. 05) as the level of water-extractable soluble non-starch polysaccharides in the diet increased. Acetate, propionate and butyrate levels also increased (linear and quadratic effect; p< 0. 05) with increasing levels of water-extractable non-starch polysaccharides. In experiment two, with the exception of glycine, dietary supplementation of alkali-extractable non-starch polysaccharides significantly increased the endogenous amino acid loss at the terminal ileum compared with water-extractable non-starch polysaccharides (p< 0. 05). The addition of xylanase significantly decreased ileal endogenous amino acid loss in rats. The overall results of these experiments indicate that the presence of soluble non-starch polysaccharides increases endogenous amino acid loss at the terminal ileal, which may explain the reduction in the digestibility of crude protein and amino acids commonly observed in animals fed diets containing a high concentration of soluble non-starch polysaccharides...|$|R

There was a widening of the endoplasmic reticulum, a decrease in number of membrane-associated ribosomes, and a development of fine and coarse vacuoles containing agranular disoriented membranes. Cytoplasmic ribosomes unassociated with membranes were less numerous. Nuclear changes consisted of a coarsening and clumping of the nuclear chromatin, chromatin margination, and increased osmiophilia and vacuolation of the nucleolus. Eight to ten days after the beginning of ethionine injections, changes in zymogen granules, mitochondria, and the Golgi apparatus appeared, but only after extensive damage to the acinar cell. The effects were consistent with ethionine's known interference with protein metabolism but also suggest disturbance in ribonucleic acid metabolism.

Growing broiler chickens (5 weeks old) were used. All three assay diets were based on dextrose, and in the GuC and EHC diets GuC or EHC were the sole source of N. Endogenous AA flows determined with the use of <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> were considerably lower (P 0. 05), except for the flow of arginine, which was lower (P < 0. 05) in the EHC method. Glutamic acid, aspartic acid, threonine and glycine were the predominant endogenous AA present in digesta from the distal ileum. The contents of methionine, histidine and cystine were lower compared with other AA. The method of determination had no effect on the AA composition of endogenous protein, except for threonine, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine and cystine. The concentrations of threonine and arginine were lower (P < 0. 05) and that of lysine was higher (P < 0. 05) with the EHC method compared with the other two methods. The concentration of glutamic acid was greater (P < 0. 05) and that of cystine was lower (P < 0. 05) in the EHC and GuC methods compared with the <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> method. The results showed that the ileal endogenous flows of N and AA are markedly enhanced by the presence of protein and peptides, above those determined following feeding of a <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet.</b> It is concluded that the use of EHC and GuC methods enables the measurement of ileal endogenous losses in chickens under normal physiological conditions...|$|E

40|$|Summary. After mating, rats {{were fed}} {{one of the}} {{following}} diets: 100 % sucrose, 100 % vitamin-free casein, purified protein-free or purified with 20 % casein. Fetal survival and weight changes in the maternal adrenal glands, uterus, ovaries and gastrocnemius muscle were determined at Day 20. Pregnancy failed in all animals fed sucrose or a <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> and in half of those fed purified casein. Daily injections of pro-gesterone (5 mg) increased both the number of rats remaining pregnant and fetal survival rates in those fed sucrose, a <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> or casein. Pregnancy maintenance in these animals was characterized by larger adrenal glands and smaller gastrocnemius weights. The failure of preg-nancy in rats fed only vitamin-free casein or a <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> was associated with a significant increase in loss of total body weight. The minimum period of progesterone treatment for the maintenance of pregnancy was Days 5 to 9 in dams fed only sucrose after mating. In animals fed sucrose, treated with progesterone from Days 5 to 9 and killed on Days 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18, the weights of the uterus and con-ceptuses began to increase, the weight of the liver declined, followed by a decrease in gastrocnemius weight.

The flows were better correlated to the water-holding capacity (WHC) of the diet than to fiber intake (R 2 = 0. 996 vs 0. 76, respectively). The relationship with WHC was of the exponential type, with a high increase when the WHC exceeded 3 g of water/g diet. A similar pattern and correlation (R 2 = 0. 98) was obtained for the ileal flow of nucleobases (markers of epithelial cells and bacteria), whereas the relationships with crude mucus (R 2 = 0. 96) and diaminopimelic acid (marker of bacteria, R 2 = 0. 55) were linear. N retention by pigs fed with 0, 30, 60, or 90 g/kg of dry matter (DM) of the same protein isolates {{did not differ significantly}} in pigs receiving a 40 or 160 g of PIF/kg diet, despite significant differences in ileal N and amino acid flows between the two fiber levels (2. 0 and 3. 1 g of N/kg of DM intake, on average).

30|$|Silvery-black porgy (Sparidentex hasta) is {{recognized}} as one of the most promising fish species for aquaculture diversification in the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea regions. In this regard, during recent years, nutritional studies focused on establishing the nutritional requirements for improving diet formulation for this species (Mozanzadeh et al. 2017). Previous studies have shown that the dietary protein requirement of S. hasta juvenile is estimated to be 48 %, being fish meal the major source of protein in the diet (Mozanzadeh et al. 2017). Moreover, the optimal dietary EAA profile for S. hasta juveniles was estimated to be (g 16  g/N): arginine 5.3, lysine 6.0, threonine 5.2, histidine 2.5, isoleucine 4.6, leucine 5.4, methionine + cysteine 4.0 (in a diet containing 0.6 cysteine), phenylalanine + tyrosine 5.6 (in a diet containing 1.9 tyrosine), tryptophan 1.0, and valine 4.6 (Marammazi et al. 2017). In addition, Yaghoubi et al. (2017) reported that arginine, threonine, and lysine were the most limited EAA for humoral immunity in this species. Several studies used <b>protein-free</b> <b>diets</b> (PF) for estimating nitrogen utilization and loss as well as protein and EAA requirements for maintenance in different fish species (Kaushik et al. 1995, Abboudi et al. 2006, 2009). To our knowledge, there is no available information about the effects of dietary protein and EAA deficiencies on physiological responses in this sparid species. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate effects of protein and EAA deficiencies on the growth performance, feed utilization, body composition, and pancreatic digestive enzyme activities to clarify how protein and EAA deficiencies can affect physiological responses in this species.|$|R

40|$|Metastasis will {{continue}} to be an incurable disease for most patients until we develop highly selective anticancer therapies. The development of these therapies requires finding and exploiting major differences between cancer cells and normal cells. Although the sum of the many DNA alterations of cancer cells makes up such a major difference, there is currently no way of exploiting these alterations as a whole. Here I propose a non-pharmacological strategy to selectively kill any type of cancer cell, including cancer stem cells, by exploiting their complete set of DNA alterations. It is based on creating challenging environmental conditions that only cells with undamaged DNAs can overcome. Cell survival requires continuous protein synthesis, which in turn requires adequate levels of 20 amino acids (AAs). If we temporarily restrict specific AAs and keep high levels of others whose deficit triggers proteolysis, we will force cells to activate a variety of genetic programs to obtain adequate levels of each of the 20 proteinogenic AAs. Because cancer cells have an extremely altered DNA that has evolved under particular environmental conditions, they may be unable to activate the genetic programs required to adapt to and survive the new environment. Cancer patients may be successfully treated with a <b>protein-free</b> artificial <b>diet</b> in which the levels of specific AAs are manipulated. Practical considerations for testing and implementing this cheap and universal anticancer strategy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMuscle {{mass loss}} is induced by aging, several catabolic diseases, and malnutrition. It {{is well known}} that {{ingestion}} of whey protein and its hydrolysates (WPH) is effective in stimulating muscle protein synthesis. However, these studies focused on the acute up-regulation of muscle protein synthesis, and few studies have investigated the effect of whey protein and WPH on muscle mass during chronic malnutrition. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of 7 days supplementation of whey protein and WPH on muscle reduction in Wistar rats fed a <b>protein-free</b> (PF) <b>diet.</b> Wistar rats were fed either a standard diet (containing 20 % protein) or a PF diet during the experimental period.

The weight of the extensor digitorum longus decreased in rats fed a PF diet supplemented with the amino acid mixture or the whey protein. However, this decrease was partially but significantly suppressed in the group fed the WPH supplement. Additionally, administration of WPH induced a postprandial increase in plasma essential amino acids, branched-chain amino acids, and leucine concentration compared with animals fed the amino acid mixture or the whey protein.

Objective: The influence of dietary preexposure to soy protein on oral sensitization studies with soy protein in Brown Norway rats was investigated. Methods: Brown Norway rats bred on a soy protein-containing diet for several generations (routine bred [RB] animals) were placed on a soy <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> during and for at least 6 months before breeding (F 0 group). Four generations of offspring were bred on a soy <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> (F 1, F 2, F 3, and F 4 groups). RB and F 4 animals were exposed to soy protein either ad libitum through drinking water or parenterally with an adjuvant. Results: In the F 0 and F 1 animals soy protein-specific IgG antibodies were still detectable, whereas no soy protein-specific IgG was detectable in the other generations tested. In RB animals no significant increase in soy protein-specific IgG titers occurred after exposure to soy protein. Enteral exposure of the F 4 animals to soy protein resulted in sensitization to soy protein, with increased soy protein-specific IgG titers. Conclusions: These studies demonstrate {{that there is a}} continued expression of anti-soy protein antibodies in rats bred and raised on a soy <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> for one generation. Not only must the test animals be bred and raised on a specified antigen-free diet, but their parental generations must also be bred in the same manner to avoid any problems in oral sen-sitization studies.

The deduced amino acid sequence (533 residues; Mr 56493) shared closer similarity with Bacillus subtilis 3 -phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase than with the enzymes from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In all cases the similarity was most apparent in the substrate- and NAD+-binding domains, and low or insignificant in the C-terminal domain.

Similar properties were observed with a truncated form of 3 -phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase lacking the C-terminal domain, indicating that the latter is not implicated in substrate inhibition or in salt effects.

In a second experiment, we compared ileal endogenous AA outputs and true AA digestibility estimates obtained in pigs ingesting 15 N-labeled dietary proteins in a single meal vs. intravenous infusion of [15 N]Ieucine for 10 d during the ingestion of a pea-based <b>diet</b> and a <b>protein-free</b> starch <b>diet.</b> The proportion of endogenous N found in the ileal digesta differed when the label was delivered orally (50 %) vs. intravenously (72 %) and changed with time. As a consequence, the true ileal AA digestibilities measured with labeled diets were lower. A third experiment demonstrated that this was due to the rapid recycling of labeled dietary N in endogenous moieties, because 15 N was found in blood within 10 min of consuming the labeled meal, within 50 min of consumption in pancreatic enzymes, 90 min in bile and 4 h in ileal mucins. We conclude that the use of 15 N-labeled meals for determination of true ileal AA digestibilities is limited by the fast recycling of dietary N in endogenous secretions following a single 15 N-labeled meal. The accuracy of results will depend on meaningful estimates of AA flow during a limited period and accurate estimates of 15 N in AA...|$|R

Metastasis will continue to be an incurable disease for most patients until we develop highly selective anticancer therapies. The development of these therapies requires finding and exploiting major differences between cancer cells and normal cells. Although the sum of the many DNA alterations of cancer cells makes up such a major difference, there is currently no way of exploiting these alterations as a whole. Here I propose a non-pharmacological strategy to selectively kill any type of cancer cell, including cancer stem cells, by exploiting their complete set of DNA alterations. It is based on creating challenging environmental conditions that only cells with undamaged DNAs can overcome. Cell survival requires continuous protein synthesis, which in turn requires adequate levels of 20 amino acids (AAs). If we temporarily restrict specific AAs and keep high levels of others whose deficit triggers proteolysis, we will force cells to activate a variety of genetic programs to obtain adequate levels of each of the 20 proteinogenic AAs. Because cancer cells have an extremely altered DNA that has evolved under particular environmental conditions, they may be unable to activate the genetic programs required to adapt to and survive the new environment. Cancer patients may be successfully treated with a <b>protein-free</b> artificial <b>diet</b> in which the levels of specific AAs are manipulated. Practical considerations for testing and implementing this cheap and universal anticancer strategy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Shifting rats to a <b>protein-free,</b> carbohydrate-rich <b>diet,</b> {{although}} not starvation, {{resulted in the}} appearance of mRNA for, and activity of, 3 -phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3 -PGDH) in liver {{as well as in}} a marked decrease in plasma cystine concentration. Refeeding with protein caused a 50 % decrease in the mRNA in 8 h and its complete disappearance within 24 h, followed by a slower disappearance of the enzymic activity. Intraperitoneal administration of cysteine or methionine to protein-starved rats decreased the mRNA by 50 - 60 % after 8 h. However, the repeated administration of cysteine failed to cause the complete disappearance of this mRNA in 24 h. In hepatocytes in primary culture, cysteine plus methionine and glucagon had, independently, an approx. 4 -fold inhibitory effect on the abundance of the 3 -PGDH mRNA and caused its almost complete disappearance when tested together. Insulin had an approx. 2 -fold stimulatory effect, which was antagonized by cysteine plus methionine but was still apparent in the presence of glucagon. Nuclear run-on experiments and analysis of the stability of the mRNA with 5, 6 -dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, suggested that the effect of cysteine plus methionine was due to destabilization of the mRNA, whereas the effect of glucagon was exerted on transcription. Cysteine, but not methionine, inhibited the accumulation of 3 -PGDH mRNA in FTO 2 B hepatoma cells. In conclusion, the dietary control of the expression of the 3 -PGDH gene in liver seems to involve the negative effects of cysteine and glucagon and the positive effect of insulin...|$|R

40|$|Summary. -Seven {{days on a}} <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> {{increases}} the susceptibility of rats to the action of DMN as a renal carcinogen. The dose response for the induction of kidney tumours by a single dose of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in these rats is reported. The first tumour was not found until 28 weeks after the dose. At 100 weeks the incidence ranged from 22. 50 /o at the lowest dose (20 mg/kg) to 97 °h at the highest dose (60 mg/kg). The incidence in probits at any time between 50 and 100 weeks was linearly related to the log dose. Epithelial and mesenchymal tumours were produced in an approximate ratio of 2 : 1. The <b>protein-free</b> <b>diet</b> alters the rate of metabolism of DMN in the rat, and {{increases the}} alkylation of nucleic acids by this carcinogen in the kidney. Further treatment of the rat with benzo(a) pyrene can reverse, to some extent, the change in metabolism, but does not reverse the change in alkylation. It is shown that the change in kidney-tumour incidence produced by the change in diet, and by the treatment with benzo(a) pyrene, corresponds to the changes these treatments produce in the alkylation of kidney DNA by the carcinogen.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} role of dispensable {{amino acids}} (DAAs) has been seldom studied in fish, while the metabolism {{of these species}} is orientated toward the oxidation of amino acids (AAs) for energetic purpose. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the role of DAAs in the absence of indispensable (1) AA supply in Atlantic salmon and to verify if, as in mammals they play a nutritional role under near maintenance conditions. Therefore we measured the effect of adding DAAs on nitrogen and AA losses in Atlantic salmon fry fed a <b>protein-free</b> (PF) <b>diet.</b> Fry were either starved or fed a PF diet or a DAA-supplemented (DAA-PF) diet for 30 days. The maintenance protein requirement estimated from the endogenous losses were 1. 11, 1. 58 and 0. 65 g/kg BW/day for starved fish, fish fed PF or DAA-PF diets, respectively. The daily IAA and DAA losses of fish fed the DAA-PF diet were greatly reduced (- 55 and - 63 %, respectively) compared to fish fed the PF diet (P< 0. 05), except for proline and serine for which the reduction was not significant. Among the DAAs, alanine and glycine losses were particularly reduced when fish were fed the DAA-PF diet compared to the PF-diet (- 74 and - 82 % for alanine and glycine, respectively). Among the IAAs, methionine loss was the most reduced by the supplementation of the PF-diet with DAAs (- 72 %). These results showed the indispensable role of DAAs under near maintenance conditions and their sparing effect on the use of alanine and glycine specifically. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The role of diet in {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) remains controversial {{and there have}} been no controlled studies on the use of elemental diet in the treatment of RA. Elemental diet is an hypoallergenic <b>protein-free</b> artificial <b>diet</b> consisting of essential amino acids, glucose, trace elements and vitamins. This study was carried out to assess the role of elemental diet and subsequent food reintroduction in RA. Elemental diet (E 028) (and a small number of foods) was given to 24 patients with definite RA in order to induce a remission and then foods were gradually introduced. Where a food was suspected of causing symptoms it was removed from the diet. Twenty-three control patients supplemented their usual diet with E 028. After the elemental diet there was a statistically significant improvement in the diet group in grip strength (P = 0. 008) and Ritchie score (P = 0. 006) but not in ESR, CRP, thermographic joint score or functional score. The diet group lost more weight than the control group and this correlated with the improvement in grip strength. This improvement was not present following food reintroduction. As the improvements took place in more subjective disease parameters and because of the difficulties in adequately blinding studies of diet in arthritis, a placebo effect must be considered. There was a high default rate, only 38 % of those patients originally enrolled completed the study. In conclusion, this study shows that elemental diet can cause an improvement in a number of disease parameters in RA but this is not sustained by an individualized diet. It also illustrates some of the difficulties involved in the study of diet in arthritis. KEY WORDS: Rheumatoid arthritis, Treatment, Elemental diet, Elimination diet...|$|R
40|$|Both {{learning}} and basic biological mechanisms {{have been shown}} {{to play a role in}} the control of protein int^e. It has previously been shown that rats can adapt their dietary selection patterns successfully in the face of changing macronutrient requirements and availability. In particular, it has been demonstrated that when access to dietary protein is restricted for a period of time, rats selectively increase their consumption of a proteincontaining diet when it becomes available. Furthermore, it has been shown that animals are able to associate various orosensory cues with a food's nutrient content. In addition to the role that learning plays in food intake, there are also various biological mechanisms that {{have been shown to}} be involved in the control of feeding behaviour. Numerous studies have documented that various hormones and neurotransmitter substances mediate food intake. One such hormone is growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF), a peptide that induces the release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland. Recent research by Vaccarino and Dickson (1 994) suggests that GRF may stimulate food intake by acting as a neurotransmitter in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the adjacent medial preoptic area (MPOA). In particular, when GRF is injected directly into the SCN/MPOA, it has been shown to selectively enhance the intake of protein in both fooddeprived and sated rats. Thus, GRF may play a role in activating protein consumption generally, and when animals have a need for protein, GRF may serve to trigger proteinseeking behaviour. Although researchers have separately examined the role of {{learning and}} the central mechanisms involved in the control of protein selection, no one has yet attempted to bring together these two lines of study. Thus, the purpose of this study is to join these two parallel lines of research in order to further our understanding of mechanisms controlling protein selection. In order to ascertain the combined effects that GRF and learning have on protein intake several hypothesis were examined. One major hypothesis was that rats would successfully alter their dietary selection patterns in response to protein restriction. It was speculated that rats kept on a nutritionally complete maintenance diet (NCMD) would consume equal amount of the intermittently presented high protein conditioning <b>diet</b> (HPCD) and <b>protein-free</b> conditioning <b>diet</b> (PFCD). However, it was hypothesized that rats kept on a <b>protein-free</b> maintenance <b>diet</b> (PFMD) would selectively increase their intake of the HPCD. Another hypothesis was that rats would learn to associate a distinct marker flavour with the nutritional content of the diets. If an animal is able to make the association between a marker flavour and the nutrient content of the food, then it is hypothesized that they will consume more of a mixed diet (equal portion HPCD and PFCD) with the marker flavour that was previously paired with the HPCD (Mixednp-f) when kept on the PFMD. In addition, it was hypothesized that intracranial injection of GRF into the SCN/MPOA would result in a selective increase in HPCD as well as Mixednp-t consumption. Results demonstrated that rats did in fact selectively increase their consumption of the flavoured HPCD and Mixednp-f when kept on the NCMD. These findings indicate that the rats successfully learned about the nutrient content of the conditioning diets and were able to associate a distinct marker flavour with the nutrient content of the diets. However, the results failed to support previous findings that GRF increases protein intake. In contrast, the administration of GRF significantly reduced consumption of HPCD during the first hour of testing as compared to the no injection condition. In addition, no differences in the intake of the HPCD were found between the GRF and vehicle condition. Because GRF did not selectively increase HPCD consumption, it was not surprising that GRF also did not increase MixedHP-rintake. What was interesting was that administration of GRF and vehicle did not reduc^Mixednp-f consumption as it had decreased HPCD consumption...|$|R
