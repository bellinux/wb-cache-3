5|$|As a formality, {{a person}} must state a justifiable reason for {{purchasing}} a B category firearm, which include collecting, sporting, hunting or cultural activity, conducting business with firearms and ammunition, providing security, exercise of profession and self-defense. The <b>police</b> <b>will</b> issue the permit {{in up to}} 30 days (usually immediately) and the permit is shall-issue if the applicant has a valid gun license (and fulfills all of its requirements, e.g. clean criminal record); the purchase permit is valid for 12 months.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of series four, Meyer is shot in a road-rage incident {{on his way to}} work. The culprit is later admitted to the hospital as a patient, when he crashes his car after trying to flee following the shooting. He tries to escape from the hospital in fear that the <b>police</b> <b>will</b> discover him, and after three attempts at leaving the hospital, he finally achieves his goal but collapses in the hospital car park and dies.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to safety design, new security measures will be implemented. All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before {{they enter the}} site through the underground road. Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed {{in and around the}} site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD. A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority <b>police</b> <b>will</b> patrol the site.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{say that}} zero-tolerance <b>policing</b> <b>will</b> fail because its {{practice}} destroys several important requisites for successful community policing, namely police accountability, {{openness to the}} public, and community cooperation (Cox and Wade 1998: 106).|$|R
50|$|For this occasion, Oberg, {{in charge}} of the German Police in France, came from Paris to supervise. He gave Bousquet orders {{directly}} received from Heinrich Himmler. It is a notable case of the French <b>police's</b> <b>willing</b> collaboration with the Nazis.|$|R
50|$|Neighbourhood <b>policing</b> <b>will</b> {{be carried}} out at a {{district}} level with an extra 400 constables transferred into it.

5|$|In the present, White and Pink beat Nash for information. Eddie {{arrives and}} orders them to {{retrieve}} the diamonds and ditch the getaway vehicles, leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange. Nash denies knowledge, but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture, cutting off his ear with a straight razor. He is about to set Nash on fire, but is shot dead by Orange. Orange explains to Nash {{that he is an}} undercover police officer and that the <b>police</b> <b>will</b> arrive soon.|$|E
5|$|Museum curators {{consider}} {{visitors who}} pick up {{items from the}} ground to be thieves, and local <b>police</b> <b>will</b> charge them as such. The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of ten years. On 22 June 2015, two British youths from the Perse School were convicted of theft after picking up buttons and shards of decorative glass they found on the ground near the area where camp victims' confiscated personal effects were stored. The boys, both 17 years old, received probation and were fined £170, but later appealed the sentence. Curators said that similar incidents happen {{once or twice a}} year.|$|E
5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view and {{identify}} {{the body of the}} deceased {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an autopsy is required. The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the <b>police</b> <b>will</b> conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the {{effectiveness}} of ALPR systems {{within the framework of}} intelligence-led policing in two specific ways. First, the impact of ALPR systems on <b>policing</b> <b>will</b> be analyzed through assessments of crime clearance rates (follow-up arrests). In addition to impact analysis, ALPR mobile units and traditional <b>policing</b> <b>will</b> be compared for their manpower and cost effectiveness. Second, this study will identify and recommend the most effective strategies for deployment of ALPR units based on optimal crime reduction benefits through arrests and crime prevention techniques. Using the tenets of specific theories of crime prevention, including offender search theory and crime pattern theory, this study examines whether crime prevention theory can assist researchers and police leaders to optimally allocate ALPR mobile units to prevent crime before it occurs. Based on this analysis, specific recommendations regarding deployment of ALPR units will be provided...|$|R

5|$|In fiction, Druitt is {{depicted}} as the murderer in the musical Jack the Ripper by Ron Pember and Denis de Marne. In John Gardner's Sherlock Holmes story The Return of Moriarty, Professor Moriarty's criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity {{as a result of}} the Jack the Ripper murders. He discovers that Druitt is the murderer and so fakes his suicide in the hope that the <b>police</b> <b>will</b> lose interest once the murders cease. In Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell, Druitt is portrayed as a patsy for the royal family, made to look guilty of the Ripper murders in order to protect the real killer, Sir William Gull.|$|E
5|$|Seven months later, Carl {{shows his}} boss that Frank has been forging checks all over western Europe and asks {{permission}} to go to Europe to look for him. When his boss refuses, Carl brings Frank's checks to printing professionals who claim that the checks were printed in France. From an interview with Frank's mother, Carl remembers that she was actually born in Montrichard, France. He goes there and locates Frank, and tells him that the French <b>police</b> <b>will</b> kill him {{if he does not}} go with Carl quietly. Frank assumes he is lying at first, but Carl promises Frank he would never lie to him, and Carl takes him outside, where the French police escort him to prison.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} Belle's death, Aden and Nicole begin a relationship, which becomes {{strained}} when Nicole {{tells him that}} she loves him, but Aden does not return the sentiment. A repentant Aden pays Nicole more attention and {{they are able to}} get their romance back on track. Aden's brother Justin (Matthew Walker) is involved in a car accident, which causes short-term memory loss, but prompts him to admit that he too was abused by their grandfather. He regains his memory, and recalls that Larry was in the car {{at the time of the}} accident. He and Aden find their father dead. Convinced that the <b>police</b> <b>will</b> think Justin killed him, Aden decides that they should bury Larry. The police become suspicious nonetheless, and the two are arrested for murder, until a phone call made to Aden's phone from Larry confirms that he caused his own death by irresponsible driving. Justin convinces Aden to move to the city. When Nicole refuses to go with him, he leaves anyway.|$|E
50|$|The {{recipient}} of traffic {{that has been}} <b>policed</b> <b>will</b> observe packet loss distributed throughout periods when incoming traffic exceeded the contract. If the source does not limit its sending rate (for example, through a feedback mechanism), this will continue, and may appear to the recipient as if link errors or some other disruption is causing random packet loss. The received traffic, which has experienced <b>policing</b> en route, <b>will</b> typically comply with the contract, although jitter may be introduced by elements in the network downstream of the policer.|$|R

30|$|Hence, {{we propose}} {{in this work}} a new traffic {{policing}} mechanism, which is completely different from FSA-TB. This new mechanism, JIMC-P, {{is based on the}} Jaccard Index-Infused Markovian Clustering model presented in our recent work on screen mirroring traffic modeling in [15], i.e., it is a token bucket mechanism in which tokens are generated based on the JIMC model instead of being generated based on a mean rate. It should be emphasized that the high accuracy of the model (3 – 4 % prediction error on average for I-frames and P-frames) does not guarantee an equally good performance when the model is incorporated into the policer. For example, if the error is steadily caused by higher predictions, the <b>policer</b> <b>will</b> be too lenient against misbehaving users, whereas if the error is steadily caused by lower predictions, the <b>policer</b> <b>will</b> be too strict, leading to the unnecessary possible packet dropping. Hence, a thorough examination of the potential use of the model within the policer is important.|$|R
5|$|When {{a person}} dies, a doctor will certify {{the cause of}} death if it is known and due to natural causes. He or she will then fill up a {{certificate}} of cause of death (CCOD) which will be given to the family of the deceased. If the doctor is unable to determine {{the cause of death}}, or the death is due to non-natural causes, the Criminal Procedure Code requires him to refer the case to the police. The <b>police</b> <b>will</b> provide a hearse to send the body to the Centre for Forensic Medicine (CFM) Mortuary at Block 9 of the Singapore General Hospital, which will then inform the family when to visit the mortuary.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{receives}} {{a call from}} Hughes to say that Bradley {{is about to be}} arrested and urges Bradley to leave Walford as quickly as possible. Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the <b>police</b> <b>will</b> no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E
