6000|$|... "The {{story does}} not lose in travelling, {{as a matter}} of course," [...] {{answered}} our host, [...] "though it is true in the main. We all supped with Mr. Cuyler last evening, and know that he had much more than a <b>potatoe</b> on the table." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! as for that," [...] said Lord Marney; [...] "they {{get more}} than that, because there is beer-money allowed, at least {{to a great extent}} among us, though I for one do not approve of the practice, and that makes nearly a {{shilling}} per week additional; and then some of them have <b>potatoe</b> grounds, though I am entirely opposed to that system.|$|E

"It has {{not been}} a lucky day for me," [...] rejoined the lad, [...] "I could not find a single gentleman's horse to hold, so help me, except one what was at the House of Commons, and he kept me there two mortal hours and said when he came out, that he would {{remember}} me next time. I ain't tasted no wittals to-day except some cat's-meat and a cold <b>potatoe</b> what was given me by a cabman; but I have got a quid here, and if you are very low I'll give you half." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{found the}} place deserted. With the {{exception}} of our own men, I found but one living being in it. This was an old woman whom I discovered stowed away in a <b>potatoe</b> locker, in the government house. I saw tables set, and eggs in the cups, but no inhabitant. Our orders were of the most severe kind, not to plunder, {{and we did not}} touch a morsel of food even. The liquor, however, was too much for our poor natures, and a parcel of us had broke bulk in a better sort of grocery, when some officers came in and stove the casks. I made sail, {{and got out of the}} company. The army had gone in pursuit of the enemy, with {{the exception of}} a few riflemen, who, being now at liberty, found their way into the place.|$|E
6000|$|The {{first seven}} oysters I examined, {{contained}} nothing but seed pearl, and {{not many of}} these. Neb opened, and I examined; and the latter occupation was so little to my taste, that I was just {{on the point of}} ordering the whole lot thrown overboard, when Neb handed me another. This oyster contained nine beautiful pearls, of very uniform dimensions, and each about as large as a good-sized pea. I dropped them into a bowl of fresh water, whence they came out sweet, pearly, and lustrous. They were of the sort known as the [...] "white water," [...] which is the kind most prized among Christian nations, doubtless on account of their harmonizing so well with the skins of their women. No sooner was my luck known, than it brought all the other [...] "pearl fishermen" [...] around me; Marble, with his nostrils plugged with oakum, and a quid of tobacco in his mouth, that was as large as a small <b>potatoe.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “The Irishman is a {{political}} writer, and {{goes by the name}} of My Lord [...] <b>Potatoe.</b> He wrote a pamphlet in vindication of a minister, hoping [...] his zeal would be rewarded with some place or pension; but finding [...] himself neglected in that quarter, he whispered about that the [...] pamphlet was written by the minister himself, and he published an [...] answer to his own production. In this he addressed the author under [...] the title of ‘your lordship’, with such solemnity, that the public [...] swallowed the deceit, and bought up the whole impression. The wise [...] politicians of the metropolis declared they were both masterly [...] performances, and chuckled over the flimsy reveries of an ignorant [...] garreteer, as the profound speculations of a veteran statesman, [...] acquainted with all the secrets of the cabinet. The imposture was [...] detected in the sequel, and our Hibernian pamphleteer retains no [...] part of his assumed importance but the bare title of ‘my lord’, and [...] {{the upper part of the}} table at the potatoe-ordinary in Shoe Lane.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{take it you}} be a {{stranger}} in these parts, sir, or else you would know that it's as easy for a miner {{to speak to a}} mainmaster, as it is for me to pick coal with this here clay. Sir, there's a gulf atween 'em. I went into the pit when I was five year old, and I count forty year in the service come Martinmas, and a very good age, sir, for a man what does his work, and I knows what I'm speaking about. In forty year, sir, a man sees a pretty deal, 'specially when he don't move out of the same spot and keeps his 'tention. I've been at play, sir, several times in forty year, and have seen as great stick-outs as ever happened in this country. I've seen the people at play for weeks together, and so clammed that I never tasted nothing but a <b>potatoe</b> and a little salt for more than a fortnight. Talk of tommy, that was hard fare, but we were holding out for our rights, and that's sauce for any gander. And I'll tell you what, sir, that I never knew the people play yet, but if a word had passed atween them and the main-masters aforehand, it might not have been settled; but you can't get at them any way. Atween the poor man and the gentleman there never was no connection, and that's the wital mischief of this country.|$|E
6000|$|The whole {{party had}} {{gathered}} to the windows, while the discourse was proceeding, and looking out, each individual saw Mike and his friend, {{in the situation}} described by Maud. The two amateurs-- connoisseurs would not be misapplied, either--had seated themselves at {{the brink of a}} spring of delicious water, and removing the corn-cob that Pliny the younger had felt it to be classical to affix to the nozzle of a quart jug, had, some time before, commenced the delightful recreation of sounding the depth, not of the spring, but of the vessel. As respects the former, Mike, who was a wag in his way, had taken a hint from a practice said to be common in Ireland, called [...] "potatoe and point," [...] which means to eat the <b>potatoe</b> and point at the butter; declaring that [...] "rum and p'int" [...] was every bit as entertaining as a [...] "p'int of rum." [...] On this principle, then, with a broad grin on a face that opened from ear to ear whenever he laughed, the county Leitrim-man would gravely point his finger at the water, in a sort of mock-homage, and follow up the movement with such a suck at the nozzle, as, aided by the efforts of Nick, soon analyzed the upper half of the liquor that had entered by that very passage. All this time, conversation did not flag, and, as the parties grew warm, confidence increased, though reason sensibly diminished. As a part of this discourse will have some bearing on what is to follow, it may be in place to relate it, here.|$|E
60|$|The affection of {{this woman}} became matter of suspicion, not indeed to the Laird, who was never hasty in suspecting evil, but to his wife, who had {{indifferent}} health and poor spirits. She was now far advanced in a second pregnancy, and, as she could not walk abroad herself, {{and the woman who}} attended upon Harry was young and thoughtless, she prayed Dominie Sampson to undertake the task of watching the boy in his rambles, when he should not be otherwise accompanied. The Dominie loved his young charge, and was enraptured with his own success in having already brought him so far in his learning as to spell words of three syllables. The idea of this early prodigy of erudition being carried off by the gipsies, like a second Adam Smith,[Footnote: The father of Economical Philosophy was, when a child, actually carried off by gipsies, and remained some hours in their possession.] was not to be tolerated; and accordingly, though the charge was contrary to all his habits of life, he readily undertook it, and might be seen stalking about with a mathematical problem in his head, and his eye upon a child of five years old, whose rambles led him into a hundred awkward situations. Twice was the Dominie chased by a cross-grained cow, once he fell into the brook crossing at the stepping-stones, and another time was bogged up to the middle in the slough of Lochend, in attempting to gather a water-lily for the young Laird. It was the opinion of the village matrons who relieved Sampson on the latter occasion, 'that the Laird might as weel trust the care o' his bairn to a <b>potatoe</b> bogle'; but the good Dominie bore all his disasters with gravity and serenity equally imperturbable. 'Pro-di-gi-ous!' was the only ejaculation they ever extorted from the much-enduring man.|$|E
60|$|This lawn is {{the sloping}} one {{approaching}} the kitchen-garden, and was {{made out of}} it. Hundreds of times have I here watched the dancing of shadows amid a press of sunshine, and other beautiful appearances of light and shade, flowers and shrubs. What a contrast between this and the cabbages and onions and carrots that used to grow there {{on a piece of}} ugly-shaped unsightly ground! No reflection, however, either upon cabbages or onions. The latter, we know, were worshipped by the Egyptians; and he must have a poor eye for beauty who has not observed how much of it there is in the form and colour which cabbages and plants of this genus exhibit through the various stages of their growth and decay. A richer display of colour in vegetable nature can scarcely be conceived than Coleridge, my sister, and I saw in a bed of <b>potatoe</b> plants in blossom near a hut upon the moor between Inversneyd and Loch Katrine. These blossoms were of such extraordinary beauty and richness that no one could have passed them without notice. But the sense must be cultivated through the mind before we can perceive those inexhaustible treasures of Nature--for such they truly are--without the least necessary reference to the utility of her productions, or even to the laws whereupon, as we learn by research, they are dependent. Some are of opinion that the habit of analysing, decomposing, and anatomising, is inevitably unfavourable to the perception of beauty. People are led into this mistake by overlooking the fact that such processes being to a certain extent within the reach of a limited intellect, we are apt to ascribe to them that insensibility of which they are in truth the effect, and not the cause. Admiration and love, to which all knowledge truly vital must tend, are felt by men of real genius in proportion as their discoveries in Natural Philosophy are enlarged; and the beauty in form of a plant or an animal is not made less but more apparent as a whole by a more accurate insight into its constituent properties and powers. A Savant, who is not also a poet in soul and a religionist in heart, is a feeble and unhappy creature.|$|E
