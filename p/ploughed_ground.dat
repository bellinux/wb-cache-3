"Our man was {{out with}} the waggoner and the plough in the field nearest to the house, and as he was leading the team round to begin a fresh furrow, he saw, through the gap of the gate, what for anybody else {{would have been a}} mere flutter of {{something}} white. But he had straight-glancing, quick, far-reaching eyes, that only seemed to flinch and lose their amazing power before the immensity of the sea. He was barefooted, and looking as outlandish as the heart of Swaffer could desire. Leaving the horses on the turn, to the inexpressible disgust of the waggoner he bounded off, going over the <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground</b> in long leaps, and suddenly appeared before the mother, thrust the child into her arms, and strode away.|$|E

60|$|The {{spot was}} seldom visited by a pedestrian, except {{perhaps in the}} {{shooting}} season. The rarity of human intrusion was evidenced by the mazes of rabbit-runs, the feathers of shy birds, the exuviæ of reptiles; as also by the well-worn paths of squirrels {{down the sides of}} trunks, and thence horizontally away. The fact of the plantation being an island {{in the midst of an}} arable plain sufficiently accounted for this lack of visitors. Few unaccustomed to such places can be aware of the insulating effect of <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground,</b> when no necessity compels people to traverse it. This rotund hill of trees and brambles, standing in the centre of a ploughed field of some ninety or a hundred acres, was probably visited less frequently than a rock would have been visited in a lake of equal extent.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{not without}} a {{dramatic}} emotion that one reads in the Parliamentary Debates of this Wednesday evening 'past seven o'clock,' the scene with the military fugitives from Longwi. Wayworn, dusty, disheartened, these poor men enter the Legislative, about sunset or after; give the most pathetic detail of the frightful pass they were in:--Prussians billowing round by the myriad, volcanically spouting fire for fifteen hours: we, scattered sparse on the ramparts, hardly a cannoneer to two guns; our dastard Commandant Lavergne no where shewing face; the priming would not catch; there was no powder in the bombs,--what could we do? [...] "Mourir! Die!" [...] answer prompt voices; (Hist. Parl. xvii. 148.) and the dusty fugitives must shrink elsewhither for comfort.--Yes, Mourir, that is now the word. Be Longwi a proverb and a hissing among French strong-places: let it (says the Legislative) be obliterated rather, from the shamed face of the Earth;--and so there has gone forth Decree, that Longwi shall, were the Prussians once out of it, 'be rased,' and exist only as <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
60|$|The midnight {{hour for}} which there has been {{occasion}} to wait at length arrives, and I journey towards the stronghold in obedience to a request urged earlier in the day. It concerns an appointment, which I rather regret my decision to keep now that night is come. The route thither is hedgeless and treeless--I need not add deserted. The moonlight is sufficient to disclose the pale riband-like surface {{of the way as}} it trails along between the expanses of darker fallow. Though the road passes near the fortress it does not conduct directly to its fronts. As the place is without an inhabitant, so it is without a trackway. So presently leaving the macadamized road to pursue its course elsewhither, I step off upon the fallow, and plod stumblingly across it. The castle looms out off the shade by degrees, like a thing waking up and asking what I want there. It is now so enlarged by nearness that its whole shape cannot be taken in at one view. The <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground</b> ends as the rise sharpens, the sloping basement of grass begins, and I climb upward to invade Mai-Dun.|$|E

6000|$|The rural newspaper! We {{sit with}} it in hand, running our fingers over the big staring letters, as over {{the black and white}} keys of a piano, {{drumming}} out of them a mild melody of perfect repose. With what delight do we disport us in the illimitable void of its nothingness, as who should swim in air! Here is nothing to startle-nothing to wound. The very atmosphere is saturated with [...] "the spirit of the rural press;" [...] and even our dog stands by, with pendant tail, slowly dropping the lids over his great eyes; and then, jerking them suddenly up again, tries to look as if he were not sleepy in the least. A pleasant smell of <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground</b> comes strong upon us. The tinkle of ghostly cow-bells falls drowsily upon the ear. Airy figures of phenomenal esculents float dreamily before our half-shut eyes, and vanish ere perfect vision can catch them. About and above are the drone of bees, and the muffled thunder of milk streams shooting into the foaming pail. The gabble of distant geese is faintly marked off by the bark of a distant dog. The city with its noises sinks away from our feet as from one in a balloon, and our senses are steeped in country languor. We slumber.|$|E
60|$|There is not {{a single}} spot of land in either of these {{countries}} from which mountains are not discernible; almost always they form the principal feature of the scenery. The mountain outlines seen from Sparta, Corinth, Athens, Rome, Florence, Pisa, Verona, are of consummate beauty; and whatever dislike or contempt may be traceable {{in the mind of the}} Greeks for mountain ruggedness, their placing the shrine of Apollo under the cliffs of Delphi, and his throne upon Parnassus, was a testimony to all succeeding time that they themselves attributed the best part of their intellectual inspiration to the power of the hills. Nor would it be difficult to show that every great writer of either of those nations, however little definite regard he might manifest for the landscape of his country, had been mentally formed and disciplined by it, so that even such enjoyment as Homer's of the <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground</b> and poplar groves owes its intensity and delicacy to the excitement of the imagination produced, without his own consciousness, by other and grander features of the scenery to which he had been accustomed from a child; and differs in every respect from the tranquil, vegetative, and prosaic affection with which the same ploughed land and poplars would be regarded by a native of the Netherlands.|$|E
60|$|What the Goorkhas and the English did {{will be seen}} later on. The {{heavy work}} lay with the horses, for {{they had to go}} far and pick their way clear of habitations. Many of the troopers were natives of that part of the world, ready and anxious to fight against their kin, and some of the {{officers}} had made private and unofficial excursions into those hills before. They crossed the border, found a dried river bed, cantered up that, waited through a stony gorge, risked crossing a low hill under cover of the darkness, skirted another hill, leaving their hoof-marks deep in some <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground,</b> felt their way along another watercourse, ran over the neck of a spur, praying that no one would hear their horses grunting, and so worked on in the rain and the darkness, till they had left Bersund and its crater of hills a little behind them, and to the left, {{and it was time to}} swing round. The ascent commanding the back of Bersund was steep, and they halted to draw breath in a broad level valley below the height. That is to say, the men reined up, but the horses, blown as they were, refused to halt. There was unchristian language, the worse for being delivered in a whisper, and you heard the saddles squeaking in the darkness as the horses plunged.|$|E

6000|$|It was in March, bitterly cold, with an east wind {{which had}} been blowing many days, and {{overhead}} the sky was of a hard, steely grey. I was cycling along {{the valley of the}} Ebble, and finally leaving it pushed up a long steep slope and set off over the high plain by a dusty road with the wind hard against me. A more desolate scene than the one before me {{it would be hard to}} imagine, for the land was all ploughed and stretched away before me, an endless succession of vast grey fields, divided by wire fences. On all that space there was but one living thing in sight, a human form, a boy, far away on the left side, standing in the middle of a big field with something which looked like a gun in his hand. Immediately after I saw him he, too, appeared to have caught sight of me, for turning he set off running as fast as he could over the <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground</b> towards the road, as if intending to speak to me. The distance he would have to run was about a quarter of a mile and I doubted that he would be there in time to catch me, but he ran fast and the wind was against me, and he arrived at the road just as I got to that point. There by the side of the fence he stood, panting from his race, his handsome face glowing with colour, a boy about twelve or thirteen, with a fine strong figure, remarkably well dressed for a bird-scarer. For that was what he was, and he carried a queer, heavy-looking old gun. I got off my wheel and waited for him to speak, but he was silent, and continued regarding me with the smiling countenance of one well pleased with himself. [...] "Well?" [...] I said, but there was no answer; he only kept on smiling.|$|E

50|$|Conventionally, fieldwalking in grids {{or along}} lines called transects has formed the {{backbone}} of archaeological survey fieldwork, at least where visibility is fairly good. A single researcher or team will walk slowly through the target area looking for artifacts or other archaeological indicators on the surface, often recording aspects of the environment at the time. The method works best on either <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground</b> or surfaces with little vegetation. On ploughed surfaces, as the soil is turned regularly artifacts will move to the top. Erosion and soil loss on uncultivated and lightly vegetated soil (e.g., in semi-arid environments) may cause artifacts to also 'rise' to the surface.|$|E

40|$|With {{the extra}} runway at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, {{introduced}} in 2003, the noise nuisance for local residents increased {{due to increased}} groundnoise. In a case study the effect of enhanced ground absorption on the propagation of low-frequency noise from aircraft ground operations, e. g. departing aircraft, has been investigated. The study was initiated by Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, and has been performed by TNO and Alterra. By means of ground impedance measurements, performed at areas of 200 by 200 m near the runway, it was demonstrated that a <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground</b> surface shows an increased ground absorption compared to an unprocessed ground surface. The frequencies of interest are mainly in the 31 and 63 Hz octave bands. Further, is has been shown numerically that for propagation distances up to 3 km from the runway a noise reduction of 5 to 10 dB can be achieved if such a <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground</b> is employed. This reduction occurs for downwind conditions when the sound levels are highest. The study {{has contributed to the}} discussion of the airport and the residents in their search for a solution and {{to the understanding of the}} effects of airborne groundnoise...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in the restoration of blanket bogs that were afforested during the 1960 s to 1980 s, to avoid further loss of carbon to the atmosphere and to regain and defragment important blanket bog habitat. This paper reports the findings from a ten-year experiment in the UK to test the effectiveness of restoration treatments on water table depth, peat bulk density and water content, ground surface height and vegetation development. Treatments used were the six combinations of damming or not damming plough furrows with leaving the trees alive, felling and leaving {{them on the ground}} or felling and removing them. Combining felling with damming furrows was most successful in raising the water table, whether or not the felled trees were removed. Only where felling was combined with damming did the water table continue to recover between Years 5 and 10. Over ten years, the water level in these treatments rose to slightly below that of non-afforested reference bog at the same sites. This occurred as a rapid initial rise, following which there was only very slight further improvement. Felling caused the species composition of the vegetation to change towards that of the reference bogs. The process was slow, with the vegetation becoming more dissimilar to non-forested reference bog in the first five years and then becoming more similar to the reference bog after Year 5. Surprisingly, damming plough furrows had little effect on the vegetation except that, in combination with felling, it increased differentiation between the plough furrows and other positions on the <b>ploughed</b> <b>ground.</b> Conifer seedlings established on the restored plots, most densely where they adjoined standing forest, and had similar density and growth in all the felled treatments. The restoration treatments resulted in a decrease in bulk density and increase in water content of the upper peat, probably due to an unloading effect caused by the raised water table buoying up the drained peat layer. In some treatments this was amplified by removal of the weight of the trees. Damming the plough furrows caused a 5 – 7 cm rise in ground surface height, suggesting that subsidence resulting from primary consolidation and secondary compression is at least partly reversible...|$|E

Initially, the actual evaporation (precipitation minus streamflow) of the Cwm catchment declined rapidly relative to the Delyn, due to the disruption of the vegetation by <b>ploughing</b> the <b>ground</b> in preparation for planting the trees.
