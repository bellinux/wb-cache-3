40|$|Abstract: Tool <b>presetter</b> {{is a type}} of {{precision}} measuring instrument that associates to CNC machine tools and machining centers, which integrates the technologies of optics, mechanics and electrics all together, and its measuring accuracy gives direct influence on machining accuracy of CNC machines. The main factors that influence measuring accuracy of tool <b>presetter</b> include: image edge detection, image positioning and accuracy of its mechanical system. This paper gives analysis on these main factors and puts forward three newly developed algorithms for improving measuring accuracy of tool <b>presetter.</b> First algorithm is image edge detection algorithm based on subpixel that increases the edge positioning accuracy by more than 10 times. Second one is uniformity compensation algorithm for whole view measurement that is able to capture accurate real pixel size so that image movement is more precise, which further increases the measuring accuracy. The third one is linear compensation algorithm in the measuring space that makes effective compensation to the mechanical system errors, which can compensate any position in measurement space so that system accuracy increases significantly. These algorithms are tested in CoVis software and the results show that the total measuring accuracy of tool <b>presetter</b> is improved dramtically to 2 μm...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of contact and non-contact measurements of external profiles of selected grinding pins. The measurements were conducted in order to choose the appropriate measuring technique {{in the case of the}} considered measurement task. In the case of contact measurements the coordinate measuring machine ACCURA II was applied. The used coordinate measuring machine was equipped with the contact scanning probe VAST XT and the Calypso inspection software. Contact coordinate measurements were performed by using of different measurement strategies. The applied strategies included different scanning velocities and distances between measured points. Non-contact measurements were conducted by means of the tool <b>presetter</b> produced by the Mahr company. On the basis of gained results the guidelines concerning measurements of grinding pins were formulated. The measurements of analyzed grinding pins performed by means of the non-contact measuring system are characterized by higher reproducibility than the contact measurements. The low reproducibility of contact measurements may be connected with the inaccuracy of the selected coordinate measuring machine and the measuring probe, the measurement parameters and environmental conditions in the laboratory where the coordinate measuring machine is located. Moreover, the paper {{presents the}} possible application of results of conducted investigations. The results of non-contact measurements can be used in the simulation studies of grinding processes. The simulations may reduce the costs of machining processes...|$|E
40|$|The magic key in any {{commercial}} transaction is {{to satisfy the}} customer 2 ̆ 7 s requirements. In the color separation market the customer 2 ̆ 7 s expectations are consistency in the product, and films that when printed will reproduce a clean visual match to the original copy. The variables that affect the quality, consistency, and productivity for the color separation process, were reviewed. The result of this review was that the operator 2 ̆ 7 s scanner set-up for tone reproduction is the most critical variable in the process. An estimate of the total cost in the United States caused by rescans due to inconsistency of the scanner set-up gave the result of 462, 852, 000 per year. One {{solution to the problem}} of inconsistency of the scanner set-up seems to be the use of pre-scan systems. The pre-scan system helps the scanner operator determinate the optimum tone reproduction for each color separation. A review of the related literature described seven <b>presetter</b> and seven presetter/previewer systems. To test pre-scan effectiveness the DuPont Image Manager was used to produce the suggested scanner set-up using a computerized method for the tone reproduction determination with very little operator assistance. This study answered the research question, does the DuPont Image Manager improve the quality, consistency, and productivity of color separations made on a Hell DC 399 Scanner? The Hell DC 399 scanner was used. Two hypotheses, and the experimental design are presented. The experiment produced color separations using the judgment of three experienced and three inexperienced scanner operators, and by using the pre-scan system. With the films obtained, Cromalin color proofs were made. Judges evaluated the proofs using pair comparison to study the quality consistency improvement. To study the productivity, the average time required for the scanner set-up using both methods was measured, using the scanner operator 2 ̆ 7 s judgment and the DuPont Image Manager. The results of the study yielded the following conclusions: the overall visual preference of color separations was higher when the scanner is set-up according to the Du Pont Image Manager instructions by experienced or inexperienced scanner operators. The Du Pont Image Manager produces an improvement in the productivity of setting up a scanner in a ratio of 45...|$|E
