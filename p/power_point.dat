5|$|Solar panels produce {{direct current}} (DC) electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to alternating current (AC), {{which is the}} form transmitted by the electricity grid. This conversion is done by inverters. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each solar array string close to its peak <b>power</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
25|$|The maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> of a {{photovoltaic}} {{varies with}} incident illumination. For example, accumulation of dust on photovoltaic panels reduces the maximum <b>power</b> <b>point.</b> For systems {{large enough to}} justify the extra expense, a maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> tracker tracks the instantaneous power by continually measuring the voltage and current (and hence, power transfer), and uses this information to dynamically adjust the load so the maximum power is always transferred, regardless {{of the variation in}} lighting.|$|E

50|$|Spells are {{purchased}} {{in this stage}} as well, each spell is purchased as a separate skill. Several professions have a Professional Sphere of spells, and any character may purchase spells from the Universal Sphere. Spells are <b>powered</b> by <b>Power</b> <b>Points,</b> {{and in order to}} be able to cast a spell, a character must have a rank in that spell equal to the <b>power</b> <b>points</b> needed. Spells can be scaled upwardly, thereby increasing the required <b>power</b> <b>points</b> and skill ranks needed to cast the scaled version of the spell.|$|R
25|$|Several {{companies}} have begun embedding power optimizers into PV modules called smart modules. These modules perform maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> tracking (MPPT) for each module individually, measure performance data for monitoring, and provide additional safety features. Such modules can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across {{a section of}} a module causes the electrical output {{of one or more}} strings of cells in the module to decrease.|$|E
25|$|A {{solar cell}} may operate {{over a wide}} range of {{voltages}} (V) and currents (I). By increasing the resistive load on an irradiated cell continuously from zero (a short circuit) to a very high value (an open circuit) one can determine the maximum <b>power</b> <b>point,</b> the point that maximizes VI; that is, the load for which the cell can deliver maximum electrical power at that level of irradiation. (The output power is zero in both the short circuit and open circuit extremes).|$|E
25|$|Sticks: Sticks are the {{analogue}} to guns in {{the world}} of Derlavai. A stick emits a beam of energy which leaves behind a sharp scent like that of a nearby lightning strike. A soldier's stick is a large device and is activated when bare flesh such as an uncovered finger is inserted into its 'blazing hole'. The beam from a soldier's stick can burn a hole through a person with little difficulty, although they are largely ineffective against dragons and behemoths, which are not only naturally tough but also armored or painted silver to reflect beams. Smaller sticks are seen owned by civilians for blazing vermin or hunting game, or used by constables. Larger sticks, known as heavy sticks, are carried by behemoths on the battlefield, and can blaze through several men, another behemoth's armor or even take down dragons. Even larger heavy sticks can be used as fixed installations on the ground, used for air and sea defense, and carried on ley-line warships for use against ships, dragons and leviathans. Portable sticks used away from a <b>power</b> <b>point</b> or ley line require periodic recharging, which can be achieved in some unspecified way through the delivery of what is only described as 'charges' in supply wagons, or by the interventions of a mage drawing energy from a <b>power</b> <b>point</b> or sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|Crystals: Described {{as smooth}} spheres of glass, {{crystals}} are imbued with spells which {{allow them to}} be used for communication, and thus take the place of radios in the world. If operated away from a <b>power</b> <b>point</b> or ley line, they require regular recharging by some other means, which in one instance in the series involves the sacrifice of captive humans for their life energy which is used to power the crystal. Crystals can operate as videophones, showing an image of the person at the other end, as well as in audio-only mode. The emanations by which speech and images are transmitted between them are subject to interception by other mages, something {{at the forefront of the}} minds of most military planners in the series.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a mention}} of the Kuusamans rapidly {{building}} a new port in a newly conquered island by magic, which is evident from all buildings being the same (indicating that the spells made extensive use {{of the law of}} similarity). It is noted that only a country with many skilled mages could have spared the resources for such construction. In another place it is noted that printing is usually done by mechanical means, but the Valmieren resistance utilises magic for reproducing a propaganda sheet in order to avoid detection by the occupying authorities. The result of this magical duplication is readable, but the ink smudges easily as it was produced without the aid of a <b>power</b> <b>point</b> or an experienced mage.|$|E
25|$|The role of U.S. General David Petraeus {{and others}} in Iraq {{suggests}} a continued need for proconsular leadership, according to Lord. Modern technology makes communication easier than ever. But as email and <b>Power</b> <b>Point</b> presentations proliferate, clarity and intellectual discipline is lost. Another factor is that civilian policymakers, whether on the spot or in the metropole, may lack {{the skills needed to}} manage military forces. Yet proconsuls are at best an ad hoc solution to a reoccurring problem. Managing a large territory in occupation or conflict requires a range of skills and the ability to deal with various organizations. No one is trained as a proconsul and the available administrators have experience in at most one relevant agency or service. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. attempted to deal with this issue by creating an integrated civilian-military command structure called Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS).|$|E
25|$|Magic in the Darkness {{series is}} not created by mages but rather {{harnessed}} by them. The mages of Derlavai gather magical {{power from the}} various <b>power</b> <b>points</b> scattered around the planet and the ley lines which link them, a recent discovery made only 200 years {{before the start of}} the books. Mages can also gather magic from human sacrifice. As such, the operation of magic is heavily reliant on location. Large, modern cities tend to be located on or near strong <b>power</b> <b>points</b> which provide the energy for the operation of the city's lighting, heating and other comforts. In addition, large <b>power</b> <b>points</b> tend to be linked to greater numbers of ley lines, which are utilised for transportation between cities and towns.|$|R

By this definition, points inside the circle have negative <b>power,</b> <b>points</b> outside have positive <b>power,</b> and <b>points</b> on the circle have zero <b>power.</b> For external <b>points,</b> the <b>power</b> equals {{the square of the}} length of a tangent from the point to the circle.

25|$|In M, {{characters}} are awarded <b>Power</b> <b>Points</b> (similar to experience points) {{that can do}} many beneficial things for the character. As described above, <b>Power</b> <b>Points</b> (abbreviated pp.) are used to purchase powers, feats, skills, abilities, and devices. The specific nature of <b>Power</b> <b>Points</b> was changed drastically with the 2nd edition (2e) of Mutants & Masterminds. In the first edition, when a character accrues 15 pp, they advance a Power Level, thus raising the caps on power and skill ranks, {{as well as on}} power bonus stacking. There were options to keep the Power Level the same while increasing total number of points (and many sample antagonists in the Game Master setting have more <b>points</b> than their <b>Power</b> Level would suggest), but these have been incorporated into the 2nd edition rules.|$|R
25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and parallel circuits or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|E
