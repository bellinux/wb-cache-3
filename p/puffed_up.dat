5|$|One {{recorded}} case of courtship behavior involving curve-billed thrashers describes two males attacking {{each other}} vigorously and resorting to purring and hissings sounds when neither bird appeared to relent. The two males then <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> their chests and strutted {{up and down}} in front of the female. They continued to alternate between purr and hiss and fighting one another until one triumphed. The victor flew towards the female and both chirped melodically before copulation.|$|E
25|$|Some authors, such as Heather Streets, {{argue that}} the {{military}} authorities <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> {{the images of the}} martial soldiers by writing regimental histories, and by extolling the kilted Scots, kukri-wielding Gurkhas and turbaned Sikhs in numerous paintings. Richard Schultz, an American author, has claimed the martial race concept as a supposedly clever British effort to divide and rule the people of India for their own political ends.|$|E
500|$|Castle Rising {{was built}} soon after 1138 by William d'Aubigny II, an {{upwardly}} mobile Anglo-Norman noble {{who owned the}} surrounding manor of Snettisham. William married Adeliza of Louvain, the widow of King Henry I in that year, and became the Earl of Arundel in 1139. This transformed his social position, and one chronicler at Waltham Holy Cross complained how he [...] "became intolerably <b>puffed</b> <b>up...</b> and looked down upon every other eminence in the world except the King". With his new wealth, William built Castle Rising and New Buckenham Castle in Norfolk, and expanded Arundel Castle in West Sussex.|$|E

500|$|Each {{group is}} {{introduced}} {{with a general}} essay. This is followed by an article, sometimes of many pages, on each animal (or other item). The article on the wolf begins with the claim that {{it is one of}} the animals with a specially strong appetite for flesh; it asserts that the animal is naturally coarse and cowardly (grossier et poltron), but becoming crafty at need, and hardy by necessity, driven by hunger. The language, as in this instance, is elegant and elaborate, even [...] "flowery and ornate". Buffon was roundly criticised by his fellow academics for writing a [...] "purely popularizing work, empty and <b>puffed</b> <b>up,</b> with little real scientific value".|$|E
500|$|Later {{that same}} month, in January 1919, after Weber and Weber's party were {{defeated}} for election, Weber delivered {{one of his}} greatest academic lectures, [...] "Politics as a Vocation", which was a reflection on the inherent violence and dishonesty found among the politicians, a profession in which only recently Weber was so personally active. [...] About the nature of politicians, he concluded that [...] "In {{nine out of ten}} cases they are windbags <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> with hot air about themselves. They are not in touch with reality, and they do not feel the burden they need to shoulder; they just intoxicate themselves with romantic sensations." ...|$|E

In an interview with Sondheim for The Legacy Project, composer-lyricist Adam Guettel (son of Mary Rodgers and grandson of Richard Rodgers) recalls how as a 14-year-old boy he showed Sondheim his work. Guettel was [...] "crestfallen" [...] since he had come in [...] "sort of all <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> thinking [...] would be rained with compliments and things", which {{was not the case}} since Sondheim had some [...] "very direct things to say." [...] Later, Sondheim wrote and apologized to Guettel for being [...] "not very encouraging" [...] when he was actually trying to be [...] "constructive".|$|E
2500|$|Smukler {{enrolled}} in the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, and played fullback under Frank Carideo. He left before the year ended and continued to learn glove cutting under his brother Lewis. In September 1933 Smukler transferred to Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was chosen to play varsity fullback by Glenn “Pop” Warner one year later. After Smukler helped the Temple Owls achieve many wins, Warner stated, “He is a better fullback now than Ernie Nevers was in Nevers’s sophomore year. Dave is the best sophomore fullback I have ever seen. He may become the greatest fullback I have ever seen, a greater football player than Nevers or Jim Thorpe.” The coach also commended him as a defensive player, kicker, and forward passer, stating that “he combines fine judgment with his versatility. [...] He is not the type that will get <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> by praise, either.” Smukler played five consecutive games without ever letting the ball slip from his hand.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the more}} thoroughgoing of the multitudinous {{attempts}} {{to apply the}} principles of cosmic evolution, or what {{are supposed to be}} such, to social and political problems, which have appeared of late years, a considerable proportion appear to me to be based upon the notion that human society is competent to furnish, from its own resources, an administrator of the kind I have imagined. The pigeons, in short, are to be their own Sir John Sebright. A despotic government, whether individual or collective, is to be endowed with the preternatural intelligence, and with what, I am afraid, many will consider the preternatural ruthlessness, required for the purpose of carrying out the principle of improvement by selection, with the somewhat drastic thoroughness upon which the success of the method depends. [...] Experience certainly does not justify us in limiting the ruthlessness of individual [...] "saviors of society"; and, on the well-known grounds of the aphorism which denies both body and soul to corporations, it seems probable (indeed the belief is not without support in history) that a collective despotism, a mob got to believe in its own divine right by demagogic missionaries, would be capable of more thorough work in this direction than any single tyrant, <b>puffed</b> <b>up</b> with the same illusion, has ever achieved. [...] But intelligence is another affair. The fact that [...] "saviors of society" [...] take to that trade is evidence enough that they have none to spare. And such as they possess is generally sold to the capitalists of physical force on whose resources they depend. However, I doubt whether even the keenest judge of character, if he had before him a hundred boys and girls under fourteen, could pick out, with the least chance of success, those who should be kept, as certain to be serviceable members of the polity, and those who should be chloroformed, as equally sure to be stupid, idle, or vicious. The [...] "points" [...] of a good or of a bad citizen are really far harder to discern than those of a puppy or a short-horn calf; many do not show themselves before the practical difficulties of life stimulate manhood to full exertion. And by that time the mischief is done. The evil stock, if it be one, has had time to multiply, and selection is nullified.|$|E
