In 1996, Guzm√°n reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E
5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints {{tend to be}} long and lean, modern breed <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined, {{and there is a}} trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E
5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, {{we can imagine}} that, for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as an}} eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E
40|$|Models {{of habitat}} <b>preference</b> <b>are</b> widely used to {{quantify}} animal-habitat relationships, {{to describe and}} predict differential space use by animals, and to identify habitat {{that is important to}} an animal (i. e. that is assumed to influence fitness). Quantifying habitat preference involves the statistical comparison of samples of habitat use and availability. <b>Preference</b> <b>is</b> therefore contingent upon both of these samples. The inferences that can be made from use versus availability designs are influenced by subjectivity in defining what is available to the animal, the problem of quantifying the accessibility of available resources and the framework in which <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> modelled. Here, we describe these issues, document the conditional nature of preference and establish the limits of inferences that can be drawn from these analyses. We argue that <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> not interpretable as reflecting the intrinsic behavioural motivations of the animal, that estimates of <b>preference</b> <b>are</b> not directly comparable among different samples of availability and that <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily correlated with the value of habitat to the animal. We also suggest that <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> context-dependent and that functional responses in preference resulting from changing availability are expected. We conclude by describing advances in analytical methods that begin to resolve these issues...|$|R

5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> used to reflect individual differences.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have either}} {{presently}} or formerly filled the ecological niches normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and grazing ungulates. With {{the diversity of}} adaptations for specific ecological niches, habitat selections among lemur families and some genera are often very distinct, thus minimizing competition. In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west, up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance. However, to endure the extreme dry season, {{three of the five}} species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely. Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in substrate preferences, forest strata used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches. A classic example involves resource partitioning between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, and the eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus). Each utilizes either different species of bamboo, different parts of the plant, or different layers in the forest. Nutrient and toxin content (such as cyanide) help regulate food selection, though seasonal food <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> also known to play a role.|$|E

However, the General Social Survey found that men were only slightly less likely than women to value short hours, and that preferences for particular job characteristics depended mostly on age, education, race, and other characteristics rather than on gender. In addition, other research has shown that men and women likely hold endogenous job preferences, meaning that their <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> due to the jobs they hold and those they have held in the past rather than related inherently to gender.
