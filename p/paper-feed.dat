50|$|The 5L, 6L; and 3100 and 3150 all had {{an issue}} with {{multiple}} <b>paper-feed</b> jams which was resolved via class action lawsuit, the remedy of which was to freely supply an easily insertable replacement pad. The free supply of the Replaceable Separation Pad Kit has since expired {{but they can be}} found on eBay.|$|E
50|$|Both on and {{off-line}} printers were impact printers, {{capable of}} printing {{a line of}} either 120 or 160 characters, depending on the model They were single type-face, no lower case. Fan fold paper for the printers was continuous, with perforations between the pages, and sprocket-holes at {{each side of the}} paper for the <b>paper-feed</b> mechanism. Custom paper sizes, with pre-printed lines/text/colours etc. were common, especially for applications like payroll, and small paper-tape control loops were needed to match page-throw size to each paper type.|$|E
50|$|Continuous {{stationery}} (UK) or continuous form paper (USA) is paper {{which is}} designed for use with dot-matrix and line printers with appropriate <b>paper-feed</b> mechanisms. Other names include fan-fold paper, sprocket-feed paper, burst paper, tractor-feed paper, and pin-feed paper. It can be single-ply (usually woodfree uncoated paper) or multi-ply (either with carbon paper between the paper layers, or multiple layers of carbonless copy paper), often described as multipart stationery or forms. Continuous stationery is often used when the final print medium is less critical {{in terms of the}} appearance at the edges, and when continuously connected individual sheets are not inconvenient for the application. Individual sheets can be separated at the perforation (leaving a slight serration), and sheets also have edges with punched holes, which also can be removed at the perforation (one typical format).|$|E

According to {{the reverse}} {{design for the}} motion law of the {{follower}} in the swing upward conjugated cam <b>paper-feeding</b> mechanism, the technological requirements of positive design for <b>paper-feeding</b> mechanism are obtained. The quintic polynomial is presented to simulate the motion law of the <b>paper-feeding</b> tooth, and the mathematic model of the profile for conjugated cam is established. The profile of conjugated cam based on an actual sample is calculated, and the feasibility of this method is validated. It has some reference to design similar products...|$|R
40|$|As {{the design}} {{complexity}} of cyber-physical systems continues to grow, modeling the system at higher abstraction levels with formal models of computation is increasingly appealing since it enables early design verification and analysis. However, {{it is very}} challenging to analyze and verify timing at the early design stages, as the design representation is still abstract and trade-offs {{have to be made}} between the performance requirements defined in terms of system functionality and the cost of the feasible architecture that can implement the functionality. In this work, we present Metronomy, a function-architecture co-simulation framework that integrates functional modeling from Ptolemy and architectural modeling from the MetroII environment via a mapping interface. Metronomy completely separates the function and architecture modeling. It allows the function and the architecture of the system to be modeled in the most suitable design environments. At the same time, Metronomy allows designers to do timing verification and design space exploration at early design stage by exploiting contract theory and co-simulation. Two case studies on an electrical power system and a <b>paper-feed</b> sub-system for a high speed printing press demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach...|$|E

With VB as the software platform, the parallel indexing cam contour was calculated, the contour mapping was also displayed, and the data was saved as required format. Then a three-dimensional entity of the parallel indexing cam mechanism is drawn up directly in SolidWorks in order to perform the 3 D parameterization design and motion emulation of the parallel indexing cam mechanism. This can help designers to find the problems, such as the rotation difficulties caused by excessive pressure angle, the motion distortion caused by small radius of curvature. So the designer can make modification in time to improve design quality and shorten the product development cycles. The software platform can select type of the interval splitter by calculating and selecting the power motor according to the input drive shaft angle and the output shaft such shares. The system could perform the transmission of information and share the information between subsystems, enhancing the degree of integration and automation of parallel indexing cam design and manufacture. A good software platform was developed for parallel indexing cam mechanismâ€™s design, manufacturing and performance studying. Finally, the example of interval <b>paper-feed</b> mechanism in an automatic die-cutting machine was verified the usability and effectiveness of the software platform...|$|E
