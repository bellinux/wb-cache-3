40|$|The {{effect of}} {{coagulation}} coupled with chlorination (i. e., pre-, inter-, and post-chlorination) on {{the formation of}} disinfection by-products (DBPs) and the removal efficiency of DBPs precursors were investigated. Compared with coagulation coupling with <b>pre-chlorination,</b> coagulation coupled with inter-chlorination could lead a higher removal efficiency of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) and chloroacetic acids formation potential (CAAsFP). The CAAsFP/DOC value of residual DOC showed that coagulation with inter-chlorination has a beneficial effect on CAAs precursors removal. More DBPs were produced during inter-chlorination than that of <b>pre-chlorination</b> at pH 7. 5, while less DBPs were produced during inter-chlorination than that of <b>pre-chlorination</b> at pH 5. 5. In addition, the precipitate of humic acid (HA) after coagulation was chlorinated to study the kinetics of chlorine decay. The results showed that coagulated-HA had a higher reactivity with chlorine than aqueous-HA at pH 7. 5. Furthermore, the trends of zeta potential during coagulation process suggested that the distribution of chlorine species had significant influence on the removing of DBPs precursors by coagulation coupled with chlorination.

Coagulation experiments were done using swamp raw water at Masaka National Water & Sewerage Corporation water treatment plant and pilot-scale filtration experiments carried out at Ggaba II (Kampala) water treatment plant. The results from the study indicated that there were both operational and design handicaps at the treatment plants in Kampala. There is need to modify the filtration and clarification units to enable production of water meeting both the national and international standards. At Masaka water treatment, there was increase in trihalomethanes concentration {{as a result of}} <b>pre-chlorination.</b> Following aeration and <b>pre-chlorination</b> processes, the average increase of total trihalomethanes concentration was over 4000 % with over 99 % being chloroform. Preliminary results from the jar test experiments indicated that use of alum with MOCSC as coagulant aid is promising as a first stage in the treatment train for waters with a humic materials and high content of iron, typical of swamp water sources. This would probably eliminate the formation of unwanted by-products by eliminating the <b>pre-chlorination</b> process. Assessment of the characteristics of the volcanic ash showed that it meets the requirements for a filtration material; and results obtained from the pilot study showed that it was a suitable alternative material for use in a dual media filtration system. There was an increase in the filter run length of about two and half fold in the dual media filtration column compared to the mono medium column. Both columns produced similar water quality levels. Therefore, conversion of the rapid sand filters at Ggaba and similar water treatment plants in the country to dual media (volcanic ash on top of sand) systems would probably significantly improve the performance of the filtration systems.

These water bodies receive drainage water containing large amount of nutrients, mostly from intensive agricultural practices, resulting in algal blooms, which have become a growing environmental problem. Conventional treatment used for surface water may not always produce satisfactory quality water in these situations. In addition, the increasing occurrence of toxins produced by cyanobacteria in such water bodies has become an important public health issue. “Eastern Coastal Towns of Ampara District (ECTAD) Water Supply Project”, where the raw water source is an irrigation tank with high inflows of nutrients was used as a case study. Coagulation, flocculation, dissolved air floatation (DAF), rapid gravity filtration and disinfection are the unit operations that have been designed and constructed, while <b>Pre-chlorination</b> and Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) adsorption are also currently used in this water treatment plant, which have been introduced to treat taste an odour problems encountered after commissioning the plant. The case study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of <b>pre-chlorination,</b> activated carbon adsorption, Dissolved Air Flotation, filtration and disinfection in removal of cyanotoxins, taste and odor causing dissolved organic substances and colour causing substances such as iron and manganese from the source water, in order to provide satisfactory potable water.

40|$|Many source {{waters in}} China are in {{high levels of}} natural organic matter (NOM) and bromide ion (Br-), and {{the control of the}} {{formation}} of regulated and non-regulated disinfection by-products (DBPs) is a great challenge. This study uses the natural water with substantial NOM and Br- from Weishan Lake to evaluate the formation and species transformation of DBPs in three disinfection scenarios of chlorination, chloramination, and chlorine-chloramine sequential treatment (Cl- 2 -NH 2 Cl process), and the reaction pathways involved are also proposed. Compared with chlorination, the formation of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids is reduced by 88 % and 85 % and by 68 % and 65 % in chloramination and Cl- 2 -NH 2 Cl process, respectively. During chloramination, the proportion of brominated-DBPs (Br-DBPs) is lower initially, and then increases afterwards due to the continuous reaction between NOM slow reactive sites and N-bromo amines. Additionally, the ratios of dihalogenated acetic acids to total organic halogen increase continuously from 4. 5 % to 6. 3 % with <b>pre-chlorination</b> and from 4. 3 % to 9. 8 % without <b>pre-chlorination.</b> The halonitriles (HANs) formation during chlorination is the most significant in the initial 30 min at the level of 6. 5 nM, and then decreases to 2. 5 nM after 72 h. During chloramination, however, the formation of HANs increases steadily with prolonged contact time. After 72 -h contact time, the level of HANs in Cl- 2 -NH 2 Cl process is 3. 9 and 2. 5 times of that in chlorination and chloramination, respectively. In Cl- 2 -NH 2 Cl process, HOCl rapidly oxidizes Br- to HOBr, and these two active species react with the fast reactive sites within NOM to form Br-DBPs and the intermediates for nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs). The subsequent introduction of ammonia inhibits the hydrolysis and oxidation of the formed N-DBPs and contributes to the most significant formation of N-DBPs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audiencePrechlorination {{is used in}} {{seawater}} desalination {{processes to}} control the biofouling in both thermal desalination plants and membrane desalination plants. A large diversity of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) is formed during seawater pretreatment processes using chlorination, including the regulated trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs) generally form in much smaller amounts than regulated DBPs, but have been a growing concern {{over the past decade}} because of their greater health risk. High levels of nitrogen-containing compounds in algal organic matter (AOM) can lead to the formation of significant quantities of N-DBPs during algal bloom events. Moreover, the presence of high concentrations of bromide and iodide ion in seawater favors the formation of brominated and iodinated byproducts that are often more toxic than their chlorinated analogues. The aim of this work is to assess the formation and the behavior of halogenated byproducts along the treatment train of full-scale desalination plants. In the first campaign of this work, one thermal multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) plant and one reverse osmosis (RO) plant were studied, both located on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia.

40|$|Although <b>pre-chlorination</b> {{has been}} widely applied to enhance the removal of algae, the {{mechanisms}} {{involved in the process}} have not been well illustrated. This study used Microcystis aeruginosa to investigate the effects of chlorination on the algae cells (i. e., surface charge, cell integrity, and release of intracellular organic matter (IOM)), and the subsequent influence on algae removal by alum coagulation. Though intracellular K+ and IOM released after the exposure of M. aeruginosa to chlorine, no considerable change in the morphology was observed for the majority of algae cells. This indicated the significance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the removal of algae, which consisted of released IOM and natural organic matter (NOM). Chlorine dose had a substantial impact on the concentration and characteristics of DOM, and accordingly on the optimum dosage range of alum for effective coagulation of algae cells. High molecular weight (MW) DOM aided the coagulation by favoring the formation of larger flocs and decreased the optimum alum doses to achieve the maximum removal of DOM. Released IOM also had high ratios of protein/IOM to form protein-alum complexes, which increased coagulant demand and inhibited the cross linking and clustering of alum-hydroxide polymers to disturb coagulation.

This plant-scale field study investigates the feasibility and technological strategies for process improvement for the Luwen (LW) DWTP, a typical plant with conventional processes employed to treat source water heavily polluted by natural organic matter (NOM). Originally, the LW DWTP exhibits DOC removal efficiency {{as low as}} 14. 4 % for filtration effluents; and CODMn concentrations continually exceed the required (< 3 mg/L) for half a year. High doses of chlorine during pre- and post-chlorination at this DWTP lead {{to the formation of}} high-level total tri-halomethane (TTHMs). Decreasing the dosages of chlorine during <b>pre-chlorination</b> from 3. 5 to 2 mg/L obviously inhibit TTHMs formation from 0. 98 to 0. 54 for influents of this plant, but showed limited efficiency for its effluents due to the high chlorine demand of this source water. The combined use of KMnO 4 and FeCl 3 significantly enhanced CODMn removal, and the removed CODMn quantity by coagulation increased from 0. 60 to 2. 22 mg/L whereas that by chlorination decreased from 1. 66 to 0. 67 mg/L. In other words, the contributive ratios of chlorination on CODMn removal decreased from 73. 5 % to 23. 2 %. This enhanced coagulation strategy also reduced the required dosages of chlorine from 6. 26 to 4. 85 mg/L, and the formation of TTHMs decreased by 24. 8 % accordingly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Despite its remarkable performance, under low oxygen over-stoichiometry, this oxide {{is prone to}} a certain extent to subsurface/bulk chlorination, which leads to deactivation. In situ Prompt Gamma Activation Analysis (PGAA) studies evidenced that the chlorination rate is independent of the <b>pre-chlorination</b> degree but increases at lower oxygen over-stoichiometry, while dechlorination is effective in oxygen-rich feeds, and its rate is higher for a more extensively pre-chlorinated ceria.

Higher temperature and p(O 2) led to enhanced OH coverage, reduced Cl coverage, and increased reactivity. Variation of p(HCl) gave rise to opposite correlations, while raising p(Cl 2) did not induce any measurable increase in the Cl coverage, despite the strong inhibition of the reaction rate.

The objective of the present review is to study the potential contamination, transport, fate, effect and control of blistering chemical warfare agents (CWAs), in the Kuwaiti desalination industry. In general, all the environmental factors involved in the aquatic degradation of CWAs in Kuwait marine environment except for the high salin-ity in case of blistering agents such as sulphur mustard, are in favor of a fast degrada-tion process. In case of massive releases of CWAs near the Kuwaiti shorelines, turbulence resulting from tidal cycles and high temperature will affect the dissolution process and extend the toxicity of the insoluble agent.

This study focused on the Luwen DWTP with conventional treatment processes, and used bench- and plant-scale tests to optimize chlorine-based disinfection for the control of total trihalomethane (TTHMs) and CODMn. In cases of <b>pre-chlorination</b> at 1. 3 mg/L, the post-chlorination at 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg/L of chlorine contributed to high TTHMs values of 0. 94, 1. 65, 2. 07, and 2. 21, respectively. At the same doses of total chlorine, the two-point chlorination formed less THMs than the one-point dosing strategy, although it was achieved at the expense of lowered CODMn removal efficiency. The combined use of chlorine and monochloramine greatly decreased THMs formation, and a more significant decrease of TTHMs was observed at shortened time intervals between dosing chlorine and ammonia. The post addition of ammonia in the Cl- 2 -NH 2 Cl process also impacted the incorporation of Br- into THMs and increased the ratios of brominated THMs (Br-THMs) to THMs by ceasing chlorine activity. The field study compared the levels of TTHMs, CODMn, ammonia, and residual chlorine in the treatment chain and the distribution systems among three disinfection scenarios of Cl- 2, NH 2 Cl, and Cl- 2 + Cl- 2 + NH 2 Cl. The Cl- 2 + Cl- 2 + NH 2 Cl process was better than the other two processes for the simultaneous control of THMs formation and CODMn. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Chlorination is {{the most}} common and {{successful}} method for disinfection of drinking water, especially in developing countries. However, due to the probability of formation of disinfection by-products especially Trihalomethanes (THMs) that are known as hazardous and usually carcinogenic compounds, this study was conducted to assess the investigation of THMs in drinking water of Abbas Abad water treatment plant in 2015. Methods: In this study, 81 water samples were gathered during autumn season of 2015. Temperature, pH, Ec, turbidity, and residual chlorine were measured on site. After samples preparation in the laboratory, THMs concentrations were determined using gas chromatography. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package. Results: The results showed that the minimum and maximum mean concentrations (µg/l) for bromodichloromethane were 1. 47 ± 0. 57 and 1. 90 ± 0. 26, for bromoform were 1. 47 ± 0. 35 and 2. 36 ± 1. 10, for dibromochloromethane were 1. 47 ± 0. 42 and 1. 53 ± 0. 55, and for chloroform were 3. 40 ± 0. 70 and 7. 53 ± 1. 00, and all compounds were determined for stations 1 and 3, respectively. Also comparing the mean concentrations of assessed THMs with ISIRI and World Health Organization (WHO) Maximum Permissible Limits (MPL) showed significant differences (P < 0. 05). Thus, the mean concentrations of all Trihalomethanes compounds were significantly lower than the maximum permissible limits. Conclusions: Although the mean concentrations of THMs were lower than MPL, yet due to discharge of restaurants and gardens’ wastewater into the Abbas Abad River, <b>pre-chlorination</b> process of water in Abbas Abad water treatment plant, high retention time and increasing loss of foliage into the water, especially in autumn season, the formation of Trihalomethanes compounds could increase. Therefore, periodic monitoring of THMs in drinking water distribution network is recommended. ...|$|E

Water chlorination is the disinfection method most widely used, having however the disadvantage of producing trihalomethanes (THM) as secondary compounds, which {{are included in the}} list of priority hazardous substances in water. THM formation is influenced by the raw water composition and chlorine from the disinfection process. This paper intends to highlight the individual values of the chemical compounds precursors of THM in the water network in order to correlate them with the evolution of THM concentration. The cities of Targu Mures and Zalau were chosen as the study area having surface waters with different degrees of contamination as the water source. Pre-treatment with potassium permanganate is used at the water treatment plant in Targu Mures, while <b>pre-chlorination</b> is used at the water treatment plant in Zalau. Water sampling was performed weekly between March-May, 2011 in three sampling points of each city, maintained during the period of study. Total THM and their compounds as well as THM precursors (oxidability, ammonium content, nitrites and nitrates) were measured. The water supplied in the distribution network corresponded integrally to the quality standards in terms of the analyzed indicators, including THM concentrations. The higher average THM concentrations in Zalau (52. 01 ± 14 μg/L) compared to Targu Mures (36. 43 ± 9. 14 μg/L) were expected as a result of precursors concentration. In terms of THM compounds, they had similar proportions in the two localities, chloroform being clearly predominant, followed by dichlorobromoform and dibromochloroform, while bromoform was not identified. Statistical data analysis showed that the presence of THM precursors is correlated with the THM levels but not sufficient for their generation, even if they can be considered in general the basis of a valid prediction...|$|E
40|$|Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a nitrosated amine {{that has}} been {{associated}} with a 10 - 5 increase in lifetime cancer risk at the ng/L level. NDMA may be formed from a variety of anthropogenic amine precursors during drinking water treatment utilizing chloramines as a disinfectant. In this dissertation, ten veterinary antibiotics were tested for their ability to form NDMA. The antibiotics were tested at different pH, temperature, chlorine to ammonia weight ratio (Cl 2 /NH 3) and time to determine the impact of these factors on formation. Molar conversions ranged from 0. 04 to 4. 9 percent, with antibiotics containing more than one dimethylamine (DMA) functional group forming significantly more NDMA. The highest formation for most of the compounds was seen near pH 8. 4. The effect of Cl 2 /NH 3 ratio, temperature, and hold time was somewhat varied for each chemical, suggesting that the effects of these parameters were compound-specific. This suggests that large-scale farming run-off may be a new source NDMA precursors. NDMA formation is slowed by the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). It is not currently known which components of NOM are responsible for the reduction in NDMA formation. In this dissertation, water containing NOM was fractionated into different MW size groups or separated based on polarity. The high molecular weight NOM fractions (> 10 kDa), polar and charged components were shown to be the most effective in reducing the amount of NDMA formed. Some precursors have high sorption coefficients to NOM, which is the likely mechanism for reduction of NDMA formation from these compounds. Lastly, NDMA formation can be highly impacted by numerous factors relevant to drinking water treatment. In this dissertation, water samples and treatment plant data were collected from approximately 20 drinking water treatment plants in the U. S. and Canada over 2 years. Linear mixed effects models with random intercepts, which account for variability between treatment plants, were used to assess variable significance and create predictive equations.

40|$|Formation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a {{substantial}} concern for drinking water and water reuse. NDMA, a probable human carcinogen, is formed when water is disinfected with chloramines and ozone. This research focused on three issues regarding NDMA formation and mitigation. The first issue involved understanding the compounds (i. e., precursors) present in water and wastewater that react with ozone to form NDMA. Model precursors were identified and molar yields for NDMA formation were determined. The model precursors form high amounts of NDMA with ozone, but form very little NDMA with chloramines, which means there are two distinct groups of NDMA precursors: ozone-reactive and chloramine-reactive. An investigation into factors that affect NDMA formation resulted in understanding that bromide enhances NDMA formation for some precursors and elimination of hydroxyl radicals, which are produced during ozonation, leads to higher NDMA formation. Comparison of three oxidants, molecular ozone, hydroxyl radicals and dissolved oxygen, revealed that molecular ozone is the agent responsible for NDMA formation. The second issue addressed the strategic use of disinfection oxidants, alone and in combination, to minimize disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. This study compared the formation and reduction of NDMA and two groups of regulated drinking water DBPs (trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs)) in treated wastewaters using seven disinfection treatment schemes. The top two treatment schemes resulting in the lowest total DBP formation, after converting concentrations to an equivalent unit based on drinking water risk, were ozonation and ozonation-chloramination. Both treatment schemes also exhibit several advantages for application in water reuse situations. It was demonstrated that <b>pre-chlorination</b> can reduce NDMA formation by inactivating ozone-reactive NDMA precursors, but DBP trade-offs must always be addressed because chlorination causes THM and HAA formation. The third issue investigated non-optimized biofiltration to mitigate NDMA formation by removing NDMA precursors prior to disinfection with ozone or chloramines. NDMA precursor removal (ranitidine (RNTD), daminozide (DMZD), 2 -furaldehyde dimethylhydrazone (2 -F-DMH) and 1, 1, 12 ̆ 7, 12 ̆ 7 -tetramethyl- 4, 42 ̆ 7 -(methylene-di-p-phenylene) disemicarbazide (TMDS)) and DBP formation potential (NDMA, THMs, HAAs) in treated wastewater were assessed before and after biofiltration using three anthracite-containing columns with different contact times.

40|$|PhD (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{freshwater}} dinoflagellate species, Ceratium hirundinella (C. hirundinella) possesses unique characteristics, {{such as a}} thecal-plate cell {{covering of}} cellulose, spines and flagella. Unlike most other algae and cyanobacteria, C. hirundinella cells are relatively large in size (up to 450 μm in length and 50 μm in width). These unique characteristics (e. g. cell covering and flagella) and adaptations (e. g. spines) give the dinoflagellate cells the ability to reduce their sinking rate from the euphotic zone and to migrate easily through the water column. When source water contains high concentrations of C. hirundinella cells, water treatment problems and poor aesthetic water quality can be expected. These water treatment problems may include 1) the disruption of coagulation and flocculation, 2) clogging of sand filters and 3) taste and odour problems when cells penetrate into the final water. In Chapter 9 of this study, a list of operational guidelines (including alert levels) and recommendations to assist managers and operators of plants when C. hirundinella cells are causing water treatment problems. During events of high C. hirundinella concentrations in source water, managers and operators of conventional water treatment plants need strategies to optimize coagulants and unit processes. Thus when source water contains motile nuisance algae, such as C. hirundinella, in moderate or abundant quantities, it is advisable to conduct jar stirring test experiments using both turbidity and total photosynthetic pigment (or chlorophyll-a) analyses as indicators of appropriate coagulant choice and dosages. The aims {{of this study are}} summarized as follows:  To optimize coagulants and conventional water treatment processes by implementing relevant algal removal strategies and indicators during jar stirring test experiments,  To investigate the changes in surface charge (known as zeta potential) on C. hirundinella cells before and after adding coagulants as part of the treatment processes,  To investigate the physical and chemical impacts on the morphology of C. hirundinella cells after coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation,  To identify organic compounds that may be responsible for taste and odour problems associated with C. hirundinella,  To investigate the efficiency of <b>pre-chlorination</b> on the removal C. hirundinella cells when dosing various coagulants, and  Give recommendations and operational guidelines relevant for a conventional water treatment plant to improve C. hirundinella removal A combined water treatment system (Phipps and Bird Model), consisting of a six paddle jar test apparatus and six sand filter columns, was used to simulate conventional processes (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and rapid sand filtration). Source water samples containing relatively high C. hirundinella concentrations (> 500 cell/mℓ) were collected from Benoni Lake (26 º 10 ’ 50. 40 ’’S; 28 º 17 ’ 50. 11 ’’ E) in plastic containers and stored as a homogenous sample in a 200 litre container under laboratory conditions (± 22 °C). Samples were collected from the source water as well as after sedimentation (from the supernatant or sludge) to determine turbidity, total photosynthetic pigment analyses (chlorophyll) and for phytoplankton analyses. Flocs (containing C. hirundinella cells) were collected from the sludge or sediment for scanning electron microscopy investigations and to perform zeta potential analyses. Concentrated C. hirundinella samples were frozen at - 80 °C according to the proposed sampling protocol for organic compound analyses. Results obtained from this study proved that using the relevant indicators to determine the appropriate coagulant dosages during jar stirring tests may generally improve the removal of problem-causing algae, such as C. hirundinella cells. Improved algal removal efficiencies will subsequently ensure final water with good aesthetic quality. The surface charge (zeta potential) on C. hirundinella cells can be used to evaluate the best coagulation conditions within an operating window of - 10 mV to + 3 mV when dosing various coagulants. Scanning electron microscopy investigations revealed major damaging effects to C. hirundinella cells when dosing high Ca(OH) 2 concentrations. However, when dosing lower Ca(OH) 2 concentrations, in combination with organic polymer, better C. hirundinella cell removal efficiencies with less damaging effects to cells was observed. This study also indicated that the <b>pre-chlorination,</b> without causing cell lyses, can be applied to render the highly motile cells immobile which will subsequently assist the coagulation unit process. The aesthetic quality (e. g. tastes and odours) of drinking water may be influenced when C. hirundinella cells release organic material into the water as a result of cell lyses. Organic compounds, such as fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids can lead to taste and odour problems which associate with the presence of C. hirundinella. Organic compounds also serve as precursors for the formation of harmful chlorine by-products formed during chlorination. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|Raw {{water of}} {{reservoirs}} has high colour and low turbidity while river water normally has low colour and high turbidity. Organic matters carried with run off water accumulate {{at the bottom}} of reservoirs. Reservoir waters being stationary provides a friendly environment for algal growth and colour development from decomposition of those and some inorganic ion such as Iron & Manganese from soil. So treatment of reservoir water is to be focused on colour removal rather than turbidity removal. It has been found that colour removal requires high coagulant dosage than turbidity removal and purification of reservoir water gives rise to operational problems in the conventional treatment systems such as short filter run with filter clogging and filter bed cracking. Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plant has been constructed in 1954 with design capacity of 20 mgd. It is a conventional type treatment plant having the following processes, Aeration, <b>Pre-chlorination,</b> Coagulation, Flocculation, Sedimentation, Filtration Post chlorination and pH correction. Raw water is drawn off to the treatment plant from the Kalatuwawa impounding reservoir and the treated water is conveyed to Greater Colombo area under gravity feed and contributes 16 mgd to the total supply of Greater Colombo. In the course of filtration, clean filter media gradually gets clogged. After about one month, small cracks on the surface of filters starts to appear and these cracks develop into large openings with mud ball formation in continuation of the filtration process. So it has been difficult to reduce the colour to acceptable level during high colour period as settled water passes through openings without filtration. This has been a long-standing problem, which has not received a proper solution so far. Objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the reasons for filter clogging & filter cracking and find solutions to overcome this problem with improvement of colour removal efficiency. The analysis of the problem was divided into two parts. In the first part, the possible contributory factors from the reservoir up to filters were investigated. Physical & operational factors which may contribute to the problem in the filters themselves were investigated in the second part. A pilot filter was set up in parallel to the existing filters and run more than one year with increased back wash rate and air scouring and found to be operating without clogging and cracking problem in media. Similarly the applicability of clay and settled sludge as coagulant aid, and PAC as colour adsorbent was investigated for the purpose of improving settling and colour removal efficiency in order to reduce the filter load during high colour period. The chemical analysis done for raw water reveals that colour of Kalatuwawa water has developed primarily from organic substances with iron. Organic colour substances come from decomposition of vegetation and Iron from bottom soil. This study investigated the possibility of filter clogging and cracking due to algal growth in the reservoir water and found no significant algal count in raw water to clog filters Through Jar test analysis, it appears that clay and settled sludge can be applied as a coagulant aid in conjunction with Alum and these reduce colour in the settled water to satisfactory level with use of optimum dosage. Addition of Powered Activate Carbon as adsorbent to flocculation basin was found to reduce colour to minimal amount. Applying pre- chlorination is necessary to remove iron from water, as aeration alone is not able to do so. Increased back wash rate up to 36 m 3 /m 2 fhr with air scouring system gives adequate bed expansion and cleaning to filter media. Therefore this study leads to the conclusion that increased backwash rate with improvement of settling would solve the cracking and clogging problem of the filters. Similarly it requires the rehabilitation and modification of filter under drain system...|$|E

This work investigates HCl oxidation over CeO 2 using in situ and ex situ characterization techniques, and provides molecular understanding of Deacon chemistry over ceria catalysts. The reactivity {{and stability of}} CeO 2 in HCl oxidation were assessed by steady-state kinetic experiments, which indicate that The heterogeneously catalyzed gas-phase oxidation of HCl to Cl 2 (Deacon reaction) is an energy-efficient and sustainable route to recycle chlorine from HCl-containing industrial waste streams. This work investigates HCl oxidation over CeO 2 using in situ and ex situ characterization techniques, and provides molecular understanding of Deacon chemistry over ceria catalysts. The reactivity and stability of CeO 2 in HCl oxidation were assessed by steady-state kinetic experiments, which indicate that CeO 2 is an efficient catalyst for Cl 2 recycling in the temperature range of 623 - 723 K. A structural-reactivity correlation obtained by the assessment of sample pretreatment effects, particularly calcination, on reactivity reveals that ceria samples calcined at mildly high temperature (1173 K) represent the best compromise between performance and stability. Calcination at this temperature optimizes both the number of vacancies and the structural stability of the catalyst. Because of the semiconductor nature of CeO 2, HCl oxidation over CeO 2 catalysts requires the redox chemistry of the catalyst as well, and thus O vacancies are expected to play a crucial role. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy of samples exposed to reaction feeds with different O 2 :HCl ratios provide evidence that CeO 2 does not suffer from bulk chlorination in O 2 -rich feeds (O 2 :HCl ≥ 0. 75), while it does form chlorinated phases in stoichiometric or sub-stoichiometric feeds (O 2 :HCl ≤ 0. 25). The quantitative analysis of the chlorine uptake by thermogravimetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that chlorination under O 2 -rich conditions is confined {{to the surface and}} possibly one subsurface layer of CeO 2 particles. Density functional theory simulations reveal that Cl activation from vacancy positions to surface Ce atoms is the most energy-demanding step, although chlorine-oxygen competition for the available active sites may render re-oxidation as the rate-determining step. Since the surface of CeO 2 is prone to chlorination upon exposure to the reaction gas mixture, and hence the active surface phase comprises Cl species in its structure, the stability and reactivity of CeOCl as a possible active phase for Deacon reaction were investigated using various feed compositions at 703 K. CeOCl was synthesized by the solid state reaction of cerium oxide and anhydrous cerium chloride. X-ray diffraction of post-reaction samples revealed that CeOCl is unstable, in both oxygen-rich and lean conditions. A complete transformation of CeOCl into CeO 2 was observed by applying oxygen over-stoichiometric feeds. Considerable HCl conversions were obtained only after this transformation, which confirms the essential role of bulk cerium oxide in this catalytic system, probably by facilitating efficient O 2 activation via bulk and surface O-vacancy dynamics. The impact of surface chlorination on the acid/base properties of ceria (fresh and after reaction) was investigated by probe molecule adsorption (CO 2, NH 3, CO) applying micro-calorimetry, FTIR, TPD and DFT calculations. Micro-calorimetric experiments with CO 2 adsorption indicate that the basic character of CeO 2 has been essentially eliminated upon reaction in HCl oxidation indicating that most of the basic lattice O sites are exchanged by chlorine and that the OH groups formed are rather acidic. Thus, HCl adsorption is certainly retarded by the loss of basic (O 2 -) sites required for H abstraction during dissociative HCl adsorption. Furthermore, FTIR and TPD adsorption experiments using NH 3 and CO as probing molecules reveal that the density and the strength of surface acidic functions increased significantly upon reaction. EPR experiments were carried out on fresh and post-reaction samples using O 2 as probing molecule to assess the effect of surface chlorination on the amount surface O vacancies required for O 2 activation. The results strongly suggest that oxygen activation is inhibited by the high degree of surface chlorination. The coverage of most abundant surface intermediates, OH and Cl, were monitored by in situ infrared spectroscopy and in situ PGAA under various conditions. Higher temperature and p(O 2) led to enhanced OH coverage, reduced Cl coverage and increased reactivity. Variation of p(HCl) gave rise to opposite correlations, while raising p(Cl 2) did not induce any measurable increase in the Cl coverage, despite the strong inhibition of the reaction rate. The results indicate that {{only a small fraction of}} surface sites is actively involved in the reaction, and most of the surface species probed in the in situ observations are spectators. Kinetics of surface/bulk chlorination and dechlorination was investigated by means of in situ PGAA experiments. Using variable reaction conditions (T, pi) the in situ PGAA studies revealed that the chlorination rate is independent of the <b>pre-chlorination</b> degree but increases at lower oxygen over-stoichiometry, while dechlorination is effective in O 2 -rich feeds, and its rate is higher for a more extensively pre-chlorinated ceria. The role of trivalent (La, Sm, Gd, and Y) and tetravalent (Hf, Zr, and Ti) dopants in the catalytic, structural, and electronic properties of ceria was also investigated. Promoted ceria catalysts were synthesized by co-precipitation with ammonia and tested in HCl oxidation. The intrinsic reactivity of ceria was improved by a factor of 2 when doping with Hf and Zr in appropriate quantities, whereas trivalent dopants are detrimental. The effects of promoters on the electronic conductivity and the vacancy formation energy were studied by contactless conductivity experiments using the microwave cavity perturbation technique and by DFT calculations. In HCl oxidation, only the balanced reduction of both Cl and O vacancy formation energies allows for an enhanced reactivity. Promoters give rise to lattice contraction−expansion modifying vacancy formation energies, adsorption properties, and surface coverage. Die heterogen katalysierte Gasphasenoxidation von HCl zu Cl 2 (Deacon Reaktion) ist eine energieeffiziente und nachhaltige Methode, Chlor aus chlorwasserstoffhaltigen industriellen Abfallströmen zurückzugewinnen. Diese Arbeit untersucht die Oxidation von HCl über CeO 2 mit Hilfe von in situ und ex situ Charakterisierungsmethoden und liefert ein Verständnis zur Deacon Chemie über CeO 2 Katalysatoren auf molekularer Ebene. Die Reaktivität und Stabilität von CeO 2 in der HCl-Oxidation wurde mit Hilfe von kinetischen Experimenten im stationären Zustand untersucht, welche zeigen, dass CeO 2 ein effizienter Katalysator für die Wiedergewinnung von Cl 2 im Temperaturbereich von 623 - 723 K ist. Eine Korrelation von Struktur und Reaktivität, welche durch die Untersuchung des Einflusses der Probenvorbehandlung, insbesondere der Kalzinierung, auf die Reaktivität erhalten wurde, zeigt, dass Proben von Ceroxid, kalziniert bei mäßig hoher Temperatur (1173 K), den optimalen Kompromiss zwischen Leistung und Stabilität darstellen. Die Kalzinierung bei dieser Temperatur optimiert die Zahl an Leerstellen und die strukturelle Stabilität des Katalysators. Da CeO 2 ein Halbleiter ist, bedarf es zusätzlich seiner Redoxchemie für die Oxidation von HCl und es wird angenommen, dass dabei O-Leerstellen eine entscheidende Rolle spielen. Die Röntgenbeugung und die Elektronenmikroskopie an Proben, welche Reaktionsgasgemischen mit unterschiedlichem O 2 :HCl-Verhältnissen ausgesetzt wurden, zeigen, dass CeO 2 in O 2 -reichen Gasgemischen (O 2 :HCl ≥ 0. 75) keiner Chlorierung des Volumens unterliegt, während in (sub) -stöchiometrischen Gasgemischen (O 2 :HCl ≤ 0. 25) chlorhaltige Phasen gebildet werden. Die qualitative Analyse der Chloraufnahme durch Thermogravimetrie und Röntgenphotoelektronenspektroskopie weist darauf hin, dass sich die Chlorierung unter O 2 -reichen Bedingungen auf die Oberfläche und möglicherweise auf die erste Lage unterhalb der Oberfläche beschränkt. Rechnungen mit Hilfe der Dichtefunktionaltheorie stellen heraus, dass die Chloraktivierung von Leerstellenpositionen zu Ce-Oberflächenatomen der energieaufwändigste Schritt ist, obwohl die Konkurrenz von Chlor und Sauerstoff um die verfügbaren akitven Zentren die Re-Oxidation als geschwindigkeitsbestimmende Schritt kennzeichnet. Da die Oberfläche von CeO 2 in Anwesenheit des Reaktivgases zur Chlorierung neigt und damit Chlor in die Struktur der aktiven Oberfläche eingebaut wird, wurde die Stabilität und Reaktivität von CeOCl als mögliche aktive Phase für die Deacon Reaktion in unterschiedlichen Reaktivgasgemischen bei 703 K untersucht. CeOCl wurde mittels Festkörperreaktion zwischen Ceroxid und wasserfreiem Cerchlorid erhalten. Röntgenbeugungsmessungen an Ausbauproben zeigten, dass CeOCl sowohl unter sauerstoffreichen als auch unter mageren Bedingungen instabil ist. In, hinsichtlich Sauerstoff, überstöchiometrischem Gasgemischen wurde eine vollständige Umsetzung von CeOCl in CeO 2 beobachtet. Nur dann wurden nennenswerte Umsätze von HCl erhalten, was die essentielle Rolle des Volumens von CeO 2 in diesem katalytischem System bestätigt. Wahrscheinlich geschieht dies durch eine erleichterte, effiziente Aktivierung von O 2 durch die Dynamik von Volumen- und Oberflächenleerstellen des Sauerstoffs. Der Einfluss der Oberflächenchlorierung auf die Säure-Base-Eigenschaften von Ceroxid wurde mittels Adsorption an Sondenmolekülen (CO 2, NH 3, CO) mit Mikrokalorimetrie, FTIR, TPD und DFT-Berechnungen sowohl an frischen Ceroxid als auch Ausbauproben untersucht. Mikrokalorimetrische Experimente mit Adsorption von CO 2 weisen darauf hin, dass der basische Charakter von CeO 2 während der HCl Oxidation im Wesentlichen verloren geht, was darauf hindeutet, dass der überwiegende Teil des Gittersauerstoffs durch Chlor ersetzt wurde und dass gebildete OH-Gruppen eher sauer reagieren. Damit wird die Adsorption von HCl höchstwahrscheinlich durch den Verlust basischer (O 2 -) Zentren, welche für die Abstraktion von H während der dissoziativen Adsorption benötigt werden, gehemmt. Weiterhin zeigen FTIR und TPD mit NH 3 und CO als Probemolekül, dass die Dichte und Stärke saurer Funktionalitäten auf der Oberfläche während der Reaktion zunimmt. EPR Experimente an frischen Proben und an Ausbauproben mit O 2 als Sondenmolekül wurden durchgeführt, um den Effekt der Oberflächenchlorierung auf die Menge von Sauerstofffehlstellen an der Oberfläche, welche zur O 2 -Aktivierung nötig sind, einschätzen zu können. Die Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass die Sauerstoffaktivierung durch den hohen Grad an Chlorierung unterdrückt wird. Die Bedeckungen der wichtigsten Oberflächenintermediate, OH und Cl, wurden durch in situ Infrarot-Spektroskopie und in situ PGAA verfolgt. Höhere Temperaturen und höhere p(O 2) führen zu einer erhöhten Bedeckung mit OH, einer verminderten Bedeckung mit Cl und schließlich zu einer erhöhten Reaktivität. Die Änderung von p(HCl) führt zu entgegengesetzten Korrelationen, während die Erhöhung von p(Cl 2), trotz starker Unterdrückung der Reaktionsrate, keine messbare Erhöhung der Cl Bedeckung bewirkt. Diese Ergebnisse lassen vermuten, dass nur ein kleiner Teil der Oberflächenzentren aktiv an der Reaktion teilnimmt, während die meisten der untersuchten Oberflächenspezies, welche unter in situ Bedingungen beobachtet wurden, unbeteiligt sind. Die Kinetik der Oberflächen- und Volumenchlorierung und Dechlorierung wurde mit Hilfe von in situ PGAA Experimenten untersucht. Die unter verschiedenen Reaktionsbedingungen ausgeführten Experimente zeigen, dass die Chlorierungsgeschwindigkeit unabhängig vom Grad der Vorchlorierung ist, jedoch bei niedrigerer Überstöchiometrie von Sauerstoff ansteigt, während die Dechlorierung in sauerstoffreichen Gasgemischen effektiv ist. Diese Geschwindigkeit ist höher für ein stärker vorchloriertes Ceroxid. Die Rolle trivalenter (La, Sm, Gd und Y) und tetravalenter (Hf, Zr und Ti) Dotierungen für die katalytischen, strukturellen und elektronischen Eigenschaften von Ceroxid wurde ebenso untersucht. Promotiertes Ceroxid wurde mittel Co-Fällung mit Ammoniak dargestellt und in der HCl-Oxidation getestet. Die intrinsische Aktivität von Ceroxid wurde um Faktor 2 gesteigert, wenn mit Hf und Zr in adäquater Weise promotiert wurde, während sich trivalente Dotierungsmittel nachteilig auswirken. Der Effekt der Promotoren auf die elektronische Leitfähigkeit und die Bildungsenergie der Fehlstellen wurde mittels kontaktfreien Leitfähigkeitsexperimenten mit Hilfe der „Microwave perturbation technique“ und mit DFT-Berechnungen geprüft. In der HCl-Oxidation begünstigt nur eine gleichzeitige Reduktion von Cl- und O-Leerstellenbildungsenergien eine erhöhte Reaktivität. Promotoren verursachen eine Gitterkontraktion oder Expansion, was die Leerstellenbildungsenergien, die Adsorptionseigenschaften und die Oberflächenbedeckung modifiziert...|$|E
