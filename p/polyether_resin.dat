40|$|Novel non-PEG derived <b>polyether</b> <b>resins,</b> coined SLURPS (superior liquid-uptake resins for polymer-supported synthesis), were {{synthesized}} by cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers. A functional resin {{was prepared}} with excellent control over loading levels. A sequence of synthetic transformations involving {{the introduction of}} a Wang linker followed by Mitsunobu functionalization chemistry and cleavage of the bound substrate proceeded quantitatively. These new polymers combine outstanding swelling performance {{in a wide range of}} solvents with high chemical stability and tunable loading levels up to 8. 5 mmol/g. This combination of desirable features sets them apart from other polymer supports and, in particular, other <b>polyether</b> <b>resins</b> currently investigated for combinatorial chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Polyurethane {{elastomers}} {{were the}} first products to find wide commercial use in the RIM process. Recently, {{the advent of a}} new chain extender, diethyltolu-enediamine (DETDA), provided another class of commercially useful RIM elas-tomers. These materials are best classified as polyurethane/urea elastomers. We have been working on the next logical step in this evolution: amine-terminated <b>polyether</b> <b>resins</b> with amine chain extenders. These are best classi-fied as polyurea elastomers. Amine-terminated <b>polyether</b> <b>resins,</b> or <b>polyether</b> polyamines, can replace the polyol in a RIM formulation. These materials are much more reactive than pol-yols, and their composition can be varied more easily than conventional RIM polyols. Thus, these products can be tailored to meet the performance require-ments of a particular end use more easily than polyols. The use of amine-terminated polyether products in RIM applications brings a new dimension to the RIM process. Depending on the choice of amine termi-nated polyether amine, one can formulate systems covering a broad range of properties from elastomeric materials to rigid materials. Elastomeric materials are made by having a small amount of hard segment in a block-copolymer in conjunction with a polyether diamine. These elasto-meric materials can be more closely tailored to meet a specific physical prop...|$|R
30|$|Due {{to trade}} secrets not much {{is known about}} the exact {{chemical}} composition of photopolymers. The main proprietary names are Sosmos®, Watershedtm, Accura®, Renshape™ and Visijet® Flex SL. Typically, these are acrylic or epoxy photopolymers; however, unsaturated polyesters or urethanes or hybrid systems consisting of a combination of the two, can be used [41]. Somos® 7110 and Renshape™ 5260 were identified to contain epoxy and acrylic functional groups, aromatics and aliphatic ether groups [42], Flex SL was identified as a <b>polyether</b> (meth)acrylate-based <b>resin</b> [43], and Accura® SI 40 is an epoxy photopolymer resin specifically designed for rapid manufacturing rather than prototyping, with properties considered to be closer to traditional engineering plastics [44].|$|R
50|$|They {{differ from}} polyureas which are {{thermoset}} elastomeric polymers with carbamide (-NH-CO-NH-) links made by combining diisocyanate monomers or prepolymers (OCN-R-NCO) with blends of long-chain amine-terminated <b>polyether</b> or polyester <b>resins</b> (H2N-RL-NH2) and short-chain diamine extenders (H2N-RS-NH2). Polyureas are characterised by near instantaneous cure, {{high mechanical strength}} and resistance to corrosion so are widely used for 1:1 volume mix ratio spray applied, abrasion resistant waterproofing protective coating and lining.|$|R
5000|$|Polyurethanes {{form when}} {{isocyanate}} resins and prepolymers are combined with low- or high-molecular weight polyols, with strict stochiometric ratios being essential to control nucleophilic addition polymerisation - {{the degree of}} crosslinking and resulting physical type (elastomer or plastic) is adjusted from the molecular weight and functionality of isocyanate resins, prepolymers, and the exact combinations of diols, triols and polyols selected, with the rate of reaction being strongly influenced by catalysts and inhibitors; polyureas form virtually instantaneously when isocyanate resins are combined with long-chain amine functional <b>polyether</b> or polyester <b>resins</b> and short-chain diamine extenders - the amine-isocyanate nucleophilic addition reaction does not require catalysts.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of ChemistryPeter M. A. SherwoodThis {{dissertation}} {{will examine}} the fabrication of different phosphorus containing films and their use as corrosion preventative films and adhesion materials between polymers and metal and metal alloys. Orthophosphate films are used in several metals and metal alloys to prevent corrosion and promote adhesion between paints or polymers and metal substrates. One key component {{is to examine the}} use of different phosphorus containing acids that might lead to phosphorus containing films which would compliment the mainly orthophosphate films currently in use. The objectives of this study are to see if it is possible to fabricate different phosphorus containing films, use them to adhere polymers to metal and metal alloys, and test the phosphorus containing films’ and polymer films’ corrosion protection properties. The thermoplastic <b>resin,</b> <b>Poly(ether</b> ketone ketone), or PEKK was found to adhere well to different phosphorus containing films and protect the underlying layers from oxidation in 4 -D water. The phosphorus containing films were created by electrochemical deposition in different 5 M phosphorus containing acids. The metal or metal alloy was abraded to remove the native oxide and treated in the electrochemical cell. The second, separate polymer films were created by dip coating the metal or metal alloy in a polymer solution. The film thickness in both cases was controlled to be less than 100 Å to ensure that the underlying metal or metal alloy could be detected. The surface chemical analysis was collected using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, or XPS. Core level and valence band XPS were used to distinguish the differences in the chemistry at the surfaces. The valence band XPS spectra were interpreted using spectra generated by multiple scattered wave calculations and band structure calculations. In the cases were more than one film was present subtraction and addition spectrum were used to interpret the chemistry in the interface region of the films...|$|R
