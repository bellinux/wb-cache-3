40|$|We {{summarise}} and synthesise {{results from}} several studies {{dealing with the}} impacts of land availability, housing supply and associated <b>planning</b> <b>infrastructure</b> on New Zealand house prices. New house supply is responsive to the ratio of house prices to development costs as predicted by Tobin’s q-theory. Development costs, in turn, are influenced by construction costs and land costs. Qualitative evidence indicates that restrictions on land supply around Auckland – partially {{a result of that}} city’s <b>planning</b> <b>infrastructure</b> – are instrumental in raising land costs for that city, and this is substantiated by econometric analysis of the determinants of Auckland land values. Consenting processes also limit house supply responsiveness in Auckland. Our analysis shows that house supply responsiveness varies across New Zealand. In line with theory and with results of international studies, we show that regions with high supply responsiveness have relatively small price spikes following demand shocks...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} local {{authority}} <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> in England was introduced {{as part of}} the transition from land-use to spatial planning ushered in by the 2004 Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. As a component of this reform of the <b>planning</b> system, local <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> was envisioned {{as part of the}} movement for planning to go beyond traditional land-use planning and integrate policies for the development and use of land with other public policy programmes that shape places. The aim of this thesis is to critically assess the extent to which local authority <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> conforms {{to the idea of a}} transition from land-use to spatial planning. In order to address this aim, the research is set within a historical context of planning which acknowledges that there have been previous attempts to facilitate the planning and delivery of infrastructure at the local level. The thesis then reviews the existing literature of spatial planning and develops a conceptual framework to identify four characteristics of a spatial planning approach namely: evidence, governance, partnership and delivery. This framework expedites an understanding of the spatial planning approach and its association with <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning.</b> The research utilises two empirical case study local authorities- Bolton and Sheffield- to examine the live processes of local authority <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning.</b> Methodologically, the thesis employs qualitative methods, specifically semi-structured interviews supported by participant observation and documentary analysis. The thesis concludes that local authority <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> reflected a ‘squeezed path’ and an incomplete transition from land-use to spatial planning. It finds the spatial planning premise of local authority <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> to be somewhat detached from its actual implementation, creating an implementation gap at the ‘street-level’. Although, it conveys that infrastructure planners sought to construct and execute <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> processes in accordance with the spatial planning approach. Furthermore, it is suggested that the effectiveness of local authority <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> for the delivery of infrastructure is more conspicuously related to financing rather than the genealogy of the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> process. In other words, the availability of capital finance and funding was identified to be the dominant factor shaping the process of local authority <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> in the case studies. Consequently it is contended that there has been a financialisation and neoliberalisation of local infrastructure delivery. In this way, local authority <b>infrastructure</b> <b>planning</b> is subject to the interminable processes of the wider prevailing political economy; impacted by the course of neoliberalisation and ‘new public management’ procedures...|$|R
