25|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and sold under the brand name Demerol among others, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (<b>piminodine,</b> anileridine and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E

50|$|Norpethidine {{can be used}} as a precuror in {{synthesis}} of other drugs, including etoxeridine, benzethidine, furethidine, morpheridine, anileridine, phenoperidine, <b>Piminodine</b> and oxpheneridine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piminodine</b> {{has similar}} effects to other opioids, and {{produces}} analgesia, sedation and euphoria. Side effects can include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression {{which can be}} life-threatening.|$|E

5000|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and Demerol, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. [...] Pethidine was the first wholly synthetic opioid developed and is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (pethidine, <b>piminodine,</b> anileridine and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piminodine</b> (Alvodine) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{that is an}} analogue of pethidine (meperidine). It was used in medicine briefly during the 1960s and 1970s, but has largely fallen out of clinical use. It was used particularly for obstetric analgesia and in dental procedures and, like pethidine, could be combined with hydroxyzine to intensify the effects. The duration of action is 2 to 4 hours and 7.5 to 10 mg via the subcutaneous route {{is the most common}} starting dose, being equal to 80 to 100 mg of pethidine, 40 to 60 mg of alphaprodine and 10 mg of morphine. Oral formulations were also available.|$|E
50|$|Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{of the open}} chain class (methadone and relatives) invented in Germany by Hoechst in 1947. It {{is one of a}} handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like phenazocine and bezitramide) in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are ketobemidone (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), phenazocine (Narphen and Prinadol), dipipanone (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), <b>piminodine</b> (Alvodine), propiram (Algeril), anileridine (Leritine) and alphaprodine (Nisentil).|$|E
40|$|The toxic and lethal {{effects of}} <b>piminodine</b> and Win 13, 797 were studied in mice, dogs, and monkeys. The {{analgesic}} actions of both drugs {{were tested in}} mice and rats and {{were found to be}} more potent than morphine. Vascular studies on pimincdine and Win 13, 797 have shown peripheral vasodilation and acute vascular tolerance to the hypotensive effect in dogs with partial crossed tolerance to morphine. Dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital were sensitive to the respiratory depressant actions of these drugs. Nalorphine readily antagonizes this respiratory depression. <b>Piminodine</b> and Win 13, 797 are myocardial depressants on the dog heart-lung preparation and the cat papillary muscle, but only in doses or concentrations much higher than would be used therapeutically. The actions of <b>piminodine</b> and Win 13, 797 on the isolated rabbit jejunal segment are minimal. The qualitative actions of <b>piminodine</b> and Win 13, 797 on EEG effects in dogs with chronically implanted electrodes were like those of morphine. Quantitatively, Win 13, 797 was equipotent to morphine, and <b>piminodine</b> one-half as effective. Studies on single-dose suppression in monkey and primary physical dependence in dogs and monkeys indicate that <b>piminodine</b> and Win 13, 797 have high addiction liability at least in these species. Nearly all the administered <b>piminodine</b> or Win 13, 797 is altered chemically when injected into dogs. There is no evidence for marked local tissue deposition for either drug...|$|E
