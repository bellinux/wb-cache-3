25|$|The {{details of}} the {{surgical}} approach depend on the location {{and size of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>tumour</b> and its N stage. Neck dissection to examine the draining lymph nodes may be carried out simultaneously or as a second staging procedure. For tumours of the tonsil and lateral pharyngeal wall, and clinically node negative (N0) disease, dissection of the neck typically involves levels 2–4 (see diagram) ipsilaterally. Where nodes are involved clinically, dissection will depend on the location and size of the node or nodes. In the case of tongue base primaries, close to the midline, bilateral dissection is recommended.|$|E

Similarly, the landmark trials of Bernard Fisher, chair of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, and of Gianni Bonadonna, working in the Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano, Italy, proved that adjuvant chemotherapy after complete surgical resection of breast tumours significantly extended survival — particularly in more advanced cancer.|$|E
500|$|Lung cancer {{can either}} arise {{directly}} from lung tissue or {{as a result}} of metastasis from another part of the body.

40|$|A {{substantial}} number of patients with early-stage colorectal cancer relapse from metastatic disease. Identification of these patients by genetic profiling of their <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> may allow more informed follow-up and tailored administration of adjuvant therapy. <b>Primary</b> <b>tumours</b> from 70 patients with early-stage and largely microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer were profiled using metaphase-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and the aberrations confirmed independently in a subset of patients using microarray-based CGH. Of the 70 cancers, 61 were amenable to CGH, and follow-up data was available from 56 patients. Genomic aberrations were correlated with patients' survival using univariate, multivariate and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Metastatic <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> exhibited more complex genomic aberrations than non-metastatic <b>primary</b> <b>tumours.</b> Loss of chromosome 4 p was an independent prognostic factor in early-stage colorectal cancer using multivariate analysis (Hazard ratio, 9. 6; 95 % CI, 3. 3 - 28; P = 0. 0001). Loss of both chromosome arms 8 p and 18 q had a statistically significant negative effect on disease-free survival. Moreover, <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> with loss of both chromosomes 4 and 14 q bestowed poorer prognosis than tumours with loss of {{any one of the}} two chromosomes (P < 0. 0001). Genetic profiling of <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> of patients with early-stage colorectal cancer is of significant value in identifying the subset of patients who may relapse with metastatic disease.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} beta-catenin in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its clinical significance. METHODS: 101 patients were surgically treated for NSCLC by lobectomy or pneumectomy with systematic lymph node dissection. Follow up was available in all patients, ranging from 24 to 110 months. Immunostaining of tissue sections from <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> and (when present) their lymph node metastases was performed and evaluated using a monoclonal antibody against beta-catenin. Correlations were investigated between beta-catenin immunostaining in <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> and E-cadherin immunostaining (data available from a previous study), lymph node stage, and survival. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between scores for beta-catenin immunostaining and E-cadherin immunostaining in <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> (p = 0. 007), and between the beta-catenin immunostaining score in <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> and in their lymph node metastases (p = 0. 006). An inverse correlation {{was found between the}} beta-catenin immunostaining score in <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> and lymph node stage N 0, N 1, or N 2 (p = 0. 03). According to the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate, the level of beta-catenin expression in <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> was a statistically significant prognostic factor (p = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced beta-catenin expression in surgically treated NSCLC is clearly associated with lymph node metastasis and an infavourable prognosis. The existence of a functional relation between E-cadherin and beta-catenin is supported by the results of this clinicopathological study...|$|R

The expression of most genes involved in tumourigenesis (p 53, Rb, cyclin D 1, myc, bcl- 2, EGFR, neu, and E-cadherin) was similar in <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> and metastases, The expression of nm 23 and Ep-CAM was found to be more frequently lower than higher in metastases, compared with their <b>primary</b> <b>tumours,</b> Whereas most genetic alterations of <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> remain unchanged in metastases, expression of the cell adhesion molecule Ep-CAM and of nm 23 is more frequently reduced than increased in metastases, compared with their <b>primary</b> <b>tumours,</b> suggesting relevance to the process of metastasis, This also implies differences in the regulation of markers involved in tumourigenesis and the process of metastasis.

40|$|Abstract The {{microenvironment}} within solid tumours {{can influence}} the metastatic dissemination of tumour cells, and recent evidence suggests that poorly oxygenated (hypoxic) cells in <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> can also affect the survival and proliferation of metastatic tumour cells in distant organs. Hypoxic tumour cells have been historically targeted during radiation therapy in attempts to improve loco-regional control rates of <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> since hypoxic cells {{are known to be}} resistant to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. There are, therefore, a number of therapeutic strategies to directly target hypoxic cells in <b>primary</b> (and metastatic) <b>tumours,</b> and several compounds are becoming available to functionally inhibit hypoxia-induced proteins that are known to promote metastasis. This mini-review summarizes several established and emerging experimental strategies to target hypoxic cells in <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> with potential clinical application to the treatment of patients with tumour metastases or patients at high risk of developing metastatic disease. Targeting hypoxic tumour cells to reduce metastatic disease represents an important advance in the way scientists and clinicians view the influence of tumour hypoxia on therapeutic outcome. </p...|$|R

40|$|Problems/objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the relevance of}} routine head and neck ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), chest X-ray, and standard clinical examination for the early detection of recurrences, second <b>primary</b> <b>tumours,</b> and distant metastases in the follow-up of patients treated for head and neck cancers. Methodology: Retrospective cohort study. Results: One hundred ninety-five patients were reviewed. Seventy-one recurrences appeared during the follow-up period. Five recurrences were diagnosed during head and neck US and CT. Sixty-four recurrences were diagnosed based on patients' complaints or standard clinical examination. Two lung malignancies were diagnosed during the annual chest X-ray. Conclusion: Systematic head and neck US and CT exams revealed recurrent cancers with poor efficiency and should be performed only after clinical suspicion of recurrence or second <b>primary</b> <b>tumours.</b> The value of an annual chest X-ray remains debatable.

40|$|Brain metastases are {{generally}} {{associated with a}} poor prognosis. The number of metastases, location and control of extracranial disease typically influences the management of patients. Treatment options are currently limited and are dependent on the clinical context. Interventions include surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery with few metastases, with whole brain radiotherapy serving a role in patients with several metastases. In recent years, there have been increased efforts directed towards early phase trials to address the role of targeted biological agents towards pathogenic drivers namely, EGFR, HER 2 and BRAF. Due to the location and appropriateness of the clinical situation biopsies are impractical in these patients. In this DPhil, I have characterised the genomic landscape of a cohort of brain metastases of 4 colorectal, 7 ductal breast and 7 lung adenocarcinomas. Analysis of genomes involved: characterisation of mutation burdens, spectra and signatures, profiling copy number aberrations, driver gene discovery and reconstructing the clonal architecture of the genomes. Unpaired <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and published reports served as a comparative tool to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity compared to <b>primary</b> <b>tumours.</b> The brain metastases generally resembled <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> with regards to mutation burdens, spectra and signatures. Drivers of <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> including those targeted by current biological agents were generally, though not universally located in major clonal groups in the metastases. Increased chromosomal instability was observed in the metastases. Although my sample size was modest the brain metastases had an increased number of copy number alterations in comparison to <b>primary</b> <b>tumours.</b> Furthermore, my findings suggest that chromothripsis may occur more frequently in brain metastases.

40|$|Much {{has been}} learned about the {{chromosomal}} abnormalities of colorectal carcinomas but the cytogenetic relationship between the neoplastic clones present in <b>primary</b> versus metastatic <b>tumour</b> samples remains unclear. We analyse the frequency of abnormalities for 47 chromosome regions using the interphase {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} technique in a group of 48 <b>tumours,</b> including 24 <b>primary</b> colorectal <b>tumours</b> and 24 paired liver metastases. All tumours showed complex karyotypes with numerical/structural abnormalities for seven or more different chromosomes/chromosome regions both in the <b>primary</b> <b>tumours</b> and in their paired metastases. Chromosome 8 was the most frequently altered (22 / 24 <b>primary</b> <b>tumours),</b> consistently showing del(8 p 22) and/or gains/amplification of 8 q 24, followed by abnormalities of the entire chromosome 7 (21 / 24 <b>primary</b> <b>tumours)</b> and of chromosomes 17 p and 20 q (20 / 24 <b>primary</b> <b>tumours).</b> Simultaneous staining for multiple chromosome probes revealed the presence of two or more tumour cell clones in 23 / 24 cases (46 / 48 tumour samples). Interestingly, the liver metastases typically contained tumour cell clones similar to those found in the <b>primary</b> <b>tumours,</b> suggesting the absence of selective selection of specific tumour clones. Despite this, additional chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 23 / 24 metastatic tumours, which preferentially consisted of del(17 p 13) and gains/amplification of 11 q 13 and 20 q 13; moreover, compared to <b>primary</b> <b>tumours,</b> metastases showed an increased number of abnormalities of chromosomes 1 p, 7 q, 8 q, 13 q, and 18 q, and new chromosomal abnormalities involving chromosomes 6, 10 q 23, 14 q 32, 15 q 22, and 19 q 13. Owing to the high frequency of numerical abnormalities of the entire chromosome 7 and loss and/or gain/amplification of specific regions of chromosome 8, eg del(8 p 22) and/or gains/amplification of 8 q 24 in <b>primary</b> colorectal <b>tumours</b> with associated metastases, it is suggested that their assessment at diagnosis could be of great clinical utility for the identification of colorectal cancer patients at higher risk of developing liver metastases.
