50|$|However, {{the method}} is unable to detect an ongoing leak after the initial event: after the {{pipeline}} wall breakdown (or rupture), the initial <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> subside and no subsequent <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> are generated. Therefore, if the system fails to detect the leak (for instance, because the <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> were masked by transient <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> caused by an operational event such as a change in pumping pressure or valve switching), the system will not detect the ongoing leak.|$|R

[Journal of the Acoustic Society of America, Nov. 1998] {{described}} {{the generation of}} shock-free high-amplitude <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> in closed cavities using large equipment and resonators to produce the reported effects. An attempt is made to generate shock-free high-amplitude <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> using relatively small resonators. Ambient air is used as the working fluid.

5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E

40|$|Structural grids (grid metastructures) {{supporting}} discrete <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> {{similar to}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> in continuous media are considered. The grids consist of links capable of transmitting longitudinal <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> and nodes providing equal pressures {{on the ends of}} outgoing links. The pressures in the nodes are governed by finite-difference equations approximating, under certain conditions, the wave equation in free space. It is shown that the pressures in the nodes are determined by the acoustic velocities and impedances of links rather than by the coordinates of the nodes and the link lengths. Therefore, a grid approximating <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> in a region of uniform homogeneous space can be replaced by an equivalent “deformed” grid with other spatial coordinates of nodes but the same <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> in the nodes. In particular, a locally “stretched” equivalent grid can be found that, theoretically, provides a sufficiently large region free from nodes and links. This property makes it possible to use these grids to construct ultrabroadband acoustic cloaks...|$|R

During phase II, {{the frequency of the}} EGG was relatively constant in each individual, with a median frequency of 0. 046 Hz [2. 8 counts per minute (cpm) ]. EGG frequency was greater (P < 0. 05) than the median rate of antral <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> (1. 8 cpm). The suppression of antral <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> (P < 0. 05) and stimulation of isolated pyloric <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> (IPPWs) (P < 0. 05) produced by triglyceride infusion were not associated with changes in EGG frequency compared with phase II.

40|$|Abdominal {{symptoms}} such as diarrhoea, abdominal cramps {{and vomiting}} are common during and after abdominal radiotherapy for gynaecological and pelvic malignancy. It has recently been recognized that small intestinal dysmotility may contribute to these symptoms but the underlying mechanisms are unclear {{in part because of}} the technical difficulties inherent in performing studies in irradiated small intestine. The aim of the current study was to evaluate small intestinal motor activity using perfused micromanometric techniques in 6 – 8 -cm segments of ileum during arterial perfusion with isotonic oxygenated fluorocarbon solution. Intestinal segments from six rats were studied 4 days after treatment with 10 Gy abdominal irradiation. Ileal segments from nine nonirradiated animals acted as controls.
