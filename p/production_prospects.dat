40|$|Forecasting {{has been}} very {{important}} in decision making at all levels and sectors of the economy. In agriculture, where the decision environment is characterized by risks and uncertainty largely due to uncertain yields and relatively low price elasticities of demand of most commodities, decision makers require some information {{about the future and}} the likelihood of the possible future outcomes. Forecast information serves many users. Farmer's production and marketing decisions, for instance, are often based on some perspective of the likely pattern of price movements over the coming year. Likewise, <b>production</b> <b>prospects</b> for the season are used by market intermediaries in coordinating their resources. Outlook information about production and consumption are also important in developing government price support programs. Along with the variety of forecast users, there exists a wide range of available forecasting techniques. They range from a very simple trend extrapolation to a very complex system of structural equations and simulation models. Very often, these alternative approaches provide different forecasts of the same event. The forecast user, then must determine which of the set of forecasts to use, given his/her decision environment. After a choice has been made, the other forecasts are often discarded. This paper aims to test the hypothesis that forecast performance is proportional to the information contained in the forecasting method. This is carried out through the evaluation of a forecasting approach which is a combination of annual and quarterly ratio econometric models for cattle and hog prices. Such a combination is done to draw from the advantages of both annual models in estimating structural parameters and quarterly models which provide needed information for decision making.

40|$|Exports in the Middle Eastern {{countries}} should increase from $ 800 million to $ 900 million {{as a result}} of the tariff cuts agreed on in the Uruguay Round, according to the author. This represents an annual expansion of less than 1 percent. Projected gains are small because the erosion of tariff preferences that Middle Eastern countries received in OECD markets offset the positive effects of reduced most-favored-nation tariffs on nonpreference-receiving products. And petroleum, the main Middle Eastern export [...] which generally faces zero or low tariffs [...] is unaffected by the Uruguay Round reductions. Egypt's projected gains (about $ 20 million, or under 0. 5 percent of total exports) are concentrated largely in agricultural exports to the European Union and manufactures in the United States. Israel should experience net trade losses because of the erosion of its free trade preferences in the European Union and the United States. The Uruguay Round made major progress in removing nontariff barriers that Middle Eastern exports face, especially in agriculture, textiles, and clothing. But with the removal of the Multifibre Arrangement, international trade in textiles and clothing will become much more competitive. Middle Eastern countries must adopt measures to cut costs and increase efficiency to remain viable exporters. As a result of what was achieved in the Uruguay Round, the average OECD nontariff barrier coverage ration for Middle Eastern exports should fall from a current 10 percent to between 1 and 2 percent. Net food importing countries could be adversely affected by the higher international food prices expected to result from the Uruguay Round agreement. There is a clear priority for net food importers to adopt reforms stimulating domestic <b>production.</b> <b>Prospects</b> for increased trade in the Middle East are constrained by the similar comparative advantages and export profiles of many Middle Eastern countries.

40|$|In Australia, climate {{variability}} and {{the predicted}} impact {{of climate change}} help in making seasonal rainfall less predictable and seasonal irrigation supplies more uncertain, eroding agricultural <b>production</b> <b>prospects</b> and profitability. Water allocation forecasts have economic value to irrigators for making informed cropping decisions. Thisstudy estimated the economic value of improved irrigation allocation forecasts in the Coleambally irrigation area (CIA) in southeastern Australia using a non-linear programming model. The model uses production and profit functions to estimate yield and gross margins for various water allocation levels rather than using given crop yields and gross margins. The model also captures the tactical response of improved cropping decisions made by irrigators based on water allocation announcements throughout the irrigation season. Tactical responses include changing the winter crop combinations, abandoning irrigation for {{a percentage of the}} summer crops, temporary purchase or sale of water, and deficit irrigation. The estimated economic benefit of improved seasonal water allocation forecasts to the CIA irrigators ranges from AU$ 1. 33 ha− 1 to AU$ 9. 58 ha− 1 (AU$ 1 = US$ 0. 77). The economic analysis of water allocation forecasts shows that the potential total gross margin for the irrigators at the 100 % allocation level was AU$ 47. 6 m, assuming accurate forecast of the end-of-season allocations. A more realistic scenario generates a forecast value of AU$ 8. 9 million reduction in the gross margin (pessimistic water allocation outlook) and AU$ 1. 60 million in the forgone gross margin (optimistic water allocation outlook) for only 5 % variation in outlook above or below the actual allocation level of 60 %. This suggests that losses far exceed when water allocations are over-estimated by irrigators, as resources and inputs could be overly committed to execute the less-informed cropping plans. The knowledge benefits from forecasts are far greater {{at the lower end of}} an allocation due to relative water scarcity. However, for higher allocation levels (> 80 %), the knowledge benefits are negligible due to less water scarcity. Thus, investments in water allocation forecasts and related agrometeorological information could be useful tools for policy makers, farmers, agribusiness, and the insurance industry...|$|E

40|$|Smallholder {{dairy farmers}} in the Kenya {{highlands}} generally intensify their farming systems by integrating dairy with crop production and shifting from free-grazing to semi-zero- or zero-grazing. They consequently change the breed composition, size and structure of their herds with resultant change in herd demographic rates. The intensification of smallholder dairying has underpinned changes in the farming systems to sustain more intensive land use and support more people per unit area of land in smallholder households. However, the concern is whether smallholders will continue to benefit from dairying through continued intensification when facing the pressures of continuously shrinking landholdings, worsening soil fertility and reduced access to formerly public delivered livestock input and output services, while imported nutrients remain relatively low and non-agricultural job opportunities remain lacking. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to quantify the consequences of the intensification of farming systems in the Kenya highlands on the dynamics of smallholder dairy herds in order to better understand the constraints to, and opportunities for, the continued intensification of smallholder dairying. Data collection was through a random stratified cross-sectional survey of smallholder households. Data from the cross-sectional survey sample were complemented with additional information from longitudinal and targeted semi-structured interviews, which involved a randomly selected sub-sample of the previous cross-sectional survey. The drivers of intensification of smallholder dairying were identified and the relative changes were quantified {{at the level of the}} farms and farming systems. Intensification requires increased use of external resources including sources of replacement animals, feed resources, animal health and breeding services and credit to sustain the herd population and <b>production.</b> <b>Prospects</b> for maintaining and expanding smallholder dairying in the Kenya highlands depend upon the proportion of free-grazing farms maintained within the farming systems, because these supply semi-zero- and zero-grazing farms with dairy replacements. The rationale underlying smallholders' breeding decisions is based on multiple objectives of more milk, adaptability to local feed conditions and diseases and the provision of non-marketed production such as manure, insurance and financing roles of cattle. Feeding interventions to support continued intensification of smallholder dairying must be within the context of the household's economy, which is characterised by limited cash flow and low risk bearing capacity. Smallholders need affordable working capital to sustain intensification with use of external resources. Solutions to constraints of intensification must concurrently involve both technical and institutional innovations that may encourage greater complementarities and stratification in the dairy sub-sector...|$|E
40|$|Toxic algae are {{a growing}} concern in the marine environment. One unique marine diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries (Hasle) Hasle, {{produces}} the neurotoxin domoic acid, which {{is the cause of}} amnesic shellfish poisoning. The molecular characterization of this organism has been limited to date. Therefore, the focus of this thesis was to identify and initiate characterization of actively expressed genes that control cell growth and physiology in P. multiseries, with the specific goal of identifying genes that may {{play a significant role in}} toxin production. The first step in gene discovery was to establish a complementary DNA (cDNA) library and a database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for P. multiseries. 2552 cDNAs were sequenced, generating a set of 1955 unique contigs, of which 21 % demonstrated significant similarity with known protein coding sequences. Among the genes identified by sequence similarity were several involved in photosynthetic pathways, including fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a/c light harvesting protein and a C 4 -specific pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase. Several genes that may be involved in domoic acid synthesis were also revealed through sequence similarity, for example, glutamate dehydrogenase and 5 -oxo-L-prolinase. In addition, the identification of sequences that appear novel to Pseudo-nitzschia may provide insight into unique aspects of Pseudo-nitzschia biology, such as toxin production. Genes whose expression patterns were correlated with toxin production were identified by hybridization to a microarray manufactured from 5376 cDNAs. 121 cDNAs, representing 12 unique cDNA contigs or non-redundant cDNAs, showed significantly increased expression levels in P. multiseries cell populations that were actively producing toxin. (cont.) The up-regulated transcripts included cDNAs with sequence similarity to 3 -carboxymuconate cyclase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, an amino acid transporter, a small heat shock protein, a long- chain fatty acid Co-A ligase, and an aldo/keto reductase. These results provide a framework for investigating the control of toxin production in P. multiseries. These transcripts may also be useful in ecological field studies in which they may serve as signatures of toxin <b>production.</b> <b>Prospects</b> for further application of molecular genetic technology to the understanding of the physiology and ecology of P. multiseries is discussed. by Katie Rose Boissonneault.

40|$|Deforestation {{and forest}} {{degradation}} {{in the tropics}} have been receiving both scientific and political attention in recent decades due to its impacts {{on the environment and}} on human livelihoods. In Ghana, the continuous decline of forest resources and the high demand for timber have raised stakeholders concerns about the future timber <b>production</b> <b>prospects</b> in the country. The principal drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in Ghana are agricultural expansion (50 %), wood harvesting (35 %), population and development pressures (10 %), and mining and mineral exploitation (5 %). Various measures are being pursued that are targeted at addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation and at increasing the forest resource base. Understanding the key driving forces behind current forest resource development trends will help to gain insights into the possible courses of action to take to improve the developments of the resources, especially where actions that are being taken today {{will have an impact on}} the forest resources for many years to come. In this thesis, I used interdisciplinary research methods to provide insights into the current status of the forest resource base in Ghana and into its likely and possible future developments. I addressed 5 research questions: (1) What are the trends and changes associated with the growing stock in the timber production areas? (2) What driving forces account for current trends and future developments of timber resources in Ghana? (3) What different scenarios can be identified and how will these affect future developments of timber resources in the high forest zone? (4) What factors motivate farmers to engage in on-farm tree planting and management? (5) To what extent do the current trends of forest resources drive forest transition in Ghana? National forest inventory data, timber harvesting data and forest plantation establishment data showed that the growing stock in both on- and off-reserve production areas have been declining since 1990. Ghana’s average forest growing stock of 40 m 3 per ha is much lower than the 195 m 3 per ha for the Western and Central Africa sub-region. Timber harvesting records also indicate that, in recent decades, total timber harvests have mostly been substantially higher than the annual allowable cut, resulting in an increasing gap between national timber demand and supply, which drives illegal logging. Current plantation establishment efforts are not sufficient to bridge the gap between demand and supply of timber, partly due to low establishment rates and lack of appropriate management of newly established plantations. Forest governance system and resource demand are the two key driving forces that affect the current trends and future developments of forest resources in the high forest zone of Ghana. Four scenarios were developed: (1) legal forestry scenario with emphasis on improving the resource base to meet high demand; (2) forest degradation, which implies a business-as-usual scenario; (3) forest transition, with emphasis on expanding the resource base in response to environmental concerns; and (4) timber substitution scenario seeking to provide wood substitutes to conserve the resource base. Across two on-farm tree planting schemes, I found that financial benefits, educational campaigns by project teams, knowledge about current environmental issues, ownership of timber for family use and access to land, grants, farming inputs, seedlings, capacity building, and market for agricultural produce are the factors that motivated farmers to engage in on-farm tree planting and management. Currently, there is no strong force toward a forest transition through any of the five generic pathways (economic development; forest scarcity; globalization; state forest policy; and smallholder, tree-based land use intensification). This is because the existing trends of forest resources developments are either too small-scale or too ineffective. In order to accelerate a forest transition in Ghana, policy and management options should target measures that reduce current degradation of natural forests, increase the area and productivity of commercial forest plantations, promote sustainable forest management, and support and encourage forest conservation and integration of trees into farming systems...|$|E
