40|$|Ceramic {{coatings}} {{are widely}} used in aerospace field as thermal barrier materials for their high-temperature performance. The adhesion quality of ceramic coatings on metallic substrate is an important index for coating performance. The uniformity of coating thickness is also important since it determines the thermal stresses in the coatings, which means the coating performance is closely related with the uniformity. The reflection characteristic of the coating-substrate interface is an essential factor for evaluating the adhesion quality. Since the acoustic impedance of ceramic coatings {{is very close to}} that of substrate, {{it is not easy to}} distinguish their reflection wave in the received waves. In this paper, the propagation characteristics of ultrasonic wave in coatings with different thicknesses on the substrate were researched using immersion ultrasonic testing with <b>pulse-echo</b> <b>method.</b> An algorithm based on the amplitude and phase of reflection waves was proposed for the evaluation of adhesive quality.

A total of 58 wood stakes (29 loblolly pine, Pinus taeda, and 29 aspen, Populus tremuloides) that were vertically installed (full length) in forest soils were non-destructively tested {{by means of}} a laboratory-type acoustic measurement system. The same acoustic measurements were also conducted on the wood stakes after they were removed from the soil. Compression (parallel to grain) tests were then performed on the stakes in the laboratory to obtain residual elastic and strength properties.

Salting involved an increase of the V in meat muscles and a decrease of the time of flight in whole hams. Measuring the V before and after salting, the salt content could be estimated.

40|$|Nonuniform {{broadband}} transducers {{have been}} shown to radiate transient fields of simpler time and space structures than conventional uniform transducers by modifying transducer diffraction effects [1, 2]. The echo-structure arising from a defect as measured in <b>pulse-echo</b> <b>methods</b> of NDT is a fortiori simplified since transducer diffraction effects occur both in radiation and in reception [2]. Most of the theoretical and experimental works on nonuniform transducers dealt with the propagation of pulses of ultrasound in fluids. In solids, the transient field radiated by even a simple compression wave disk-transducer directly coupled with an elastic half-space is very complex because diffraction effects leads to complex mode-conversion phenomena [3 – 5]. Such a transducer not only radiates a complex compression wave-field (comparable with that radiated in fluids by a similar transducer) but also a complex shear wavefield. In the present paper, three different source profiles are considered (same as in Ref. [2] where echo-responses from targets in fluids were studied) : a conventional uniform profile, a nondiffracting profile and a profile reinforcing diffraction effects. The two nonuniform profiles are not ideal as those considered in [6]. We have developed industrial prototypes vibrating with these profiles (in [2], only laboratory-made transducers were considered). The present paper aims to show how they simplify the wavefield structure radiated in solids. To do this, both waveform and amplitude of the transient velocity radiated at various field-points are calculated by means of two methods: a recently proposed approximate solution [4] (improved in [5]) and a pure numerical scheme based on the finite-difference method [7]. First, the approximate solution is recalled [4, 5]. Analytic formulas for a uniform source profile are explicitly given. They are combined with the superposition principle to allow the computation of the field radiated by nonuniform but axisymmetrical source profiles considered herein. Then, the finite-difference scheme originally developed for NDT modeling [7] is briefly recalled. It allows the computation of the field radiated by arbitrary axisymmetrical source profiles. Both methods are used to predict the particle velocity radiated by the three profiles considered at various field-points either on- or off-axis and at different ranges. The accuracy of both methods is shown by comparing predicted waveforms. Finally, all the results are discussed to show advantages and disadvantages of using nonuniformly excited transducers in the context of <b>pulse-echo</b> <b>methods</b> of NDT...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Two different bulge forming measurement methods are used simultaneously in order to {{reinforce the}} standardization of the bulge test measuring procedures. An indirect method, Digital Image Correlation (DIC), is compared with a direct one, ultrasound <b>pulse-echo</b> <b>method.</b> Findings: The main conclusion is that the DIC system is a valid indirect measurement method to study bi-axial sheet metal forming. Research limitations/implications: The constant pressure bulge test method was used and it yielded positive results for comparing the direct and indirect method (considering thickness measurement of the bulge dome), as an important research implication is that the touch less measurement method {{could be applied to}} other sheet metal forming processes. Practical implications: Tension tests are used as a standard accepted procedure to determine material parameter values for characterizing the forming sheet behaviour. However, by using a tension test, only a limited strain range can be considered for determining the true stress – true strain curve. Based on this limitation, the bulge test is used to achieve a much larger strain range under bi-axial loading conditions.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} increasingly play a {{major role}} in industrial applications. To utilize a composite appropriately, its physical properties and mechanical behavior must be understood; ultrasonics is a common means of obtaining such information. For most conventional materials, ultrasonic measurements are relatively straightforward. Since the elastic properties of such materials are independent of direction, a single plate specimen and <b>pulse-echo</b> <b>methods</b> can be used [1, 2]. This configuration is of limited usefulness for composites, however, because their anisotropic nature means that the elastic properties vary as a function of propagation direction. The obvious solution of preparing and measuring multiple plate specimens with different orientations can be slow and expensive, and may provide incomplete information. Therefore, a fresh approach is needed. In this paper, we describe techniques that enable ultrasonic measurements for virtually any propagation direction in an anisotropic material. The experiments use hemispherical test samples in conjunction with a versatile mechanical fixture. By connecting the apparatus to a commercial acquisition system possessing automated scanning capabilities, waveforms may be obtained over a wide range of propagation directions. The data are then analyzed to determine the velocity, attenuation, or other information as a function of direction. Experimental results for a composite are presented in order to illustrate the technique’s capabilities and highlight specific information that may be gained...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic Stoneley and leaky {{interface}} wave {{techniques have}} been applied to the characterization of the bondline structure and the near-surface bulk properties of flat metal alloy samples separated by {{a thin layer of}} polymer adhesive. Interface wave energy is confined to the region containing the polymer and extending approximately one ultrasonic wavelength into each of the metal substrates. The amplitude and distribution of localized particle motions both normal and parallel to the interface are sensitive to point defects at the polymer-metal boundaries as well as to grain boundaries and dislocations near the metal surfaces and to microcracks in the polymer. In this paper, the measured sensitivity of interface wave attenuation to defects near the bondline and to variations in the viscosity of the adhesive layer is compared with theoretical changes predicted by the model developed by Rokhlin. Two experimental techniques utilized to obtain these measurements are presented. First, differential interferometric optical measurements of interface wave attenuation due to defects near glass-polymer-metal boundaries are discussed.
