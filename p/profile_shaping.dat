Two methods are proposed, one varying the permittivity, the other using a wire medium. By the use of Mathieu functions we demonstrate a flatter, a triangular and a peakier profile.

40|$|Tracer {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used for estimation of soil water and groundwater recharge flux especially in arid and semiarid regions. These tracer methods {{are based on the}} solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> (distribution of concentration with depth) and peak position. For soils of semi-arid to sub-humid climates, vertical water movement may seasonally vary in direction due to climate conditions and vegetative demands. The first objective of this thesis was to show that TDR (time domain reflectometry) can be a useful tool for estimation of soil water fluxes using tracer methods. The second objective was to study the effects of repeated cycles of directionally-varying flow upon solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> and position used by tracer methods under controlled laboratory conditions. Three soil columns with a KCl tracer and Beaver Creek sand were used for this study. Rain and evaporative systems were used to cause the downward and upward soil water movements in the column, respectively. Soil moisture content and solute concentration were measured using TDR. The result for the first objective was that the peak migration and the soil water balance methods gave similar average upward and downward soil water fluxes. This result indicates that the TDR method can be recommended for determination of soil water fluxes with tracer methods in fields or in laboratory studies for sufficient time and depth. In the second objective, three different seasonal flow regimes were studied using the sand columns, and each flow regime simulated climatic seasons that might occur in the field. Several apparent and statistical parameters were used to evaluate the change of the solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> and position under cycling conditions of the three different flow regimes. These parameters showed that the solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> and position clearly changed under the three different repeated regimes of downward and upward seasonal flows. It was concluded that climate (seasonality) can have significant impacts on the estimation of soil water fluxes using tracer methods. The result from this investigation shows that the <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> and position after a number of cycles (years of fluctuations) can provide a description of the previous climatic effects on the concentration profile. Therefore, the <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> can be used as an indicator of the flow regime that has affected the solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape.</b> Moreover, if a reference of a solute profile is available (a solute profile before a period of time), it is easier to determine the flow regime affected the <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> and position by determining the change of the <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> and position using statistical parameters presented in this thesis...|$|R

In contrast, here we show how to control the longitudinal (propagation direction) mode profile on a sub-wavelength scale, but without the need for active solutions such as synthesizing the shape by combining multiple Fourier harmonics. This is done by means of a customised permittivity variation that can be calculated either directly from the desired mode profile, or as inspired by e. g. the range of shapes generated by the Mathieu functions.

40|$|Abstract. Formation of {{core regions}} with reduced {{electron}} transport is reported in regimes with current <b>profile</b> <b>shaping</b> at JET. The electron heat diffusivity (χe) is reduced down to 0. 5 m 2 /s {{in the region}} of low magnetic shear with an ICRH power of 1 MW with no indication of a threshold. In the high performance optimised shear regime, obtained in scenarios dominated by ion heating, internal transport barriers on the ion temperature profiles are simultaneously accompanied by a significant reduction of the electron heat diffusivity at two-third of the plasma radius. In this regime, recent results and measurements obtained with the new gas-box divertor configuration are reported together with their transport analyses. The results indicate that χe is reduced by one order of magnitude in a spatially localised region. Formation of internal transport barriers (ITB) with dominant ion heating schemes has produced high performance plasmas in JET [1 - 2]. In order to extrapolate this regime to fusion tokamak reactors one must establish whether an ITB can be formed and sustained with mostly electron heating and low particle fuelling rates as expected in burning plasmas. To address these long term problems, current profile control experiments performed at JET using dominant electron heating schemes alone together with their analyses are reported in the first section. Then, in th...|$|E

The unique feature of narrow and well-localized power deposition assigns a key role to ECRH for different tasks, such as plasma start-up, electron heating, current drive, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) control and <b>profile</b> <b>shaping.</b> The integration of high-power microwave diplexers in the transmission lines will improve the flexibility and efficiency while simultaneously reducing the complexity of large ECRH systems. They can serve as power or beam combiners, as slow and fast directional switches to toggle the power from continuously operating gyrotrons between two launchers, and as discriminators of low-power electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals from high-power ECRH using a common transmission line and antenna. Among various design options a resonant diplexer with a narrow resonance was selected for application at ASDEX Upgrade.

The concept is based on a combined high-current lens/target configuration. Current is fed at an electrode located downstream {{from the beginning of the}} target where pion capturing is needed. The current is carried by plasma outside the target. A second plasma lens section, with an additional current feed, follows the target. The plasma is immersed in a relatively small solenoidal magnetic field to facilitate its current <b>profile</b> <b>shaping</b> to optimize pion capture. Simulations of the not yet fully optimized configuration yielded a 25 % higher neutrino flux at a detector situated at 3 km from the target than the horn system for the entire enegry spectrum and a factor of 2. 47 higher flux for neutrinos with energy larger than 3 GeV. A major advantage of plasma lenses is in background reduction. In anti-neutrino operation, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of close to 3 for the whole spectrum, and for and for energy larger than 3 GeV, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of 3. 6. Plasma lenses have additional advantages: larger axial currents, high signal purity: minimal neutrino background in anti-neutrino runs. The lens medium consists of plasma, consequently, particle absorption and scattering is negligible. Withstanding high mechanical and thermal stresses in a plasma is not an issue...|$|E

ECRH is used to probe transport features, both in steady state {{and in response to}} time-varying heating, while LHCD is used for current density <b>profile</b> <b>shaping.</b> The experiments clearly show resiliency in the electron temperature profile response to localized ECRH. Central, low gradient plasmas are characterized by low stiffness, {{in the sense that the}} temperature gradient can change with conducted heat flux, and low electron thermal diffusivity. Strong stiffness, in the sense that the temperature gradient length 1 /LT=-T/T does not change significantly even with largely different heating profiles and intensity, and high diffusivity are found in the confinement region (0. 15 <r/a< 0. 5). A particular attention is given to the experimental investigation of the transition layer between low-high diffusivity (and low-high stiffness) regions, which is found at the EC deposition radius rdep in case of powerful ECRH. A transition layer, well identified by heat waves launched by modulated ECH, is found also in plasmas with dominant ohmic heating, showing that it is a local plasma feature, and not merely a consequence of a step-wise increase in the conducted heat flux at rdep. A novel experimental technique providing localized modulation of the temperature gradient shows strong dependence of heat diffusivity on LT at the transition layer. All observations fit well with a critical temperature gradient length modelling of local electron heat transport. 1...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostics at ASDEX Upgrade have {{available}} {{a very large}} number of highly developed measuring channels. The prospect of making this wealth of information usable for plasma optimization led to the implementation of a number of diagnostics running data acquisition in real-time (RT). Ultimately, this development aims to achieve a network of intelligent diagnostics delivering analysed data for high-level plasma performance control such as <b>profile</b> <b>shaping</b> and NTM stabilization. The new RT diagnostics consist of standard industrial 19 " servers organized in clusters and running a standard UNIX multiprocessor RT-capable operating system (RT OS).

40|$|International audienceWe seek to {{understand}} how the stress interactions and the slip-weakening process combine within a non-coplanar, normal fault network to allow a slip instability to develop, and shape the final slip distribution on the system. In a first part, we perform a non-linear spectral analysis to investigate the conditions of stability and the process of slip initiation in an antiplane non-coplanar fault system subject to a slip-dependent friction law. That numerical model allows determining the zones that are able to slip within a fault network, as well as the location of the stress singularities. The resulting slip profiles on the faults show only a few different shapes, some of them with long, linear sections. This leads to formulate a general classification of slip profiles {{that can be used to}} infer the degree of fault interaction within any non-coplanar system. In a second part of work, we use our modelling to try reproducing the cumulative slip profiles measured on three real normal interacting faults forming a large-scale en echelon system. For that, we assume that cumulative slip profiles can be compared to the first static modal solution of our conceptual model. We succeed reproducing the profiles quite well using a variable weakening along the faults. Overall, the weakening rate decreases in the direction of propagation of the fault system. Yet, modelling the slip along the propagating, isolated termination segment of the system requires an unlikely distribution of weakening. This suggests that factors not considered in our analysis may contribute to slip <b>profile</b> <b>shaping</b> on isolated, propagating faults...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses key {{aspects of}} opportunistic multiuser scheduling, {{one of the main}} components of next generation wireless networks responsible for achieving maximum spectrum efficiency and superior user experience. The main topics include the exploitation of multiuser diversity and spatial frequency reuse while maintaining user fairness, the design and analysis of fair scheduling policies that can provide optimal performance, the utilization of historical channel data in scheduling, and the Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantee. First, we consider the scheduling problem in cellular networks which support Device-to-Device Communications (D 2 D). In a D 2 D network, additional communication modes including orthogonal and non-orthogonal D 2 D communications make it very challenging to perform fair resource allocation while maximizing the system performance. Based on the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) scheduling approach, we propose two orthogonal scheduling policies that guarantee access fairness among all users while taking advantage of multi-user diversity and local D 2 D communications. For even higher spectral efficiency, spatial frequency reuse is proposed via our novel Group Fairness Scheduling (GFS) policy, that exploits both spatial frequency reuse and multiuser diversity in order to deliver marked improvements to system performance with perfect fairness among the users. Next, we examine the optimality of opportunistic scheduling under temporal fairness. In general, obtaining the optimal scheduling gain under user fairness or other QoS criteria for a heterogeneous environment is very difficult. Two main methods are proposed to obtain the optimal scheduling solutions under temporal fairness. In the first method, we derive linear program-based scheduling (LPS) algorithms using a window of past Channel State Information (CSI) to compute the scheduling decisions that can approach the optimal policy as the window size gets large. In the second method, we cast the scheduling problem as one of statistical classification and propose a novel supervised classification-based scheduling (SCS) framework for obtaining optimal scheduling decision boundaries. Finally, we address one of the key QoS aspects of opportunistic multiuser scheduling, the user service delay time. Keeping the service delay time under control while maximizing the scheduling gain subject to some fairness criterion is a very hard problem in general. In order to reduce the service delay, we introduce the concept of delay <b>profile</b> <b>shaping.</b> Based on this concept and large system approximations, we develop a novel delay reduction scheme, the Opportunistic Bernoulli Mixing (OBM) policy, which can support different user channel conditions and resource allocation requirements with an excellent performance/delay tradeoff...|$|E
