Leakage and the subsequent loss of ventilation resulting from improperly sealed stoppings can lead to unhealthy and unsafe working conditions. The research presented in this paper investigates the total leakage of a stopping, including air leakage through the stopping, at the stopping perimeter, and through the coalbed. The study also examines sealing considerations for stoppings that are constructed under roof control screen, the effects that wooden wedges had on inhibiting efficient application of polyurethane foam sealant, and airflow leakage through the surrounding coal. The work involved building a stopping in a dead end room of the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine and then pressurising the room using compressed air. Stopping leakage was evaluated by measuring air pressure loss in the enclosed room due to the air leakage. Part of the research utilises a diluted soap solution that was applied to the stopping and the surrounding coal to detect air leakage signified by bubble formations.

40|$|AIMS: A "valve-in-ring" (ViR) {{procedure}} {{involves the}} transcatheter implant of a valved stent in a prosthetic mitral ring. The {{presence of a}} partial dehiscence of the prosthetic ring is a major contraindication for a ViR due to inefficacious sealing. We describe an alternative method of ViR implant to achieve proper valve sealing {{in the case of}} ring dehiscence. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 76 -year-old male patient suffered from severe central mitral regurgitation due to annuloplasty ring dehiscence and leaflet tethering. ECG-gated multidetector computed tomography was used for preoperative planning. Standard transapical access was gained through a minimally invasive left thoracotomy in the 5 th intercostal space. A customised Melody® valve with two PTFE sutures fixed to the apex was used. The intervention was performed without complications, the patient recovered well, and transthoracic echo revealed no mitral regurgitation through the implanted valve with a transvalvular gradient of 4 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: The implantation of a long covered stent such as the Melody valve allows successful sealing following a ViR even in case of partially detached annuloplasty rings.

40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{current study}} is being {{conducted}} {{to better understand}} how interior capillary geometry/design and interior surface treatments may affect the thermal performance of sintered and non-sintered, grooved heat pipes. The thermal performance was quantified by measuring the temperature difference between the evaporator and condenser sections of each heat pipe while varying power inputs.

Temperature differences were measured with four strategically placed thermocouples that were connected to a data acquisition system. Experiments thus far have shown that non-sintered, grooved heat pipes may experience higher heat loads while maintaining a low temperature difference.

40|$|The {{goal for}} this thesis is to {{minimize}} clearances and tolerances, {{in order to}} prevent water leakage. A <b>proper</b> <b>seal</b> on the seal rings does not let excess water flow through the turbine runner, thus conserving more water and wasting less energy. Moreover, water leakage past worn wear plates allows for an extra load for the turbine when operating in condense mode. When the wicket gates are closed, water leakage past worn plates wastes mechanical energy in the water; thus, decreasing the efficiency of the Francis turbine, especially when operating at partial loads. Furthermore, the wicket gates also known as guide vanes can increase the efficiency of the turbine in their relation to their laminar profile and <b>proper</b> <b>seal.</b> Water is a very vital resource in today 2 ̆ 7 s society. This thesis illustrates how existing hydro machinery can be improved to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels as an electric energy source. This study provides actual examples of improvements using the generating units located at Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam located in Boulder City, NV is part of the Lower Colorado Region, of the U. S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation. Overhauling a hydro unit to obtain better efficiency is very similar to overhauling a vehicles engine to improve the vehicles fuel economy. Modifying and replacing three major hydro-machinery components: seal rings, wear plates, and wicket gates, improves the efficiency of Hoover Dam units by an average of 2 percent. This increase in capacity equates to an additional 8, 000 MW-hrs per year per unit. The wholesale market value of this increase in energy and capacity, roughly equates to about 290, 000 per unit per year [1].
