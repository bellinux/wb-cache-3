We use priority to character-ize this rule. Priority is an axiom that high-productive agent should receive less resource than the low-productive one, and should after all get more production than the low-productive. The ethic of impartiality is a fair concept that all the agents in a society are treated differently {{in the sense of}} resource-allocation, only because of their <b>productivity.</b> <b>Agreement</b> means that when productivity of some agents are changed in a society, there are no discriminating treatment for the change of the society between members of a group in which all the productivity of agents are unchanged. Consistency says that although the economy changes, there are no change for personal wealth of a group in which all the productivity of agents are unchanged if the partial given wealth of the group is not changed. We characterize resource-allocation rules that satisfy priority, and agreement, and satisfy priority, consistency, and resource continuity under the ethic of impartiality.

40|$|Recent {{social policy}} and labour markets debates in Europe, {{responding}} to the difficulties faced by the traditional neo-Keynesian welfare state settlement, stress the value of positive investment alongside de-regulation and greater flexibility {{as a way of}} achieving both economic and social goals. •	Patterns of policy reform are complex and reflect differing national circumstances. A general move towards deregulation, constraints on entitlement to passive benefits, programmes to enhance employment, particularly among high-risk groups such as single parents and young people, targeted subsidies for low earners and case-management may be identified. •	In relation to investment in education, research and development and combined training and benefit programmes to enhance mobility between jobs the picture is less clear. Education standards continue to rise, but research and development spending stagnates and few countries have developed substantial ‘flexi-curity’ programmes to support job mobility. •	The labour market tradition in much of Europe has been one of conflict between labour and employers. As labour grows weaker, new approaches develop. These tend to stress <b>productivity</b> <b>agreements</b> and greater flexibility in work practices within firms and reforms to passive social security systems more broadly, but movement to support the more challenging investment and flexi-curity policies is slow. •	In general, social and labour market policies in Europe stress deregulation and negative activation more strongly than social investment and ‘flexi-curity’. The countries with high growth and employment achieve that goal by different routes: Sweden has a closely integrated social democratic corporatism with high spending on benefits and training programmes and the UK a more liberal market-oriented system, with lower spending, highly targeted benefits and less mobility support. •	Europe has something to learn from Korea in achieving high investment in human capital and R and D, while Korea may have something to learn from Europe in social investment, particularly flexi-curity and equal opportunity policies...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to provide an {{analysis}} of the British steel industry's attempts to deal with the reform of industrial relations in the period 1964 - 74, and to evaluate the contribution of productivity bargaining to that process. After a first introductory chapter, Chapters Two to Four are concerned with outlining the industry's problems, the employer's response, and with the negotiation of industry-wide <b>productivity</b> <b>agreements.</b> The contribution of productivity bargaining is evaluated in Chapters Five to Eight in which industrial relations at Corby and Ravenscraig Works are examined. The methods of investigation include the use of primary sources such as private letters, minutes, reports and statistical data, and also published material; this was possible through the author being employed at Ravenscraig during 1965 - 70. Other data was gathered through interviews with union officials and managers at various levels, the interview programme being carried out while the author was employed at the Steel Industry Management College, 1971 - 75. In addition, employee attitude surveys conducted at both Corby and Ravenscraig provided relevant material. The thesis tries to improve understanding of the collective bargaining process by a detailed examination of bargaining structures, by tracing the reaction and interactions of management, unions and work groups to changes in the awareness of their interests as they either react to a structural change or introduce a new one which thereby alters behaviour. The principal arguments are contained in three sequential but integrated hypotheses which identify the key explanatory variables and the nature of their interaction. The main contribution of the thesis is to refine and make more precise the application of both systems theory and job regulation theory to the factory level reform process. The conclusions follow from the testing of the hypotheses and are as follows: (i) The collective bargaining structure is a major variable explaining industrial relations behaviour. (ii) A major weakness of both systems and job regulation theories is the one directional nature of their causal sequence and the thesis illustrates a systematic process of two way interaction between the key structural factors and the behavioural response. (iii) The more centralised, standardised and formalised the key structural variables (that is, the collective bargaining arrangements, management and union organisations) the greater the power of leaders to assist or resist reform. Conversely, the more structures are fragmented with power devolved the weaker the leaderships' influence. (iv) The adherence to a definite causal sequence of key variable interaction increases the probability of a successful outcome. The hypotheses are tested and the conclusions validated in Chapters Five to Eight of the thesis...|$|R

Thus, this paper proposed the use of an alternative trait underlying the selection of resistant genotypes under field conditions with natural infestation: the weightof healthy seeds (WHS). To this end, 24 genotypes were evaluated under two management systems: with systematic chemical control of insects (management I), and without control (management II). Different indices were calculated using grain weight (Y P) of management I and WHS ofmanagement II (Y S).

40|$|Physiological {{processes}} and local-scale structural dynamics of mangroves are relatively well studied. Regional-scale processes, however, {{are not as}} well understood. Here we provide long-term data on trends in structure and forest turnover at a large scale, following hurricane damage in mangrove ecosystems of South Florida, U. S. A. Twelve mangrove vegetation plots were monitored at periodic intervals, between October 1992 and March 2005. Mangrove forests of this region are defined by a − 1. 5 scaling relationship between mean stem diameter and stem density, mirroring self-thinning theory for mono-specific stands. This relationship is reflected in tree size frequency scaling exponents which, through time, have exhibited trends toward a community average that is indicative of full spatial resource utilization. These trends, together with an asymptotic standing biomass accumulation, indicate that coastal mangrove ecosystems do adhere to size-structured organizing principles as described for upland tree communities. Regenerative dynamics are different between areas {{inside and outside of}} the primary wind-path of Hurricane Andrew which occurred in 1992. Forest dynamic turnover rates, however, are steady through time. This suggests that ecological, more-so than structural factors, control forest <b>productivity.</b> In <b>agreement,</b> the relative mean rate of biomass growth exhibits an inverse relationship with the seasonal range of porewater salinities. The ecosystem average in forest scaling relationships may provide a useful investigative tool of mangrove community biomass relationships, as well as offer a robust indicator of general ecosystem health for use in mangrove forest ecosystem management and restoration...|$|R

40|$|A {{redesigned}} proton-transfer-reaction {{mass spectrometer}} was {{deployed in the}} field to measure atmospheric fluxes of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released following the cutting and drying of hay. The instrument has a fast response, around 0. 1 s, allowing use of the eddy covariance technique. Measurements were done over a 3 -day period in a hay field {{in the eastern part of}} Tirol, Austria, in the early growing season and are compared to earlier results obtained using a slower-response instrument in the late growing season [Karl et al., 2000]. Peak upward fluxes of the order of 9. 9 x 10 - 6 g m- 2 s- 1 for methanol, 1. 5 x 10 - 6 g m- 2 s- 1 for acetaldehyde, and 1. 5 x 10 - 6 g m- 2 s- 1 for the sum of hexenals, hexenols, hexanal, pentenols, 3 -methylbutanal, and butanone were observed during and after harvesting. Time-integrated values for the first day were of the order of 65 ± 20 mg m- 2 (130 ± 40 μg per gram dry weight(gdw) - 1) for methanol and 13 ± 4 mg m- 2 (26 ± 8 μg gdw- 1) for acetaldehyde. VOC fluxes measured in this study were generally higher than in August 1999, which can be explained by higher temperatures and higher photosynthetic <b>productivity.</b> Good <b>agreement</b> with another means for estimating VOC fluxes, the surface gradient method, was achieved. This paper presents measurements of eddy covariance for a wide variety of oxygenated VOCs and shows that hay harvesting can influence the local air quality in many regions in the Alps on a short-term basis.

40|$|Productivity {{growth was}} at the heart of the {{economic}} development in the Afterwar period – the so called ‘trentes glorieuses’. These years were characterised by a strong coordination of labour markets, collective agreements that were mainly set at the sectoral level and wage constraint. At this time, the most relevant objectives were a strong competitive economy, a hard currency, low inflation and full employment. It seems that this glorious era has come to an end. Many EU and non-EU countries, such as the UK and the USA, have experienced a labour productivity stagnation or slowdown over the last decade. Academics, policy makers and business leaders are concerned to reverse this trend since “productivity is the ultimate engine of growth in the global economy” (OECD 2015). As the working population is projected to decline with the ageing population, labour productivity growth becomes the sole source for potential average output growth in both the EU and the euro area starting from 2028 (European Commission, 2012). This projection includes both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of growth. Directly linked to productivity stagnation is the issue of inequality and, precisely, wage inequality (Keune, Tomassetti 2016). There is mounting evidence that “increasing inequality may be one of the causes of declining growth, as inequality both impedes improvements in productivity and weakens demand. Low growth, in turn, reinforces inequality by intensifying distributional conflict” (Streeck 2014, 37). Inequality is also likely to increase even more in the years ahead as a consequence of the impact of Industry 4. 0 and the digital evolution of the economy on labour markets and societies (Blasi et al 2013; Etui 2016). On the brink of a new extraordinary age of change – i. e. the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution (Shwab 2016) –, many scholars still disagree over what current technological innovations imply for the future of work and employment relations (Katz et al. 2015). Along with opportunities, new challenges appear in different forms than previous waves of technological change: hybridization between humans and robots; dematerialisation of boundaries between industries; working and doing business anytime, anywhere; labour market polarisation; marginal cost reduction and productivity slowdown. These factors are compounded by an increasingly diverse workforce where tensions exists between inclusion and diversity, impacting on employment relations. There is consensus that investments in technological innovation, research and skills are key drivers for labour productivity. It is also clear that – beside these factors – work organisation plays an important role in enhancing labour productivity and making growth sustainable. Productivity figures (GDP/GVA per hour worked and GDP/GVA per capita) are linked to the output of production and the input of labour. Collective bargaining and other aspects of labour and employment relations play a major role in these figures. Dialogue on productivity issues is important both in terms of consensual labour-management cooperation and as a regulator of wages and conditions of work. Coordination of collective bargaining has a positive impact on economic performance, because it impedes wage competition and enforces companies to increase productivity in order to being able to pay the given wages. At the company level, <b>productivity</b> <b>agreements</b> can result in innovation and enhance performance through compensation and benefits, working time flexibility, Work-life Balance, skills improvements and workers involvement. Furthermore, collective bargaining, especially firm-level bargaining, has always been conceived as a means both to facilitate and react to technological changes. This project is set against a background of institutionalist research which investigates the role of central institutions and actors in the setting and maintenance of employment relations. Drawing on key theories such as regulatory space, varieties of capitalism, regulation theory and coordination theory this research places the productivity bargaining in a theoretical arena to understand the role of productivity bargaining and the coordination of collective bargaining across key European countries. Against this background, this report aims to shed light on the reasons behind labour productivity slowdown or weak growth in some countries, by focusing on the role that employment relations plays behind such a trend. Our goal is to analyse the potential and effective implication of collective bargaining and employment relations on labour productivity, as well as to analyse public policies and social partners’ attitude towards labour productivity in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the UK A note of caution is, however, needed because the relationship between employment relations and the input of labour is at best complex and, if worse, dubious. While the connotation of high productivity and hard work is a very basic one, the actual relationship is likely to be much more complex with influence from smarter working, new technology and research and development investment. Therefore, when comparing figures of productivity GDP growth between countries and sectors, such complexities should be kept in mind. The ‘productivity paradox’ furthermore points to the question to what extent productivity growth gives an accurate figure of productivity as such. The quality of production output may not be taken into account accurately and services that are for free, like some of the services with ICT, do not count to productivity but may still add to prosperity...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{has been}} the {{stumbling}} block {{in the last four}} GATTIWTO rounds, including the ongoing Doha Round. This {{is the result of the}} particular features of the farm regimes in many developed and developing countries in which tariff barriers are just part, and not necessarily the most prominent, of the protectionist measures in the agricultural sector. Indeed, direct and indirect support of market price and of producers' income are not less important in the management of the system. Government also provide support to close the gap between domestic prices and international market prices, allowing their farmers to find foreign outlets for a supply that is constantly growing under the spur of ever-soaring <b>productivity.</b> International <b>agreements</b> can, thus, affect deeply domestic policies of the parties involved in the negotiation. This thesis argues that, hostilities between the two main trade partners in the international farm market, the United States and the European Community, have their roots in the defence of their market share rather than in the conflict between different economic ideologies. In contrast to non-primary products, the agricultural trade rules in the stillborn. Havana Charter and, in the long-lasting GATT allowed wide room for manoeuvre for protectionist and subsidising measures. In the twenty years that followed the coming into being of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the United States tried to secure its market in the member states of the European Community and to curb its growing competitive potential in the world market, but it does not seem that it was ready to make a reshaping of its own system conditional on an international agreement. The strains that afflicted the US and, the EC systems in the early 1980 s had some features in common but their causes and their effects differed. It is, therefore, natural that the attitudes of the parties in the Uruguay Round negotiations differed. The proposals tabled by the United States aimed at a freer market but did not mean the removal of all kinds of government-financed support and above all were bound to impose a much heavier burden on EC farmers than on their US competitors. In tum the European Community was not ready to commit itself to international deals whose effects on its farm policy would go beyond those of the limited domestic reforms agreed on by the member states. Finally, a formally multilateral, but actually bilateral, agreement was reached when the European Community implemented a farm reform that partially replaced its traditional price support system with an income support system similar to that in place in the United States and the latter abandoned its demands for a radical curtailment of domestic and export subsidies and focused on limited commitments that, however, could rein its European competitors' export capacity.

40|$|An {{integrated}} micropalaeontological (planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils), mineralogical {{and stable}} isotope investigation {{was carried out}} across the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary in a previously undescribed hemipelagic section (Forada section) cropping out in the Piave River Valley (Southern Alps, Belluno Province, NE Italy). Our results suggest that an apparently complete K/T transition with an expanded basal Danian is preserved in the Forada section. The K/T boundary {{is marked by a}} ca. 1. 5 - cm-thick clay interval intercalated in the pelagic carbonates of the Scaglia Rossa Formation. The boundary clay, characterised by an iridium anomaly, is constituted by a basal 1 – 2 mm-thick “green layer” and an overlying “red layer”. Below the boundary clay, the calcareous nannofossil Micula murus Zone and the planktonic foraminiferal Plummerita hankteninoides Zone, that characterise the terminal Maastrichtian in complete sections, have been identified. Virtually all the calcareous plankton biohorizons normally utilised in the early Danian have been recognised. Interestingly, the ranking of the various biohorizons is the same observed elsewhere if considering the single plankton groups separately, while several inconsistencies emerge if considering the relative succession of the two calcareous plankton groups simultaneously. We caution to infer hiatuses on a section based only on the spacing of the biohorizons of a single group because of the risk of diachroneities in the stressed early Danian environment. By comparing the “distance” of the key biohorizons (i. e. the First Occurrence (FO) of Cruciplacolithus primus and the Last Occurrence (LO) of Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina) from the boundary clay at Forada and in other complete classical sections, we have inferred that the early Danian is expanded in the Forada section. The section seems ideally suited for studying the recovery pattern of the pelagic ecosystem and calcareous plankton communities {{in the aftermath of the}} K/T catastrophe in a pelagic setting of the western central Tethys. The adaptive radiation of planktonic foraminifera was very rapid in contrast with the delayed diversification of coccolithophores. The latter show a ca. 21 -cm-thick “dead zone” that is followed by a long-lasting survival interval (ca. 180 -cm-thick, that might represent some 200 kyr) dominated by persistent Cretaceous coccolithophores and calcareous dinoflagellate Thoracosphaera spp. The temporal pattern in recovery of the coccolithophore and planktonic foraminiferal communities is decoupled as well pointing to their varying sensitivities to the K/T perturbation. It appears that the ecospace occupied by coccolithophores in the terminal Maastrichtian was occupied in the initial Danian by the calcareous dinoflagellates (Thoracosphaera spp.), that remained a significant component of the assemblage up to the base of the Prinsius dimorphosus Zone of Romein [Romein, A. J. T., 1979. Lineages in Early Paleogene calcareous nannoplankton. Utrecht Micropaleontological Bulletins, 22. 231 pp. ], probably in the early Chron C 29 n. On the contrary,planktonic foraminifera seem to reach stable conditions earlier, in the late Cruciplacolithus primus Zone. The early Danian interval considered is also characterised by low Sr/Ca ratio of the biogenic carbonates that would suggest dramatically low coccolithophore <b>productivity</b> conditions, in <b>agreement</b> with previous flux studies. We speculate that the altered ecological structure of phytoplankton community and the low productivity of coccolithophores severely affected the efficiency of the transfer of organic carbon from the photic zone to the deep ocean, thus supporting the early Danian “living ocean” model of D'Hondt et al. [D'Hondt, S., Donaghay, P., Zachos, J. C., Luttenberg, D., Lindinger, M., 1998. Organic carbon fluxes and ecological recovery from the Cretaceous–Tertiary mass extinction.
