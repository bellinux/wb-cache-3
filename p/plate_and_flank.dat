40|$|A {{procedure}} to standardize camel carcass fabrication is proposed. This includes a definitive method of jointing the carcass into wholesale neck, shoulder, brisket, rib, plate, loin, flank, rump and leg cuts. Carcass cutout {{data were collected}} from the right sides of 21 Najdi male camels averaging 8, 16 and 26 months of age {{in order to determine the}} influence of age on the weight of each wholesale cut. The weight of body, empty body, hot carcass, cold carcass, hump fat, kidney, pelvic and heart fat (KPH) and each wholesale cut increased (P< 0. 01) with age. Except for percent shrinkage and wholesale rump weight, all studied traits increased (P< 0. 01) linearly as the age increased. This change was most pro nounced in wholesale flank and plate cuts, increasing by 4. 2 and 3. 4 times, respectively, while the rump and shoulder cuts changed the least, increasing by 1. 8 and 1. 9 times, respectively. Allometric growth coefficients indicated that as the camel grew, the weight of rib, brisket, <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>flank</b> cuts increased relatively more rapidly than did cold carcass or empty body weight and that the weight of wholesale shoulder, neck, leg and rump increased less rapidly than did cold carcass or empty body weight...|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that subcutaneous (s. c.) adipose tissue would differ in monounsaturated (MUFA) and {{saturated fatty acid}} (SFA) composition among different depots throughout a beef carcass. To test this, 50 carcasses {{from a variety of}} breed types and backgrounds were sampled. External fat samples were collected from eight different carcass locations: round, sirloin, loin, rib, chuck, brisket, <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>flank.</b> Samples were used to provide information on slip points, fatty acid composition and MUFA:SFA ratios. Lipids were extracted from s. c. adipose tissue by a modified chloroform:methanol procedure, and fatty acid composition and slip points were measured. The brisket was significantly lower in palmitic (16 : 0) and stearic (18 : 0) acid than the other seven sampling sites (P = 0. 001). The brisket demonstrated the highest values of MUFA (P = 0. 001) with the exception of possessing the lowest value of transvaccenic (18 : 1 t 11) acid (P = 0. 002). There were also significant differences in the amounts of PUFA among the eight sampling sites. The lowest values were from the brisket with a mean of 25. 1. The flank had the highest slip point with a mean of 39. 0 (P ? 0. 001). There was a high negative correlation shown between palmitoleic and stearic acid (R 2 = 0. 827). The brisket displayed the highest values for MUFA:SFA ratios (P = 0. 001), whereas the flank was the lowest. Due to the significant differences amongst fat depots within bovine carcasses in their fatty acid composition we conclude that substantial differences exist across fat depots...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Feeder lambs (n = 90) were selected to represent the five USDA yield grades (YG). Ewes and wethers (n= 15 for each group) were selected from Suffolk, F 1 (Suffolk X Commercial Rambouillet first cross), and Commercial Rambouillet. Lambs were sorted randomly into one of five YG treatments and placed on a finishing diet. A three-member team of trained livestock evaluators estimated fat thickness in the live lambs. Lambs were slaughtered according to appropriate humane slaughter methods at staggered intervals when evaluators determined that the lambs had reached their assigned endpoint. All carcasses were evaluated for USDA quality and yield grade at 48 hours postmortem. Carcasses were fabricated into a rough leg, loin, rack, shoulder, neck, breasts, shanks, <b>plates,</b> <b>and</b> <b>flanks.</b> The rough subprimals were then split into right and left sides and all right side subprimals were physically dissected into dissectable lean, bone, and fat (subcutaneous, seam, and internal). Dissectable tissues were weighed for each subprimal. Analysis of variance of the means revealed that breed was significant for virtually all subprimals. Sex class was significant for most bone weights and percentages. Mean analysis of percentage total, subcutaneous, seam, and internal fat and percentage lean and bone reveals the high variability between breeds and sex classes within the five yield grades. Regression equations were developed to predict compositional development of percentage lean, bone, and fat (total, subcutaneous, seam fat, and internal) given actual fat thickness. These equations revealed that Suffolk lambs had lower percentages of total and subcutaneous fat than Commercial Rambouillet and Fl lambs, respectively. Commercial Rambouillet lambs were lower for percentage seam fat than Suffolk and Fl lambs, respectively. Carcasses from ewes were slightly higher than their wether counterparts for total, subcutaneous, and internal fat, and percentage lean. Wether carcasses had more seam fat and bone than ewe carcasses. Across the five yield grades, breed and sex-class impact the ultimate composition of lambs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe synchondroses {{consist of}} mirror-image growth <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> are {{critical}} for cranial base elongation, but relatively {{little is known about}} their formation and regulation. Here we show that synchondrosis development is abnormal in Indian hedgehog-null mice. The Ihh−/− cranial bases displayed reduced growth and chondrocyte proliferation, but chondrocyte hypertrophy was widespread. Rather than forming a typical narrow zone, Ihh−/− hypertrophic chondrocytes occupied an elongated central portion of each growth <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> were <b>flanked</b> by immature collagen II-expressing chondrocytes facing perichondrial tissues. Endochondral ossification was delayed in much of the Ihh−/− cranial bases but, surprisingly, was unaffected most posteriorly. Searching for an explanation, we found that notochord remnants near incipient spheno-occipital synchondroses at E 13. 5 expressed Sonic hedgehog and local chondrocytes expressed Patched, suggesting that Shh had sustained chondrocyte maturation and occipital ossification. Equally unexpected, Ihh−/− growth plates stained poorly with Alcian blue and contained low aggrecan transcript levels. A comparable difference was seen in cultured wild-type versus Ihh−/− synchondrosis chondrocytes. Treatment with exogenous Ihh did not fully restore normal proteoglycan levels in mutant cultures, but a combination of Ihh and BMP- 2 did. In summary, Ihh is required for multiple processes during synchondrosis and cranial base development, including growth plate zone organization, chondrocyte orientation, and proteoglycan production. The cranial base appears to be a skeletal structure in which growth and ossification patterns along its antero-posterior axis are orchestrated by both Ihh and Shh...|$|R
40|$|Two major {{signaling}} {{centers have}} been shown to control patterning of sea urchin embryos. Canonical Wnt signaling in vegetal blastomeres and Nodal signaling in presumptive oral ectoderm are necessary and sufficient to initiate patterning along the primary and secondary axes, respectively. Here we define and characterize a third patterning center, the animal pole domain (APD), which contains neurogenic ectoderm, and can oppose Wnt and Nodal signaling. The regulatory influence of the APD is normally restricted to the animal pole region, but can operate in most cells of the embryo because, in the absence of Wnt and Nodal, the APD expands throughout the embryo. We have identified many constituent APD regulatory genes expressed in the early blastula and have shown that expression of most of them requires Six 3 function. Furthermore, Six 3 is necessary for the differentiation of diverse cell types in the APD, including the neurogenic animal <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> immediately <b>flanking</b> ectoderm, indicating that it functions at or near the top of several APD gene regulatory networks. Remarkably, it is also sufficient to respecify the fates of cells {{in the rest of the}} embryo, generating an embryo consisting of a greatly expanded, but correctly patterned, APD. A fraction of the large group of Six 3 -dependent regulatory proteins are orthologous to those expressed in the vertebrate forebrain, suggesting that they controlled formation of the early neurogenic domain in the common deuterostome ancestor of echinoderms and vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that carcass subcutaneous fat location would affect sensory and quality traits. Five carcass fat sources were tested: brisket, chuck, <b>plate,</b> <b>flank,</b> <b>and</b> round. Ground beef was formulated using each fat source and extra-lean beef trim (> 95 % lean) to contain 80 % lean trim and 20 % fat trim. Patties (100 g) were evaluated for color, lipid oxidation, fatty acid composition and consumer evaluation. Flavor was analyzed using a Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) on the headspace above a cooked (74 degrees C) patty {{in a heated}} (60 degrees C) 473 mL glass jar with a solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) fiber. Color, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS), consumer sensory, and cook/freezer loss data showed no differences (P > 0. 05) among carcass locations. Percentage stearic acid was lower (P = 0. 044) in the brisket than in the chuck <b>and</b> <b>flank.</b> The brisket was higher in percentage cis-vaccenic acid (P = 0. 016) and in the saturated fatty acid to monounsaturated fatty acid ratio (P = 0. 018), and lower (P = 0. 004) {{in the percentage of}} total saturated fatty acids than all other sources of subcutaneous fat. Butanedione was highest (P = 0. 013) in the <b>flank</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> fat. Brisket tended to be higher (P = 0. 054) than <b>flank,</b> <b>plate,</b> <b>and</b> round in 1 -octen- 3 -ol. Brisket was higher (P = 0. 008) than chuck, <b>flank,</b> <b>and</b> round, but not different (P > 0. 05) than plate in octanedione. Brisket was higher (P = 0. 003) than all other sources for beefy aroma. Flank was higher (P = 0. 047) than chuck and round for chemical aroma. Brisket was higher (P = 0. 004) than all other sources except flank for floral aromas. Plate was higher (P = 0. 029) than all other sources for heated oil aromas. For secondary aroma descriptor, round was higher (P < 0. 001) than <b>flank,</b> <b>plate,</b> <b>and</b> chuck for dairy. While differences in some key fatty acids and aromatics existed among carcass locations, when the fat was diluted with a common lean source, fat source did not {{have a negative effect on}} sensory or quality traits. Therefore, formulating ground beef using subcutaneous fat from specific locations on a carcass may improve the beef aromatics without negatively affecting sensory or quality traits...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} market for U. S. beef has grown {{dramatically in the}} past decade to the benefit of beef producers. In 1990 U. S. beef and beef variety meat exports amounted to 508, 109 metric tons worth $ 1. 88 billion. By 2000 U. S. beef and beef variety exports grew to 1, 237, 000 metric tons worth $ 3. 6 billion. Why is the {{international market}} important to beef producers? There are several examples that demonstrate the importance of the export market to U. S. beef producers. U. S. beef exports represented 13 % of production in 2000. This is equivalent to 2. 7 billion pounds. 2000 was also the first year the U. S. became the largest beef and beef variety meat exporting country in the world, surpassing Australia. Without the export market the domestic market would have to absorb this product into our marketing channels. There is a perception that the export market is primarily an outlet for U. S. middle meats, which could be easily consumed domestically. This perception is false. The export market is an outlet for beef products that are not readily consumed in the U. S. When dividing the carcass into rounds and chucks, middle meats, thin meats (briskets, short <b>plate,</b> short ribs <b>and</b> <b>flanks),</b> <b>and</b> variety meats, thin meats and variety meats make up the largest exports by volume, 31 % each.

40|$|The {{growth of}} lean from nine {{wholesale}} cuts {{in relation to}} the total lean weight in carcass side were evaluated with three allometric equations for 18 Najdi male camels slaughtered at 8, 16 and 26 months of age. The allometric growth coefficients indicated that as camels grew, weights of lean from brisket <b>and</b> <b>flank</b> cuts increased relatively more rapidly than the total lean in carcass side (β > 1. 1) and that weights of lean from wholesale shoulder and rump cuts increased relatively less rapidly (β > 0. 9) than the total lean weight from carcass side. The growth coefficients for the lean in the thoracic limb and pelvic limb showed a dorsoventral rise in the growth impetus, with coefficients for the thoracic limb correspondingly higher than those of pelvic limb. The growth coefficients for the lean from shoulder, rib, <b>flank</b> <b>and</b> leg cuts increased (P< 0. 01) with increased weight of total lean in carcass side, whereas it decreased with increased total lean weight in carcass side for the lean in neck, brisket, <b>plate,</b> loin <b>and</b> rump cuts. At constant weight of total lean in carcass side, older camels had larger coefficients for lean in neck, brisket, rump, <b>flank</b> <b>and</b> leg cuts, but had smaller coefficients for lean in shoulder, rib, <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> loin cuts...|$|R
