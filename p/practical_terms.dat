5|$|In late June, the Aćimović {{administration}} {{issued an}} ordinance regarding {{the administration of}} the Banat which essentially made the region a separate civil administrative unit {{under the control of the}} local Volksdeutsche under the leadership of Sepp Janko. While the Banat was formally under the jurisdiction of the Aćimović administration, in <b>practical</b> <b>terms</b> it was largely autonomous of Belgrade and under the direction of the military government through the military area command in Pančevo.|$|E
5|$|In <b>practical</b> <b>terms,</b> horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food {{steadily}} throughout the day, {{as they do in}} nature when grazing on pasture. Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, {{it is important to remember}} the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E
5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In <b>practical</b> <b>terms,</b> this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEfficient term {{matching}} {{techniques are}} pre-requisite for <b>practical</b> <b>term</b> rewriting systems, compilers and interpreters. In previous work, {{we proposed a}} new technique to construct deterministic and optimal pattern-matching automata [8 – 11]. As an important result of our work, we now show how deterministic pattern-matching automata can be constructed incrementally. This is important for applications in which the pattern set changes dynamically. A famous example of such an application is the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithms [7]...|$|R
5|$|In <b>practical</b> <b>terms,</b> {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the {{language}} of fraud to justify a fully secret trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E

40|$|In <b>practical</b> <b>term</b> any result {{obtained}} {{using an}} ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator heavily {{depends upon the}} method to determine the weighting vector. Several approaches for obtaining the associated weights have been suggested in the literature, in which none of them took into account the preference of alternatives. This paper presents a method for determining the OWA weights when the preferences of alternatives across all the criteria are considered. An example is given to illustrate this method and an application in internet search engine shows {{the use of this}} new OWA operator...|$|R

The variant's value must decrease during each loop iteration but must never become negative during the correct execution of the loop. Loop variants are used to guarantee that loops will terminate.|$|E
30|$|The authors avoided {{employing}} the term “quality” in this study. As Harvey and Green (1993) observe, this word means five different things: excellence, consistency, fitness for purpose, {{value for money}} and transformational. Excellence and transformational are over-used techno-bureaucratic terms that may prove difficult to define and measure. Fitness for purpose {{is a far more}} readily understood and <b>practical</b> <b>term.</b> It refers to the fulfilment of certain expectations. The notion derives from the manufacturing industry but has been adopted by many educational quality agencies. For these reasons, the authors judged this to be the most appropriate term to use in evaluating OER.|$|R
40|$|The {{populations of}} the seaward {{intertidal}} ends of the 1955 lava flows in Hawaii were studied {{during the first few}} years of their development. Different seral phenomena were recognized such as pioneer colonization, succession, disclimax, and subclimax. The term climax is used as a <b>practical</b> <b>term</b> to denote existence of an equilibrium between the populations and the environment. Appearance of the climax situation seems to be related to stability of the substratum for a period at least as long as six to ten years, but even populations on surfaces as old as 100 years are different from some that are on adjacent prehistoric surfaces...|$|R

50|$|A {{commander-in-chief}} is {{the person}} or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a <b>practical</b> <b>term,</b> it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadership—either a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military.|$|R
40|$|The {{vasodilator}} {{capacity of}} the coronary circulation is an important diagnostic and prognostic characteristic, and its accurate assessment is therefore an important frontier. The coronary flow capacity (CFC) concept was introduced to overcome the limitations {{associated with the use}} of coronary flow reserve (CFR) for this purpose, which are related to the sensitivity of CFR to physiological alterations in systemic and coronary hemodynamics. CFC was developed from positron emission tomography, and was subsequently extrapolated to invasive coronary physiology. These studies suggest that CFC is a robust framework for the identification of clinically relevant coronary flow abnormalities, and improves identification of patients at risk for adverse events over the use of CFR alone. This Review will discuss the concept of CFC, its promises in the setting of ischaemic heart disease, and its challenges both in theoretical and <b>practical</b> <b>term...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} model modifies {{option pricing}} formulas {{for the basic}} case of log-normal probability distribution providing correspondence to formulated criteria of efficiency and completeness. The model is self-calibrating by historic volatility data; it maintains the constant expected value at maturity of the hedged instantaneously self-financing portfolio. The payoff variance dependent on random stock price at maturity obtained under an equivalent martingale measure is taken {{as a condition for}} introduced "mirror-time" derivative diffusion discount process. Introduced ksi-return distribution, correspondent to the found general solution of backward drift-diffusion equation and normalized by theoretical diffusion coefficient, does not contain so-called "long tails" and unbiased for considered 2004 - 2007 S&P 100 index data. The model theoretically yields skews correspondent to <b>practical</b> <b>term</b> structure for interest rate derivatives. The method allows increasing the number of asset price probability distribution parameters. ...|$|R
25|$|For {{a living}} trust, the grantor may retain {{some level of}} control to the trust, such by {{appointment}} as protector under the trust instrument. Living trusts also, in <b>practical</b> <b>terms,</b> tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations. If a living trust fails, the property will usually be held for the grantor/settlor on resulting trusts, which in some notable cases, has had catastrophic tax consequences.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{sanitation}} {{refers to}} the absence of sanitation. In <b>practical</b> <b>terms</b> it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually open defecation (and open urination but this is of less concern) with associated serious public health issues. It is estimated that 2.4 billion people still lacked improved sanitation facilities as of 2015.|$|E

In <b>practical</b> <b>terms</b> this means moose are more vulnerable in areas where wolf or bear populations were decimated {{in the past but}} are now rebounding. These same studies suggest, however, that moose learn quickly and adapt, fleeing an area if they hear or smell wolves, bears, or scavenger birds such as ravens.|$|E
