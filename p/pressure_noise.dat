These changes indicate the amount of material sorbed when a sample enters a column and the amounts desorbed when resolved bands leave. A differential capillary flow meter is used in our apparatus to measure these changes. The pressure sensing element in the flow meter is a tensioned-diaphragm differential pressure transducer.

40|$|We {{describe}} an experimental conceptual design for observation and reduction of radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise.</b> The radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise</b> is increased {{in a high}} finesse cavity with a small mass mirror. In our experiment a Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer with a homodyne detection scheme will be built with Fabry-Perot cavities of finesse of 10000 containing suspended mirrors of 23 mg. To observe the radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise,</b> the goal sensitivity is set to 1 × 10 ^(- 17) [m/√Hz] at 1 kHz. Then the radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise</b> is reduced by adjusting the homodyne phase. To achieve the sensitivity, the other noise sources such as thermal noises, seismic noise and laser frequency noise should be suppressed below 1 × 10 ^(- 18) [m/√Hz] at 1 kHz. The whole interferometer is suspended as a double pendulum on double-layer stacks. As a preliminary setup, a Fabry-Perot cavity of finesse of 800 with a suspended mirror of 100 mg was locked. The current best sensitivity is 1 × 10 ^(- 15) [m/√Hz] at 1 kHz. ...|$|E
40|$|Quantum {{fluctuations}} in the radiation pressure of light can excite stochastic motions of mechanical oscillators thereby realizing a linear quantum opto-mechanical coupling. When performing a precise measurement {{of the position of}} an oscillator, this coupling results in quantum radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise.</b> Up to now this effect has not been observed yet. Generally speaking, the strength of radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise</b> increases when the effective mass of the oscillator is decreased or when the power of the reflected light is increased. Recently, extremely light SiN membranes (≈ 100 ng) with high mechanical Q values at room temperature (≥ 10 ^ 6) have attracted attention as low thermal noise mechanical oscillators. However, the power reflectance of these membranes is much lower than unity (< 0. 4 at a wavelength of 1064 nm) which makes the use of advanced interferometer recycling techniques to amplify the radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise</b> in a standard Michelson interferometer inefficient. Here, we propose and theoretically analyze a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer that includes the membrane as a common end mirror for the Michelson interferometer part. In this topology, both power and signal recycling can be used even if the reflectance of the membrane is much lower than unity. In particular, signal recycling is a useful tool because it does not involve a power increase at the membrane. We derive the formulas for the quantum radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise</b> and the shot noise of an oscillator position measurement and compare them with theoretical models of the thermal noise of a SiN membrane with a fundamental resonant frequency of 75 kHz and an effective mass of 125 ng. We find that quantum radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise</b> should be observable with a power of 1 W at the central beam splitter of the interferometer and a membrane temperature of 1 K...|$|E

The sensitivity of the interferometric gravitational wave detectors, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO), is limited by quantum shot noise, quantum radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise,</b> {{and a set of}} classical noises.

The well response is usually monitored during {{a relatively short period of}} time, depending upon the test objectives. Reservoir properties are determined from well test data via an inverse problem approach. Uncertainty is inherent in any nonlinear inverse problem. Unfortunately, well test interpretation suffers particularly from a variety of uncertainties that, when combined, reduce the confidence that can be associated with the estimated reservoir properties.

40|$|Quantum {{enhanced}} sensing is {{a powerful}} technique in which nonclassical states are used to improve the sensitivity of a measurement. For enhanced mechanical displacement sensing, squeezed states of light {{have been shown to}} reduce the photon counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been predicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should produce an unavoidable increase in radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise</b> that drives the mechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far been hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal mechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the delicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum enhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical system, we observe the nonclassical radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>noise</b> that necessarily accompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying both the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental trade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement is further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the mechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be exploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the amplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal noise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a mechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne efficiency of 94 %. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical motion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical light enhances the measurement of the motion.
