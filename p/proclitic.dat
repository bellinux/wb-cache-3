25|$|Brazilians {{normally}} {{place the}} object pronoun before the verb (<b>proclitic</b> position), as in ele me viu ("he saw me"). In many such cases, the proclisis {{would be considered}} awkward or even grammatically incorrect in EP, in which the pronoun is generally placed after the verb (enclitic position), namely ele viu-me. However, formal BP still follows EP in avoiding starting a sentence with a <b>proclitic</b> pronoun; so both will write Deram-lhe o livro ("They gave him/her the book") instead of Lhe deram o livro, though it will seldom be spoken in BP (but would be clearly understood).|$|E
25|$|The Lukunosh dialect of Mortlockese has two 3rd person pronouns. The {{independent}} {{forms of}} the 3rd person singular and plural are /ii/ and /iir/ respectively. These change forms depending on if it {{is used as a}} subject <b>proclitic,</b> direct object suffix, or possessive suffix.|$|E
25|$|In general, the dialects {{that gave}} birth to Portuguese had a quite {{flexible}} use of the object pronouns in the <b>proclitic</b> or enclitic positions. In Classical Portuguese, the use of proclisis was very extensive, while, on the contrary, in modern European Portuguese the use of enclisis has become indisputably majoritary.|$|E
25|$|In {{western and}} {{southern}} Jutish dialects of Danish, æ {{is also the}} <b>proclitic</b> definite article: æ hus (the house), as opposed to Standard Danish and all other Nordic varieties which have enclitic definite articles (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian: huset, Icelandic, Faroese: húsið (the house)). The dialects are rarely committed to writing, except for some dialect literature.|$|E
25|$|Tense is {{normally}} {{indicated by the}} use of a particular verb form – either an inflected form of the main verb, or a multi-word construction, or both in combination. Inflection may involve the use of affixes, such as the -ed ending that marks the past tense of English regular verbs, but can also entail stem modifications, such as ablaut, as found in the strong verbs in English and other Germanic languages, or reduplication. Multi-word tense constructions often involve auxiliary verbs or clitics. Examples which combine both types of tense marking include the French passé composé, which has an auxiliary verb together with the inflected past participle form of the main verb; and the Irish past tense, where the <b>proclitic</b> do (in various surface forms) appears in conjunction with the affixed or ablaut-modified past tense form of the main verb.|$|E
25|$|According to the most-common analysis, the Otomi {{language}} has {{two kinds of}} bound morphemes, proclitics and affixes. Proclitics differ from affixes mainly in their phonological characteristics– they are marked for tone and block nasal harmony. Some authors consider proclitics to be better analyzed as prefixes. Orthographically, the standard orthography writes proclitics as separate words, whereas affixes are written joined to their host root. Most affixes are suffixes and with few exceptions occur only on verbs, whereas the proclitics occur both in nominal and verbal paradigms. Proclitics mark the categories of definiteness and number, person, negation, tense and aspect – often fused in a single <b>proclitic.</b> Suffixes mark direct and indirect objects, as well as clusivity (the distinction between inclusive and exclusive we), number, location and affective emphasis. Historically, as in other Oto-Manguean languages, the basic word order is verb–subject–object (VSO), but some dialects tend towards subject–verb–object (SVO) word order, probably under influence from Spanish. Possessive constructions use the order possessed-possessor but modificational constructions use modifier-head order.|$|E
25|$|Level I is {{typically}} used by non-age-mates and non-intimates and is unmarked {{in terms of}} prefixation or suffixation of the listener and verbs. Level II is marked by the prefix on- on the verb and is used between intimates. Some Nahuatl speakers have been observed to alternate between Level I and Level II for one listener. The use of both levels is believed to show some respect or to not subordinate the listener. Level III is marked by the prefix on-, the reflexive prefix mo-, and an appropriate transitivizing suffix based on the verb stem. Verbs in Level III may additionally be marked with the reverential suffix –tzinōa. Finally, Level IV {{is typically}} used between people who share a ritual kinship relationship (e.g. parent with godparent, godparent with godparent of the same child). Level IV {{is marked by a}} <b>proclitic</b> (i.e. word that depends on the following word and works similarly to an affix, such as the word “a” or “an” in English) ma. Another important aspect of Level IV is that it addresses the listener in 3rd person whereas Level I through III all use 2nd person forms. By using this 3rd person form, maximal social distance is achieved.|$|E

2500|$|Proclitics (clitics which {{latch on}} to a {{following}} word), {{on the other}} hand, can [...] "steal" [...] a falling tone (but not a rising tone) from the following mono- or disyllabic word (as seen in the examples /vîdiːm/→/ně‿vidiːm/, /ʒěliːm/→/ne‿ʒěliːm/). This stolen accent is always short, and may end up being either falling or rising on the <b>proclitic.</b> This phenomenon, although obligatory in Neoštokavian idiom and so in all three standard languages, is often lost in spoken idioms from the influence of other dialects (such as in Zagreb, the influence of Kajkavian dialect).|$|E
2500|$|Verbs are inflected {{for either}} direct object or {{indirect}} object (but not for both simultaneously) by suffixes. The categories of person of subject, tense, aspect, and mood are marked simultaneously with a formative which {{is either a}} verbal prefix or a <b>proclitic</b> depending on analysis. These proclitics can also precede nonverbal predicates. The dialects of Toluca and Ixtenco distinguish the present, preterit, perfect, imperfect, future, pluperfect, continuative, imperative, and two subjunctives. Mezquital Otomi has additional moods. On transitive verbs, {{the person of the}} object is marked by a suffix. If either subject or object is dual or plural, it is shown with a plural suffix following the object suffix. So the structure of the Otomi verb is as follows: ...|$|E
