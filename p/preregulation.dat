40|$|This study assesses whether California’s minimum nurse {{staffing}} legislation {{affected the}} amount of uncompensated care provided by California hospitals. Using data from California’s Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, the American Hospital Association Annual Survey and InterStudy, the authors divide hospitals into quartiles based on <b>preregulation</b> staffing levels. Controlling for other factors, they estimate changes in {{the growth rate of}} uncompensated care in the three lowest staffing quartiles relative to the quartile of hospitals with the highest staffing level. The sample includes short-term general hospitals over the period 1999 to 2006. The authors find that growth rates in uncompensated care are lower in the first three staffing quartiles as compared with the highest quartile; however, results are statistically significant only for county and for-profit hospitals in Quartiles 1 and 3. The authors conclude that minimum nurse staffing ratios may lead some hospitals to limit uncompensated care, likely due to increased financial pressure...|$|E
40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) {{is associated}} with brain abnormalities in the areas that regulate emotions, and it is postulated that people with OCD have difficulty downregulating (= reducing) their negative emotions. This study recruited 20 participants with OCD and 20 controls to rate 294 emotional photos (emotional stimuli not related to OCD) for emotional valence. Participants {{were then asked to}} downregulate while they saw the 20 photos with the highest negative ratings and 20 photos with the highest positive ratings. Participants with OCD had more difficulty downregulating their negative emotions than controls. Evidence for that is that (1) participants with OCD gave significantly higher ratings to the affectively negative photos in the postregulation phase, after adjusting for their <b>preregulation</b> ratings and (2) participants with OCD took significantly more time to regulate both their negative and positive emotions. The findings suggest that individuals with OCD not only present with the symptoms that are specified in the OCD diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), but also with difficulty downregulating their negative emotions to non obsessive-compulsive (nonOC) affectively negative stimuli. Clinicians may consider adding emotion regulation skills to psychological treatments of OCD. published_or_final_versionClinical PsychologyDoctoralDoctor of Psycholog...|$|E
40|$|Uranium and its {{associated}} trace elements and radionuclides are ubiquitous in the South Texas Tertiary environment. Surface mining of this resource from the 1960 ’s through the early 1980 's at over 60 locations has left an extensive anthropological footprint (Fig. 1) in the lower Nueces and San Antonio river basins. Reclama-tion of mining initiated after 1975 has been under the regulatory authority of the Railroad Commission of Texas (RCT). However, mines that were active before the Texas Surface Mining Act of 1975 was enacted, and never reclaimed, are now considered abandoned. The Abandoned Mine Land Section of the RCT is currently reclaiming these <b>preregulation</b> uranium mines with funding from the federal government. The RCT monitors the overall effectiveness of this process through postreclamation radiation and vegetative cover surveys, water quality testing, slope stability and erosion control monitoring. Presently a number of graduate and postgradu-ate students are completing research on the watershed and reservoir distribution of trace elements and radionuclides downstream of the South Texas Uranium District. The question remains {{as to whether the}} ele-vated levels of uranium, {{its associated}} trace elements and radiation levels in the South Texas environment are due to mining activity or natural geological abundance. An answer to such an environmental geology question can be resolved through the spatial analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The compilation o...|$|E
40|$|Since new {{drinking}} water regulations were implemented in England and Wales in 2000, cryptosporidiosis has been significantly reduced {{in the first}} half of the year but not in the second. We estimate an annual reduction in disease of 905 reported cases and ≈ 6, 700 total cases. Cryptosporidiosis is a common cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. In England and Wales, ≈ 4, 500 cases are reported each year (1). In the 1990 s, several cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in England and Wales were associated with public {{drinking water}} supplies; in 2000, new drinking water regulations were implemented to address this problem. Risk assessments were required at all water treatment plants, and those that did not meet the standards were required to monitor regularly for Cryptosporidium spp. Consequently, water companies closed some plants, upgraded others, and paid close attention to the maintenance and operation of their works (2). Since these regulations were implemented, a reduction in reported cases of cryptosporidiosis, especially the disappearance of the spring peak, has been reported in northwestern England (3). The aim of our research was to quantify the public health impact of the regulations by assessing whether they have led to statistically significant reductions in cryptosporidiosis. The Study All cases of cryptosporidiosis in England and Wales reported to national surveillance from 1989 through mid- 2005 were analyzed; those associated with recent foreign travel were excluded. The average weekly number of cryptosporidiosis cases <b>preregulation</b> (1989 – 1999) were plotted against the same data postregulation (2000 – 2005) (Figure). Since the regulations were implemented, fewe...|$|E
40|$|Regulation and {{fragmentation}} by dams {{belong to}} the most widespread deliberate impacts of humans on the world's rivers, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. We evaluated the effects of hydroelectric development by comparing the flora of vascular plants in 200 -m-long reaches of river margin distributed along eight entire rivers in northern Sweden. Four of these rivers were free-flowing, and four were strongly regulated for hydroelectric purposes. First, we compared species diversity per site between entire free-flowing and regulated rivers. To reduce the effects of natural, between-river variation, we compared adjacent rivers. One regulated river had lower plant species richness and cover than two adjacent free-flowing ones, whereas two other parallel rivers, one regulated and another free-flowing, did not differ significantly. Second, river-margin vegetation responded differently to different types of regulated water-level regimes. Both along run-of-river impoundments, with small but daily water-level fluctuations, and along storage reservoirs, with large fluctuations between low water levels in spring and high levels in late summer and fall, {{the number of species}} and their cover per site were lower than along the free-flowing rivers. Regulated but unimpounded reaches were most similar to free-flowing rivers, having lower plant cover per site, but similar numbers of species. For reaches with reduced discharge, evidence was mixed; some variables were lower compared to free-flowing rivers whereas others were not. However, for the last two types of regulation, statistical power was low due to small sample sizes. Third, we classified all plant species according to their dispersal mechanisms and tested whether they respond differently to different types of regulated water-level regimes. Three out of four types of regulation had higher proportions of wind-dispersed species, and two out of four had lower proportions of species without specific mechanisms for dispersal, compared to free-flowing rivers, suggesting that dispersal ability is critical for persistence following regulation. Run-of-river impoundments had higher proportions of long-floating species and species with mechanisms for vegetative dispersal, suggesting that water dispersal may still be important despite fragmentation by dams. Fourth, plant species richness and cover varied with both local factors, such as water-level regime, and regional factors, such as length of the growing season. Presence of clay and silt in the river-margin soil, <b>preregulation</b> position of the contemporary river margin, non-reservoir sites, low altitudes, and long growing seasons were associated with high plant species richness and cover...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. There is an increasing need for AC-DC converters to draw a pure sinusoidal current at near unity power factor from the AC mains. Most conventional power factor correcting systems employ PWM techniques to overcome the poor power factor being presented to the mains. However, the need for smaller and lighter power processing equipment has motivated the use of higher internal conversion frequencies in the past. In this context, resonant converters are becoming {{a viable alternative to}} the conventional PWM controlled power supplies. The thesis presents the implementation of active power factor correction in power supplies, using resonance mode techniques. It reviews the PWM power factor correction circuit topologies previously used. The possibility of converting these PWM topologies to resonant mode versions is discussed with a critical assessment as to the suitability of the semiconductor switching devices available today for deployment in these resonant mode supplies. The thesis also provides an overview of the methods used to model active semiconductor devices. The computer modelling is done using the PSpice microcomputer simulation program. The modifications that are needed to the built in MOSFET model in PSpice, when modeling high frequency circuits is discussed. A new two transistor model which replicates the action of a OTO thyristor is also presented. The new model enables the designer to estimate the device parameters with ease by adopting a short calculation and graphical design procedure, based on the manufacturer's data sheets. The need for a converter with a high efficiency, larger power/weight ratio, high input power factor with reduced line current distortion and reduced cost has {{led to the development of}} a new resonant mode converter topology, for power processing. The converter presents a near resistive load to the mains thus ensuring a high input power factor, while providing a stabilised de voltage at the output with a small lOOHz ripple. The supply is therefore ideal for <b>preregulation</b> applications. A description of the modes of operation and the analysis of the power circuit are included in the thesis. The possibility of using the converter for low output voltage applications is also discussed. The design of a 300 W, 80 kHz prototype model of this circuit is presented in the thesis. The design of the isolation transformer and other magnetic components are described in detail. The selection of circuit components and the design and implementation of the variable frequency control loop are also discussed. An evaluation of the experimental and computer simulated results obtained from the prototype model are included in the presentation. The thesis further presents a zero-current switching quasi-resonant flyback circuit topology with power factor correction. The reasons for using this topology for off-line power conversion applications are discussed. The use of a cascoded combination of a bipolar power transistor and two power MOSFETs i the configuration has enabled the circuit to process moderate levels of power while simultaneously switching at high frequencies. This fulfils the fundamental precondition for miniaturisation. It also provides a well regulated DC output voltage with a very small ripple while maintaining a high input power factor. The circuit is therefore ideal for use in mobile applications. A preliminary design of the above circuit, its analysis using PSpice, the design of the control circuit, current limiting and overcurrent protection circuitry and the implementation of closed-loop control are all included in the thesis. The experimental results obtained from a bread board model is also presented with an evaluation of the circuit performance. The power factor correction circuit is finally installed in this supply and the overall converter performance is assessed...|$|E
