40|$|Background & Objective: It's been {{considered}} that midbrain region namely rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is the coring point of modulation of pain. The <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>gray</b> (PAG) <b>matter</b> {{has been documented}} to act as antinociceptive along with RVM. However, there are evidences demonstrating that RVM get a few connections from the cuneiformsnucleus (CnF) which might indicate CnF does have the same mechanism as PAG. Thus in this study, we tried to explore the antinociception effects of CnF and GABAA circuits.  Methods: Rats were anesthetized with Thiopental drug. Using the stereotaxic apparatus and Paxinos atlas, the point representing for CnF location over the scalp has been designated. One week after the surgery, rats were fully prepared for tests. Animals were put in three groups. First for control group, 0. 5 µl of normal saline was injected into the CnF. Later, a few nanograms of bicucculline (as a GABAA antagonist) were administered into the CnF, dose dependently.  Results: From the results, {{it has been shown}} that CnF has a role in antinociception effect since the injection of bicucculline increased tail flick latency (TFL) and even further increased TFL when administered dose dependently (with high doses).  Conclusion: According to results of current study, CnF has a significant role in pain modulation and circuits of GABAergic system also plays a key role on its antinociception effect...|$|R

The formalin test {{was used as a}} model of persistent pain. Intra-PAG microinjections of (S) - 3, 5 -DHPG (25 and 50 nmol/mouse) and L-CCG-I (30 and 60 nmol/mouse), agonists of group I and group II mGluRs, respectively, decreased the nociceptive response (- 92 +/- 6 % and - 89 +/- 8 %, respectively) during the late phase. No change of the early nociceptive phase was observed after (S) - 3, 5 -DHPG or L-CCG-I treatments. These effects were antagonized by a pretreatment with CPCCOEt (40 nmol/mouse) and (2 S) -alpha-EGlu (30 nmol/mouse). CPCCOEt is a selective antagonist of group I mGlu receptors, while (2 S) -alpha-EGlu is an antagonist of group II. Intra-PAG microinjections of L-SOP (60 and 120 nmol/mouse), a selective agonist of group III mGluRs, induced an increase of the nociceptive response (+ 95 +/- 7 %) during the late hyperalgesic phase. (R,S) -alpha-M-SOP (70 nmol/mouse), a selective antagonist of group III mGluRs, completely antagonized the L-SOP-induced effect.

Male Swiss mice (12 weeks old, 25 - 35 g, N = 8 - 14 /group) were stereotaxically implanted with a 7 -mm cannula aimed at the dPAG. Intra-dPAG NOC- 9 (75 nmol) produced defensive-like behavior (jumping and running) and antinociception (assessed by the formalin test). Both effects were reversed by prior local infusion of NBI 27914 (2 nmol). Conversely, intra-dPAG NPLA (0. 4 nmol) did not modify the anxiogenic/antinociceptive effects of CRF (150 pmol).

40|$|Abstract — Aim: Presented is the neuroradiological {{signature}} of acute Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE), derived from {{different types of}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. WE results from thiamine depletion, and its most typical antecedent is chronic alcohol dependence. Brain regions observed with in vivo MRI affected in acute WE include the mammillary bodies, <b>periaqueductal</b> and periventricular <b>gray</b> <b>matter,</b> collicular bodies and thalamus. These affected areas are usually edematous and are best visualized and quantified with MRI sequences that highlight such tissue. Following the acute WE phase and resolution of edema and inflammation of affected brain tissue, WE, if not adequately treated with thiamine repletion, can herald Korsakoff’s syndrome (KS), with its symptomatic hallmark of global amnesia, that is, the inability to commit newly encountered (episodic) information to memory for later recall or recognition. Methods: Neuropathology of KS detectable with MRI has a different neuroradiological signature from the acute stage and can be observed as tissue shrinkage or atrophy of selective brain structures, including the mammillary bodies and thalamus and ventricular expansion, probably indicative of atrophy of surrounding <b>gray</b> <b>matter</b> nuclei. Quantification of these and additional <b>gray</b> <b>matter</b> structures known to underlie global amnesia reveal substantial bilateral volume deficits in the hippocampus, {{in addition to the}} mammillary bodies and thalamus, and modest deficits in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca.

40|$|Previous {{findings}} suggest that spinal manual therapy (SMT) {{has the ability to}} induce pain relief and increase sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. This is suggested to occur due to stimulation of the descending inhibitory pathways, projecting from the dorsi <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>gray</b> (dPAG) <b>matter</b> of the midbrain. The current study investigated the effects of grade III posteroanterior mobilisations to three thoracic vertebrae, utilising pain pressure threshold (PPT) and SNS activity as measures. PPT was measured at T 4 only in order to compare the effects of mobilising a vertebra directly as well as above and below. 12 healthy male participants (age 77. 3 ± 11. 2 : height, 76. 6 cm ± 11. 3 : mass, 80. 9 kg ± 12. 5) took part in this randomised, repeated measures, cross-over design study. Results reflected an immediate hypoalgesic effect of spinal manual therapy, demonstrated through increased PPT, occurring concurrently alongside increased SNS measures of skin conductance (SC). PPT percentage change (PC) was higher in adjacent vertebrae in comparison to T 4, however a Friedman’s test revealed {{no significant difference between the}} three vertebrae mobilised (χ 22 = 3. 167, P = 0. 205). Therefore SMT demonstrated global effects as well as local.
