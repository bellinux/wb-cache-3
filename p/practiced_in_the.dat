5|$|A {{gristmill}} {{built at}} the mouth of the creek was one of the first manufacturing buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large sawmill was constructed on Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The sawmill was also expanded and six dams were constructed on the creek. The total cost of this project was $100,000. Agriculture was another industry that was <b>practiced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of the creek in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley.|$|E

5|$|In early 1916, UB-7 and UB-8 {{were still}} {{cruising}} in the Black Sea out of Varna. The Germans {{did not have}} good luck in the Black Sea, which was not a priority for them. The Bulgarians, who saw {{the value of the}} submarines in repelling Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase UB-7 and UB-8. Bulgarian sailors <b>practiced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there. The transfer of UB-8 to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916, but for reasons unreported in sources, UB-7 remained under the German flag.|$|E
5|$|White {{was one of}} two {{physicians}} {{practicing in}} Frederick County along with Daniel Hart (died about 1748). White practiced from his residence near Great North Mountain, and one of his more notable patients was Colonel James Wood, founder of Winchester, Virginia. White's son Alexander married Wood's daughter, Elizabeth Wood. White was part a larger wave of Scottish physicians who settled in Virginia prior to the American Revolutionary War. White's alma mater, the University of Edinburgh, was a leading center of medical education and research, and the school trained more physicians than were needed in Scotland. Unlike White, the majority of Scottish physicians <b>practiced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main centers of population in the colonial port cities.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their initial seasons, they struggled financially. A key event in franchise history occurred in the 11th game of the Giants inaugural season. The Chicago Bears, led by star running back Red Grange, came to town attracting a then pro football record 73,000 fans, and giving the Giants a much needed financial influx. The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL. After these initial struggles, the Giants financial status stabilized, and they {{led the league in}} attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s. By the early 1960s, the Giants had firmly established themselves as one of the league's biggest attractions. However, rather than continue to receive their higher share of the league television revenue, the Mara sons pushed for equal sharing of revenue {{for the benefit of the}} entire league. Revenue sharing is still <b>practiced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL today, and is credited with strengthening the league.|$|E

5|$|The Order {{remained}} in collateral {{branches of the}} family of the Dukes of Jülich and Berg until 1521, when the male line holding the two duchies and the county of Ravensberg became extinct. A daughter, Maria von Geldern, remained to inherit the duchies and the county, but, under the Salic law <b>practiced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern German states, women could only hold property through a husband or guardian. Consequently, the territories passed to her husband—who was also her distant relative—John III, Duke of Cleves and Mark. The couple had three daughters, one of whom, Ann of Cleves, married Henry VIII of England in 1540, and one son, Wilhelm, who subsequently inherited the duchies and the administration of the Order. The duchies included most of the present-day North Rhine-Westphalia that lay outside the ecclesiastical territories of the Electorate of Cologne and Münster. Wilhelm was known as Wilhelm the Rich.|$|E

40|$|Information {{management}} training has been neglected <b>in</b> family <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. An adult learning model for such training is introduced. A pilot study using the adult learning approach showed improvements in information management processes over the six-month study period. The research project {{described in this}} paper compares the effectiveness of on-site training using adult learning methods, written information, and no intervention, <b>in</b> 33 family <b>practices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. Nine of <b>the</b> eleven <b>practices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> on-site training group completed the training sessions and eight provided full data, whereas only one of <b>the</b> eleven <b>practices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> written information group, and only one of <b>the</b> eleven <b>practices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group provided full data. Preliminary analysis demonstrates that on-site training practices made considerable changes to <b>the</b> information systems <b>in</b> their <b>practices,</b> and appreciated the importance of high-quality data, both for patient care and reporting requirements. Full comparisons of data quality and information management methods are presented, and an assessment of priority training needs for maximum benefit is made...|$|R
