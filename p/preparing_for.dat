40|$|Background: Postgraduate medical {{education}} training programs strive to prepare their trainees optimally for independent practice. Several studies have shown, however, that new consultants feel inadequately <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> practice, {{and that this}} {{increases the risk of}} stress and burnout. Aim: To analyze across specialties for which tasks and themes new consultants feel inadequately prepared. And, to identify themes that need improved attention in postgraduate {{medical education}} programs or after registration. Methods: 330 New consultants from all hospital specialities with accredited training programs who completed their training in the north-eastern educational region of The Netherlands between 2004 and 2010 received a questionnaire which was based on a previously validated generic task inventory. Results: 143 respondents (43 %) returned the questionnaire. They felt excellently <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> 40 tasks, well <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> 25 tasks, marginally sufficiently <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> 18 tasks and insufficiently <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> 8 tasks. Preparedness scores were lowest for tasks concerning management administration and leadership, research, end-of-life care, and patient safety-related communication. Surgical specialists felt better <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> practice than medical specialists, which could not be explained by differences in general self-efficacy. Conclusion: Although new consultants felt well <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> medical tasks, the scores of more generic tasks indicate that the alignment between the different phases of the medical education continuum and independent practice needs improvement...|$|R

5|$|Although Etty painted {{many private}} portraits {{of his friends}} and acquaintances, he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Portraiture was seen as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class. Other than <b>Preparing</b> <b>for</b> a Fancy Dress Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. <b>Preparing</b> <b>for</b> a Fancy Dress Ball did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E
