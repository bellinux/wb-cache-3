5000|$|It {{consisted}} of two sticks crossed together in the centre and set on a <b>swivel</b> <b>pin</b> in a block of wood called the Stoc. A pin of wood is fixed {{in each of the}} four extremities of the sticks, and round thus, a hank of thread is placed, which is unravelled and made into a ball, as the operator spins the instrument round.|$|R
50|$|In 1951 a KCWBC VIII {{was entered}} {{for the first}} time into the University Women's Rowing Association Eights Regatta in Oxford. It was also the first time that they had rowed on <b>swivel</b> <b>pins.</b> The crew made it through to the second round where they drew with Oxford, forcing a half course re-row which they regrettably lost. However, the same year saw the club win the Durham Intercollegiate Ladies Challenge Cup.|$|R
50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the <b>swivel</b> <b>pin</b> ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the stub axle of the steered wheels via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm.|$|R
40|$|A <b>pivot</b> (<b>swivel,</b> rotating) {{chair is}} {{considered}} as an i/o de-vice, an information appliance. The input modality is ori-entation tracking, which can dynamically select transfer functions used to spatialize audio in a rotation-invariant soundscape. In groupware situations, like teleconferenc-ing or chat spaces, such orientation tracking {{can also be}} used to twist iconic representations of a seated user, avatars in a virtual world, enabling social situation awareness via coupled visual displays, soundscape-stabilized virtual source locations, and direction-dependent projection of non-omnidirectional sources. For audio output modal-ity, the system can present unencumbered binaural sound with soundscape stabilization for multichannel sound im-age localization. The Internet Chair, manifesting as per-sonal lbe (location-based entertainment) is potentially useful in both stand-alone and networked applications...|$|R
50|$|A vacuum vise is a hobbyist's tool, {{commonly}} used to hold circuit boards, model airplanes and other small work. They are mounted with a suction cup and often have an articulated joint in the middle to allow the vise to <b>pivot</b> and <b>swivel.</b> Jewelers also use vacuum vises to hold jewelry.|$|R
50|$|Rowlock - Pronounced Rolick. A 'U' shaped metal {{device that}} secures an oar and {{acts as a}} fulcrum during the motion of rowing. Sometimes called an oarlock in the USA. The Rowlock is {{attached}} with a <b>swivelling</b> <b>pin</b> to the gunwale in a row boat. Commonly made from galvanized steel, bronze or plastic. Before the availability of metal the oar was normally levered against 2 wooden pins called Thole pins inserted in the gunwale. Tholepins are still used in some third world nations. In a narrow row boat the rowlocks are held well outboard in a lightweight outrigger (rigger) which is often equipped with a locking pin to hold the oar securely.|$|R
50|$|An {{internal}} combustion engine is acted upon by {{the pressure of the}} expanding combustion gases in the combustion chamber space {{at the top of the}} cylinder. This force then acts downwards through the connecting rod and onto the crankshaft. The connecting rod is attached to the piston by a <b>swivelling</b> gudgeon <b>pin</b> (US: wrist pin). This pin is mounted within the piston: unlike the steam engine, there is no piston rod or crosshead (except big two stroke engines).|$|R
40|$|Release {{mechanism}} ensures reliable {{separation of}} structural members while imparting minimal impulse to members. Includes {{set of three}} hooks and pistons holding toggle and thereby clamp plate to body of mechanism. In locked position, pistons down, and hooks held against toggle. In unlocked position, pistons up. Notches in pistons let hook <b>swivel</b> on <b>pivot</b> <b>pins.</b> Functions even when two of its three key elements fail...|$|R
50|$|Name tags may be {{attached}} to garments with adhesive or worn {{with the assistance of}} a magnet or pin. Plastic or metal name tags can {{be attached}} to various backings used to attach to the clothing of the wearer. There are many types of name tag backings, including magnetic backings, locking <b>pins,</b> <b>swivel</b> clips, military clutch pins, alligator clips, and cell phone attachments. Magnetic backings, because they do not puncture clothing with pins, have recently become more popular for name tags. Some name tags are worn around the neck using a lanyard or necklace.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept was}} also {{attempted}} for conversion to a naval use. HMS Temeraire {{was completed in}} 1877 with two disappearing guns (11-inch muzzle-loading rifles (279 mm)) sinking down into barbette structures (basically circular metal protective walls over which the gun fired when elevated). This was to combine {{the ability of the}} early <b>pivot</b> guns to <b>swivel</b> with the protection of more classical fixed naval guns. A similar design was later used in Russia for the first ship of the Ekaterina II-class battleships. It has been suggested that both the harsh saltwater environment and the constant swaying and rolling of a ship at sea caused problems for the complex mechanism.|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of a foot restraint platform designed primarily for use by an astronaut being rigidly and permanently attached to an end effector which is suitable for attachment to the manipulator arm of a remote manipulating system is described. The foot restraint platform is attached by a brace to the end effector at a location away from the grappling interface of the end effector. The platform comprises a support plate provided {{with a pair of}} stirrups for receiving the toe portion of an astronaut's boots when standing on the platform and a pair of heel retainers in the form of raised members which are fixed {{to the surface of the}} platform and located to provide abutment surfaces for abutting engagement with the heels of the astronaut's boots when his toes are in the stirrups. The heel retainers preclude a backward sliding movement of the feet on the platform and instead require a lifting of the heels in order to extract the feet. The brace for attaching the foot restraint platform to the end effector may include a <b>pivot</b> or <b>swivel</b> joint to permit various orientations of the platform with respect to the end effector...|$|R
25|$|In the {{south-west}} corner was a {{group of}} objects which may have been hung up, but when discovered, were compressed together. They included a Coptic or eastern Mediterranean bronze bowl with drop handles and figures of animals, found below a badly deformed six-stringed Anglo-Saxon lyre in a beaver-skin bag, of a Germanic type found in wealthy Anglo-Saxon and north European graves of this date. Uppermost was a large and exceptionally elaborate three-hooked hanging bowl of Insular production, with champleve enamel and millefiori mounts showing fine-line spiral ornament and red cross motifs and with an enamelled metal fish mounted to <b>swivel</b> on a <b>pin</b> within the bowl.|$|R
50|$|Some bowls {{have clearly}} Christian motifs on their escutcheons. The spiral {{ornament}} developed through the 6th to 7th century {{invention of the}} 'trumpet-spiral' pattern, which was afterwards adopted from these enamels and incorporated into the repertoire of the famous painted Gospel-books such as the Book of Durrow or the Lindisfarne Gospels. This painted decoration was certainly intended for meditative contemplation and as a devotional work. From the very mixed cultures and beliefs of the inhabitants of Britain during the Dark Ages, the art, and perhaps {{some part of the}} function of these bowls became absorbed into the Celto-Saxon ornamental language of Christian Britain. Among the finest examples is the large bowl from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial (near Woodbridge, Suffolk), which has an enameled fish sculpture set to <b>swivel</b> on a <b>pin</b> within the bowl.|$|R
50|$|The Sukhoi Shkval was {{designed}} as a two-engined interceptor with radar, two built-in aircraft guns and side-by-side afterburner engines. Two designs were investigated in the wind tunnel. These differed only {{in the form of the}} air intakes and the position of the canards. The first version with D-shaped air intakes, comparable to the Su-15, and canards in front of the cockpit, which extend to the radome, could not get through. The second concept with rectangular ramp air inlets (comparable to the air inlets of the MiG-25) and canards at the upper side edge of the air inlets got the advantage. The hull itself is similar to the fuselage of the Su-15 without landing gear, wing, fin and brake flaps. The four wings were fixed at the corners of the fuselage as a reclining X (comparable to the fictional X-wing fighter from Star Wars). On the four wings end were cylindrical containers, which in the lower part contain shock absorbers for take-off and landing. In the remaining part of these cylindrical containers were kerosene tanks, as in wings and the fuselage. The containers were externally provided with a guide plate as a continuation of the wing. Each wing has a rudder that functions as a rudder and aileron. In order to facilitate the vertical landing, the entire Ejection seat as well as the Thrust lever and the Side-stick were pivotally mounted in the cockpit in such a way that the ratio of the ejection seat to these control elements remained unchanged regardless of the <b>pivoting</b> position. The <b>swivel</b> device gave the pilot a better view of the ground / landing zone by a window in the cockpit floor. A cockpit section of the Sukhoi Shkval was built with the window in the ground and the swivel seat / instrument combination, with which this function could be tested and demonstrated, which happened several times. A two-axle trailer was also planned for the transport and erection of the Sukhoi Shkval.|$|R
