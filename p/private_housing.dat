5|$|The area {{attracted}} more social housing when the Westwoods and Manor Farm estates {{were developed in}} the 1960s. A large <b>private</b> <b>housing</b> estate was built at Sharp Lane after 1972 and 1,300 houses were built at Leeds New Forest Village after 2005.|$|E
5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old {{industries}} have disappeared {{and there has been}} diversification, in particular because of the close links to the motorway system and the development of warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of <b>private</b> <b>housing</b> have been established farther to the east; this has resulted in the population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{also took}} places during the 1990s of <b>private</b> <b>houses</b> {{on the north}} of the estate near Dartmouth Avenue, which unlike most of the interwar Coalpool {{consists}} of <b>private</b> <b>houses,</b> also built in the 1930s.|$|R

5|$|Malvern {{had already}} become an {{overspill}} for the nearby city of Worcester, {{and the new}} motorways constructed in the early 1960s brought the industrial Midlands within commuting distance by car. With this development came the construction of large <b>private</b> <b>housing</b> developments. The town continues to swell as increasingly more farmland, especially in the Malvern Link area between the villages of Guarlford and Newland, is turned over to housing projects creating new communities and suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The Abbots of Muchelney Abbey {{held the}} Rectorship {{of the parish}} church of Somerton during the Middle Ages. They built a tithe barn, to house the tithes of crops and produce paid by the parish to the town's Rector. The Abbey was {{dissolved}} in 1539 during the English Reformation, and the tithes and the tithe barn passed into the ownership of Bristol Cathedral. In the 20th century the barn was converted into <b>private</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{to other}} Brazilian universities, Unicamp offers no {{large-scale}} in-campus housing, and most students live either near the campus or in Campinas. A student tradition in Brazil, {{inherited from the}} Portuguese universities, is the república, a fraternity-style <b>private</b> <b>housing</b> where multiple students rent large houses or apartments and live together. Dues to the suburban campus and {{the large number of}} students coming from other cities, repúblicas {{play a key role in}} the student life, serving as centers for social life, parties and also study and work areas. While some repúlicas have existed for decades, sometimes moving from one house to another, most are formed by students in the same or similar classes, and last for a few years.|$|E

5|$|The Lower Earley development, {{built in}} 1977, {{was one of}} the largest <b>private</b> <b>housing</b> {{developments}} in Europe. It extended the urban area of Reading as far as the M4 motorway, which acts as the southern boundary of the town. Further housing developments have increased the number of modern houses and hypermarkets in the outskirts of Reading. A major town-centre shopping centre, The Oracle, opened in 1999, is named after the 17th century Oracle workhouse, which once occupied {{a small part of the}} site. It provides three storeys of shopping space and boosted the local economy by providing 4,000 jobs.|$|E
5|$|The built {{environment}} around Coatbridge's town centre is characterised by its mixture of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sandstone buildings and late twentieth-century precast concrete shops. The leafy Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas {{to the west}} and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various twentieth-century local authority housing buildings. Several high rise flats dominate the skyline. Due to the decline of industries, several <b>private</b> <b>housing</b> estates have been built on reclaimed land.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1785, the {{government}} had taken possession of Southsea Common, the marshland surrounding the castle, to ensure it remained open and accessible to the fort's guns, and convicts were deployed to fill in and flatten out the marshes from 1831 onwards. The surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre; seaside facilities were established {{at the start of}} the century and in the 1840s new <b>private</b> <b>housing</b> was built around the edge of the common, used by military and naval officers. The construction of a railway line from London enabled the settlement of Southsea, named after the castle, to turn into a prosperous resort. Southsea Common was leased by the local government in 1884 and, as the population grew, practising firing the castle's guns became more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Pressure from an {{increasing}} population {{led to the}} town being supplied with amenities such as sewers, which were built in 1875–1880; and Sale {{was connected to the}} telephone network in 1888. As in the late-19th century, the early-20th century saw a great deal of construction work in Sale. The town's first swimming baths were built in 1914, and its first cinema, the Palace, was opened during the First World War. The end of the war in 1918 resulted in a rush of marriages, which highlighted a shortage of housing. The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building council housing, and rented it to the local population at below market rates. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sale had 594council houses. The building programme was interrupted by the start of the war. additional <b>private</b> <b>housing</b> development brought the total of inter-war houses built in Sale to around 900, including large housing estates like Woodheys Hall estate in Ashton.|$|E
