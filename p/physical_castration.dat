40|$|Few {{figures in}} Byzantine culture are as superficially {{dissimilar}} as angels and eunuchs, yet their iconography was closely linked, {{a result of}} their similar occupations and the traditions brought to bear on the problem of depicting angels, traditionally bodiless. Textual evidence on the roles and appearance of each group begins to reveal these connections, but it is only when the art itself is examined that the close relationship between angels and eunuchs becomes clear. For while angels were celestial beings of imagination, Byzantine court eunuchs had a very particular appearance based on the inevitable <b>physical</b> manifestations of <b>castration.</b> The artistic sources give clues about this physical appearance, their dress, functions in court ceremonial, and role in Byzantine society. Then in the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Magi, or most other scenes with angels, Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch. This borrowing was part of the larger influence of imperial iconography on Christian Art, yet it is fascinating for what it reveals about angels and eunuchs, their roles in society and the Church, and the evolution of Early Christian Art and the Byzantine Empire...|$|R
40|$|Castration {{has a long}} {{temporal}} and geographical span. Its origins are unclear, but likely lie in the Ancient Near East {{around the time of}} the Secondary Products Revolution and the increase in social complexity of proto-urban societies. Due to the unique social and gender roles created by castrates’ ambiguous sexual state, human castrates were used heavily in strongly hierarchical social structures such as imperial and religious institutions, and were often close to the ruler of an imperial society. This privileged position, though often occupied by slaves, gave castrates enormous power to affect governmental decisions. This often aroused the jealousy and hatred of intact elite males, who were not afforded as open access to the ruler and virulently condemned castrates in historical documents. These attitudes were passed down to the scholars and doctors who began to study castration in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, affecting the manner in which castration was studied. Osteometric and anthropometric examinations of castrates were carried out during this period, but the two World Wars and a shift in focus meant that castrate bodies were not studied for nearly eighty years. Recent interest in gender and sexuality in the past has revived interest in castration as a topic, but few studies of castrate remains have occurred. As large numbers of castrates are referenced in historical documents, the lack of castrate skeletons may be due to a lack of recognition of the <b>physical</b> effects of <b>castration</b> on the skeleton.

40|$|Castration of male lambs is {{performed}} in all major sheep producing counties {{as a standard}} management practice. The reasons to castrate may be different and {{will depend on the}} size and type of the farm. Castration gives more control over genetics of the flock, stops inbreeding, unwanted pregnancies and behaviours. It also gives improved carcass characteristics. However, {{it has been shown that}} castration is painful and distressing to the animals. Different techniques are used to castrate sheep at the present time such as rubber ring, Burdizzo, combined, short scrotum, and surgical castration. Due to changing attitudes towards animal pain and unnecessary suffering there is a need for further development and implementation of new castration methods, efficient pain assessment techniques, animal welfare codes of practice and legislative requirements to improve lamb well-being. Recent increase of public concern regarding animal welfare is putting pressure on many government bodies to strengthen research in this area and increase attempts to regulate by law unnecessary suffering during standard livestock management practices.

40|$|Among land animals, more pork is {{eaten in}} the world than any other meat. The earth holds about one billion pigs who deliver over 100 mmt of pork to people for consumption. Systems of pork {{production}} changed from a forest-based to pasture-based to dirt lots and finally into specially-designed buildings. The world pork industry is variable and complex not just in production methods but in economics and cultural value. A systematic analysis of pork industry sustainability was performed. Sustainable production methods are considered at three levels using three examples in this paper: production system, penning system and for a production practice. A sustainability matrix was provided for each example. In a comparison of indoor vs. outdoor systems, the food safety/zoonoses concerns make current outdoor systems unsustainable. The choice of keeping pregnant sows in group pens or individual crates is complex in that the outcome of a sustainability assessment leads to the conclusion that group penning is more sustainable in the EU and certain USA states, but the individual crate is currently more sustainable in other USA states, Asia and Latin America.

Investigation included surgically castrated (SC; n= 12) and immunocastrated (IC; n= 11) male pigs, fed ad libitum a feed mixture with 12 - 13 MJ ME/kg; 13 - 15 % crude protein (two-phase feeding). The experiment started at 24. 4 weeks of age when average body weight (ABW) of SC pigs was 24. 3 kg and of IC pigs 28. 4 kg. Immunocastrates were vaccinated with Improvac® (Zoetis-Pfizer) at 39 (V 1) and revacinated at 46 (V 2) weeks of age (WA). Pigs were slaughtered 6 weeks after V 2. Until V 1 when IC are actually entire males, growth rate was slightly lower in IC than SC pigs (446 vs. 495 g/day, respectively). Established difference was statistically significant (P= 0. 03). In the period between V 1 and V 2 growth rate was alike in IC and SC (454 vs. 448 g/day, respectively; P= 0. 92). Overalluntil V 2, there was no difference in ABW between IC and SC pigs (99. 2 vs. 100. 2, respectively; P= 0. 89).

40|$|In most countries, male pigs are {{physically}} castrated soon after birth {{to reduce the}} risk of boar taint and to avoid behaviours such as fighting and mounting. However, entire male pigs are more feed efficient and deposit less fat than barrows. In addition, many animal welfare organizations are lobbying for a cessation of castration, with a likelihood that this could lead to inferior pork unless an alternative method is used to control boar taint. An alternative to <b>physical</b> <b>castration</b> is immunization against gonadotrophin releasing factor (GnRF) which allows producers to capitalize on the superior feed efficiency and carcass characteristics of boars without the risk of boar taint. From a physiological perspective, immunized pigs are entire males until shortly after the second dose, typically given 4 to 6 weeks before slaughter. Following full immunization, there is a temporary suppression of testicular function and a hormonal status that resembles that of a barrow. Nutrient requirements will be different in these two phases, before and after full immunization. Given that there have been few published studies comparing the lysine requirements of entire males and barrows in contemporary genotypes, it is useful to use gilt requirements as a benchmark. A series of meta-analyses comparing anti-GnRF immunized boars and physical castrates and use of nutritional models suggest that the lysine requirement of entire males before the second immunization is 5 % higher than for gilts, from 25 to 50 kg BW, and by 8 % from 50 to 95 kg. Given that the penalty in growth performance for having inadequate dietary lysine is greater in males than in gilts or barrows, it is important to ensure that lysine requirements are met to obtain the maximum benefits of entire male production during this phase. After the second immunization, the lysine requirement of immunized males decreases and may become more like that of barrows. In addition, a consistent effect of full immunization is a marked increase in voluntary feed intake from about 10 days after the second dose. Putting these together, the estimated lysine requirement, expressed in terms of diet composition, falls to 94 % of the gilt level. Although general principles can be described now, further research is needed to fully define the lysine requirements of immunized boars. It is important that the temporal pattern of tissue deposition rates and feed intake be explored to be incorporated into models to predict nutrient requirements over the period of rapidly changing metabolism...|$|E

A total of 1, 230 male pigs was enrolled in 16 weekly batches and allocated to 3 groups: barrows (castrated on the next day after birth [study Day 0]), pigs vaccinated with the above-mentioned product, and intact boars. Vaccinated pigs were injected subcutaneously with 2 mL of the antigonadotropin releasing factor (GnRF) vaccine at 9 to 11 wk of age (60 - 78 d) and 15 to 17 wk of age (102 - 120 d) and slaughtered at 22 to 25 wk of age (152 - 176 d). No clinical abnormalities or adverse events attributable to vaccination occurred. Mean BW of vaccinated pigs was 6 % greater compared with barrows at slaughter (P < 0. 0001). The vaccinated pigs had greater ADG than barrows from castration to slaughter (8 %). In detail, a lower ADG from first to second vaccination (- 12 %; P < 0. 0001) and a 27 % greater ADG from second vaccination to slaughter (P < 0. 0001) were observed. The ADG of vaccinated pigs and intact boars was not significantly different throughout the study, except from first to second vaccination (boars greater; P = 0. 0059) and second vaccination to slaughter (vaccinates greater; P = 0. 0390). Feed conversion ratio of barrows was 11 and 8 % greater compared with vaccinated pigs (P = 0. 0005) and boars (P = 0. 0062) from first to second vaccination but was 23 to 26 % lower compared with vaccinated pigs (P < 0. 0001) and intact boars (P < 0. 0001) from first vaccination to slaughter and 7 to 9. 5 % lower from the second vaccination to slaughter (P = 0. 0029 and P = 0. 0003 for vaccinates and intact boars, respectively). At slaughter, the belly fat androstenone concentration of all vaccinated pigs and 64 % of intact boars was below 200 ng/g. Belly fat skatole concentration was below 20 ng/g in samples from all groups. In conclusion, vaccination against GnRF using the GnRF analog-diphtheria toxoid conjugate tested did not induce adverse clinical effects, proved effective, and compared with <b>physical</b> <b>castration,</b> resulted in greater BW at slaughter and improved ADG and feed conversion ratio from first vaccination to slaughter. © 2014 American Society of Animal Science.

40|$|This year {{marks the}} tenth anniversary of California 2 ̆ 7 s {{enactment}} of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s first chemical castration law. This law requires certain sex offenders to receive, {{as part of their}} punishment, long-term pharmacological treatment involving massive doses of a synthetic female hormone called medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). MPA treatment is described as chemical castration because it mimics the effect of surgical castration by eliminating almost all testosterone from the offender 2 ̆ 7 s system. The intended effect of MPA treatment is to alter brain and body function by reducing the brain 2 ̆ 7 s exposure to testosterone, thus depriving offenders of most (or all) capacity to experience sexual desire and to engage in sexual activity. The procedure also carries severe side effects. Despite numerous predictions that this law would be quickly struck down as cruel and unusual, it remains on the books, and six additional states have followed California 2 ̆ 7 s lead with chemical castration laws of their own. Moreover, we are currently facing a new wave of legislative efforts to impose chemical or surgical castration as a condition for sex offenders 2 ̆ 7 release from prison. The Supreme Court has identified the following questions as being key to a determination of whether a punishment is inherently cruel within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment: (1) Whether it violates the dignity of man, which is the basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment; (2) Whether it violates evolving standards of decency; (3) Whether it involves the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain - that is, pain that completely fails to further either retributive, deterrent, incapacitative or rehabilitative goals; and (4) Whether it involves torture or barbarous methods of punishment, such as drawing and quartering, burning at the stake, or <b>physical</b> <b>castration.</b> This essay will argue that the most effective and appropriate way to determine the relationship between these interpretive principles is to refer them back to the text of the Eighth Amendment, and particularly to the word cruel. Cruel is generally taken to mean 2 ̆ 2 indifference to or pleasure in another 2 ̆ 7 s distress. 2 ̆ 2 As this definition indicates, a cruel punishment is not necessarily the same thing as a punishment that fails to further a penological purpose; nor is it necessarily the same thing as a punishment that is not acceptable under current standards of decency. Rather, the word 2 ̆ 2 cruel 2 ̆ 2 implies a certain relationship between the punisher and the person punished: an attitude that the suffering of the offender is either unimportant, or is something to be positively enjoyed. In other words, a cruel punishment is one that treats the offender as though he or she were not a human person with a claim to our concern as fellow persons, but as a mere animal or thing lacking in basic human dignity. Because chemical castration is designed both to shackle the mind and painfully cripple the body of sex offenders, this essay will argue, it is doubly cruel, and should be struck down as a violation of the Eighth Amendment...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to evaluate a new technology used to suppress testicular function of male pigs using an immunological designed to block the communication of gonadotropin releasing factor (GnRF) with the anterior pituitary gland. This disrupts {{the production of a}} number of male sex hormones such as testosterone and androstenone. The reduction of testosterone allows for an increase in hepatic metabolism of skatole. Androstenone and skatole are the two primary compounds associated with objectionable odors and aromas collectively known as "boar taint". Boar taint issues are the one of the key reasons <b>physical</b> <b>castration</b> (surgical castration) has been so widely adopted in United State swine production systems. Improvest?? (Pfizer Animal Health, Kalamazoo, MI) is a 9 amino-acid base pair GnRF conjugate that prevents boar taint in entire male pigs even when allowed to grow to ending live weights over 130 kg. This research used two populations of pigs of PIC genetics (Pig Improvement Company, Hendersonville, TN) divided over three independent experiments. The objectives of the first experiment were to determine if increasing lysine levels in the diets of immunologically castrated (IC) male pigs will increase percent fat free lean and carcass cutability. The {{objective of}} the second experiment was to determine if increasing lysine levels in the diets of IC male pigs will affect further processed product characteristics when compared to physical castrates or entire males. Raw materials for this experiment were derived from the same pigs used in the previous experiment evaluating carcass characteristics and cutability. The objectives of the final experiment were to determine if advantages in cutting yields of immunocastrated (IC) males over physical castrates, demonstrated in the first experiment, would persist when pigs were harvested at either 4 weeks (early harvest group) or 6 weeks (late harvest group) post second injection and to evaluate belly quality and bacon processing characteristics of IC males fed a moderate level of dietary unsaturated fatty acids (DDGS). In the first experiment, 96 pigs (16 per treatment) were selected based on ending live weight (weight 48 h prior to harvest) for further analysis. The experiment used four dietary programs differing in percent lysine inclusion where the diets ranged in a low lysine level (0. 7 % in the late finishing diet) to a high lysine level (1. 0 % in the late finishing diet). Percent fat-free lean increased 3. 7 percentage units in IC males as lysine level was increased from low (56. 1 % fat-free lean) to high (59. 8 % fat-free lean) dietary lysine. There were no differences (P > 0. 05) among IC males fed low, low/medium, or medium/high lysine levels, but there was a linear increase (P = 0. 01) in fat-free lean as dietary lysine level increased. There were no differences in shear force, cook loss, or ultimate pH (P ??? 0. 05) among any of the treatment groups. Extractable lipid of loin chops decreased 1. 01 percentage units from IC males fed the low lysine diet (2. 29 %) to the IC males fed the high lysine diet (1. 28 %). Lean cutting yields and carcass cutting yields were higher in IC males than in physical castrates, but were lower than entire males. There was a linear increase in lean cutting yield (P = 0. 05) and carcass cutting yield (P = 0. 01) in IC males as dietary lysine level increased. Entire males (2. 85 cm) had the thinnest (P 0. 05) among physical castrates or IC males regardless of lysine level. There were no differences (P ??? 0. 05) in protein content or protein fat-free values in cured and smoked hams among any treatment group. A total of 156 pigs (78 IC males and 78 physical castrates) were used in the second population of pigs. Selection criteria were based on sex and ending live weight where the heaviest 15 pigs within a pen were selected at 4 weeks post-second injection and the remaining 10 pigs in the pen were selected at 6 weeks post second injection. Pigs were harvested at either 4 or 6 weeks post-second injection and within each harvest group pigs were classified as heavy, light, or median weight. There were no differences between IC males and physical castrates for shear force (P = 0. 09), ultimate pH (P = 0. 57), L* (P = 0. 93), a* (P = 0. 33), b* (P = 0. 31), subjective color score (P = 0. 64), or drip loss (P = 0. 30). There were no interactions between sex and harvest time (P = 0. 99) or between sex and weight category (P = 0. 43) or the three-way interaction (P = 0. 84) for lean cutting yields. There were also no interactions between sex and harvest time (P = 0. 49) or between sex and weight category (P = 0. 66) or the three-way interaction (P = 0. 28) for carcass cutting yields. Lean cutting yields of IC males (28. 84 kg) were 1. 20 kg heavier, 2. 62 percentage units higher (P < 0. 0001), than physical castrates (27. 64 kg) and carcass cutting yields were 1. 06 kg heavier, 2. 27 percentage units higher (P < 0001), for IC males (33. 98 kg) when compared to physical castrates (32. 91 kg). Bellies from IC males were thinner (P = 0. 01) and had wider belly flops (P < 0. 0001) than bellies from IC males. Even though cook loss percentage was greater (P < 0. 0001) in IC males when compared to physical castrates, cooked yields were not different (P = 0. 74) between the two sexes. Over both populations of pigs, immunological castration with Improvest?? does not affect pork quality, improves cutting yields, makes fresh bellies thinner, but does not affect cured product characteristics...|$|E
