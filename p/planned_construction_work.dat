50|$|The {{parking lot}} project has caused uproar amongst local {{residents}} and heritage activists who staged a protest on Saturday 15 June 2013. Over three hundred people attended {{to voice their}} anger at the Municipality planners and the Ministry of Culture. Various different groups and Non-Governmental Organisations attended and voiced concern such as Green Line, Biladi, Save Beirut Heritage and the Association for the Protection of Lebanese Heritage. Guided tours were given of the ruins and it was explained how the <b>planned</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> would irreparably damage the trees, Byzantine church {{and one of the}} few green spaces left in Beirut.|$|E
50|$|A {{condominium}} {{community development}} called 'SouthField' was <b>planned,</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> began during December 2010 {{and the first}} homes were sold and occupied by summer 2011. Over 600 acres have already been transferred to the local reuse authority, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Federal Aviation Administration. In November 2011, the Navy and Tri Town, the quasi-municipal local reuse authority, signed a purchase and sales agreement for the remaining 834 acres of the base; about 708 acres of the 834 acres are available for transfer and 126 acres will be leased until the property has been cleaned up or closed out and deemed suitable for transfer by the EPA.|$|E

50|$|During the {{building}} of the first tramline in Essen in 1893, planning began on a partially underground railway, which was not realised until decades after the Second World War. The first preliminary line of the current Stadtbahn emerged in the early 1960s and were laid partly as tram tracks on the median strip of the Ruhrschnellweg (“Ruhr Expressway”), which is exactly where the modern line U18 runs. In this case, an underground Stadtbahn (U-Stadtbahn) was not initially <b>planned.</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>work</b> on the tram line in the Ruhr Expressway was carried out simultaneously with the upgrade of the Ruhr Expressway itself, since the latter up to that time had only three lanes and flat junctions and had insufficient capacity because of the large increase in traffic. Following the upgrade of other forms of public transport, the possibility of some form of public transport on the Ruhr Expressway were considered, including express buses on a separate bus lane. Ultimately, however, an option based around a rapid tramway gained favour. Thus a line was built on parts of today's Essen-Mülheim route, which was initially connected by temporary exit ramps {{with the rest of the}} tram network.|$|E

40|$|Normally {{end users}} are passive users {{who do not}} {{participate}} in managing their energy consumption. International literature is demonstrating that involvement and awareness in facility management can help energy saving. For this reason, it is necessary that the subject becomes active and able to fit inside the energy management information. From this point of view, the Smart Energy Efficient Middleware for Public Spaces (SEEMPubS), a Seventh Framework Programme project, aims to reduce energy consumption in historic and modern public buildings through low economic impact <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> and an efficient ICT network for monitoring, detecting and managing consumption. At the end of this project, consumption data, which were collected within a number of the test rooms, will be available to end users through a Facility Management application (Archibus) that will allow users to see energy consumption data visible in real time, and to perform a different kind of medium and long term analysis and consequently to <b>plan</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works,</b> when necessary. At the same time, collected data, are used to study the methodology through interoperability among parametric software, both architectural (Revit Architecture), energetic (Daysim, Radiance and TRNSYS) and Facility Management (Archibus FM). Therefore, SEEMPubS will be able to transform "users" into "informed-user" involving them in the global energy proces...|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} {{describing}} {{the theme of}} price development of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> on the railway superstructure. The result is meant as determination of technical-economic indicator {{which can be used}} in view of pricing mainly for public tenders {{as well as in the}} way of orientation at cost prices. The work is also engaged in production index for construction. The main meaning of this part is formed by comparing the dates of the Czech Statistical Office in the production of building and civil engineering in the Czech Republic between years of 2009 and 2015 with the production of railways constructions. As the railroad tracks are in corporate governance SŽDC state organization – whole <b>planned</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> are controlled by conditions and rules of public tenders. After joining the Czech Republic into the European Union the requirements for optimal state of international transportation networks in their technical and social part had to be guaranteed.

50|$|At {{the end of}} February 2010, ‘Forum 2020’, a group {{consisting}} {{of a number of}} captains of industry and academics from the Antwerp area and stRaten-generaal, proposed a comprehensive new plan, starting from the given fact that the Oosterweel connection had been disapproved by referendum. They proposed a ‘meccano-scenario’, in which the E17 and the E34 are connected with the E313/E34 by means of a sequence of short tunnels to the north of Antwerp. In Waasland, a ‘western tangent road’ is put forward {{as an alternative to the}} R2. It would start in Melsele and connect the E17 with the E34 by means of a tunnel. A 'northern tangent', again composed of tunnels, would connect this junction with the A12 and the E19 in the northernmost part of the port area. It would connect with an eastern tangent T102, again a tunnel, connecting the Ekeren junction with the E313/E34 past Wommelgem, which would run along the route of the planned above ground A102. Simultaneously, next to the tunnel underneath the Albert canal in Schoten, a tunnel for local use would be built to replace the <b>planned</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> to add height to the existing Hoogmolenbrug.This bypass would use ‘intelligent traffic management’ to steer the bulk of through-traffic away from the R1.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} the Tanggu Xingang seaport (later the Tianjin Xingang port) started during the Japanese {{occupation}} of China. In 1938, the Japanese occupation forces decided that the existing river ports in Tianjin and Tanggu were insufficient {{to meet their needs}} for transportation to and from North China. The Haihe was troublesome both due to silting and winter icing, and the Taku Bar allowed passage only to very shallow vessels, so {{the decision was made to}} expand capacity by building a seaport outside of the Haihe estuary. After an exploratory and <b>planning</b> period, <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> started on 25 October 1940. In October 1941, the Tanggu New Port Harbor Bureau was set up.|$|R
