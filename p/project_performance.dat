2500|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{theory is}} the broad {{body of work}} that attempts to lay analytical foundations for determining the order of specific nucleotides in a sequence of DNA, otherwise known as DNA sequencing. The practical aspects revolve around designing and optimizing sequencing projects (known as [...] "strategic genomics"), predicting <b>project</b> <b>performance,</b> troubleshooting experimental results, characterizing factors such as sequence bias {{and the effects of}} software processing algorithms, and comparing various sequencing methods to one another. In this sense, it could be considered a branch of systems engineering or operations research. The permanent archive of work is primarily mathematical, although numerical calculations are often conducted for particular problems too. DNA sequencing theory addresses physical processes related to sequencing DNA and {{should not be confused with}} theories of analyzing resultant DNA sequences, e.g. sequence alignment. Publications sometimes do not make a careful distinction, but the latter are primarily concerned with algorithmic issues. Sequencing theory is based on elements of mathematics, biology, and systems engineering, so it is highly interdisciplinary. The subject may be studied within the context of computational biology.|$|E

The <b>project</b> manager has detailed knowledge of the <b>project’s</b> <b>performance</b> baseline, and several choices for assessing the performance status.

The project manager normally will establish “triggers, ” or percentages for the variances, which, if exceeded, cause a project review and possible management action...|$|R

40|$|A {{planning}} {{model has}} been developed to assist regional blood suppliers in alleviating seasonal imbalances between supply and demand of blood. A Markovian population model is used to <b>project</b> various <b>performance</b> measures for a blood supply region. These measures are summarized in graphs covering a planning period of several months to one year. The planner improves <b>projected</b> <b>performance</b> by changing collection plans and using the planning model iteratively to evaluate each plan. The data required by the model are generally available: past performance of bloodmobile sponsors, quotas and demand forecasts. In this paper the model is described, <b>projected</b> <b>performance</b> measures are validated against actual measures, sensitivity to errors in inputs is analyzed and the model is evaluated relative to less complex models. The planning model is shown to be sufficiently accurate for its purpose and highly effective for its cost.
