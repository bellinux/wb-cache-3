5|$|Despite the <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design, many {{operational}} {{officers were}} opposed {{to the use of}} volatile hydrogen peroxide aboard ship. Ultimately, the Mark 16 went into limited production while work on the Mark 17 was suspended in 1941, but resumed in 1944. Admiral Ernest King favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on the oxygen system was downgraded. As such, the U.S. Navy made no combat use of the oxygen torpedo design during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Although not yet ordained, Gerard {{was rewarded}} with the Bishopric of Hereford, and he was consecrated by Archbishop Anselm on 8 June 1096; his {{ordination}} as a deacon and priest had taken place the previous day. He assisted at the consecration of St Paul's Cathedral in London on 9 June 1096. He {{may have been a}} member of the hunting party in the New Forest on 2 August 1100 when Rufus was killed, as he witnessed King Henry I's coronation charter– now known as the Charter of Liberties– three days later at Winchester, close by the New Forest. Gerard was present at Henry's coronation that same day, along with Maurice, Bishop of London. Henry was probably crowned by Maurice, but the medieval chronicler Walter Map states that Gerard crowned Henry in return for a <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first vacant archbishopric. Gerard may have assisted Maurice in the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In 1065 Northumbria revolted against Tostig, and {{the rebels}} chose Morcar, {{the younger brother}} of Edwin, Earl of Mercia, as earl in place of Tostig. Harold, perhaps to secure the support of Edwin and Morcar in his bid for the throne, {{supported}} the rebels and persuaded King Edward to replace Tostig with Morcar. Tostig went into exile in Flanders, {{along with his wife}} Judith, who was the daughter of Count Baldwin IV of Flanders. Edward was ailing, and he died on 5 January 1066. It is unclear what exactly happened at Edward's deathbed. One story, deriving from the Vita Edwardi, a biography of Edward, claims that Edward was attended by his wife Edith, Harold, Archbishop Stigand, and Robert FitzWimarc, and that the king named Harold as his successor. The Norman sources do not dispute the fact that Harold was named as the next king, but they declare that Harold's oath and Edward's earlier <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> throne could not be changed on Edward's deathbed. Later English sources stated that Harold had been elected as king by the clergy and magnates of England.|$|E

5|$|Lansford W. Hastings, {{an early}} {{immigrant}} from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 {{and saw the}} <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> undeveloped country. To encourage settlers, he published The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California. He described a direct route across the Great Basin which would bring immigrants through the Wasatch Mountains and across the Great Salt Lake Desert. Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to Fort Bridger. The fort was a scant supply station run by Jim Bridger and his partner Pierre Louis Vasquez in Blacks Fork, Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route. As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to have crossed {{the southern part of}} the Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.|$|E

25|$|After other {{battles and}} {{retreating}} to Monticchio, {{one of his}} headquarters, Crocco broke the alliance with Borjes {{because he did not}} want to serve under a foreigner and did not believe the <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bourbon government about the provision of reinforcements.

25|$|A {{period of}} peace lasted from August 1649 to February 1651, but the Polish side {{balked at the}} {{implementation}} of the Zboriv agreements and further confrontations became inevitable.
