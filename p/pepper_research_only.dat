Yearly amendments of compost were demonstrated to be having a long-term impact on nutrient availability and organic matter content of soil. Soil samples collected in mid June before applying compost or chemical fertilizer in 2003 revealed that plots receiving compost in 2001 and 2002 had significantly higher organic matter content and more available phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, manganese, and zinc than non-compost-amended plots. ...|$|R
