50|$|Dereenalomane Barytes Mine was {{originally}} {{worked as a}} copper mine Traill and Thomas in 1840, producing 19 tons of copper, before shifting to barium sulphate, a heavy white mineral, (used for paint, papermaking, etc.) Josiah Wedgwood used it for making pottery. Geologist T. D. Triphook, was involved in 1854 when it {{was known as the}} Bandon Barytes Mines. From 1860 the mine was managed by Charles Thomas, a Cornish Mining Captain, followed by George Ellis in the 1870s. From 1820 to 1920 intermittently when 2,500 tons were raised in 1851 compared to only 800 tons in three other centres in the former United Kingdom. The material was washed, dried, crushed and milled. It was <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>bags</b> and sent <b>to</b> an island jetty in Dunmanus Bay by a 1.23 mi aerial ropeway. In 1917 a major fire caused extensive damage including the underground workings. Although repairs were carried out the mine never reached its former output. Mining historian Grenville AJ Cole regarded it as the first in Ireland and one of the earliest in the world. The companies listed as having worked the mine were, Marty Dennis and Co., British Barytes Co., Durrus Barytes Co., Mount Gabriel Barytes and Umber Co., Irish Barytes and Umber Co., Dereenlomane, Barytes Mines Ltd., Dunmanus Barytes Mines Ltd.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the differences between backpacks designed for travel and backpacks designed for recreation. A feature analysis was conducted by analyzing the top fifteen best-selling travel and recreational backpacks {{in order to identify}} the representative features for each type of bag. Following the feature analysis, four archetypal bags were selected (two of each type) to conduct an experiment to assess the load-carrying design and usability of the backpacks. A primary usability feature targeted with this study was packability – defined {{for the purpose of this}} research as the ease of packing quickly and efficiently. An experiment was conducted where participants were assigned to a backpack. Participants were required to <b>pack</b> items <b>into</b> the backpack and walk on a treadmill with the backpack on at a slow pace for 30 minutes. Following the treadmill task, participants were asked to find three items <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> the <b>bag.</b> Time <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> the <b>bag</b> and time <b>to</b> find the items were both measured. Discomfort surveys and force plate data were collected before and after walking on the treadmill to assess the load-carrying design of the backpack as it relates to comfort/discomfort of the user and heart rate data was collected throughout the experiment. The results of this study indicate that recreational backpacks require additional exertion when compared to travel backpacks when walking at a slow pace for 30 minutes across even terrain as measured by a change in heart rate. The results also indicate a trend that travel backpacks require less time to pack, require less time to find items in the bag, and result in increased postural stability when compared to recreational backpacks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Aggregate outputs {{learning}} is a newly proposed setting in data mining and machine learning. It differs from the classical supervised learning setting in that, training samples are <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>bags</b> with only the aggregate outputs (labels for classification or real values for regression) provided. This problem is associated with several kinds of application background. We focus on the aggregate outputs classification problem in this paper, {{and set up a}} framework based on kernel K-means to solve it. Two concrete algorithms based on our framework are proposed, each of which can cope with both binary and multi-class scenarios. The experimental results suggest that our algorithms outperform the state-of-art technique. Also, we propose a new setting for patch extraction in the Content Based Image Retrieval procedure by using the algorithm...|$|R

It was around this time that Kuwaiti security forces undertook raids against the Peninsula Lions, during which they discovered two explosives caches, the first containing raw materials and the second a bomb-making workshop with nine completed devices <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>bags</b> and ready for delivery. The most recent raids resulted in intense fire fights in Kuwait City suburbs that left six militants, one police officer, and one Bahraini bystander dead.

5000|$|The {{usefulness}} of the shed and log handling machinery declined in the late 1950s, and White's Shed {{was no longer in}} operation after the bulk sugar terminal was established at Portsmith in 1964. At this new terminal, huge volumes of sugar could be stored and delivered directly into the holds of ships, without needing <b>to</b> be <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>bags</b> or other containers. This new method of sugar handling reduced significantly the wharf labour force for sugar. The sinker log crane {{on the west side of}} the shed was sold in 1959 and was later used at Rankine's Peeramon Mill, near Lake Eacham on the Atherton Tablelands, where it currently resides. The disused White's Shed was subsequently leased to mining companies, perhaps as early as the 1960s. The shed was used to store copper concentrate from the Red Dome mine between 1993 and 1997, and was leased to the Dianne Copper Mine prior to this. The name [...] "White's Shed" [...] derives from this period.|$|R

50|$|Common to {{many other}} Plains farmers, the Pawnee left their villages in late June when their corn crop was about knee high to live in tipis and roam the plains on a summer buffalo hunt. They {{returned}} about the first of September to harvest their crops. Maize, beans, and pumpkins were dried, <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> rawhide <b>bags,</b> and stored in bell-shaped underground storage pits. The Pawnee followed the harvest with a month of celebrations and in early December departed their villages again for a winter hunt, their stored agricultural products hidden beneath the ground. This yearly cycle of life was common among the Plains farmers, especially after the acquisition of the horse in the late 17th and 18th century gave then the mobility to undertake lengthy hunts far from their permanent villages.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, pemmican was {{prepared}} from the lean meat of large game such as buffalo, elk, deer, or moose. The meat {{was cut in}} thin slices and dried, either over a slow fire or in the hot sun, until it was hard and brittle. (About 5 lb of meat are required to make 1 lb of dried meat suitable for pemmican.) Then it was pounded into very small pieces, almost powder-like in consistency, using stones. The pounded meat was mixed with melted fat in an approximate 1:1 ratio by volume. In some cases, dried fruits, such as blueberries, choke cherries, cranberries, or saskatoon berries, were pounded into powder and then added to the meat/fat mixture. The resulting mixture was then <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> rawhide <b>bags</b> for storage. It can be stored for a maximum of 10 years.|$|R
