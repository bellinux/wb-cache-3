It is a potential fuel for long-lifetime radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Its common <b>parent</b> <b>nuclides</b> are β− from 241Pu, EC from 241Cm and α from 245Bk. 241Am is fissile and the critical mass of a bare sphere is 57.6-75.6 kilograms and a sphere diameter of 19-21 centimeters. Americium-241 has a specific activity of 3.43 Ci/g (Curies per gram or 117.29 Gigabequerels (GBq) per gram). It is commonly found in the form of americium-241 dioxide (241AmO2). This isotope also has one meta state; 241mAm, with an exitation energy of 2.2 MeV, and a half-life of 1.23 μs. Its presence in plutonium is determined by the original concentration of plutonium-241 and the sample age. Because of the low penetration of alpha radiation, americium-241 only poses a health risk when ingested or inhaled. Older samples of plutonium containing plutonium-241 contain a buildup of 241Am.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} quantitative evaluation of alpha-stopping effects on (U-Th) /He ages has been developed. Alpha stopping ranges in the ^(238) U, ^(235) U, and ^(232) Th chains vary between ∼ 10 and ∼ 30 μm, depending on decay energy and density/composition of the stopping medium. In {{the case of}} U- and Th-rich accessory minerals (e. g. apatite, zircon, titanite), the dominant effect of long stopping distances is alpha ejection to adjacent minerals. For grains smaller than a few hundred microns in minimum dimension, ejection effects will cause measured helium ages to substantially underestimate true ages. For example, a sphere of 100 μm radius retains only ∼ 82 % of its alphas. For a homogeneous distribution of <b>parent</b> <b>nuclides,</b> the fraction of alphas ejected is ∼ 1 / 4 of the mean alpha range multiplied by the crystal surface to volume ratio, independent of geometry. Removal of the outer 20 μm of a crystal prior to dating eliminates the region which has experienced alpha loss, but may lead to erroneous ages when crystals are strongly zoned with respect to uranium and thorium. By careful characterization of four sieved apatite separates from a single sample, we show {{that it is possible}} to accurately correct (U-Th) /He ages for alpha ejection even when ejection exceeds 35 % of total decays. Our results are useful for identifying the size and shape of grains which are best suited for (U-Th) /He dating and provide the basis for correcting ages when ejection effects are significant. This work underscores that meaningful (U-Th) /He ages require either large crystals, or correction of measured ages for alpha ejection...|$|R

Analytic solutions describe transport through the model compartments: the solid phase waste package, the liquid phase within each waste package and the liquid phase within the disposal unit. The model accounts for elemental solubility limits and retardation coefficients (Rf) separately in the waste package and in the disposal unit. Several parameters define the site specific aspects of the disposal unit. In our case for example, the disposal unit is waste buried with crushed volcanic tuff, and a small net infiltration rate is determined from independent numerical studies.

40|$|Naturally-occurring {{radionuclides}} (uranium, radium, and radon), major dissolved constituents, {{and trace}} elements were investigated in fresh groundwater in 117 wells in fractured crystalline rocks from the Piedmont region (North Carolina, USA). Chemical variations show a general transition between two water types: (1) slightly acidic (pH 5. 0 - 6. 0), oxic, low-total dissolved solids (TDS) waters, and (2) near neutral, oxic to anoxic, higher-TDS waters. The uranium, radium, and radon levels in groundwater associated with granite (Rolesville Granite) are systematically higher than other rock types (gneiss, metasedimentary, and metavolcanic rocks). Water chemistry plays a secondary role on radium and radon distributions as the 222 Rn/ 226 Ra activity ratio is correlated with redox-sensitive solutes such as dissolved oxygen and Mn concentrations, {{as well as}} overall dissolved solids content including major divalent cations and Ba. Since 224 Ra/ 228 Ra activity ratios in groundwater are close to 1, we suggest that mobilization of Ra and Rn is controlled by alpha recoil processes from <b>parent</b> <b>nuclides</b> on fracture surfaces, ruling out Ra sources from mineral dissolution or significant long-distance Ra transport. Alpha recoil is balanced by Ra adsorption that is influenced by redox conditions and/or ion concentrations, resulting in an approximately one order of magnitude decrease (~ 20, 000 to ~ 2000) in the apparent Ra distribution coefficient between oxygen-saturated and anoxic conditions and also across the range of dissolved ion concentrations (up to ~ 7  mM). Thus, the U and Th content of rocks is the primary control on observed Ra and Rn activities in groundwater in fractured crystalline rocks, and in addition, linked dissolved solids concentrations and redox conditions impart a secondary control. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Variations in the isotopic {{composition}} of Ni resulting from natural mass-dependent processes in terrestrial or extraterrestrial conditions, inhomogeneous distribution of nucleosynthetic components and/or ingrowth from radioactive <b>parent</b> <b>nuclides,</b> {{help us to}} further understand the early formation history of Solar System materials {{and the nature of}} the processes these materials subsequently experienced. In studies of Ni isotope systematics, mass-dependent variations in the {{isotopic composition}} of Ni are often bypassed because of the challenges associated with the sample preparation. At the level of natural variation studied, Ni isotope ratio measurements are extremely sensitive to spectral interference, artificial on-column isotope fractionation and possibly even to the mass bias correction model applied. To adequately address these complications, an isolation procedure and measurement protocol relying on multi-collector ICP-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) have been designed and validated in this work. The overall reproducibility obtained based on repeated measurement of a Sigma-Aldrich high-purity Ni standard is 0. 036 &, 0. 049 parts per thousand, 0. 078 parts per thousand and 0. 53 parts per thousand for delta Ni- 60 / 58, delta Ni- 61 / 58, delta Ni- 62 / 58 and delta Ni- 64 / 58, respectively (n = 14; 2 SD). Nickel isotope ratio variations have been studied in a set of iron meteorites and geological reference materials, and the results obtained, except for those suffering from an elevated Zn- 64 background, show good agreement with the available literature data. By using the flexible generalized power law with a variable discrimination exponent and the three-isotope method, the processes underlying natural mass fractionation of Ni for terrestrial reference materials were found to have a mixed equilibrium/kinetic nature. Mass-dependent Ni fractionation was observed between sample fractions of the Canyon Diablo iron meteorite, and the extracted fractionation factor beta corresponds to isotope partitioning following the power law...|$|R

Several projects are covered in this dissertation: the application of instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and rigorous statistical analyses to the sourcing of Egyptian limestone and Kenyan obsidian, {{and the development of a}} method to determine titanium, barium, and arsenic concentrations in obsidian using epithermal neutron activation. INAA, when coupled with rigorous statistical methods, including principal component analysis and clustering techniques, can provide the precision and confidence needed to accurately determine the source of material. However, this technique has not been fully explored for the provenancing of Egyptian limestone sculpture. A combination of the elemental concentration data and rigorous statistical methods is used to study the compositional differences between known ancient quarries. Obsidian is an important component of East African artifacts. Although compositional studies of obsidian from East Africa conducted in the 1980 s showed great potential, a comprehensive database has not been developed. Here, samples from Kenya were examined via INAA. The results indicate that there is a clear correlation between geographic proximity and chemical composition. Titanium and barium are often used for characterizing obsidian, especially in areas in Africa. A method has been developed to analyze for these elements using epithermal neutron activation analysis, which takes advantage of larger natural abundances of <b>parent</b> <b>nuclides</b> and a higher probability for epithermal neutron reactions.

50|$|The Canyon Diablo {{meteorite}} {{was used}} {{because it is}} both large and representative of a particularly rare type of meteorite that contains sulfide minerals (particularly troilite, FeS), metallic nickel-iron alloys, plus silicate minerals.This is important because {{the presence of the}} three mineral phases allows investigation of isotopic dates using samples that provide a great separation in concentrations between <b>parent</b> and daughter <b>nuclides.</b> This is particularly true of uranium and lead. Lead is strongly chalcophilic and is found in the sulfide at a much greater concentration than in the silicate, versus uranium. Because of this segregation in the <b>parent</b> and daughter <b>nuclides</b> during the formation of the meteorite, this allowed a much more precise date of the formation of the solar disk and hence the planets than ever before.The age determined from the Canyon Diablo meteorite has been confirmed by hundreds of other age determinations, from both terrestrial samples and other meteorites. The meteorite samples, however, show a spread from 4.53 to 4.58 billion years ago. This is interpreted as the duration of formation of the solar nebula and its collapse into the solar disk to form the Sun and the planets. This 50 million year time span allows for accretion of the planets from the original solar dust and meteorites.|$|R

Isochron dating can be further separated into mineral isochron dating and whole rock isochron dating; both techniques are applied frequently to date terrestrial and also extraterrestrial rocks (meteorites). The advantage of isochron dating as compared to simple radiometric dating techniques is that no assumptions are needed about the initial amount of the daughter nuclide in the radioactive decay sequence. Indeed, the initial amount of the daughter product can be determined using isochron dating.
