25|$|The best {{possible}} <b>prediction</b> <b>method</b> would yield {{a point in}} the upper left corner or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a perfect classification. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called line of no-discrimination) from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative base rates). An intuitive example of random guessing is a decision by flipping coins. As the size of the sample increases, a random classifier's ROC point migrates towards the diagonal line. In the case of a balanced coin, it will migrate to the point (0.5, 0.5).|$|E

40|$|Exome {{sequencing}} {{is becoming}} a standard tool for mapping Mendelian disease-causing (or pathogenic) non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs). Minor allele frequency (MAF) filtering approach and functional <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> are commonly used to identify candidate pathogenic mutations in these studies. Combining multiple functional <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> may increase accuracy in prediction. Here, we propose to use a logit model to combine multiple <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> and compute an unbiased probability of a rare variant being pathogenic. Also, {{for the first time}} we assess the predictive power of seven <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> (including SIFT, PolyPhen 2, CONDEL, and logit) in predicting pathogenic nsSNVs from other rare variants, which reflects the situation after MAF filtering is done in exome-sequencing studies.

2500|$|DX {{communication}}, {{popular among}} amateur radio enthusiasts, {{is a term}} given to communication over great distances. Thanks to the property of ionized atmospheric gases to refract high frequency (HF, or shortwave) radio waves, the ionosphere can be utilized to [...] "bounce" [...] a transmitted signal down to ground. Transcontinental HF-connections rely on up to 5 bounces, or hops. Such communications {{played an important role}} during World War II.

2500|$|In a 1997 {{study of}} the {{cost-benefit}} ratio of earthquake prediction research in Greece, Stathis Stiros suggested that even a (hypothetical) excellent <b>prediction</b> <b>method</b> would be of questionable social utility, because [...] "organized evacuation of urban centers {{is unlikely to be}} successfully accomplished", while [...] "panic and other undesirable side-effects can also be anticipated." [...] He found that earthquakes kill less than ten people per year in Greece (on average), and that most of those fatalities occurred in large buildings with identifiable structural issues. Therefore, Stiros stated that it would be much more cost-effective to focus efforts on identifying and upgrading unsafe buildings. Since the death toll on Greek highways is more than 2300 per year on average, he argued that more lives would also be saved if Greece's entire budget for earthquake prediction had been used for street and highway safety instead.|$|E
2500|$|Earthquake {{prediction}} is {{a branch of}} the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits, But warning of an earthquake that does not occur also incurs a cost: [...] not only the cost of the emergency measures themselves, but of civil and economic disruption. False alarms, including alarms that are canceled, also undermine the credibility, and thereby the effectiveness, of future warnings. In [...] 1999 it was reported [...] that China was introducing [...] "tough regulations intended to stamp out ‘false’ earthquake warnings, in order to prevent panic and mass evacuation of cities triggered by forecasts of major tremors." [...] This was prompted by [...] "more than 30 unofficial earthquake warnings ... in the past three years, none of which has been accurate." [...] The acceptable trade-off between missed quakes and false alarms depends on the societal valuation of these outcomes. [...] The rate of occurrence of both must be considered when evaluating any <b>prediction</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Protein-protein {{interactions}} underlie {{many important}} biological processes. Computational <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> can nicely complement experimental approaches for identifying protein-protein interactions. Recently, a unique category of sequence-based <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> {{has been put}} forward - unique {{in the sense that}} it does not require homologous protein sequences. This enables it to be universally applicable to all protein sequences unlike many of previous sequence-based <b>prediction</b> <b>methods.</b> If effective as claimed, these new sequence-based, universally applicable <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> would have far-reaching utilities in many areas of biology research. Results Upon close survey, I realized that many of these new methods were ill-tested. In addition, newer methods were often published without performance comparison with previous ones. Thus, it is not clear how good they are and whether there are significant performance differences among them. In this study, I have implemented and thoroughly tested 4 different methods on large-scale, non-redundant data sets. It reveals several important points. First, significant performance differences are noted among different methods. Second, data sets typically used for training <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> appear significantly biased, limiting the general applicability of <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> trained with them. Third, there is still ample room for further developments. In addition, my analysis illustrates the importance of complementary performance measures coupled with right-sized data sets for meaningful benchmark tests. Conclusions The current study reveals the potentials and limits of the new category of sequence-based protein-protein interaction <b>prediction</b> <b>methods,</b> which in turn provides a firm ground for future endeavours in this important area of contemporary bioinformatics. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{forms of}} {{cross-validation}} are straightforward to implement {{as long as}} an implementation of the <b>prediction</b> <b>method</b> being studied is available. In particular, the <b>prediction</b> <b>method</b> can be a [...] "black box" [...] - {{there is no need}} to have access to the internals of its implementation. If the <b>prediction</b> <b>method</b> is expensive to train, cross-validation can be very slow since the training must be carried out repeatedly. In some cases such as least squares and kernel regression, cross-validation can be sped up significantly by pre-computing certain values that are needed repeatedly in the training, or by using fast [...] "updating rules" [...] such as the Sherman-Morrison formula. However one must be careful to preserve the [...] "total blinding" [...] of the validation set from the training procedure, otherwise bias may result. An extreme example of accelerating cross-validation occurs in linear regression, where the results of cross-validation have a closed-form expression known as the prediction residual error sum of squares (PRESS).|$|E

The report concludes that there are a large number of noise prediction procedures available which vary markedly in complexity. Deficiencies in accuracy of methods in many cases may be related, not to the methods themselves, but the accuracy and detail of the aerodynamic inputs used to calculate noise. The steps recommended in the report to provide accurate and easy to use <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> are: (1) identify reliable test data; (2) define and conduct test programs to fill gaps in the existing data base; (3) identify the most promising prediction methods; (4) evaluate promising <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> relative to the data base; (5) identify and correct the weaknesses in the <b>prediction</b> <b>methods,</b> including lack of user friendliness, and include features now available only in research codes; (6) confirm the accuracy of improved <b>prediction</b> <b>methods</b> to the data base; and (7) make the methods widely available and provide training in their use...|$|R
