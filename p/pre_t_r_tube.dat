The type of study was quasi-experimental especially non-randomized control group, pre-test post-test design and the writer used quantitative approach in finding out to answer the problem, the data collecting technique used test and documentation. There were two classes of study namely X Multimedia I as experimental group and X Multimedia 2 as control group with the total number students which X Multimedia I class the total students are 25 and X Multimedia 2 class the total students are 25. The sample of study is determined using cluster sampling technique. Both groups were given pre-test before treatment. Then, the studentsof experiment group was taught by using Audio Visual video mediaand control group was taught using pictures media. Finally, the writer gave post-test to both groups. The normality of the test was <b>Pre</b> <b>Test</b> and PostTest of the experiment group in Kolmogorov-Smirnov was higher than level of significance alpha used or r = 0. 145 > 0. 05 (<b>Pre</b> <b>Test)</b> and <b>r</b> = 0. 276 > 0. 05 (Post Test) so that the distributions are normal.

Results: T h e re were signifi-cant differences (p< 0. 05) : i) premature neonates develop neonatal seizures later, probably related to the etiologies of the seizures; ii) etiologically, there is a predominance of peri-intraventricular hemorrhage in p re t e rm and of asphyxia in full term neonates; iii) clonic seizures are most frequent in <b>pre</b> <b>t</b> e rm and subtle s e i z u res in full term neonates.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} CD 4 � regulatory <b>T</b> cells (<b>T</b> <b>R)</b> that express CD 25 and {{the transcription}} factor FoxP 3 {{play a key}} role in immune homeostasis, preventing immune pathological responses to self and foreign Ags. CTLA- 4 is expressed by a high percentage of these cells, and is often considered as a marker for <b>T</b> <b>R</b> in experimental and clinical analysis. However, it has not yet been proven that CTLA- 4 has a direct role in <b>T</b> <b>R</b> function. In this study, using a T cell-mediated colitis model, we demonstrate that anti-CTLA- 4 mAb treatment inhibits <b>T</b> <b>R</b> function in vivo via direct effects on CTLA- 4 -expressing <b>T</b> <b>R,</b> and not via hyperactivation of colitogenic effector T cells. Although anti-CTLA- 4 mAb treatment completely inhibits <b>T</b> <b>R</b> function, it does not reduce <b>T</b> <b>R</b> numbers or their homing to the GALT, suggesting the Ab mediates its function by blockade of a signal required for <b>T</b> <b>R</b> activity. In contrast to the striking effect of the Ab, CTLA- 4 -deficient mice can produce functional <b>T</b> <b>R,</b> suggesting that under some circumstances other immune regulatory mechanisms, including the production of IL- 10, are able to compensate for the loss of the CTLA- 4 -mediated pathway. This study provides direct evidence that CTLA- 4 has a specific, nonredundant role in the function of normal <b>T</b> <b>R.</b> This role has to be taken into account when targeting CTLA- 4 for therapeutic purposes, as such a strategy will not only boost effector T cell responses, but might also break T R-mediated self-tolerance.
