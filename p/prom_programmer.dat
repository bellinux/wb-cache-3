5|$|Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent {{mechanism}} for upgrading the firmware of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) {{a way for}} firmware bugfixes to be deployed. During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a <b>PROM</b> <b>programmer.</b> Any class of USB device can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications.|$|E
5000|$|Also, PROMs (programmable ROMs), EPROMs (ultraviolet-{{erasable}} PROMs) and EEPROMs (electrically erasable PROMs) {{are available}} {{that can be}} programmed using a standard <b>PROM</b> <b>programmer</b> without requiring specialised hardware or software. However, there are several disadvantages: ...|$|E
50|$|PROM (Programmable {{read-only}} memory) In {{this type}} {{the data is}} written into the chip before it is installed in the circuit, but {{it can only be}} written once. The data is written by plugging the chip into a device called a <b>PROM</b> <b>programmer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The S-record format {{was created}} in the mid-1970s for the Motorola 6800 processor. Software {{development}} tools for that and other embedded processors would make executable code and data in the S-record format. <b>PROM</b> <b>programmers</b> would then read the S-record format and [...] "burn" [...] the data into the PROMs or EPROMs used in the embedded system.|$|R
50|$|Datacube {{was founded}} in the mid-1970s by Stanley Karandanis and J Stewart Dunn. In the early days, Datacube {{manufactured}} board level products for the Multibus, {{which was one of}} the first computer buses developed for microprocessors. Early boards designed by Dunn were PROM, RAM and character generator boards. Of these, character display boards such as the VT103 and VR107 were the best sellers, and were used in programmable read-only memory (<b>PROM)</b> <b>programmers</b> and similar systems.|$|R
5000|$|Programmable {{read-only}} memory (PROM), or one-time programmable ROM (OTP), {{can be written}} to or programmed via a special device called a <b>PROM</b> <b>programmer.</b> Typically, this device uses high voltages to permanently destroy or create internal links (fuses or antifuses) within the chip. Consequently, a PROM can only be programmed once.|$|E

5000|$|EPROM (Erasable {{programmable}} read-only memory) In {{this type}} {{the data in}} it can be rewritten by removing the chip from the circuit board, exposing it to an ultraviolet light to erase the existing data, and plugging it into a <b>PROM</b> <b>programmer.</b> The IC package has a small transparent [...] "window" [...] in the top to admit the UV light. It is often used for prototypes and small production run devices, where the program in it {{may have to be}} changed at the factory.|$|E
50|$|PROMs are {{manufactured}} blank and, {{depending on the}} technology, can be programmed at wafer, final test, or in system. Blank PROM chips are programmed by plugging them into a device called a <b>PROM</b> <b>programmer.</b> The availability of this technology allows companies to keep a supply of blank PROMs in stock, and program them {{at the last minute}} to avoid large volume commitment. These types of memories are frequently used in microcontrollers, video game consoles, mobile phones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, implantable medical devices, high-definition multimedia interfaces (HDMI) and in many other consumer and automotive electronics products.|$|E
50|$|At Johns Hopkins's evening school, Jenniches's peers {{influenced}} {{her to work}} at Westinghouse Electric Company. It was {{the first}} time Westinghouse attained a female engineer, so they had to create an unusual exception for her: an internship. She would be the only woman there, and the only person that had ever had an internship. Jenniches accepted the unique opportunity. She quit teaching and worked at Westinghouse as an associate engineer. She worked there, as an intern and a woman, for two weeks, unpaid, in a plant, with no security clearance, all while still attending evening classes to complete her engineering degree. No one had ever done that before. As a part of her job, she used keypunch digital tapes to program read-only memories, a <b>PROM</b> <b>programmer.</b> She worked harder than most people. Therefore, she would often be on-call, sometimes waking from home at 3 o'clock in the morning to attend to emergency data requirements.|$|E
40|$|Driver program {{allows for}} programing, reading, and {{verification}} of various PROM's. Manual {{entry of data}} to DATA/I/O <b>PROM</b> <b>Programmer</b> timeconsuming and error-prone. Driver program combines file management capability of EXORCISOR with flexibility of DATA I/O system. Provides user with way of reading, programing and verifying PROM's storing data on disk, modifying files and printing data...|$|E
40|$|Summary form only given, as follows. A small microcomputer, using a Motorola 6800, {{has been}} developed. Two printed-board {{versions}} have been operating since 1979 in the NA 3 experiment, and about 30 other {{are used for}} test and small experiments in various laboratories. The computer consists of a 2 / 25 or 3 / 25 CAMAC unit, which can be crate controller or branch driver. In normal use, it is connected to SA 400 floppy disks and a terminal. Optionally, interfaces to a cassette unit, <b>PROM</b> <b>programmer</b> and three analog outputs can be operated on the same boards. Total memory size is 11 kbytes PROM (22 kbytes with 2716 memories) and 8 kbit RAM. Software on PROM consists of an input-output monitor, with disassembling facility, editor and local assembler, a fast and easy-to-use floppy disk monitor, and an histogram package, in 7 kbytes PROM. Some macro instructions are recognised in the assembler: message printing, CAMAC functions, initialisations and are then very easily performed. (0 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|The INTEL 8080 {{has become}} one of the two most widely used {{microprocessors}} (mu P's) at CERN, the other being the MOTOROLA 6800. Even though this is the case, there has been up to date only rudimentary facilities available for aiding the development of application programs fro this mu P. An ideal development system is one which has a sophisticated editing and filing capability, an assembler /compiler, and access to the mu P application. In many instances one also requires access to a <b>PROM</b> <b>programmer</b> as the application may utilized only PROMs for program storage. An INTEL 8080 mu P development system was implemented in the PS Division at CERN. While any other minicomputer would be suitable, this system utilizes a PDP- 11 / 45 minicomputer as the editing and file-handling machine, and an MCS 8 /MOD 80 mu P development system for assembling, PROM programming, and debugging user programs at run time. The two computers are linked by a CAMAC crate system, which provides the means of access to mu P applications in CAMAC and the interface of the development system to other applications.
