On 26 July 2017, Lockheed was awarded the first production award for the air-launched LRASM; low-rate initial <b>production</b> <b>Lot</b> 1 includes 23 missiles. On 27 July 2017, Lockheed {{announced the}}y had successfully conducted the first launch of an LRASM from an angled topside canister using a Mk-114 booster, demonstrating the missile's ability to be utilized on platforms lacking vertical launch cells.|$|E
25|$|Each {{observation}} measures {{one or more}} properties (such as weight, location, color) of observable bodies distinguished {{as independent}} objects or individuals. In survey sampling, weights {{can be applied to}} the data to adjust for the sample design, particularly stratified sampling. Results from probability theory and statistical theory are employed to guide the practice. In business and medical research, sampling is widely used for gathering information about a population. Acceptance sampling is used to determine if a <b>production</b> <b>lot</b> of material meets the governing specifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{dielectric}} is then formed {{over all}} the tantalum particle surfaces by the electrochemical process of anodization. To achieve this, the “pellet” is submerged into a very weak solution of acid and DC voltage is applied. The total dielectric thickness {{is determined by the}} final voltage applied during the forming process. Initially the power supply is kept in a constant current mode until the correct voltage (i.e. dielectric thickness) has been reached; it then holds this voltage and the current decays to close to zero to provide a uniform thickness throughout the device and <b>production</b> <b>lot.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1952, the Mint {{considered}} {{replacing the}} Lincoln cent {{with a new}} design by Mint Chief Engraver Gilroy Roberts, but Mint officials feared that the incoming Eisenhower administration would be hostile to replacing a Republican on the cent. [...] Several thousand 1955 pieces were struck with a doubled die, and display doubling of the date. [...] The Mint {{was aware of the}} pieces, and knew they were somewhere within a large <b>production</b> <b>lot,</b> but opted to release them, rather than destroy the entire lot.

On 1 July 2013, an initial operational test and evaluation (IOT) report found that the P-8A was [...] "operationally effective, operationally suitable, and ready for fleet introduction." [...] Six test and nine low-rate initial production aircraft had been delivered at that point. On 31 July 2013, Boeing received a $2.04 billion contract to build 13 P-8As in the fourth low-rate initial <b>production</b> <b>lot,</b> for a fleet of 37 aircraft {{by the end of}} 2016, and long-lead parts for 16 P-8As of the first full-rate <b>production</b> <b>lot.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Production of Two and a Half Men went on hiatus in January 2011 while Sheen {{underwent}} a substance rehabilitation program in his home, his third attempt at rehab in 12 months. The following month, CBS canceled the season's four remaining episodes after Sheen publicly made derogatory {{comments about the}} series' creator, Chuck Lorre, and Warner Bros. banned Sheen from entering its <b>production</b> <b>lot.</b> Sheen, already the highest-paid actor on television, responded by publicly demanding a 50 percent raise, claiming that {{in comparison to the}} amount that the series was making, he was [...] "underpaid".|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Parker and Stone began {{plotting}} {{a television}} sitcom starring {{the winner of}} the 2000 Presidential election. The duo were [...] "95 percent sure" [...] that Democratic candidate Al Gore would win, and tentatively titled the show Everybody Loves Al. The main goal was to parody sitcom tropes, such as a lovable main character, the sassy maid, and the wacky neighbor. Parker said the producers did not want to make fun of politics, but instead lampoon sitcoms. They threw a party the night of the election with the writers, with intentions to begin writing the following Monday and shooting the show in January 2001 with the inauguration. With the confusion of who the President would be, the show's production was pushed back. The show was filmed at Sony Pictures Studios, and was the first time Parker and Stone shot a show on a <b>production</b> <b>lot.</b>|$|E
