25|$|In 1955, {{following}} a contractual dispute with his publisher Dupuis, Franquin {{went for a}} short stint at rival Tintin magazine. This {{led to the creation}} of Modeste et <b>Pompon,</b> a gag series which included contributions from René Goscinny (of Astérix fame) and Peyo. Franquin later returned to Spirou, but his contractual commitment to Tintin meant that he had to contribute to both magazines, an unusual arrangement in the comic industry. The series was later passed on to authors such as Dino Attanasio and Mittéï (Jean Mariette).|$|E

These terms were based on shape or colour, and the National Dahlia Society included cactus, <b>pompon,</b> single, show and fancy in its 1904 guide.

This culminated in the 1969 publication of The International Register of Dahlia Names by the Royal Horticultural Society which became the central registering authority.|$|E
