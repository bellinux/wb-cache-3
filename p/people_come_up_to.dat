500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. <b>People</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> you {{in the street and}} shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz {{noted that}} the episode bore stylistic similarities to [...] "Paper Hearts". However, unlike the episode, [...] "Sein und Zeit", and its second part [...] "Closure", sets out to actually {{answer the question of}} Samantha's disappearance. Spotnitz later explained, [...] "it's similar [...] in the sense that what you always thought happened to Samantha may not have actually happened. 'Paper Hearts' never ultimately answers the question. We've had <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> us and say, 'Okay, so we know she's really dead, so what happened?' So we decided in this one to answer the question." [...] The episode's title, Sein und Zeit, is a reference to Martin Heidegger's best known work and means [...] "Being and Time" [...] in German.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of [...] "Irreplaceable", Hermansen thought that the track would not receive radio play because of the acoustic guitars, and deemed the song too pop-oriented. Hermansen did not expect [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] to conform to any genre. Despite his prediction, the song became successful on urban charts. It was played in New York and on country radio stations. Shortly {{after the release of}} [...] "Irreplaceable", Beyoncé told MTV: [...] "I love 'Irreplaceable'. I think it's important to have those songs. I've had so many <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me in tears, saying, 'I experienced my first breakup. If it wasn't for the song, I wouldn't be strong enough to not call. I wouldn't know how much I'm worth.' I'm happy {{to be a part of}} that." ...|$|E
50|$|Torker BMX Products: October 1, 1983 - November 1984 Torker {{literally}} {{went out}} of business while the racing team was racing on the East Coast. He didn't have a clue until <b>people</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him with the news.|$|R
2500|$|Margules' sister, actress Annette Margules, {{remembered him}} as {{charitable}} and generous {{to all who}} needed help. He took care of people, he even fed people.

I felt I had done terribly but afterward, all these <b>people</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me saying, 'I've loved you since Ionia.' I also wrote a bassline for their song Nine Hours Later, which they invited me onstage to play at several shows." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|Wall Street enjoyed renewed {{interest}} in the film in 1990 when the cover of Newsweek magazine asked, [...] "Is Greed Dead?" [...] after 1980s icons like Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky ran afoul of insider trading laws. Over the years, the film's screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, [...] "The movie changed my life. Once I saw it I knew that I {{wanted to get into}} such and such business. I wanted to be like Gordon Gekko". In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film. In recent years, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in Wall Street has changed and he replied, [...] "The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. Enron is a fiction, in a sense, {{in the same way that}} Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... Kenny Lay—he's the new Gordon Gekko". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Owen Gleiberman recently commented that the film, [...] "reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich—they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs, LaFontaine {{scored the}} winning {{goal in the}} fourth {{overtime}} period of the seventh and decisive game between the Islanders and Washington Capitals, known as the [...] "Easter Epic". [...] The game was started on Saturday, April 18, and concluded just before 2 a.m. on the 19th, Easter Sunday. [...] "It was the most memorable moment in my hockey life," [...] he later recalled. [...] "Even today, wherever I go, <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me and start telling me where they were during the Easter Epic." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, Liza {{says she}} sings because, [...] "Music has always {{affected}} me emotionally, has always calmed me and {{has given me}} hope. <b>People</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me after a concert, when I performed in Chechnya, in Grozny, and said that these songs heal. Although they are tragic, in the end there is always something positive - hope for a good life." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with HollywoodOutbreak.com, Lahti said she believed that her character struck a huge chord in the show, [...] "...when those episodes were airing, everywhere I went, <b>people</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me and said how much they hate me", others approached Lahti and praised her, saying, [...] "We love that you’re so mean to Stabler (Christopher Meloni). We’ve been waiting for someone <b>to</b> stand <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Asimov's {{original}} {{title for the}} story was [...] "Mathematical Games", but after the story appeared under the new title he decided he liked it. In his commentary on the story in The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories collection, Asimov stated, [...] "More <b>people</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me {{over the next few}} weeks to tell me they had read that story than had ever been the case for any other story I had ever written." ...|$|R
2500|$|Pete's catchphrase was [...] "alright treacle?" [...] {{pronounced}} [...] "awight treacle", {{often used}} when addressing female characters. Peter Dean has discussed why the catchphrase came into existence: [...] "I had this saying - treacle. There was this long scene with Den and his mistress and I {{had to ask}} her for a drink, but I completely forgot her name, so said 'Give us a drink, treacle'. And after the episode came out, the actress said her children kept calling her treacle! A couple of scriptwriters wanted to stop it - they didn't want any catchphrases. But one lovely writer put it in so I could say {{it was in the}} script! And it stuck. Poor people couldn't afford sugar so put treacle in their tea. And it just means someone sweet and nice. I always said it and my granddad said it. Even now <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me and ask if I'll say 'awight treacle' down their mobile phone to someone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've had a lot of <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{here you}} have the state of mind of whole brigades of people, and {{particularly}} of young people, nowadays. The current morality hasn't gripped them; they don't really believe in it at all. They may render it lip-service, but that is quite another thing. There are scarcely any tolerable novels to justify its prohibitions; its prohibitions do, in fact, remain unjustified amongst these ugly suppressions. You may, if you choose, silence the admission of this in literature and current discussion; you will not prevent it working out in lives. <b>People</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the great moments of passion crudely unaware, astoundingly unprepared as no really civilised and intelligently planned community would let any one be unprepared. They find themselves hedged about with customs that have no organic hold upon them, and mere discretions all generous spirits are disposed to despise.|$|E

I was very disheartened because I {{grew up on the}} Northern Beachesin Sydney and I didn't see it as any {{different}} whatsoever. It was happening 20 years ago when I was young. I remember there was violence, there was rape, there was party rape and there was party rape with alcohol and a lot of violence associated with that. Brian Joyce ...|$|R
5000|$|Along the way, <b>people</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her to {{ask what}} she was doing, and Mosher talked with them. A {{significant}} goal {{of the project was}} to engage local people and hear their stories. [...] Heidi Quante, creative coordinator with the climate action group 350.org, reported that [...] "Eve really found a new way of teaching people... Her art was so good, she became a magnet.
