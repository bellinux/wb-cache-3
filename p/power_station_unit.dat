5000|$|For example, [...] "normal" [...] fouling at a {{conventionally}} fired 500 MW (net electrical power) <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>unit</b> {{accounts for}} output losses of the steam turbine of 5 MW and more. In a 1,300 MW nuclear power station, typical losses could be 20 MW and up (up to 100% if the station shuts down due to fouling-induced component degradation). In seawater desalination plants, fouling {{may reduce the}} gained output ratio by two-digit percentages (the gained output ratio is an equivalent that puts the mass of generated distillate {{in relation to the}} steam used in the process). The extra electrical consumption in compressor-operated coolers is also easily in the two-digit area. In addition to the operational costs, also the capital cost increases because the heat exchangers have to be designed in larger sizes to compensate for the heat-transfer loss due to fouling. To the output losses listed above, one needs to add the cost of down-time required to inspect, clean, and repair the components (millions of dollars per day of shutdown in lost revenue in a typical power plant), and the cost of actually doing this maintenance. Finally, fouling is often a root cause of serious degradation problems that may limit the life of components or entire plants.|$|E
