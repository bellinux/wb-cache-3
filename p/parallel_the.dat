VT 132 begins running southeast and east through woods in Strafford, crossing into the town of Thetford.|$|R
5|$|Chinook Pass is {{the border}} between Pierce and Yakima {{counties}} and Mount Rainier National Park and the Wenatchee National Forest. The pass is also where the highway crosses the Pacific Crest Trail, a National Scenic Trail that was completed in 1993. East of Chinook Pass, the roadway begins to <b>parallel</b> <b>the</b> American River northeast to follow the Little Naches River, which becomes the Naches River. After a junction with {{the other end of}} the proposed SR168, named Little Naches Road, the highway exits the Wenatchee National Forest and enters Naches. The byway ends at US12 in Naches near the Naches Selah Canal.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{southeast}} quadrant from I-80 (at the time replacing US-40) at Parley's Canyon to 4600 South in Holladay began in mid-1965. This involved realigning Wasatch Boulevard to <b>parallel</b> <b>the</b> route and truncating that road at 3300 South. Prior to this, Wasatch Boulevard connected to US-40. The section from I-80 to 3300 South opened by January 1967, with the portion of roadway from 3300 South to 4500 South opening in November 1969.|$|E
5|$|Crossing into {{southern}} Otsego County, I-75 continues northward through Northern Michigan forests. It passes {{to the east}} of the community of Waters and Otsego Lake. North of exit279, I-75 proceeds by the Gaylord Regional Airport and crosses the 45th <b>Parallel,</b> <b>the</b> halfway mark between the Equator and the North Pole by latitude. The freeway then traverses the west side of Gaylord and continues through forests in the northern sections of the county. North of Vanderbilt, I-75 enters southern Cheboygan County, assuming the G.

5|$|Director Greg Beeman {{attempted}} {{to create a}} visual theme among the characters that would <b>parallel</b> <b>the</b> approaching storm. The episode would mark the departure of Eric Johnson as Whitney Fordman, though he would return as a special guest in seasons two and four. Although the Smallville finale pulled in just {{over half of the}} viewership attained by the pilot episode, it was still favorably received by critics. It was also nominated for two awards.|$|E
5|$|During the Classical and Romantic {{periods of}} music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, {{a great deal}} of musical {{instruments}} capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in <b>parallel,</b> <b>the</b> composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} and property owners {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are remembered in street names. Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets <b>parallel</b> <b>the</b> river, so they do not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, where the rails were set into the streets.|$|E

5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in <b>parallel.</b> <b>The</b> diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|If built, {{the light}} rail would have as its western {{terminus}} a maintenance facility across Highway 82 from the airport. It {{would include a}} stop at Buttermilk and <b>parallel</b> <b>the</b> highway, using the old Maroon Creek Bridge, until it reached Monarch Street downtown. There it would turn south to its eastern terminus at Rubey Park. If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail, it could be built as bus lanes at first.|$|E
5|$|In German Flatts, NY28 becomes Columbia Street and intersects the {{northern}} terminus of NY168. In Mohawk, NY28 intersects NY5S. After crossing the Mohawk River, NY28 becomes Mohawk Street and meets I-90 (New York State Thruway) at exit30. In {{the village of}} Herkimer, NY28 has a concurrency with NY5. North of NY5, NY28 begins to <b>parallel</b> <b>the</b> West Canada Creek. In Middleville, it intersects the western terminus of NY29 and {{the northern}} terminus of NY169. The highway executes a 90-degree turn at the three-route junction. NY28 continues towards the north paralleling the West Canada Creek. In Poland, NY28 begins a concurrency with NY8.|$|E

The highway heads southeast as two-lane Old Philadelphia Road in a forested area between a pair of quarries. As MD7 approaches the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, MD267 (Baltimore Street) splits to the southeast and crosses the tracks to pass through Charlestown, while MD7 begins to closely <b>parallel</b> <b>the</b> tracks along {{the northern edge of}} the town. The state highway receives the other end of MD267 (Bladen Street) as it curves away from the railroad. MD7 crosses Broad Creek and Stony Run before passing under the Amtrak line.|$|E
5|$|Married people, however, {{are advised}} not to worship Dhumavati. It {{is said that}} her worship creates a feeling of wanting {{solitude}} and distaste of worldly things, which is considered as highest characteristics of a spiritual quest. Thus, Dhumavati's worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who <b>parallel</b> <b>the</b> life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described a being partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand her power.|$|E
5|$|Near the De Peyster–Oswegatchie town line, {{the route}} begins to <b>parallel</b> <b>the</b> south {{bank of the}} Oswegatchie River as it merges with the {{alignment}} of CR10 (Old State Road). From here, NY184 continues alongside the Oswegatchie River into the town of Oswegatchie and its village of Heuvelton {{not far from the}} town line, where the route becomes known as Union Street.
