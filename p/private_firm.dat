5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based <b>private</b> <b>firm</b> Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed {{that there was nothing}} in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E

40|$|We examine two {{inconclusive}} {{issues in}} the IPO (initial public offering) underpricing literature. It is unclear whether <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> or state-owned enterprises (SOEs) underprice their IPOs more and how the institutional environment affects IPO underpricing.

40|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, China {{experienced}} perhaps the largest labour restructuring program in the world. This paper uses a new dataset of Chinese industrial enterprises to examine what leads to downsizing, and tries to understand the effects of labour downsizing on firms' technical efficiency, financial performance and employee wages. We find that downsizing is more prevalent in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and is more likely when enterprises are older, larger and have higher excess capacity. For both SOEs and <b>private</b> <b>firms,</b> downsizing is more likely when the prices of their products drop, but <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> respond more dramatically. Moreover, downsizing has serious short-term costs in terms of total factor productivity (TFP). For mild downsizing, <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> suffer more deterioration in productivity. The distribution of surplus after downsizing is more favourable to labour in SOEs. For severe downsizing, both SOEs and <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> exhibit lower TFP growth with similar magnitudes. Our findings imply that <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> emphasize profit goals, while SOEs place a greater weight on labour protection. Copyright (c) 2008 The Authors. ...|$|R
40|$|How does {{capital market}} access affect the capital {{structure}} decisions of firms? To examine this question, we compare the financing decisions {{of a large}} sample of private and public companies from 18 different European countries. We find {{significant differences in the}} leverage policies of <b>private</b> and public <b>firms.</b> <b>Private</b> <b>firms</b> have much higher leverage ratios than public firms. In particular, the leverage of <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> is more negatively related to past profitability, consistent with their less active adjustment. Other evidence corroborates sluggish adjustment and suggests that <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> face significantly higher cost of accessing external capital markets. When we compare <b>private</b> and public <b>firms</b> in countries that differ on creditor rights and contract enforceability, we find more pronounced differences in the leverage policies of <b>private</b> and public <b>firms</b> in countries that are strong on legal rights and their enforcement. In countries with weak rights and poor enforcement, the financing policies of public firms begin to resemble those of <b>private</b> <b>firms.</b> © 2011 The Authors.

25|$|In February 2007 the {{government}} unveiled its new buyback-contract formula, which significantly extended {{the length of}} the contracts to as long as 20 years. The buy-back scheme is a formula used by the Iranian government to attract foreign investment. Following the end of the Iran–Iraq War in 1988, Iran faced a major problem: it needed foreign investment if it did not want to lose its vital income from the oil and gas industry, yet its revolutionary ideology and Constitution forbid granting “concessions”. A compromise solution was found in 1989 with the First Five-Year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan. Under Note 29 of the said plan, the Iranian government is allowed to employ “buybacks” in its effort to meet the industrial and mineral needs in connection with exports, production and investment. Put in laymen terms, a buy-back transaction is a method of trade where plants, machinery, production equipment and technology is supplied (by a domestic or foreign <b>private</b> <b>firm),</b> in exchange for the goods that will be produced directly or indirectly by means of such facilities.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of auditor choice in debt pricing in <b>private</b> <b>firms.</b> Because both Moody's and Standard & Poor's {{comprehensively}} rate 144 A bond issues made by <b>private</b> <b>firms,</b> we can isolate {{the importance of the}} information and insurance motives for hiring a Big 4 auditor. After controlling for other determinants and nonrandom selection of external auditors, we fail to find that the presence of a Big 4 auditor affects the yield spreads or credit ratings on these securities. This implies that auditor choice does not influence either the perceptions of credit-rating agencies about the credibility of issuers' financial statements or the perceptions of bondholders about implicit insurance coverage against future losses stemming from audit failure. Consistent with Chaney, Jeter, and Shivakumar's 2004 finding that <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> do not pay more for Big 4 audits, our evidence suggests that <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> with Big 4 auditors do not benefit from lower borrowing costs.
