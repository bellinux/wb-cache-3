40|$|Since its {{earliest}} {{times in the}} building sector, glass has performed a shutting function, allowing natural light through and a clear outside view. The evolution of production and assembly techniques has transformed glass from a simple transparent element into a system with high technological potential. Designs for dynamic (user-controlled) systems allow transparency level modulation and indoor light quantity transmission control. These provide greater comfort and also offer economic benefits. The first phase of this research has analysed and verified the performance of some translucid systems that are either currently on the market, or in experimental phase. Apart from guaranteeing the primary shutting function, such systems undertake the task of adapting energy fluxes, thus obtaining controllable illumination levels via the use of special filtering modes. In {{the second phase of}} the research the experimentation of a new system was undertaken. A prototype (<b>patent</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> n. VI 2005 A 00294) for controlling illumination levels was created. Essentially, the system aims to control illumination levels through systems that are less complex than those presently available. While considering the growing demand for lassoed surfaces in modern building construction, the new system bypasses certain problems present in commercial systems, such as high cost/benefit relationship and durability...|$|E
40|$|Large {{quantity}} of asynchronous motors work in heavily dusted environments. On the end-winding insulation of the motors to 55 kW {{operating in the}} mining and smelting enterprise there is a 3 cm dust layer, which {{may lead to the}} asynchronous motor end-winding local overheat and consequent early breakdown. Contemporary literature allocates insufficient consideration to the issue of studying the impact the winding dust pollution has on the motor lifespan; {{for the most part they}} are experimental researches. The article investigates and establishes correlation relationship between the additional winding heating and the end-winding dust layer thickness. The investigation considers the induction motor winding to be a homogeneous solid and assumes the motor thermal conditions steady inasmuch as the winding insulation dust-cover forming time is much greater than the motor-heating time constant. The obtained expression permits determining the winding dust level by temperature variations; the dependence has linear character. Neither the motor type, size, nor the capacity do affect the local insulation overheating since the temperature difference between the windings being dust laden does not exceed 10 % for asynchronous motors of various capacity. The authors develop an appliance that enables the winding dustiness level monitoring and signals of necessity for the preventive cleaning measures implementation. The appliance operation principle is based on measuring results comparison of the two temperature-sensing devices mounted on the end-winding: one – in the upper part, and the other – in the bottom. The differential in the sensors reading-out allows estimating the dust layer sedimentation on the end-winding. A <b>patent</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> has been issued on the investigation results.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) is stored under low {{temperature}} and high pressure. It {{has to be}} gasified before it is used. Therefore, LNG gasification unit is essential and {{it is vital to}} the high-efficiency utilization of LNG. In this paper, a new-type LNG rapid gasification unit was developed. Adopted in this unit are some innovative technologies authorized with the national <b>patent</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention,</b> such as the umbrella-shape gas flow circle unit, the flue gas circulation system and the water feeding system, which help to guarantee its operation safety and increase its operation efficiency. After it was justified in lab test, the unit for industrial application was designed and manufactured and then tested to verify its design rationality. The results show that the new-type LNG rapid gasification unit meets the design requirements in the aspect of efficiency, exhaust gas loss, radiation loss and fuel gas consumption rate; at a load of 1800 – 2200  m 3 /h, its efficiency is over 95 %; at a load of 1976. 0  m 3 /h which is close to the design value of 2000  m 3 /h, its efficiency is 96. 34 % or even up to 2800  m 3 /h. This new-type LNG rapid gasification unit is adaptable to a large range of loads and can adapt to the rapid increase of external load. Its fuel gas consumption rate is only 1. 5 %, which is in the range of energy conservation. It presents the advantages of high heating efficiency, rapid startup, high gasification rate, compact structure, small land occupation and invulnerability to the environment, therefore, it is applicable to the middle and small independent regions which cannot be connected to the natural gas supply pipeline networks due to various reasons...|$|E
