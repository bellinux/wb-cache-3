40|$|Floating {{platforms}} for {{offshore wind}} {{tend to be}} very expensive and different solutions have been proposed to increase their cost-effectiveness. One of them involves the combination of offshore wind generation with other forms of ocean renewable energy, as is the subject of the FP 7 <b>project</b> <b>Marina</b> Platform. In particular, wave energy from the sea has been investigated since the ' 70 s and although a few technologies have already reached a pre-commercial stage, their actual economic feasibility can still be questioned so that the possibility of sharing cables, moorings and even the structure with offshore wind turbine is very interesting also {{from the point of view}} of wave energy developers. This paper presents the design, modeling and analysis of a combined concept composed of a semi-submersible platfor...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of the project 'Fieldwork Coastal Engineering', part of the Master studies Hydraulic Engineering of Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). It has been made by {{students}} of the TU Delft, in cooperation with students from the University of Architecture in Sophia. The fieldwork took place in Byala, Bulgaria, between 5 th October and 12 th October 2006. The aim of the fieldwork {{is to give the}} students insight in how to set up a measuring campaign, how such a campaign will be executed and how it should be reported. This year there is also a cooperation with a coastal development <b>project,</b> <b>Marina</b> Black Sea. This is a new tourist development along the Bulgarian coast. The data, collected during the measurements, have been used to make a preliminary design for a breakwater that can protect the future marina, which is being developed at the moment. This report is above all a technical report. The data collected with the measurements is presented, as well as the methods used for the measurements. Furthermore, the preliminary design of the normative cross-section of the breakwater has been included. The report {{can be used as a}} starting point by those who will make the final design for the breakwater...|$|E
40|$|Regulatory {{ecotoxicity}} {{testing of}} chemicals is of societal importance {{and a large}} effort is undertaken at the OECD to ensure that OECD test guidelines (TGs) for nanomaterials (NMs) are available. Significant progress to support the adaptation of selected TGs to NMs was achieved {{in the context of}} the <b>project</b> <b>MARINA</b> ([URL] funded within the 7 th European Framework Programme. Eight OECD TGs were adapted based on the testing of at least one ion-releasing NM (Ag) and two inert NMs (TiO 2). With the materials applied, two main variants of NMs (ion releasing vs. inert NMs) were addressed. As the modifications of the test guidelines refer to general test topics (e. g. test duration or measuring principle) we assume that the described approaches and modifications will be suitable for the testing of further NMs with other chemical compositions. Firm proposals for modification of protocols with scientific justification(s) are presented for the following tests: growth inhibition using the green algae Raphidocelis subcapitata (formerly: Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; TG 201), acute toxicity with the crustacean Daphnia magna (TG 202), development toxicity with the fish Danio rerio (TG 210), reproduction of the sediment-living worm Lumbriculus variegatus (TG 225), activity of soil microflora (TGs 216, 217), and reproduction of the invertebrates (Enchytraeus crypticus, Eisenia fetida, TGs 220, 222). Additionally, test descriptions for two further test systems (root elongation of plants in hydroponic culture; test on fish cells) are presented. Ecotoxicological data obtained with the modified test guidelines for TiO 2 NMs and Ag NM and detailed method descriptions are available...|$|E

40|$|Physicochemical {{properties}} of chemicals affect their exposure, toxicokinetics/fate and hazard, and for nanomaterials, the variation of these properties {{results in a}} wide variety of materials with potentially different risks. To limit the amount of testing for risk assessment, the information gathering process for nanomaterials needs to be efficient. At the same time, sufficient information to assess the safety of human health and the environment should be available for each nanomaterial. Grouping and read-across approaches can be utilised to meet these goals. This article presents different possible applications of grouping and read-across for nanomaterials within the broader perspective of the MARINA Risk Assessment Strategy (RAS), as developed in the EU FP 7 <b>project</b> <b>MARINA.</b> Firstly, nanomaterials can be grouped based on limited variation in physicochemical properties to subsequently design an efficient testing strategy that covers the entire group. Secondly, knowledge about exposure, toxicokinetics/fate or hazard, for example via properties such as dissolution rate, aspect ratio, chemical (non-) activity, can be used to organise similar materials in generic groups to frame issues that need further attention, or potentially to read-across. Thirdly, when data related to specific endpoints is required, read-across can be considered, using data from a source material for the target nanomaterial. Read-across could be based on a scientifically sound justification that exposure, distribution to the target (fate/toxicokinetics) and hazard of the target material are similar to, or less than, the source material. These grouping and read-across approaches pave the way for better use of available information on nanomaterials and are flexible enough to allow future adaptations related to scientific developments.
