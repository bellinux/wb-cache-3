50|$|Millettia stuhlmannii, {{commonly}} known as <b>panga</b> <b>panga,</b> is a well-known species of timber tree that is native to the southeastern Afrotropics. The alternative name partridge wood refers to the light and dark patterns of its heartwood, which is said to form ‘partridge-breast’ figures. The wood of the tropical species M. laurentii has similar qualities and uses, but is slightly darker, and lacks the copious yellowish white resin of the heartwood vessels. Its foliage {{is similar to that}} of Pterocarpus rotundifolius, and it may be confused with the latter when observed from a distance.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of various types of surface treatments on selected tropical wood species and the subsequent change of colour due {{to the effect of}} natural and simulated UV radiation. Measurements were performed on the following three species: zebrano (Microberlinia brazzavillensis), <b>panga</b> <b>panga</b> (Millettia Stuhlmannii) and african padouk (Pterocarpus soyauxii). As surface treatment were used water-based, polyurethane, oil and solvent-based paint. Samples were exposed to simulated UV radiation. The total duration of radiation was 168 hours. After that the colour changes delta E* were measured by using a spectrophotometer. The aim was to compare the different paints used on all woods and their colour change. The thesis also includes research of light permanency of coating exposed to natural UV radiation...|$|E
