5|$|The modern Olympic Games {{were first}} held in Athens in 1896, and {{travelled}} to Paris {{four years later}} {{as part of the}} 1900 Exposition Universelle world's fair. The second Games featured a greatly expanded range of events from the first, up from 43 to 95. Among the events added in 1900 was the tug of war. Two tug of war teams were entered for the Paris tournament; Racing Club de France represented the host nation, along with a team from the United States which was composed of six athletes that were taking part in various other events during the Games. The American team withdrew from the competition, as they discovered that the tug of war was scheduled {{at the same time as}} the hammer throw which three of their team were competing in. A Scandinavian team was accepted as a late-entry by the organisers, comprising a mix of Swedish and Danish athletes competing at the Games. Various reports assign the credit for the formation and entry of this team to different sources; a Danish account claimed that it was one of the Danish <b>pullers,</b> Eugen Schmidt who was responsible, while a Swedish record attributed it to their representative at the Games, Lieutenant Bergh.|$|E
5|$|The French team, {{representing}} the Racing Club de France, included 3 {{players who were}} later part of the gold-winning rugby team for France. Jean Collas, Charles Gondouin, and Émile Sarrade were all part of both teams, while it is often misreported that another of their rugby teammates, the Haitian-born Constantin Henriquez was also on the tug of war team, {{but this was a}} case of mistaken identity due to their similar names, with Colombian-born Francisco Henríquez de Zubiría taking part in the tug of war. The other two members of the tug-of-war team were Raymond Basset and Joseph Roffo. The combined Scandinavian team featured three athletes from each of Sweden and Denmark. The Swedish competitors were August Nilsson, who also took part in the pole vault and shot put, Gustaf Söderström, who was competing in the shot put and the discus throw, and Karl Staaf, who did the pole vault, triple jump, standing triple jump and hammer throw. Only one of the three Danish <b>pullers</b> took part in any other events; Charles Winckler competed in the shot put and discus throw. Dane Edgar Aabye was at the Games as a journalist for the Politiken newspaper, but was recruited into the team to make up the numbers as one of the original entrants was injured. Eugen Schmidt, the sixth member of the team, had competed in the 100 metres sprint and the 200 metre rifle shooting at the 1896 Games, and founded the Danish Sports Federation that same year.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the day of}} 25 October, the Americans redeployed and {{improved}} their defences against the Japanese attack they were expecting that night. In the west, Hanneken and the 5th Marines closed the gap between their two forces. Along the southern portion of the perimeter, <b>Puller's</b> and Hall's troops disentwined and repositioned. <b>Puller's</b> men fortified the western [...] of the sector and the 164th soldiers took the eastern [...] segment. The division reserve, the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment was placed directly behind Hall's and <b>Puller's</b> positions.|$|R

5|$|Recognizing {{that a major}} Japanese {{attack was}} underway, Puller {{requested}} reinforcement. At 03:45, the 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall and being held in reserve, was fed piecemeal into <b>Puller's</b> line. In spite of the darkness and intermittent heavy rain, the Army National Guard troops were placed in <b>Puller's</b> defences before daybreak.|$|R

Graduating from Shaker Heights High School in 1943, he briefly attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, where he was initiated into the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} escalated in May 1938 {{when the}} Governor General abolished the <b>pullers</b> license entirely despite Japanese Canadians protests. This resulted in many younger Japanese Canadians being forced from the fishing industry, leaving Japanese Canadian net men {{to fend for}} themselves. Later that year, in August, a change to the borders of fishing districts in the area resulted {{in the loss of}} license for several Japanese-Canadian fishermen who claimed they had not been informed of the change. While these events did result in reduced competition from Japanese Canadians in the fishing industry, it created further tensions elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Before {{beginning}} to shoe, the farrier removes the old shoe using pincers (shoe <b>pullers)</b> and trims the hoof {{wall to the}} desired length with nippers, a sharp pliers-like tool, and the sole and frog of the hoof with a hoof knife. Shoes do not allow the hoof to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The coffin bone inside the hoof should line up straight with both bones in the pastern. If the excess hoof is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on {{the legs of the}} animal.|$|E

25|$|Methanol is {{occasionally}} used to fuel {{internal combustion}} engines. Pure methanol {{is required by}} rule {{to be used in}} Champcars, Monster Trucks, USAC sprint cars (as well as midgets, modifieds, etc.), and other dirt track series, such as World of Outlaws, and Motorcycle Speedway, mainly because, {{in the event of an}} accident, methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke. Since the late 1940s, Methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control, control line, free flight airplanes, cars and trucks; such engines use a platinum filament glow plug that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction. Drag racers, mud racers, and heavily modified tractor <b>pullers</b> also use methanol as the primary fuel source. Methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a Top Alcohol Dragster and, until the end of the 2006 season, all vehicles in the Indianapolis 500 had to run on methanol. As a fuel for mud racers, methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone.|$|E

25|$|She {{actively}} but secretly helped {{freedom fighters}} of the Liberation War. In 1971, several people in Dhaka including professor Ghyasuddin Ahmed and famous writer Shahidullah Kaiser collected medicine {{and food and}} delivered those to the posts of Sufia Kamal's house, from where the freedom fighters picked those up for their training outpost. From July 1971, she {{used to go to}} the hospital with food and medicine for the injured people of war. At that time there was an acute crisis of food and medicine in the hospital. She used to give food and medicine to certain rickshaw <b>pullers</b> at the Science Laboratory, Dhaka. They would take the food and medicine to the freedom fighters. She was able to establish closer contact with the freedom fighters such as Abul Barak Alvi, Shafi Imam Rumi, Masud Sadek Chullu and Jwel in August. As the Pakistani army kept their strong watch on her, she would try to help the freedom fighters in different ways ignoring the risks. Except Abul Barak Alvi, all others died in the hand of the Pakistani Army. The Pakistan Army and their collaborators killed Sufia Kamal's son-in-law, Kahar Chowdhury, because they were very angry with her. Early December 1971 Shahidullah Kaiser, Munier Chowdhury and Dr. Fazle Rabbi cautioned her to leave Dhaka but they themselves did not leave and got caught and later got killed.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to how}} the riots began. According to one source they were sparked by a {{physical}} altercation between a Japanese marine and a local ricksha puller, in which the latter was seriously injured. When a coolie attempted to come to the assistance of the ricksha puller, the marine stabbed him through the heart with his sword. Rather than disciplining the marine for his conduct, the Japanese naval commander ordered a detachment of troops to fire machine guns at a crowd of protestors who had gathered around the concession. The conflict between Japanese troops and Chinese protestors eventually led to dozens of fatalities. According to Japanese reports little after 3:00 PM on 3 April Chinese children threw stones at two sailors who were passing by Tsumazuru, a luxury restaurant on Xiechang Road in the Japanese concession in Hankou. In the ensuing verbal altercation, about 30 Chinese turned upon the sailors and then a group of rickshaw <b>pullers</b> surrounded them and started to beat them. The sailors knocked over one of the rickshaw men and took refuge in the nearby restaurant Yamayoshi. Immediately Chinese onlookers entered the fray and both Yamayoshi and a neighbouring restaurant, the Naniwa Buffet, were utterly destroyed. To make matters worse, false rumors were spread that Japanese sailors had killed Chinese and that a rickshaw man had been stabbed with a knife. Just then, near Pinghe Street on the northern side of the Japanese concession, a group of Chinese who were taking part in the celebratory procession of an organizational meeting of the farmers’ association instead stormed the Japanese concession, two thirds of which was engulfed by the mob. When they saw Japanese people, they surrounded them and beat them, and Japanese businesses were attacked one by one. The attacks of these rioters were undertaken in a thorough and precise manner. The vice-consul Tanaka rushed to the scene when he heard about the disturbances but although he called out to the crowd that he was a consul, he was still assaulted. At the house of a certain Mr. Tamura near the barbershop at the corner of Nanxiao Road and Pinghe Street the mob found his wife, who was lying in a sickbed shortly after giving birth, and kicked her to death before abandoning her corpse where they killed her.|$|E

500|$|The GRC scheme {{has been}} criticized as {{weakening}} the candidate–voter relationship, because {{it may be more}} difficult for voters to feel that candidates actually represent them when {{there are a number of}} candidates in a team to vote for. Most voters elect MPs whom they can identify with and are better able to represent their interests. It would be much easier for voters to identify with a single candidate than with a team of, say, four individuals. Also, since there will be key vote <b>pullers</b> in every GRC, the unknown or unpopular candidate is [...] "dragged into Parliament on the coat-tails of the major vote-puller". This alienates the electorate from its representatives, thereby undermining the idea of representation. Since the people [...] "cannot clearly identify themselves with the candidates ... responsibility for choices cannot be ascribed to the people".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{dismantling}} project, there was debate by local residents {{on whether the}} wrecked stern should be removed. Some local officials believed the stern, which lay on a remote area of the beach, was not a hazard or an eyesore. Arnie Roblan, a state representative from Coos Bay, called the wreck a potential tourist attraction. For some residents, uncertainty remained surrounding Titan's removal plan, with the worry that the stern {{would be unable to}} withstand the force of the hydraulic <b>pullers</b> and that parts of the ship already buried in the sand would be unmovable. The president of the Coos Bay city council expressed concern that the proposed removal operation could cause ecological damage that would not occur if the ship were left on the beach.

5|$|At 17:00 on 24 September, as <b>Puller's</b> men {{hiked up}} the {{northeast}} slope of Mount Austen, they surprised {{and killed a}} bivouac of 16 Japanese soldiers. The noise from the skirmish alerted several companies of Oka's Maizuru Battalion, who were emplaced nearby. The Maizuru troops quickly attacked <b>Puller's</b> Marines, who took cover and returned fire. Acting on Oka's orders, the Japanese slowly disengaged while withdrawing towards the Matanikau River, and the engagement was over by nightfall. The Marines counted 30 dead Japanese and had suffered 13 dead and 25 wounded. Puller radioed headquarters and requested help to evacuate the wounded. Vandegrift replied that he would send the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (2/5) as reinforcements the next day.|$|R

At the same time, McDougal's battalion was to attack across the sand spit. If the attacks were successful, the rest of <b>Puller's</b> battalion would land by boat west of Point Cruz to take the Japanese by surprise from the rear. Aircraft from Henderson Field—as well as Marine [...] and [...] artillery—would provide support for the operation. The Marine offensive would begin the next day, on 27 September.|$|R
