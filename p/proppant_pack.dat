50|$|Guar gums are {{preferred}} as thickeners for {{enhanced oil}} recovery (EOR). Guar gum and its derivatives account {{for most of}} the gelled fracturing fluids. Guar is more water-soluble than other gums, and it is also a better emulsifier, because it has more galactose branch points. Guar gum shows high low-shear viscosity, but it is strongly shear-thinning. Being non-ionic, it is not affected by ionic strength or pH but will degrade at low pH at moderate temperature (pH 3 at 50 °C). Guar's derivatives demonstrate stability in high temperature and pH environments. Guar use allows for achieving exceptionally high viscosities, which improves the ability of the fracturing liquid to transport proppant. Guar hydrates fairly rapidly in cold water to give highly viscous pseudoplastic solutions of, generally, greater low-shear viscosity than other hydrocolloids. The colloidal solids present in guar make fluids more efficient by creating less filter cake. <b>Proppant</b> <b>pack</b> conductivity is maintained by utilizing a fluid that has excellent fluid loss control, such as the colloidal solids present in guar gum.|$|E

This paper presents a simplified mathematical model of a crack partially filled with compressible proppant subject to remote compressive stress and a computational approach for evaluating the productivity rate of hydraulically stimulated wells. The conducted case studies confirm that the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> distribution and compressibility {{have a significant impact}} on well productivity. Furthermore, it is suggested that under certain conditions, for example, relatively low confining stresses, the partially propped fractures can lead to higher well production rate than fractures fully filled with proppant. The benefit of reducing <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> compressibility for improving the performance of wells with partially propped fractures is also verified. L Bortolan Neto and A Khann...|$|E
3000|$|There are {{a number}} of obvious {{drawbacks}} to these technologies. For example, the blocking of high permeability zones in the oil recovery scenario is somewhat uneven and could always be better. For the shale gas application, we have already alluded to the undesirable chemical viscosifiers and breakers added to modify viscosity. Recent work on viscoelastic surfactants (Dogon and Golombok 2016 a, b), has demonstrated that viscosity modifications can be tuned to arise from the flow conditions associated with the different stages of the process i.e., they display flow-induced viscoelasticity whereby the viscosity adjusts according to the flow conditions. For oil recovery this means that they automatically show high fluid viscous resistance in high permeability regions (Santvoort and Golombok 2018). For the fracking problem it means that they have initially high viscosity for proppant carrying purposes but afterwards during “flowback”, the viscosity falls to near water levels enabling return flow through the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> without dislodging particles. This corresponds to a low viscosity at the permeability associated with the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack.</b> (Note that the permeability of such a <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> is much higher than the permeabilities associated with the oil production problem discussed above.) [...]...|$|E
40|$|Fluids {{displaying}} flow induced viscoelasticity {{are tested}} for proppant placement and flow back. The viscosity is self-regulating and obviates {{the need for}} viscosifiers and breakers. The flow induced viscoelasticity degrades at higher flow rates enabling good injectivity. Particle tracking velocimetry is performed to study the influence of flow rate on the particle settling under different flow regimes. These tests show that above a critical flow rate particles are maintained in suspension and settle with a constant velocity giving the fluid an apparent viscosity up to 200 mPa. s compared to a zero-shear viscosity of 2 mPa. s. During flowback in porous <b>proppant</b> <b>packs</b> the fluid has a low flow resistance with a viscosity comparable to its zero-sheared state.

40|$|In {{hydraulic}} fracturing stimulation treatments for organic-rich mudrocks, some issues that pose challenges in pre-completions design include selection of intervals for stimulation treatment, and selection of proppants for stimulation design. After the stimulation treatment, a key post-completions {{issue is the}} detection of the fracture and evaluation of the fracture performance. The application of petrophysical and geophysical analysis can offer potential solutions to these issues, thereby lead to improvements of both pre-completions and post-completions design of the {{hydraulic fracturing}} treatment. The objectives of this dissertation are (a) to introduce a rock classification workflow, which integrates geologic, petrophysical and geomechanical analysis, for the determination of zones for fracture stimulation treatments, (b) {{to develop a new}} technique for characterization of mechanical damage in <b>proppant</b> <b>packs</b> to improve the selection of proppants for stimulation treatment, and (c) to investigate the use of nanoparticles as contrast agents that enhances magnetic susceptibility measurements for the detection of hydraulic fractures after stimulation treatments. I first demonstrated that the integrated rock classification workflow, which includes geologic attributes of the formation, in-situ stress assessment capturing the effects of anisotropy in organic-rich mudrocks, and also takes into account anisotropic poroelastic coefficients, can improve the selection strategy for completion zones. Next, I introduced the application of the Hertz-Mindlin granular contact model to approximate the effective elastic properties of <b>proppant</b> <b>packs.</b> I used the calibration parameters of the Hertz-Mindlin model to develop correlations for the prediction of weight percentage of crushed proppants. Finally, from laboratory investigations, I demonstrated that superparamagnetic nanoparticles when mixed with proppants enhance the reliability of detecting fractures using magnetic susceptibility measurements. I also presented the sensitivity of the magnetic susceptibility measurements to the composition of proppants, concentration of nanoparticles, and the width of the induced fractures. The outcomes of this dissertation demonstrate significant contribution of petrophysical and geophysical analysis in achieving better fracture performance from completions design. Better fracture performance can be achieved by improving the strategies for identifying prolific zones for fracture initiation and propagation, achieving good fracture conductivity from the selection of proppants, and analyzing post-fracture performance of hydraulic fracturing treatments. These improvements could in turn result in improved rates and recoveries from organic-rich mudrock formations...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{evolution}} of friction and permeability of a propped fracture under shear. We {{examine the effects of}} normal stress, proppant thickness, proppant size, and fracture wall texture on the frictional and transport response of <b>proppant</b> <b>packs</b> confined between planar fracture surfaces. The proppant-absent and proppant-filled fractures show different frictional strength. For fractures with proppants, the frictional response is mainly controlled by the normal stress and proppant thickness. The depth of shearing-concurrent striations on fracture surfaces suggests that the magnitude of proppant embedment is controlled by the applied normal stress. Under high normal stress, the reduced friction implies that shear slip is more likely to occur on propped fractures in deeper reservoirs. The {{increase in the number of}} proppant layers, from monolayer to triple layers, significantly increases the friction of the propped fracture due to the interlocking of the particles and jamming. Permeability of the propped fracture is mainly controlled by the magnitude of the normal stress, the proppant thickness, and the proppant grain size. Permeability of the propped fracture decreases during shearing due to proppant particle crushing and related clogging. Proppants are prone to crushing if the shear loading evolves concurrently with the normal loading...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} parameters in the success of a hydraulic fracturing treatment is to have sufficiently high fracture conductivity. Unbroken polymers can cause permeability impairment in the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> and/or in the matrix along the fracture face. The objectives of this research project were to design and set up an experimental apparatus for dynamic fracture conductivity testing and to create a fracture conductivity test workflow standard. This entirely new dynamic fracture conductivity measurement will be used to perform extensive experiments to study fracturing fluid cleanup characteristics and investigate damage resulting from unbroken polymer gel in the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack.</b> The dynamic fracture conductivity experiment comprises two parts: pumping fracturing fluid into the cell and measuring <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> conductivity. I carefully designed the hydraulic fracturing laboratory to provide appropriate scaling of the field conditions experimentally.

40|$|Proppants are a {{specific}} application of granular {{materials used in}} oil/gas well stimulation. Employment of hard and soft particle mixtures {{is one of the}} many approaches availed by the industry to improve fracture resistance and the stability of the granular pack in the hydraulic fracture. Current industrial practices of proppant characterization involve long term and expensive conductivity tests. However, the mechanics governing the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> response, in particular the effects due to material, shape and size of particles on the pack porosity, stiffness and particle fragmentation are not understood clearly. The present research embodies analytical and experimental approach to model hard (ceramic) and soft (walnut shell and/or pure aluminum) proppant mixtures by taking into account polydispersity in size, shape and material type of individual particles. The hydraulic fracture condition is represented through confined compression and flowback loads. The particle interactions clearly illustrate changes in pore space as a function of pressure, mixture composition and friction. Single particle compression tests on individual particles are carried out to obtain mechanical properties which are incorporated into the finite element models and are further correlated with the compression/crush response of the mixture. The <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> stiffness and particle fragmentation depends strongly on the mixture composition as illustrated in the models and experiments. The flowback models demonstrated that the formation of a stable arch is essential to pack stability. Additional variables that enhance flowback resistance are identified as: addition of softer particles to a pack, softer rock surfaces and higher inter-particle friction. The computational studies also led to the discovery of better, and more efficient pack compositions such as - short and thin pure Al needles/ceramic and the pistachio shells/ceramic mixtures. These analytical results have generated great interest and are engaged in the design of experiments to formulate future <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> mixtures at Baker Hughes Pressure Pumping, Tomball, TX...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{is a well}} completions {{technique that}} induces a network of flow channels in a reservoir. These channels are characterized by fracture conductivity, {{a measure of how}} easily a liquid or gas flows through the fracture. Fracture conductivity is influenced by several variables including fracture surface roughness, fracture closure stress, proppant size, and proppant concentration. The proppant concentration within a fracture can significantly affect the magnitude of fracture conductivity, which enhances the productivity of a hydraulically fractured well. Therefore, understanding the relationship between proppant concentration and fracture conductivity is critical to the successful development of unconventional reservoirs such as the Eagle Ford Shale. This work investigates the fracture conductivities of seven Eagle Ford Shale samples collected from an outcrop of facies B. Rough fractures were induced in the samples and laboratory experiments that closely followed the API RP- 61 procedure were conducted on the samples to measure the unpropped and propped conductivities. Propped experiments were performed with 30 / 50 mesh white sand at two different areal concentrations within the fracture, 0. 1 lb/ft^(2) and 0. 2 lb/ft^(2). Assuming a cubical packing arrangement, the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> is calculated to be a partial monolayer of 0. 8 layers at 0. 1 lb/ft^(2) and a pack of 1. 6 layers at 0. 2 lb/ft^(2). The results show that when the fractures are propped with 0. 1 lb/ft^(2) or 0. 2 lb/ft^(2), fracture conductivity values are approximately two orders of magnitude greater than unpropped conductivity values. Therefore, even low areal concentrations of proppant in a fracture can significantly enhance conductivity in the Eagle Ford Shale. Comparing the results of the two propped experiment types, conductivity values at 0. 1 lb/ft^(2) proppant concentration are on average 49 % higher than conductivity values at 0. 2 lb/ft^(2). This difference is attributed to the partial monolayer pack at 0. 1 lb/ft^(2) and <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> of 1. 6 layers at 0. 2 lb/ft^(2). However as closure stress increases from 1, 000 psi to 6, 000 psi, fracture conductivity at 0. 2 lb/ft^(2) decreases more slowly than conductivity at 0. 1 lb/ft^(2). These results suggest that the conductivity of the denser <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> at 0. 2 lb/ft^(2) is more resistant to the flow inhibiting effects caused by proppant embedment and proppant crushing...|$|E

However, recent experimental {{studies have shown}} that the Forchheimer model is unable to fit laboratory results at high flow rates. On the other hand, the non-Darcy flow model, proposed by Barree and Conway, is capable of describing the entire range of relationships between flow rate and potential gradient from low- to high-flow rates through <b>proppant</b> <b>packs.</b> In this paper, we present a numerical model by incorporating the Barree and Conway model into a general-purpose reservoir simulator for modeling single-phase and multiphase non-Darcy flow in porous and fractured media. The numerical formulation is based on the TOUGH 2 methodology, i. e., spatial integral-finite-difference discretization, leading to an unstructured grid, followed by time discretization carried out with a backward, first-order, finite-difference method. The final discrete nonlinear equations are handled fully implicitly by Newton iteration. In the numerical approach, flow through fractured rock is handled using a general multi-continuum approach, applicable to both continuum and discrete fracture conceptual models. In an effort for model validation, we use analytical solutions to verify our numerical model results for both single-phase and multiphase non-Darcy flow. In addition, the numerical model is applied for well testing analysis of transient non-Darcy flow toward a well...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{research}} project had two parts, with separate objectives. Both parts of the project used a machine that applied ultrasonic waves to our samples. The purpose of Part A {{was to determine if}} ultrasonic waves applied to a loaded crush cell has an effect on pack porosity. Previous work by C. R. Bulau (URP) and C. Ireland (SURF) demonstrated that the crush testing results were a strong function of the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack’s</b> porosity. Variable porosity leads to poor repeatability of crush resistance measurements. Three variables were evaluated while measuring porosity: amplitude of the ultrasonic waves, time of exposure, and the effect of closure stress applied to a crush cell during the proppant’s settling process. Our data shows that pack porosity can be stabilized ultrasonically. Part B’s goal was to quantitatively determine the effectiveness of ultrasonically removing fines from proppant by measuring the mass reduction of a sample treated with ultrasonic cleaning. This result was compared to measurements obtained using the API RP 19 C standard method of testing turbidity. It was hypothesized that proppant that measures a low turbidity will still have a mass percent of fines that are released during ultrasonic cleaning. Our data confirmed Part B’s hypothesis. This project may lead to future studies relating the measured conductivity of the sample after ultrasonic cleansing to the conductivity of the original. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{acoustic}} sensing (DAS) is {{an emerging}} technology in hydraulic fracture diagnosis. Current uses of DAS {{systems have been}} limited to qualitative analysis that pinpoint noise sources, such as injection into formation or production from a fracture. Identification of noise verifies that injection or production is happening and its sound intensities at the different locations give a relative indication as to which locations took more fluid or produced more fluid post-treatment. Signal processing techniques and quantitative analysis are used to measure flow rates in a simulated fractured well. Production into a 5 -? inch OD well was simulated by injecting fluid through packed bed of 16 / 30 mesh, 20 / 40 mesh and 30 / 50 mesh proppant. Gas was injected at varying rates into the fracture and into the well. The noise produced from production was recorded with a hydrophone. The acoustic signal was transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain through a fast Fourier transform (FFT) for analysis. The experimental {{results showed that the}} frequency of sound and its intensity were crucial in determining the amount of fluid being produced. The sound level of the peak frequencies were found to be linearly related to the flow rate. The results verified that sound alone can be used to measure flow rate through a <b>proppant</b> <b>packed</b> fracture and perforation tunnel.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracture}} {{treatments are}} used in low permeability shale reservoirs {{in order to provide}} highly conductive pathways from the reservoir to the wellbore. The success of these treatments is highly reliant on the created fracture conductivity. Optimizing fracture designs to improve well performance requires knowledge of how fracture conductivity is affected by rock and proppant characteristics. This study investigates the relationship between rock characteristics and laboratory measurements of propped and unpropped fracture conductivity of outcrop samples. These samples are from the Eagle Ford shale and the Fayetteville shale. Triaxial compression tests were performed on core specimens {{in order to determine the}} Young?s Modulus and Poisson?s Ratio of the outcrop samples. A combination of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the mineralogy. Profilometer surface scans were also performed to characterize the fracture topography. The results from this study show that the main factors affecting fracture conductivity are closure stress and proppant characteristics (concentration, size, and strength). For unpropped fractures, the fracture topography is the main factor in determining fracture conductivity. The topography interaction of the two surfaces determines the fracture width. A higher Young?s Modulus helps maintain this fracture width by resisting deformation as closure stress increases. For propped fractures, the most influential factor in determining fracture conductivity is proppant characteristics (concentration, size, and strength). At a proppant monolayer placement, the major mechanism for conductivity loss is proppant embedment, leading to decreased fracture width. A higher Young?s Modulus reduces the proppant embedment and better maintains fracture conductivity as closure stress increases. For a multilayer <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> concentration, the effect of rock characteristics is negligible compared to the effect of <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The key to {{producing}} gas from tight gas reservoirs {{is to create}} a long, highly conductive flow path, via the placement of a hydraulic fracture, to stimulate flow from the reservoir to the wellbore. Viscous fluid is used to transport proppant into the fracture. However, these same viscous fluids need to break to a thin fluid after the treatment is over so that the fracture fluid can be cleaned up. In shallower, lower temperature (less than 250 oF) reservoirs, the choice of a fracture fluid is very {{critical to the success of}} the treatment. Current hydraulic fracturing methods in unconventional tight gas reservoirs have been developed largely through ad-hoc application of low-cost water fracs, with little optimization of the process. It seems clear that some of the standard tests and models are missing some of the physics of the fracturing process in low-permeability environments. A series of the extensive laboratory ?dynamic fracture conductivity? tests have been conducted. Dynamic fracture conductivity is created when proppant slurry is pumped into a hydraulic fracture in low permeability rock. Unlike conventional fracture conductivity tests in which proppant is loaded into the fracture artificially, we pump proppant/ fracturing fluid slurries into a fracture cell, dynamically placing the proppant just as it occurs in the field. Test results indicate that increasing gel concentration decreases retained fracture conductivity for a constant gas flow rate and decreasing gas flow rate decreases retained fracture conductivity. Without breaker, the damaging effect of viscous hydraulic fracturing fluids on the conductivity of <b>proppant</b> <b>packs</b> is significant at temperature of 150 oF.

40|$|The flow of non-Newtonian fluids in porous {{media is}} {{important}} in many applications, such as polymer processing, heavy oil flow, and gel cleanup in propped fractures. Residual polymer gel in propped fractures results in low fracture conductivity and short effective fracture length, sometimes causing severe productivity impairment of a hydraulically fractured well. Some residual gels are concentrated in the filter cakes built on the fracture walls and have much higher polymer concentration than the original gel. The residual gel exhibits a higher yield stress, and is difficult to remove after fracture closure. But non-Newtonian fluid has complicated rheological equation and its flow behavior in porous media is difficult to be described and modeled. The Kozeny-Carman equation, a traditional permeability-porosity relationship, has been popularly used in porous media flow models. However, this relationship is not suitable for non-Newtonian fluid flow in porous media. At first, I studied polymer gel behavior in hydraulic fracturing theoretically and experimentally. I developed a model to describe the flow behavior of residual polymer gel being displaced by gas in parallel plates. I developed analytical models for gas-liquid two-phase stratified flow of Newtonian gas and non-Newtonian residual gel to investigate gel cleanup under different conditions. The concentrated gel in the filter cake was modeled as a Herschel-Buckley fluid, a shear-thinning fluid following a power law relationship, but also having a yield stress. Secondly, I used a combination of analytical calculations and 3 D finite volume simulation to investigate the flow behavior of Herschel-Bulkley non-Newtonian fluid flow through propped fractures. I developed the comprehensive mathematical model, and then modified the model based on numerical simulation results. In the simulations, I developed a micro pore-scale model to mimic the real porous structure of flow channel in propped fractures.

40|$|Multi-stage {{hydraulic}} fracturing {{is the key}} to the success of many shale gas and shale oil reservoirs. The main objectives of {{hydraulic fracturing}} in shale are to create artificial fracture networks that are conductive for oil and gas flow and extensive into the reservoir for high and long-lasting production, while economical to keep the well commercial. Due to the variation in shale mineralogical and mechanical properties, mechanisms of fracture conductivity creation in shale formations are complicated. Standard fracture conductivity measurement procedures were developed for high concentration propped fractures and need to be modified to measure the conductivity of unpropped fractures and the low concentration <b>proppant</b> <b>packs.</b> Water-based fracturing fluids can interact with the clay minerals in shale and eventually impact shale fracture conductivity. All these challenges require more studies to elevate the understanding of shale fracture conductivity creation and impairment. The aims of this work are to design an experimental framework to measure fracture conductivity created by different mechanisms, to develop a correlation calibrated by the experimental data to predict shale fracture conductivity, and to investigate the mechanisms of conductivity damage by water. We first present the laboratory procedures and experimental design that can accurately measure fracture conductivity of shale fractures. Then, a program is developed to calculate conductivity considering the physical processes that dictate propped fracture conductivity as observed in the experiments. After the undamaged shale fracture conductivity is measured by dry nitrogen, water with similar flowback water compositions is flowed to simulate the damage process followed by the second gas flow to measure the recovered fracture conductivity after the water damage. From this study, we find that the unpropped shale fractures are conductive up to certain closure stress by a variety of mechanisms. The correlation we develop can capture the physical processes in the shale fracture and can reasonably predict propped fracture conductivity. Shale fracture surface softening is identified as the dominant cause for the significant conductivity reduction after water flow. The systematic study on realistic shale fracture conductivity is the foundation of well performance analysis and production history matching.

40|$|Abstract. Polymer-free VES fluids {{are used}} to {{minimize}} damage to the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> to efficiently transport proppants into fractures. Proper investigation of the rheological properties and the proppant settling of the fluids {{play an important role}} in fracturing enginering. In this paper,the rheology and viscosity-temperature properties of the VES fracturing fluid were researched at the range of 1 wt % to 6 wt % of VES concentration using the HAAKE RS 300 Stress-Controlled Rheometer. Proppant settling experiments are performed in static VES fluid. The results show that VES system behaves as a non-Newtonian shear-thinning fluid and the power law model can be used to describe fluid rheology within a certain range of shear rate and temperature. However, with the increase of shear rate and temperature, the fluid trends to Newtonian fluid. Apparant viscocity of the fluid first increases slightly with the temperature rising from 28 ˚C, then, It would drastically reduce after reaching a peak. The temperature correspongding to the peak value increases with the concentration of VES,as well as the shear rates.

The field example illustrates a case when the apparent choice to use transverse fractures from horizontal wells proved to be suboptimal from the productivity perspective, but fundamental considering economics. Parametric studies for permeability ranging from 0. 01 to 5 md illustrate the importance of economics in addition to physical performance.

The residual opening of the partially propped fracture is determined {{as a function of}} the initial fracture geometry, the propped length of the fracture, the compressive rock stresses, the elastic properties of the rock, and the compressibility of the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack.</b> A mathematical model for fluid flow towards the fracture is developed, which incorporates the effects of the residual opening profile of the fracture and the high conductivity of the unpropped fracture length. The residual opening profile of the fracture is calculated for a particular case where the propp ant pack is nearly rigid and there is no closure ofthe fracture faces due to the confining (compressive) stresses. A sensitivity study is performed to demonstrate the dependence of the well productivity index on the propped length of the fracture, the propp ant pack permeability, and the dimensionless fracture conductivity. The sensitivity study suggests that the residual opening of a fracture has a significant impact on production, and that partially propped fractures can be more productive than fully propped fractures.

30|$|After this {{sensitivity}} analysis {{we found that}} massive hydraulic fracturing treatment is required for Fig  16 {{in order to achieve}} long half-length and high fracture conductivity. This massive frac will increase the history production rate by 4 – 5 times. The fracture half-length that could be achieved using the proposed design length ranging between, 600 and 800 ft. The fracture conductivity achieved by using the proposed model, ranging between 10, 000 and 20, 000 ft (md) depends on the proppant type used. Coarse proppant type is preferred (12 – 18); medium strength will give high conductivity. The amount of proppant required to achieve this design is ~ 360, 000 Lb. In most of the cases the frac height will propagate downward toward the carbonate layer. In order to avoid propagating the frac toward the carbonate layer, very small frac design should be used (~ 40, 000 Lb of proppant). This small frac size will not increase the productivity from well as required and the production rate is expected to drop rapidly after the fracture. <b>Proppant</b> flow <b>pack</b> additive should be used to avoid proppant flow back after the treatment and avoid damaging the sucker rod pump.|$|R

The current American Petroleum Institute (API) procedure for conductivity testing produces results that are difficult to replicate. In one case three commercial labs tested the same sample of proppant, the results varied between labs and the highest spread in data had an 80 % variation (Anderson, 2013). The goal of this thesis is to investigate cell loading procedures that reduce the variation in laboratory results. A variety of cell loading techniques were tested including Hoke cylinder injection, guar injection, and cell vibration. Hoke cylinder loading was determined not to be a feasible technique with the current lab equipment at Montana Tech’s Research Lab. The guar injection produced a smaller spread in the data when compared to the API loading technique. However, when the results from the guar injection were analyzed it was apparent the guar had not been completely removed from the cell after injection. The remaining guar reduced the overall permeability of the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack,</b> which lead to an unfair comparison with the API Standard procedure. The cell vibration technique produced conductivity values that were very similar to the results produced by the API procedure but with a considerable reduction in the overall variance.

Hydraulic fracturing or frac-packing high permeability reservoirs {{is different from the}} conventional hydraulic fracturing technology used in low permeability formations. While the main purpose of the conventional technique is to create a long, highly conductive path, frac-packing on the other hand is used predominantly to get past near wellbore formation damage, control sand production and reduce near wellbore pressure drop. Ultra-deepwater reservoirs are usually high temperature and high pressure with high permeabilities. Frac-packing these types of wells requires short fractures packed with high proppant concentrations. Understanding the behavior of the fracture fluid and proppant is critical to pump such a job successfully and to ensure long term productivity from the fracture. A series of laboratory experiments have been conducted to research the different problems resulting from high temperature and pressure which negatively affect conductivity. Unlike conventional long-term conductivity measurements, we placed the proppant into the fracture and pumped fracture fluid through it and then measured conductivity by pumping oil to represent true reservoir conditions. Proppant performance and fracture fluids clean-up during production were examined. High strength proppant is ideal for deep fracture stimulations and in this study different proppant loadings at different stresses were tested to measure the impact of crushing and embedment on conductivity. The preliminary test results indicated that oil at reservoir conditions does improve clean-up of fracture fluid left back in the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack.</b> Increasing the proppant concentration in the fracture showed higher conductivity values even at high closure stress.

Chemical breakers reduce viscosity of the guar polymer by cleaving the polymer into small-molecular-weight fragments. The reduction of viscosity will facilitate the flow-back of residual polymer providing rapid recovery of polymer from <b>proppant</b> <b>pack.</b> Ineffective breakers or misapplication of breakers can result in screen-outs or flow-back of viscous fluids both of which can significantly decrease the well productivity. Breaker activity of low to medium temperature range oxidative and enzyme breaker systems was evaluated. ViCon NF an oxidative breaker (Halliburton product) and GBW 12 - CD an enzyme breaker (BJ Services product) were used in this research project with the main objective to study on the degradation pattern of fracturing fluid (guar polymer gel) as a function of (time, temperature and breaker concentration itself). This study provides focuses on the way to mix the fracturing fluid, compositions of the fracturing fluid and how to conduct the crosslink and break test. Crosslink test indicate the optimum cross-linker concentration to produce good crosslink gel and the break test gave the characteristic of the gel during degradation process and also the break time. Besides relying on the laboratory experiment, information obtained from research on SPE and US Pattern papers were used to make a comparison study on oxidative and enzyme breakers properties. Degradation pattern observed from the break test showed that reduction in gel viscosity depends on time, temperature and breaker concentration. Observations from experiment also revealed that small concentration of enzyme breakers provides rapid break compared to oxidative breakers...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{a popular}} stimulation method in tight gas and shale gas reservoirs that uses a viscous fluid to fracture the reservoir rock and uniformly transport proppant to create a highly conductive path that is kept open by the proppant after fracturing. This method is used to improve the productivity of the otherwise low permeability reservoirs. Hydraulic fracturing, though in general beneficial, is a complex process that {{has a number of}} challenges in fracturing design and execution. This research focuses on studying the damage caused by the fracturing fluid (gel) to the fracture and the conditions to remove the damage. Guar gum and its derivatives have been the most commonly used polymers to increase the viscosity of fracturing fluids. The fracturing fluid gets dehydrated under pressure leaving behind a highly concentrated unbroken residue called filter cake which causes permeability impairment in the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack,</b> resulting in low fracture conductivity and decreased effective fracture length. This study seeks to characterize filter cakes. By measuring its thickness and with the leak off volume, the concentration and yield stress of the filter cake can be estimated. The thickness of the filter cake was measured with a precise laser profilometer. Correlations are proposed to estimate filter cake properties (thickness, concentration and yield stress) based on pumping conditions (pump rate, time and net pressure) and rock properties. With these properties known, a required flow back rate of the reservoir fluid can be estimated to clean up the filter cake modeled as a non-newtonian fluid exhibiting a yield stress. Typical field conditions were referenced and scaled down in the lab to closely represent the field conditions. Recommendations are provided on gel damage based on the observation of the study...|$|E
40|$|Productivity index (PI) is an {{important}} indicator of a well?s production capacity. For conventional reservoirs, well productivity is usually calculated using the pressure response of the reservoir in its pseudosteady-state period. There are numerous studies for different well completion schemes which developed correlations for pseudosteady-state productivity index for specific cases, such as horizontal wells and fractured wells. Most of the developed models for complex well completion schemes use some approximations for productivity index calculation and they have some limitations in use. Furthermore, as the petroleum industry goes toward producing lower quality reservoirs like low- and ultra low-permeability reservoirs, the period of transient flow covers a larger part of the well lifetime and these pseudosteady-state productivity calculations become less applicable in prediction of the reservoir?s production behavior. The Distributed Volumetric Sources (DVS) method seems able to fill this gap. Our method is able to predict the productivity index of a general well completion scheme for transient as well as pseudosteady-state flow periods. In this study, we focus on a typical well completion scheme ? vertical well intersected by a vertical fracture of finite conductivity. Parametric study is performed by varying the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> permeability with a linear distribution, varying fracture width with an elliptical distribution and varying fracture height with an elliptical distribution. The details of hydraulic fracture are integrated into the calculation of well productivity. By combining the well productivity with gas material balance, production forecasting of the hydraulically fractured wells could be easily obtained. The result of production forecasting {{could be used to}} aid in decision making of choosing the best stimulation treatment. Field examples are presented to illustrate the application of this technology for production modeling the complicated reservoir cases involving fracture stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Unconventional {{reservoirs}} {{have become}} increasingly possible and economical due to the advances of hydraulic fracturing, a stimulation technique that creates highly conductive fractures that serve as pathways for hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the wellbore. This technique?s success {{is determined by the}} rock?s capability to fracture and the ability to sustain fracture conductivity. Several parameters, including formation properties, proppant type, and proppant concentration, affect the efficiency of fracture conductivity and should be taken into account for an optimal treatment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between unpropped and propped fracture conductivity and the rock properties of outcrop samples from each of the facies of the Eagle Ford formation. Multiple samples were collected from each zone and mechanical properties were tested in both the z-direction and x-direction of the bedding planes. Compressive triaxial tests were performed on core samples of the outcrops in order to determine the elastic rock properties of Young?s Modulus and Poisson?s Ratio. Additionally, Brinell hardness tests were completed to determine the resistance of plastic deformation of the outcrop samples. Lastly, mineral composition was obtained by X-Ray Diffraction analysis. The results of this study were compared to fracture conductivity data performed on the Eagle Ford formation. Within facies B 1, the oil producing zone, the effect of anisotropy was present and revealed that the parallel (x-direction) samples had higher conductivity and higher Young?s Modulus than samples perpendicular (z-direction) to the bedding planes. Throughout all the facies, unpropped conductivity was predominantly influenced by the surface roughness. The propped fractures are more affected by proppant characteristics for fracture conductivity. At monolayer proppant concentration, proppant embedment is the main cause of conductivity loss due to permanent deformation. Fracture conductivity is influenced by several rock mechanical properties. Slower decline rates for propped conductivity were associated with higher surface roughness. Furthermore, the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> characteristics dominate over the rock?s mechanical properties when multilayer proppant concentration is applied...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is a stimulation {{technique that}} has made production from unconventional reservoirs such as shale formations economically feasible. This technique creates high conductivity paths that improve the communication between the reservoir and the wellbore. The success of this technique depends {{on the ability to}} fracture the rock and to maintain fracture conductivity. Therefore, {{in order to have a}} successful treatment, the effect of parameters such as formation properties, type of proppant and proppant concentration on fracture conductivity and fracture creation should be considered. This work investigates the relationship between fracture conductivity and formation properties for two different locations in the Marcellus shale. Multiple cores from the locations were collected to ensure repeatability in the results. The core samples were fractured parallel and perpendicular to the bedding planes in order to analyze the effect of anisotropy in fracture conductivity. Additionally, compressive triaxial tests were performed to obtain the rock mechanical properties in the elastic region until permanent deformation was reached, and X-ray Diffraction analysis was used to obtain mineralogy composition. The laboratory results were compared with previous fracture conductivity data and surface roughness data from the same Marcellus shale locations. The findings showed that the anisotropy effect is present for this formation and reflected in the fracture conductivity values, where samples parallel to the bedding plane seem to have higher Young?s Modulus. At proppant monolayer concentration the main mechanism for conductivity loss is proppant embedment, where due to the high localized stress, the rock-proppant interaction goes directly to permanent deformation of the rock. It was also observed that a higher Young?s Modulus helps to maintain the fracture width which translates in lower rate of conductivity loss with increasing closure stress. Rock mechanical properties have impact on fracture conductivity. This effect is less pronounced if a multilayer proppant concentration is used, where the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> characteristics become an important parameter in fracture conductivity...|$|E
40|$|Conference theme, "The New Energy Age: Building on Success"The {{success of}} {{hydraulic}} fracturing stimulation is highly reliant on the flow area and permeability of the induced fractures. The flow area can be significantly affected by proppant distribution while fracture permeability is mainly governed by proppant sizes. To create a fracture {{with a large}} flow area, small proppants are essential to maintain a minimum proppant settling velocity; on the other hand, large proppant sizes provide higher <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> permeability (i. e., fracture permeability). Therefore, {{it is critical to}} study the effect of proppant on the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing stimulation. In this paper, a 3 -D numerical simulator is developed to simulate proppant distribution profile, calculate fracture geometry based on the proppant distribution and forecast productivity through each fracture. More specifically, finite difference method is applied to calculate proppant distribution profile during the hydraulic fracturing and flow back processes for different settings such as proppant size and relative density. Both single-proppant and multi-proppant size combination are investigated and their after-stimulation productivities are compared. Proppant slippage velocity is considered over a wide range of fracturing fluid viscosity and density. Fracture geometry is firstly determined through the hydraulic fracturing operating parameters and then recalculated based on simulated proppant concentration profile. The adjusted fracture geometry is then used to simulate fluid flow from reservoir matrix to the fracture with non-uniform proppant distribution and non-Darcy flow of compressible fluid. Results show that, among all parameters, reservoir permeability mostly affects proppant size selection and pumping scheduling in order to achieve an optimum fracturing performance. Multi-proppant size combination simulation results indicate that properly designed multi-proppant combination treatment can increase after-stimulation productivity and improve fracture performance. There exists an optimum combination of proppants size and their volume portion exists for a specific reservoir. The approach presented here can help further understand proppant transport and settling, fracture geometry variation and fracture production performance. Bing Kong, Shengnan Chen, Kai Zhang, M. E.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis addresses the problem of removal of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials, NORM, and describes an effective alternative to the current treatment method for their removal. High-pen-meability fracturing, recently established in the petroleum industry, is the recommended technique. NORM are found throughout subterranean formations. Whenever fluids from petroleum or water reservoirs are produced NORM are present in varying quantities. NORM can only be sensed with radiation detectors. However, they have proven carcinogens, and the US Environmental Protection Agency has set a limit on the maximum contaminated level of any stream. Until now, the preferred method of treatment was to remove NORM from contaminated waters with specially designed filters, which in turn create a new problem. The same filters that are used to treat the water themselves become highly radioactive with a considerable disposal problem. In the petroleum industry, NORM become concentrated in the scale that is deposited inside the well or surface pipes. When scale is removed, it can be so radioactive that it can only be stored in toxic sites. Additionally, as water is produced along with oil, so are NORM. Until now, for the Gulf of Mexico at least, produced water has been released into the ocean, but the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is threatening to change this. In the North Sea the regulations are already stricter. There is then a compelling motivation to remove NORM before they are produced, and thus, eliminate the disposal problem. A high-permeability fracture design is presented which modifies existing petroleum practices by introducing within the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> highly selective radionuclide sorbents. These sorbents, at calculated concentrations, can remove NORM readily for several years from typical flow rates containing typical NORM concentrations...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{carried out}} the analysis of fracture conductivity in a tight reservoir using laboratory experiments, by applying the procedure known as the dynamic fracture conductivity test. Considering {{the large number of}} experiments necessary to evaluate the effect of each parameter and the possible interaction of their combinations, the schedules of experiments were planned using a fractional factorial design. This design is used during the initial stage of studies to identify and discharge those factors that have little or no effect. Finally, the most important factors can then be studied in more detail during subsequent experiments. The objectives of this investigation were focused on identifying the effect of formation parameters such as closure stress, and temperature and fracture fluid parameters such as proppant loading over the final conductivity of a hydraulic fracture treatment. With the purpose of estimating the relation between fracture conductivity and the design parameters, two series of experiments were performed. The first set of experiments estimated the effects of the aliases parameters. The isolated effect of each independent parameter was obtained after the culmination of the second set of experiments. The preliminary test results indicated that the parameters with major negative effect over the final conductivity were closure stress and temperature. Some additional results show that proppant distribution had a considerable role over the final fracture conductivity when a low proppant concentration was used. Channels and void spaces in the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> were detected on these cases improving the conductivity of the fracture, by creating paths of high permeability. It was observed that with experiments at temperatures around 250 degrees F, the unbroken gel dried up creating permeable scales that resulted in a significant loss in conductivity. The results of this investigation demonstrated that dynamic fracture conductivity test procedure is an excellent tool to more accurately represent the effects of design parameters over the fracture conductivity. These results are also {{the first step in the}} development of a statistical model that can be used to predict dynamic fracture conductivity...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-deepwater {{reservoirs}} {{are important}} unconventional reservoirs {{that hold the}} potential to produce billions of barrels of hydrocarbons, but also present major challenges. This type of reservoir is usually high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and has a relatively high permeability. Hydraulic fracturing high permeability reservoirs {{are different from the}} hydraulic fracturing technology used in low permeability formations. The main purpose of hydraulic fracturing in low permeability reservoirs is to create a long, highly conductive path, whereas in high permeability formations hydraulic fracturing is used predominantly to bypass near wellbore formation damage, control sand production and reduce near wellbore pressure drop. Hydraulically fracturing these types of wells requires short fractures packed with high proppant concentrations. In addition, fracturing in high permeability reservoirs aims at achieving enough fracture length to increase productivity, especially when the viscosity of the reservoir fluid is high. In order to pump such a job and ensure long term productivity from the fracture, understanding the behavior of the fracture fluid and proppant is critical. A series of laboratory experiments have been conducted to study conductivity and fracture width with high proppant loading, high temperature and high pressure. Proppant was manually placed in the fracture and fracture fluid was pumped through the pack. Conductivity was measured by pumping oil to simulate reservoir conditions. Proppant performance and fracture fluids, which carry the proppant into the fracture, and their subsequent clean-up during production, were studied. High strength proppant is ideal for deep fracture stimulations and in this study different proppant loadings at different stresses were tested to see the impact of crushing and fracture width reduction on fracture conductivity. The preliminary test results indicated that oil at reservoir conditions improves clean-up of fracture fluid left in the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> compared with using water at ambient temperature. Increasing the proppant concentration in the fracture showed higher conductivity values in some cases even at high closure stress. The increase in effective closure stress with high temperature resulted in a significant loss in conductivity. Additionally, the fracture width decreased with time and increased effective closure stress. Tests were also run to study the effect of cyclic loading which is expected to further decrease conductivity...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase and non-Darcy flow {{effects in}} {{hydraulically}} fractured gas wells reduce effective fracture conductivity. Typical <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> laboratory experiments are oriented {{in such a}} way such that phase segregation is not possible, which results in mixed flow. Tidwell and Parker (1996), however, showed that in proppant packs, gravity segregation occurs for simultaneous gas and liquid injection at laboratory scale (1500 cm 2). Although the impact of gravity on flow in natural fractures has been described, previous work has not fully described the effect of gravity on multiphase non-Darcy flow in hydraulic fractures. In this work, reservoir simulation modeling was used to determine the extent and impact of gravity segregation in a hydraulic fracture at field scale. I found that by ignoring segregation, effective fracture conductivity can be underestimated by up to a factor of two. An analytical solution was developed for uniform flux of water and gas into the fracture. The solution for pressures and saturations in the fracture agrees well with reservoir simulation. Gravity segregation occurs in moderate-to-high conductivity fractures. Gravity segregation impacts effective fracture conductivity when gas and liquid are being produced at all water-gas ratios modeled above 2 Bbls per MMscf. More realistic, non-uniform-flux models were also run with the hydraulic fracture connected to a gas reservoir producing water. For constant-gas-rate production, differences in pressure drop between segregated cases and mixed flow cases range up to a factor of two. As the pressure gradient in the fracture increases above 1 to 2 psi/ft, the amount of segregation decreases. Segregation is also less for fracture half-length-to-height ratios less than or close to two. When there is less segregation, the difference in effective conductivity between the segregated and mixed flow cases is reduced. I also modeled the water injection and cleanup phases for a typical slickwater fracture treatment both with and without gravity effects and found that for cases with segregation, effective fracture conductivity is significantly higher than the conductivity when mixed flow occurs. Gravity segregation is commonly ignored in design and analysis of hydraulically fractured gas wells. This work shows that segregation is an important physical process and it affects effective fracture conductivity significantly. Hydraulic fracture treatments can be designed more effectively if effective fracture conductivity is known more accurately...|$|E
40|$|Low-permeability gas wells often produce {{less than}} {{predicted}} after a fracture treatment. One {{of the reasons}} for this is that fracture lengths calculated after stimulation are often less than designed lengths. While actual fracture lengths may be shorter due to fracture growth out of zone, improper proppant settling, or proppant flowback, short calculated fracture lengths can also result from incorrect analysis techniques. It is known that fracturing fluid that remains in the fracture and formation after a hydraulic fracture treatment can decrease the productivity of a gas well by reducing the relative permeability to gas in the region invaded by this fluid. However, the relationships between fracture fluid cleanup, effective fracture length, and well productivity are not fully understood. In this work I used reservoir simulation to determine the relationship between fracture conductivity, fracture fluid production, effective fracture length, and well productivity. I simulated water saturation and pressure profiles around a propped fracture, tracked gas production {{along the length of the}} propped fracture, and quantified the effective fracture length (i. e., the fracture length under single-phase flow conditions that gives similar performance as for multiphase flow conditions), the "cleanup" fracture length (i. e., the fracture length corresponding to 90 % cumulative gas flow rate into the fracture), and the "apparent" fracture length (i. e., the fracture length where the ratio of multiphase to single-phase gas entry rate profiles is unity). This study shows that the <b>proppant</b> <b>pack</b> is generally cleaned up and the cleanup lengths are close to designed lengths in relatively short times. Although gas is entering along entire fracture, fracturing fluid remains in the formation near the fracture. The water saturation distribution affects the gas entry rate profile, which determines the effective fracture length. Subtle changes in the gas rate entry profile can result in significant changes in effective fracture length. The results I derived from this work are consistent with prior work, namely that greater fracture conductivity results in more effective well cleanup and longer effective fracture lengths versus time. This study provides better explanation of mechanisms that affect fracturing fluid cleanup, effective fracture length, and well productivity than previous work...|$|E
40|$|Proppants {{are solid}} particles, {{extensively}} used in hydraulic fracturing operations. These materials possess specific mechanical strength indispensable in keeping induced fractures open, resulting in up-surged well production. Proppants have different parameters including density, mechanical strength, internal porosity, shape, sieve distribution, {{and most importantly}} acid resistance. The acid resistance of the fracturing proppants, defined as the stability and suitability of proppants when they {{come into contact with}} different acids, is an important property. Numerous acids are used during the hydraulic fracturing process to remove the scale and clays affecting the fracture conductivity. Inopportunely, these acids adversely affect the proppants already existing in the fracture. The industry measures the acid solubility of proppants according to the API RP 19 C/ISO 13503 - 2 standard. However, it fails to give any guidance on the anticipated final effect of acid dissolution on the mechanical performance of the tested proppants. This study investigates different factors affecting the interactions of different acid systems with sand and ceramic proppants under downhole conditions. Solubility experiments were conducted using translucent and aging cells at temperatures up to 350 ?F. The effects of varying acid system, temperature, soaking time, static, and dynamic conditions were examined. The supernatant of solubility tests was analyzed with Fluorine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (19 F-NMR) to identify the reaction products. Total key cations? concentrations were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Proppants were then analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to detect their mineral composition. After performing solubility tests, the residual solids were then dried and analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities. Moreover, the effects of acid dissolution on the mechanical performance of proppants were also tested using an automated load frame. Experimental results show that monocrystalline sand proppants are soluble in regular mud acid (12. 0 wt% HCl, 3. 0 wt% HF), with a maximum recorded solubility of 10. 0 wt%. Clay-based ceramic proppants are also soluble in mud acid, with much higher acid solubility compared to sand proppants. <b>Proppant</b> <b>pack</b> shows more compaction for clay-based proppants than that of sand proppants prior to and after acid exposure. Bauxitic ceramic proppants have a minimal solubility of 0. 5 wt% in 10. 0 wt% HCl. The proppant, however, is readily soluble in different mud acid solutions, reaching up to 56. 0 wt% dissolution in some extreme cases. The higher solubility of ceramic proppants is attributed to HF attack at the grain boundaries. Understanding the effects of various acids on natural and synthetic proppants will improve production capabilities by promoting the design of acidizing regimens recommended during hydraulic fracturing operations...|$|E
