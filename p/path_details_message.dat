The pattern language contains four levels {{which are used}} to specify communication protocol and its messages. These four levels of this pattern language are: high-level protocol specification, protocol structure specification, <b>message</b> specification, and <b>detailed</b> <b>message</b> specification. Several existing patterns, e. g. the Layers, are used together with new ones to specify protocol structure. Patterns for communication protocol messages are {{most important part of}} this pattern language, and also most important part of any communication protocol specification. ...|$|R

50|$|A primary {{driver in}} {{selecting}} a communication medium {{for a particular}} message {{is to reduce the}} equivocality, or possible misinterpretations, of a message. If a message is equivocal, it is unclear and thus more difficult for the receiver to decode. The more equivocal a message, the more cues and data needed to interpret it correctly. For example, a simple message intended to arrange a meeting time and place could be communicated in a short email, but a more <b>detailed</b> <b>message</b> about a person's work performance and expectations would be better communicated through face-to-face interaction.|$|R
50|$|Voice mail's {{introduction}} enabled {{people to}} leave lengthy, secure and <b>detailed</b> <b>messages</b> in natural voice, working hand-in-hand with corporate phone systems.

GE, one of the pioneer adopters of voice-mail {{in all of its}} offices around the world, claimed that voice-mail saved, on average, over US$1,100 per year per employee. Needless to say, the ability to tell someone something without talking to them, can be a powerful reason to choose Voice-mail for delivery of a particular message.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} clock {{distribution}} networks in synchronous systems presents enormous challenges. Control {{of the clock}} signal delay {{in the presence of}} various noise sources, process parameter variations, and environmental effects represents one of the fundamental problems in the design of high speed synchronous circuits.
