An efficient and thorough method for wear debris analysis should be derived from this research to assist brake manufacturers and researchers in understanding the characteristics of wear particulates being released from current brake materials. In addition, a test method allowing inspection of brake formulations in development phase should be provided and several model 2 ̆ 2 environmentally friendly 2 ̆ 2 brake lining materials should be developed. The most hazardous constituents in a known brake lining formula should be replaced with non-hazardous materials that will obtain performance specifications comparable to the original formula. The brake manufacturing industry and general public should be notified of important findings from this research. Model brake linings fabricated on-site with known constituents were run through an AO 4 D performance dynamometer test to collect airborne and non-airborne wear debris that is comparable to wear debris produced by an average passenger vehicle. Based on previous experience with analysis of brake linings, this wear debris will be analyzed with scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy with EDX (TEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarized light microscopy (PLM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and laser scattering <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution <b>analyzer</b> (LSPSDA).
