A corresponding production method provides that, for generating granular particles based on expanded clay, natural clay minerals are optionally premixed and extruded, after which the extrudate is granulated and fired at elevated temperature in order to evaporate the enclosed water and foam the granular material.

40|$|ABSTRACT The synthesis, {{characterization}} {{and development}} {{of a new generation of}} fluoro-containing polyamideimide (PAI) polymers are described in this paper. The polymers are generally prepared by forming the <b>polycondensation</b> <b>product</b> of an aromatic diamine, a trifunctional aromatic anhydride acid chloride and an aromatic dianhydride containing trifluoromethyl moieties. These new materials possess high glass transition temperatures, useful mechanical properties and outstanding thermoplastic flow behavior which render them readily melt processable into fibers, films, sheets and other molded articles. The as-precipitated fluoro-containing PAI materials are soluble in many organic solvents and are thus amenable to solution casting techniques. They also show excellent resistance towards thermooxidative degradation at temperatures to 450 &deg;F and have low moisture uptake. In addition, compatible blends with polybenzimidazole (PBI) resin have yield synergistic effects on the mechanical properties of the resulting polymer. 1...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{copolymers}} {{consisting of}} poly(2 -hydroxyethyl aspartamide-co-N,N'-dimethyl- 1, 3 -propane aspartamide) (PHEA-DPA) were prepared from polysuccinimide (PSI), {{which is the}} thermal <b>polycondensation</b> <b>product</b> of aspartic acid, via a ring-opening reaction with N,N'-dimethyl- 1, 3 -propane diamine (DPA) and ethanolamine. The prepared water-soluble copolymer was then crosslinked by reacting it with hexamethylene diisocyanate to provide the corresponding gel. The swelling behavior and morphology of the crosslinked hydrogels were investigated. The degree of swelling decreased with increasing crosslinking reagent due to the higher crosslinking density. It was also confirmed that the swelling property is affected by pH. At low pH (< pH 4), swelling is increased due to the ionization of DPA with a tertiary amine moiety. In addition, a reversible swelling and de-swelling behavior was demonstrated by adjusting the pH of the solution. The prepared hydrogels showed a well-interconnected microporous structure with regular 5 - 20 μm sized pores...|$|E

The generation of pores is initiated by the formation of reverse micelles in a polymeric <b>polycondensation</b> <b>product,</b> which expand during heating, leading to larger pores. A reaction scheme involving a complex formation and nonhydrolytic polycondensation reaction with ester elimination leads to the formation of ail extended Ti-O-Ti network.

It is demonstrated that high-mol. -mass PA 66 (Mw ~ 20000 - 30000) can be sepd. using this approach.

40|$|The cyclohexane−igepal inverse microemulsion, {{comprehensively}} {{established for}} the synthesis of silica nanoparticles in an ammonia-catalyzed sol−gel process, was alternatively studied with an acid-catalyzed sol−gel process. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) {{was used as the}} silica precursor, while two different aqueous phases containing either HNO 3 or HCl at two different concentrations, 0. 1 and 0. 05 M, were examined in the presence {{and in the absence of}} NaF, a catalyst of the condensation step. The evolution of the overall reacting system, specifically hydrolysis and polycondensation of reaction intermediates, was monitored in situ by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering. No size variation of the inverse micelles was detected throughout the sol−gel process. Conversely, the density of the micellar core increased after a certain time interval, indicating the presence of the <b>polycondensation</b> <b>product.</b> The IR spectra of the reacting mixture were in agreement with such a hypothesis. 1 H and 13 C NMR measurements provided information on the soluble species, the surfactant, and TEOS. The TEOS consumption was well fitted by means of an exponential decay, suggesting that a first-order kinetics for TEOS transpires in the various systems examined, with rate constants dependent not only on the acid concentration but also on its nature (anion specific effect), on the presence of NaF, and on the amount of water in the core of the inverse micelle. The self-diffusion coefficients, determined by means of PGSTE NMR, proved that a sizable amount of the byproduct ethanol was partitioned inside the inverse micelles. Characterization of the final product was carried out by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which concurrently confirmed that the silica isolated from the inverse nonionic microemulsion is not significantly different from the product of a bulk acid-catalyzed sol−gel synthesis. TEM micrographs illustrated particles with diameters smaller than the diameter of the inverse micelles as determined by SAXS, due to a shrinkage effect, in addition to nanostructured aggregates in the range 20 − 100 nm...|$|E

40|$|The Maillard reaction, or nonenzymatic browning, {{includes}} a complex network of reactions {{initiated by the}} condensation reaction of a carbohydrate and an amino compound, and is of utmost importance {{for the formation of}} flavour and colour in thermally treated foods. Besides volatile flavour compounds, also brown-coloured <b>polycondensation</b> <b>products,</b> named melanoidins, are produced. In latest years, the interaction of lipid oxidation products in the classical Maillard reaction pathway and vice versa is of particular interest, since {{it has been shown that}} the course of both reactions can be modified by the reactants, intermediates and products of the other (ZAMORA & HIDALGO 2005). Therefore, in parallel with the formation of model melanoidins, <b>polycondensation</b> <b>products</b> resulting from the interaction of amino acids with lipid oxidation products were studied. For this purpose, various coloured water-soluble high molecular weight and water-nonsoluble reaction products were isolated from the model reactions of glycine or lysine with a lipid oxidation product (hexanal, (2 E) -hexenal, (2 E, 4 E) -decadienal) in the presence or absence of glucose. They were characterised by UV-visible absorbance measurements, elementary analysis, and thermal degradation followed by SPME-GC-MS analysis (ADAMS et al. 2003). The UV-visible absorbance spectra before and after dialysis indicated that the most important contributors to the formation of water-soluble coloured material were constituents of the low molecular fraction. Elementary analysis data showed that a higher amount of nitrogen was incorporated in the high molecular weight fractions as compared to the water-nonsoluble fractions, except for the water-nonsoluble reaction products from amino acid/(2 E, 4 E) -decadienal interactions, which demonstrated the lowest C/N ratio found. Volatile carbonyl compounds, furans, aliphatic compounds, pyridines, pyrroles and benzene derivatives were the main groups of compounds identified in the thermal degradation profile of each fraction tested. Aldol condensation reactions of the carbonyl compounds were very important in the initial reaction steps.

To this end, a Monte Carlo approach has been developed in order to build different molecular architectures from the initial reactant monomers at the appropriate conversion level. This approach allows us to analyze the composition of these melts in terms of topological architecture and molecular weight of the various polymer species present. Subsequently, the linear rheology of each sample is predicted within the tube model framework [van Ruymbeke et al., Macromol. 2006], based on the position/seniority of the different branches in these polymer species, by averaging over a limited number of representative segments.
