40|$|Using unique data on {{condominium}} {{transactions that}} allow for accurately-measured capital gains and losses, we {{examine the impact of}} these gains and losses on homeowner decisions. As predicted by the disposition effect, owners with a gain have higher sell propensities than those with a loss. Since real estate prices result from owner negotiations with buyers and tenants, we also examine whether prices vary across otherwise comparable units depending on the owner’s capital gain. We report that owners with a gain accept lower selling <b>prices,</b> <b>list</b> for sale at lower prices, and accept lower rents from tenants. These pricing implications are sensitive to the magnitude of the owner’s gain, which is consistent with realization utility, and are economically large. For example, selling prices are 5 % lower on average. Overall, our findings indicate that the disposition effect and realization utility, both of which originate from prospect theory, influence homeowner decisions. Alternative explanations such as financing constraints, informed trading, and mean reversion cannot explain our result...|$|E
40|$|In many markets firms set {{posted prices}} which are {{potentially}} negotiable. � We analyze the optimal marketing mix of pricing and bargaining when price takers buy at posted prices but bargainers attempt to negotiate discounts. � The optimal bargaining strategy involves the firms offering bargainers randomly-sized discounts. � Competing firms keep posted prices high {{to weaken the}} bargainers' outside option, thus forgoing the chance to increase profits from price takers by undercutting their rival. � A range of posted price equilibria are possible, and the higher price in the range inrceases when the proportion of bargainers goes up or the bargainers become less skilled. � We consider how firms and competition authorities might encourage more consumers to bargain and determine {{the conditions under which}} each would choose to do so. � Finally, we study the firms' strategic decision about how much bargaining discretion sales staff should be allowed. � Both firms allowing full bargaining flexibility is always an equilibrium - but not always the most profitable one. � If there are enough bargainers, both firms committing to only matching the rival's posted price is also an equilibrium: price matching moderates competition, thus raising profits.

40|$|A common {{approach}} to elicit risk attitude is the multiple <b>price</b> <b>list</b> {{with a series}} of binary choices. However, a frequently observed problem when using multiple <b>price</b> <b>lists</b> is that participants switch more than once from the safer to the riskier option, thus exhibiting multiple switching behavior. The present study analyzes whether the visualization of different multiple <b>price</b> <b>lists</b> reduce multiple switching behavior. Therefore, we conduct two types of multiple <b>price</b> <b>lists</b> in two different display formats. Participants are randomly assigned into a textual or a visual group and carry out both multiple <b>price</b> <b>lists</b> in the corresponding display format. Our results reveal that different types of multiple <b>price</b> <b>lists</b> lead to differences in the extent of multiple switching behavior. Moreover, we show that the visualization of a multiple <b>price</b> <b>list</b> can be an instrument to greatly reduce multiple switching behavior...|$|R

40|$|Today's Swedish {{large-scale}} forestry uses {{almost exclusively}} computer-aided bucking. It allows the harvester computer, using an optimisation <b>price</b> <b>list</b> (steering <b>price</b> <b>list),</b> {{to maximize the}} value of each tree. The optimisation <b>price</b> <b>list</b> can be adjusted so that the industry gets the raw material it demands from the forest. There are various simulation programs {{that can be used}} when constructing a optimisation <b>price</b> <b>list.</b> The simulation program merchandise a database of stem shapes using a given <b>price</b> <b>list</b> and mimics a harvester's work. To get the demanded raw material for the industry it is important to use a well-adjusted optimisation <b>price</b> <b>list.</b> To be able to construct a good <b>price</b> <b>list</b> it is essential to have a stem shape data base that resembles the forest were the optimisation <b>price</b> <b>list</b> will be used. No such data base was available for the pine forest from the island of Gotland. Data collected from a harvester was used and manipulated to create the data base. The data base was merchandised using a simulation program. The result after merchandise was compared with the result from actual harvest operations using the same <b>price</b> <b>list.</b> The database was manipulated further until the results were consistent with results from the harvesting on Gotland. It proved to be difficult to create a data base that resembles the pine forest on Gotland. A large amount of forced bucking (without computer assisted bucking) was found in the material. The result from the harvested timber from Gotland gave no longer a desirable outcome. The large amount of forced bucking is probably due to the very crooked forest that grows on Gotland in combination with the steering <b>price</b> <b>lists</b> used. To avoid reversing the harvester head before each log was bucked, the harvest operators instead chose to buck manually. Adjusting the steering <b>price</b> <b>list</b> should reduce the amount of forced bucking. A possible way is to create an optimisation <b>price</b> <b>list,</b> which manages two matrixes; one for straight trees of high quality and one for crooked trees of inferior quality. Before bucking a tree, the matrix that best fits the tree is chosen...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{increased}} interests in the empirical regularity among house prices, the housing stock turnover and neighbourhood transition. What most studies imply {{is that it is}} not the seller’s choice of selling price that gives rise to the empirical regularity; instead, it is the stickiness of the seller’s choice of reservation price which leads to the mar-ket outcome. This paper attempts to disentangle the observed market price of a property into the seller’s reservation price, the buyer’s offer price, and the listing’s days on market. It draws on the search theory and applies an econometric model of three simultaneous equa-tions on Multiple Listing Service data. The result suggests that, first, a shift in the mean of the offer price distribution may not lead to a shift in the mean of the reservation price distribution by the same amount. This result is consistent with the observed pattern: Dur-ing periods of price decline, properties tend to take longer to sell because sellers may hold sticky reservation prices. Second, to the extent that list prices may be a proxy for reservation <b>prices,</b> <b>list</b> prices serve as an upperbound of the latter. List prices may not fully reflect how sellers value their property’s physical and neighbourhood attributes. The paper attempts to shed light on the price mechanism underlying property markets, and it provides suggestions for future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} bachelor thesis {{concentrates on}} the analysis of construction expenditures dutiny the process of introducing material and construction changes. We have selected four variant of the given construction systems supplied by four different providers. This has been conducted under the following condition: all the four variants has a common heat transfer coefficient. U= 0, 14 [W/m 2 K]. Among the selected systems we have included Heluz, Velox, Porotherm and Ytong. Under Heluz system we have chosen Heluz Family, ground surface, thickness 500 mm. This system does not involved contact insulation. As for Porotherm, we have decided for ceramic breeze blocks Porotherm 30, thickness 300 mm, to follow the obligatory common heat transfer coefficient, therefore we have also suggested contact insulation as of 220 mm. The third system, Velox permanent boarding, VELOX WS EPS PLUS thickness 420 [mm]. This system fully complies with the heat transfer coefficient requirements. Finally, we have used Ytong breeze blocks 300 mm in thickness. For this solution there also arose a need to design the contact insulation to follow the heat transfer coefficient requirements. For ech project variant we have designed project documuntation as a the basis for further budget item calculations pertinent to each single project variant. The item budget calculation was made using KROS PLUS programme. The overall budget prices and variables in each project variant have been comapred with each other, the data processed into several graphs accordingly. Among the variables we have included ground works, founding, vertical and complete constructions, horizontal constructions, surfaře finishing works, flooring and filling works, thermal insulations. Furthermore, purchasing prices for each invividual type of material, based on provider <b>prices</b> <b>list,</b> have been compared with prices as given by KROS PLUS programme...|$|E
40|$|Póster presentado en la European Geosciences Union General Assembly, celebrada en Viena del 7 al 12 de abril de 2013. Cost {{optimization}} of {{soil conservation}} measures {{is essential in}} the agricultural sector where the farmers return of investment is usually small, {{and there is a}} high degree of uncertainty about yield. The main aims of this study are: 1) to assess the cost of check dams and revegetation measures {{for a wide range of}} situations on gully networks of Andalusia and 2) provide an estimation of the adequate budget requirements for the gully restoration at farms included in the public Incentive Program for Gully Control (IPGC) supported by the Junta de Andalucia (Spain). Firstly, a study was conducted to design the structures adapted to a wide variety of gully conditions (slope, width, height, unitary discharge) in the region of Andalusia, and check dam materials (concrete and gabions) taking into account conventional engineering stability criteria, recommendations in technical literature (Gómez et al., 2011) and principles of energy dissipation maximization (Castillo, 2012). In addition, the cost of the conservation measures was estimated by using current market prices of local resources (for interventions with farmers own means) and national construction <b>prices</b> <b>list</b> (if the works were hired to an external company). The cost of the interventions was expressed as a multivariate function of the gully characteristic by means of regression analysis to facilitate its use for budget estimation purposes. Finally, these equations were applied to the farms included in the IPGC database to provide an estimation of the adequate budget required for a successful implementation of this initiative, as well as to propose unitary indexes (i. e. cost per gully meter in the longitudinal profile or per square meter in plan view) that could serve as useful criteria for this, or future programs, to allocate resources to individual farms based on specific characteristics of the gully erosion problems they suffer.

40|$|Multiple <b>price</b> <b>lists</b> {{have emerged}} as a simple and popular method for {{eliciting}} risk preferences. Despite their popularity, a key downside of multiple <b>price</b> <b>lists</b> has not been widely recognized - namely that the approach is unlikely to generate sufficient information to accurately identify different dimensions of risk preferences. The most popular theories of decision making under risk posit that preference for risk are driven {{by a combination of}} two factors: the curvature of the utility function {{and the extent to which}} probabilities are weighted non-linearly. In this paper, we show that the widely used multiple <b>price</b> <b>list</b> introduced by Holt and Laury (2002) is likely more accurate at eliciting the latter, and we construct a different multiple <b>price</b> <b>list</b> that is likely more accurate at eliciting the former.
