25|$|Rarely, {{a catcher}} {{can make a}} {{successful}} <b>pick-off</b> throw to a base to surprise an inattentive or incautious baserunner. Especially at the higher levels of baseball (where this play almost never results in an out), the catcher's snap throws are mainly for psychological effect. If the runner knows that the catcher often attempts snap throws, the runner {{is likely to take}} a smaller lead from his base before each pitch, which will allow the infielders an extra fraction of a second to throw the runner out at the next base if he attempts to advance (as, for example, when a ground ball is hit). Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals and former MLB catcher Iván Rodríguez are known for using pickoffs with success, particularly at first base. Teams may sometimes call a deliberate play, the pitchout, wherein the pitcher intentionally throws the ball wide and high to the catcher, who comes out of his crouch to receive it and relays the ball quickly to a base to put a runner out.|$|E

40|$|The WHT Extreme Aperture Velocity Explorer (WEAVE) {{is a form}} of {{ground-based}} wide-field spectrograph, {{planned to}} be installed at the prime focus of the 4. 2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT). The instrument has a two degree field of view and full coverage of the visible wavelength from 366 nm to 950 nm. Using fibre-optic <b>pick-offs</b> at the focal plane, it can also observe up to 960 simultaneous spectra for each configuration. The fibre-fed spectrograph consists of a collimator mirror, dichroic and two correcting lenses before each of two volume phase holographic (VPH) gratings and two eight-lens cameras. The two cameras have been designed to have the same lens shapes and have almost the same glass blank and the design also reduces the ghost between the surfaces of the lenses. The unique part of the instrument is called the 'Positioner'; fibres on the positioner can be moved in the focal plane to pick the required target. The WEAVE survey is expected to start observing by 2018. Here we report {{on the development of the}} details of an end-to-end image simulator for WEAVE which can be used to generate data to test the image processing and analysis pipelines.
