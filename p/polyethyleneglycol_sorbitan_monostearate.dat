This article deals with the preparation of zinc borate particles that are well dispersed and colloidally stabilized in mineral oil. This method starts with preparing two inverse emulsions (water-in-oil) with <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate</b> (Span 60) as a surfactant, light neutral oil as a continuous phase, and the aqueous solutions of borax decahydrate (Na 2 B 4 O 7 · 10 H 2 O) and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O) as the dispersed phases. The produced particles were zinc borate crystals having both rod-like and spherical morphologies, and the diameters of spherical particles were changing between 20 and 30 nm. FTIR spectra of the obtained particles showed the characteristic peaks of trihedral borate (B(3) -O) and tetrahedral borate (B(4) -O) {{groups as well as}} the specific peaks of the <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate.</b> TG showed 30. 42 % and 22. 08 % mass loss at 600 °C for the samples prepared by inverse emulsion and precipitation techniques, respectively. The endothermic peak at 50 °C is observed due to the melting of <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate</b> and the heat of melting is evaluated as - 3. 50 J/g. Tribological studies revealed that <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate</b> not only outperformed as a dispersing agent of inorganic particles, but also it proved to be an anti-wear agent. Zinc borate produced by precipitation decreased the wear scar diameter from 1. 402 to 0. 639 mm and the friction coefficient from 0. 099 to 0. 064. The inverse emulsion was effective in decreasing wear scar diameter and the friction coefficient by lowering them to 0. 596 and 0. 089 mm, respectively.

However, the apparent surface geometry depends on the direction of electron transfer: the blocked interface behaves as an array of isolated microelectrodes for the oxidation of DiMFc or DcMFc and as a uniformly accessible surface for the reduction of DiMFc(-). Interfacial capacitance and interfacial tension measurements gave the surface coverage of the surfactant, and scanning electrochemical microscopy approach curves yielded the overall reaction rate constant fur ferrocene oxidation. Four-electrode voltammetry revealed the asymmetry of the interface geometry induced by surfactant adsorption. It is concluded that <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate</b> forms patches on the interface, which the uncharged ferrocene derivative cannot penetrate. The packing density of surfactant molecules in the surface patches increased with increasing surface coverage. From the limiting current values fur DiMFc oxidation obtained from cyclic voltammograms for near-complete coverage of surfactant, the diameter of the holes in the surfactant layer is calculated to be approximately 200 nm.

Due to gastrointestinal side effects, poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability, its clinical usage has been restricted. The objective {{of the present study}} was to enhance its dissolution profile and to attain sustained release by designing a novel delivery system based on niosomes. Five niosomal formulations (F 1 -F 5) with non-ionic surfactant (<b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate)</b> and cholesterol in varying ratios of 5 : 5, 6 : 4, 7 : 3, 8 : 2 and 9 : 1 were developed by the reverse-phase evaporation technique. The size and polydispersivity index (PDI) were found in the range of 0. 608 µm to 1. 010 µm and 0. 409 to 0. 781, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the selected formulation (F 3) revealed spherical vesicles, and 79. 8 % entrapment was achieved with F 3 (7 : 3). Dissolution studies using the dialysis method showed sustained release behaviour for all formulations. The optimized surfactant-to-cholesterol concentration (7 : 3) in formulation F 3 sustained the drug-release time (T 50 %) up to 10 hours. Kinetic modelling exhibited a zero-order release (R 2 = 0. 9834) and the release exponent 'n' of the Korsmayer-Peppas model (n= 0. 90) confirmed non-fickian and anomalous release.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examines}} the microstructure, gelation tempera-tures, and flow properties of novel amphiphilogels consisting solely of non-ionic surfactants. Methods. Gels were prepared by mixing the solid gelator (<b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate</b> or <b>sorbitan</b> monopalmitate) and the liquid phase (liq-uid sorbitan esters or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 °C {{to form a}} clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling the sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was ex-amined by light and electron microscopy and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS); gelation temperatures were measured by hot-stage microscopy, a melting point apparatus, and high sensitivity dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). Flow rheograms were per-formed to establish the zero-rate viscosity of the gels and their per-formance under shear. Results. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3 D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility. Gelation temperature and viscos-ity increased with increasing gelator concentration, indicating a more robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface tempera-ture, the gels softened considerably; this would allow topical appli-cation. Conclusions.

40|$|Asiatic acid {{is a very}} {{promising}} anticancer drug; however, its poor water solubility is a serious limitation. In this study, non-ionic surfactant nanocapsules were manufactured using <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate</b> (Span 60) and cholesterol (1 : 1) to entrap and solubilize Asiatic acid. Niosome nanocapsules with or without Asiatic acid were prepared using thin film hydration method by hand shaking at 50 Â°C followed by bath and probe sonication. The probe-sonicated Asiatic acid nanocapsules had a hydrodynamic size of 179 Â± 4. 4 nm compared to 264 Â± 58. 4 nm for the nanocapsules containing no Asiatic acid. When no drug was included, the nanocapsules had a zeta potential value of - 27. 3 Â± 5. 6 mV, whilst inclusion of Asiatic acid prior to hydration caused the zeta potential to be - 7. 2 Â± 3. 5 mV. The manufacture of Asiatic acid in nanocapsule formulation resulted in marked enhancement of drug solubility, so that drug solubility reached 2. 4 mg/ml which is 160 {{times higher than the}} literature reported aqueous solubility of this drug. Furthermore, the drug entrapment efficiency in the nanocapsules was as high as 78. 8 (23. 64 mg drug/ 100 mg lipid). Overall, a simple approach to manufacturing Asiatic acid niosome nanocapsules has been introduced, offering enhanced solubility and superior entrapment of the drug.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} penetration enhancers in proniosomes as a transdermal delivery system for nisoldipine. This was performed {{with the goal of}} optimising the composition of proniosomes as transdermal drug delivery systems. Plain proniosomes comprising <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate,</b> cholesterol, ethanol and a small quantity of water were initially prepared. Subsequently, proniosomes containing lecithin or skin penetration enhancers were prepared and evaluated for transdermal delivery of nisoldipine. The plain proniosomes significantly enhanced the transdermal flux of nisoldipine to reach 12. 18 μgcm− 2 h− 1 compared with a saturated aqueous drug solution which delivered the drug at a rate of 0. 46 μgcm− 2 h− 1. Incorporation of lecithin into such proniosomes increased the drug flux to reach a value of 28. 51 μgcm− 2 h− 1. This increase {{can be attributed to the}} penetration enhancing effect of lecithin fatty acid components. Replacing lecithin oleic acid (OA) produced proniosomes of comparable efficacy to the lecithin containing system. The transdermal drug flux increased further after incorporation of propylene glycol into the OA based proniosomes. Similarly, incorporation of isopropyl myristate into plain proniosomes increased drug flux. The study introduced enhanced proniosomes as a promising transdermal delivery carrier and highlighted the role of penetration enhancing mechanisms in enhanced proniosomal skin delivery. The study opened the way for another line of optimisation of niosome proconcentrates...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} {{biodegradable}} and biocompatible organogels can be formed with chitin as the filler material and triglycerides as the continuous hydrophobic phase. When crude chitin was used, a large degree of aggregation was observed that prevented the formation of stable organogels. Two approaches were used to diminish this degree of aggregation and increase the stability. Either surfactants were used to increase the dispersability of the crude chitin, or the crude chitin was transformed into smaller rod-like nanocrystals by acid hydrolysis. Both approaches {{led to the formation}} of stable organogels with storage moduli up to 106 Pa for high chitin concentrations (20 wt%). Three different types of surfactants were used, namely phosphatidylcholine, enzymatically modified phosphatidylcholine and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate</b> (Span 60). The choice of surfactant has a large influence on the gel strength and the temperature sensitivity of the gels. With chitin nanocrystals, in the presence of surfactants, larger gel strengths were observed for lower concentrations (1 - 10 wt%), indicating more efficient packing of the particles. Gels were stable even after addition of considerable amounts of water up to 25 wt%. The increase in gel strength in the presence of water (storage modulus) was most likely an effect of the water absorption ability of chitin that increased the effective volume fraction of the fillers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate in vitro transnasal sustained-release ability of <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate</b> (SMS) organogels in isopropyl myristate (IM). Organogels were prepared containing SMS (2. 5 %– 20 %) and water (5 %– 25 %) in IM and analyzed microscopically for phase behavior. The effect of Tween surfactants on gel strength and in vitro nasal diffusion of propranolol is reported. The in vitro nasal release retardant effect of SMS and Tween 20 was investigated using factorial design. The microscopic changes in structure of organogel during in vitro nasal diffusion were studied. The water-holding capacity of SMS organogels in IM increased with SMS concentration. The release retardant effect with incorportation of cosurfactant was of the order of Tween 80 > Tween 60 > Tween 20. Gel strengthening and increased viscosity were evident with increased concentration of SMS and Tween 20. The 3 -dimensional network of SMS molecules controls the diffusional drug release. The organogel system on nasal mucosa during diffusion is dynamic in nature and changes continuously with the time of diffusion. The water penetration in the organogel network results in percolation and emulsification of organogel, thus affecting the release. Organogels provided an effective barrier for diffusion of propranolol. The surface epithelium lining and the granular cellular structure of treated nasal mucosa were intact...|$|R
40|$|The aerosol {{properties}} of niosomes were studied using Aeroneb Pro and Omron MicroAir vibrating-mesh nebulizers and Pari LC Sprint air-jet nebulizer. Proniosomes were prepared by coating sucrose particles with Span 60 (<b>sorbitan</b> <b>monostearate),</b> cholesterol and beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) (1 : 1 : 0. 1). Nano-sized niosomes were produced by manual shaking of the proniosomes in deionized water followed by sonication (median size 236 nm). The entrapment of BDP in proniosome-derived niosomes {{was higher than}} that in conventional thin film-made niosomes, being 36. 4 and 27. 5 respectively. All nebulizers generated aerosols with very high drug output, which was 83. 6 using the Aeroneb Pro, 85. 5 using the Pari and 72. 4 using the Omron. The median droplet size was 3. 32 Î¼m, 3. 06 Î¼m and 4. 86 Î¼m for the Aeroneb Pro, Pari and Omron nebulizers respectively and the "fine particle fraction" (FPF) of BDP was respectively 68. 7, 76. 2 and 42. 1. The predicted extrathoracic deposition, based on size distribution of nebulized droplets was negligible for all devices, suggesting {{all of them are}} potentially suitable for pulmonary delivery of niosomes. The predicted drug deposition in the alveolar region was low using the Omron (3. 2), but greater using the Aeroneb Pro (17. 4) and the Pari (20. 5). Overall, noisome-BDP aerosols with high drug output and FPF can be generated from proniosomes and delivered using vibrating-mesh or air-jet nebulizers. Â© 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of iron based oxygen absorber systems comprising iron, sodium chloride, water, silica gel, activated carbon, monosodium glutamate, potassium acid tartrate, powdered cellulose, malic acid, chabazite, hydroxypropyl cellulose, potassium carbonate, sodium thiosulfate, propylene glycol, glycerin, <b>polyethyleneglycol</b> <b>sorbitan</b> monooleate, sodium propionate and clinoptilolite, incorporated in sachets, patches and cards. Iron, the main active ingredient reacts with oxygen to form iron hydroxide and iron oxide, thereby removing oxygen from the primary packaging. Only activated carbon has not been evaluated as such, but it meets the specifications for activated charcoal which is authorised as additive for plastic materials and articles in contact with foods. All other ingredients of the oxygen absorber formulations have been evaluated and approved for use as additives in plastic food contact materials and/or as food additives and/or food supplements or feed additives. The active system being based on solid ingredients and not intended for direct contact with liquid food or food with an external liquid surface, migration through the gas phase was screened for 9 representative active systems. No volatiles derived from the active mixtures were detected. Therefore the CEF Panel concluded that the substances do not raise a safety concern when used in oxygen absorbers in sachets, patches or cards, placed in the headspace of the packaging or when used {{in direct contact with}} food, excluding liquid food or foods that have an external aqueous liquid phase on the surface such as sliced fruits and fresh meat...|$|R
