40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the study of several types of matrix interpolation problems, including &#x 02022;• The matrix Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem in the Nevanlinna class Np,&#x 02022;• The matrix Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem in the Stieltjes class Lp,&#x 02022;• The truncated matrix <b>power</b> <b>moment</b> problem on the real axis,&#x 02022;• The Stieltjes matrix <b>power</b> <b>moment</b> problem.
