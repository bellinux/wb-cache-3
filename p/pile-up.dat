5|$|Hamilton {{stepped up}} to be the team leader in 2003, with the goal of winning the Tour de France. He won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and was in form when he broke his {{collarbone}} in a <b>pile-up</b> on stage 1 of the Tour. He lost a lot of time. He made it up by winning a stage and finishing fourth, while his teammates Carlos Sastre and Jakob Piil also won stages.|$|E
5|$|In the Tour de France, Cancellara came {{in third}} of stage one's {{individual}} time trial. On the second stage, he was donned the yellow jersey {{thanks to a}} third place, which gave him four bonus seconds. He {{was involved in a}} mass <b>pile-up</b> on the third stage, and finished the race slowly. After a visit to the hospital, it was revealed that he had suffered two transverse process fractures in two vertebrae in his lower back and he had to abandon.|$|E
5|$|In the semifinal, three skaters, {{including}} the defending champion, crashed {{into each other}} and Bradbury moved up into second place {{to qualify for the}} final. In the final, Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and was safely in last place, around 15m behind with only 50m to go, when all four rivals collided and fell over, allowing him to avoid the <b>pile-up</b> and take the victory. The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world.|$|E
40|$|Cracks and {{dislocation}} <b>pile-ups</b> are {{equivalent to}} each other. In this paper, the physical equivalence between cracks and <b>pile-ups</b> is delineated, and the relationshps between crack-extension force, {{force on the}} leading dislocation, stress-intensity factor, and dislocation density are reviewed and summarized. These relations {{make it possible to}} extend quantitatively the recent advances in the concepts and practices of fracture mechanics to the studies of microfractures and microplastic deformations...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} SiGe virtual substrates, by solid-source {{molecular}} beam epitaxy (SS-MBE), using a new germanium grading technique has been studied. It is proposed that the grading of germanium using a series of linearly graded/uniform layers (terrace grading) prevents the dislocation <b>pile-ups,</b> associated with strain relief, from penetrating the entire epilayer. Since the dislocation <b>pile-ups</b> cause threading dislocations to become trapped and increase the roughness of the surface, the control of these <b>pile-ups</b> reduces both the threading dislocation density and the RMS surface roughness. Si 0. 50 Ge 0. 50 virtual substrates of 2 µm thickness using the terrace grading technique have been studied and compared to conventional linear graded and step graded virtual substrates of the same thickness. Substantial reductions in both the RMS roughness and threading dislocation densities {{are found in the}} terrace graded structure, compared with the conventional techniques. Electrical properties have been measured in layers grown on virtual substrates using the terrace grading and show promisingly high hole mobilities. The mechanism by which the terrace graded virtual substrates relax has been examined in order to optimise the growth conditions. It is found that the lowest layers of the virtual substrates do not relax until sufficient strain energy is accumulated by the growth of the following layers, leading to dislocation <b>pile-ups</b> that extend through several layers. The use of in-situ anneals has been shown to greatly improve the relaxation of the lower layers, with a corresponding decrease {{in the size of the}} <b>pile-ups,</b> and consequently lower threading dislocation densities have been found...|$|R

5|$|The season {{only saw}} one driver change, which was brought about when Lotus driver Romain Grosjean {{was found by}} race {{stewards}} {{to be responsible for}} causing a multi-car <b>pile-up</b> {{at the start of the}} Belgian Grand Prix. He was given a one-race ban and a €50,000 fine for his role in the collision, forcing him to miss the Italian Grand Prix. He was replaced by the team's testing and reserve driver, Jérôme d'Ambrosio. Grosjean returned to the team for the next round in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|During the February 21, 2000 {{game between}} the Canucks and the Boston Bruins, Brashear was {{involved}} in a fight with Marty McSorley. Brashear handily won the fight and {{on his way to the}} penalty box taunted the Bruins bench. Later in the game, Brashear collided with Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe, who had to be taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury. For the rest of the game, McSorley attempted to fight Brashear, who refused. With 4.6 seconds left in the game, McSorley struck Brashear with a two-handed slash to the temple with his stick; Brashear collapsed, and his helmet fell off upon impact. He suffered a seizure on the ice and the slash resulted in a grade three concussion. Goaltender Garth Snow then tried to fight McSorley, but a <b>pile-up</b> occurred, and Snow couldn't get at McSorley, who was ejected with 2.8 seconds left in the game. McSorley later received an indefinite suspension from the NHL and was charged with assault with a weapon as a result of his actions.|$|E
5|$|The 1951–52 season saw {{the club}} nearly win the Double, but {{ultimately}} end up empty-handed; {{a series of}} injuries and a fixture <b>pile-up</b> {{at the end of}} the season saw Arsenal lose their last two matches, including the title decider against eventual champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on the last day of the season; after losing 6–1, the Gunners finished third, equal on points with Tottenham. A week later, Arsenal played Newcastle United in the 1952 FA Cup Final, with several recovering players rushed back into the first team; Walley Barnes was taken off injured with a twisted knee after 35 minutes (no substitutes were allowed then), and ten-man Arsenal suffered further injuries to Holton, Roper and Daniel, so that by the end of the match they had only seven fit players on the pitch; with the numerical advantage in their favour, Newcastle won 1–0 with a goal from George Robledo.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{dislocation}} climb {{is incorporated in}} a two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics model. Calculations are carried out for polycrystalline thin films, passivated on one or both surfaces. Climb allows dislocations to escape from dislocation <b>pile-ups</b> and reduces the strain-hardening rate, especially for fully passivated films. Within the framework of this model, climb modifies the dislocation structures that develop during plastic deformation and results {{in the formation of}} <b>pile-ups</b> on slip planes that do not contain any dislocation sources.

5|$|Ten {{nations were}} {{entered in the}} tandem competition, {{and in the first}} round, they were drawn with Germany and South Africa, who fielded their silver medallist pairing of Tom Shardelow and Ray Robinson from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. The Australians made their move too early and led at the ringing of the bell {{at the start of the}} last lap, but they were {{overhauled}} well before the line as they faded in the final straight. Browne and Marchant were given another chance in the repechage round later in the same day. The Australians lead for three quarters of the distance, but were overhauled by their Czechoslovakian opponent in the final metres and were defeated in a photo finish. This would normally have meant that the Australians would have been eliminated, however the final repechage between the Soviet Union and the Germans resulted in a tangle, resulting in a heavy <b>pile-up.</b> Neither teams finished the race, but the Soviets were hospitalised. The cycling officials decided that the bruised Germans would be forced to compete in a repechage sequel against the losers in the previous repechages to qualify. This allowed the United States and the Australians a reprieve.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} resumed {{one month}} later in Belgium. Jenson Button qualified on pole and broke away at the start while a four-car <b>pile-up</b> started behind him when Romain Grosjean made contact with Lewis Hamilton and they both slammed into Fernando Alonso and Sergio Pérez, eliminating all four on the spot and triggering the safety car. Kamui Kobayashi's car was also damaged, and Pastor Maldonado was spun around amidst the chaos. Grosjean was later given a one-race ban for causing the collision, becoming the first driver in eighteen years to be banned from racing. Maldonado retired shortly after the restart with a broken front wing after making contact with Timo Glock, while Narain Karthikeyan spun off at Stavelot mid-way through the race when his wheel came loose. Button controlled the race from the front and was unchallenged throughout, while Sebastian Vettel clawed {{his way up to}} second from tenth on the grid. Kimi Räikkönen started and finished third, let down by a conservative pit strategy that forced him to make a second stop late in the race in order to use both compounds of tyre as per the rules – even when it became apparent that Button and Vettel were racing on a one-stop strategy – and Nico Hülkenberg finished in a career-best fourth place. Button's win allowed him to regain precious ground on the championship fight, while Alonso's retirement from the race and Vettel's second place moved the reigning World Champion to within twenty-four points of the championship lead. Scuderia Toro Rosso scored their first points since the Malaysian Grand Prix, with Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo finishing eighth and ninth respectively. Further down the order, Caterham was summoned to the stewards on charges of an unsafe pit release when Heikki Kovalainen was released directly into the path of Karthikeyan and the team was given a €10,000 fine for the incident.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of {{accidents}} (including two fatal ones) {{were reported by}} Ontario Provincial Police by the Sûreté du Québec across Ontario, Quebec and across several US States including a <b>pile-up</b> that involved at least seven tractor-trailers on Highway 401 near Cornwall which temporarily closed the road. A second <b>pile-up</b> on Highway 401 near Kingston caused a rig to leaked over 300 liters of fuel into a creek. Another <b>pile-up</b> involving a tractor-trailer was reported on Autoroute 40 west of Montreal forcing the shutdown {{of it as the}} trailer overturned and spilled kerosene on the roadway. Autoroutes 20 and 440 and Highways 132, 138 and 175 north and east of Quebec City were shut down due to heavy and blowing snow.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} cutoffs and <b>pile-ups</b> due to various {{processes in the}} spectra of particles produced by shock acceleration, and found that, {{even in the absence}} of energy losses, the shape of the spectrum of accelerated particles at energies well below the nominal maximum energy depends strongly on the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. This has implications in many areas, for example, in fitting the observed cosmic ray spectrum with models based on power-law source spectra and rigidity dependent diffusive escape from the galaxy. With continuous energy losses, prominent <b>pile-ups</b> may arise, and these should be included when modelling synchrotron X-ray and inverse Compton gamma-ray spectra from a shock-accelerated electron population. We have developed a Monte Carlo/numerical technique to model the shape of the spectrum for the case of non-continuous energy losses such as inverse Compton scattering in the Klein-Nishina regime. We find that the shapes of the resulting cut-offs [...] ...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a key}} {{research}} {{issue to}} accurately select out neutron signals and discriminate gamma signals from a mixed radiation field in the neutron detection. This paper proposes a fractal spectrum discrimination approach by means of different spectrum characteristics of neutron and gamma. Figure of merit and average discriminant error ratio are adopted together to evaluate the discriminant effects. Different neutron and gamma signals with various noises and pulse <b>pile-ups</b> are simulated according to real data in the literature. The proposed approach is compared with the digital charge integration and pulse gradient methods. It is found that the fractal approach exhibits the best discriminant performance among three methods. The fractal spectrum approach is not sensitive to the high frequency noises and pulse <b>pile-ups.</b> It means that the proposed approach takes the advantages of anti-noises and high discriminant ability, {{and can be used}} to better discriminate neutron and gamma in neutron detection.

40|$|The {{idealized}} general {{model of}} aggregate growth is considered {{on the basis}} of the simple additive rules that correspond to one-step aggregation process. The two idealized cases were analytically investigated and simulated by Monte Carlo method in the Desktop Grid distributed computing environment to analyze "pile-up" and "wall" cluster distributions in different aggregation scenarios. Several aspects of aggregation kinetics (change of scaling, change of size distribution type, and appearance of scale-free size distribution) driven by "zero cluster size" boundary condition were determined by analysis of evolving cumulative distribution functions. The "pile-up" case with a minimum active surface (singularity) could imitate piling up aggregations of dislocations, and the case with a maximum active surface could imitate arrangements of dislocations in walls. The change of scaling law (for <b>pile-ups</b> and walls) and availability of scale-free distributions (for walls) were analytically shown and confirmed by scaling, fitting, moment, and bootstrapping analyses of simulated probability density and cumulative distribution functions. The initial "singular" symmetric distribution of <b>pile-ups</b> evolves by the "infinite" diffusive scaling law and later it is replaced by the other "semi-infinite" diffusive scaling law with asymmetric distribution of <b>pile-ups.</b> In contrast, the initial "singular" symmetric distributions of walls initially evolve by the diffusive scaling law and later it is replaced by the other ballistic (linear) scaling law with scale-free exponential distributions without distinctive peaks. The conclusion was made as to possible applications of such approach for scaling, fitting, moment, and bootstrapping analyses of distributions in simulated and experimental data.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} and the dislocation {{arrangement in}} the die cast AM 50 magnesium alloy {{as well as}} in the stressed states have been investigated using conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The microstructure of the die cast AM 50 alloy is found to mainly consist of a-Mg, b-Mg 17 Al 12 and Al 8 Mn 5 phases. Two kinds of b-Mg 17 Al 12 particles with different sizes have been found in the stressed AM 50 magnesium alloy. Besides the normal b-Mg 17 Al 12 particles with size around several micrometers as in the die-cast AM 50 magnesium alloy, some finer b-Mg 17 Al 12 particles in the stressed states of the AM 50 alloy have also been found. The finer b-Mg 17 Al 12 particles are found to be only about tens of nanometers with oval or rod-like morphology, which may be formed during deformation. Dislocation <b>pile-ups</b> have been found in the stressed AM 50 alloy for the first time. The spacing between each parallel dislocation in the <b>pile-ups</b> is only several nanometers. The dislocations are confined in the slip planes and piled up against grain boundaries. Dislocations in the networks are found to increase with deformation of the alloy. Also, dislocation networks have been found in the b-Mg 17 Al 12 and Al 8 Mn 5 phases {{as well as in}} the matrix in the deformed AM 50 magnesium alloy. However, the dislocation <b>pile-ups</b> are found to be almost identical from 1. 3 % deformation to rupture, which explains the stable tensile yield strength of the AM 50 magnesium alloy during the deformation...|$|R
