40|$|This paper {{describes}} an engineering undergraduate course {{that covers the}} methods and techniques of multiphysics modeling. Students become active participants in analysis and discovery by being challenged to solve a sequence of problems related to high <b>priority</b> <b>technology</b> areas. <b>Projects</b> range from power systems and thermal control of habitats to autonomous flight systems and harsh environment electronics. Working in a cooperative learning environment, teams encounter a series of assignments that build on existing skills while gradually expanding their knowledge and expertise in disciplines outside of their own. This project-based approach employs a scaffolding structure with assignments organized in progressively challenging modules supported by mentoring. &# 13; Each project begins with a problem definition which requires consideration of factors and influences beyond a single discipline. Solution development then moves to setting material properties, boundary constraints and including the necessary physics engines. For many students, {{this is the first}} in depth exposure to problems with specialized terminologies, driving equations and limiting conditions. Lastly, solving and post processing are addressed exploring steady state, time-variant, frequency response, optimization and sensitivity methods. The paper discusses the teaching and learning strategies, course structure, outcome assessment and project examples...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of waste foundry sand (WFS) as a highway embankment material in a fullscale field demonstration project. This evaluation included geotechnical concerns, such as deformation, strength, hydraulic conductivity, and ease of construction. The report presents an introduction and previous research concerning WFS use in highway construction. A geotechnical laboratory testing program characterized the WFS used in the project, which was a waste product of Auburn Foundry, Inc., located in Auburn, Indiana. This study was also a part of the FHWA <b>Priorities</b> <b>Technology</b> Program. The <b>project</b> site was a 275 m section of the Country Route 206 highway project near Butler, Indiana. Three sections of the embankment were studied: a section built with clay borrow, a section built with natural sand, and a section built with WFS. The embankment was built during the summer of 1996. This report presents field testing data with regard to vertical and lateral deformations of the WFS embankment, in situ changes in pore pressures in the foundation soils during construction, and the post-construction in situ penetration resistance of the WFS. The performance of the WFS section is compared to that of the clay borrow and natural sand sections of the embankment. The results of laboratory and field testing of the Auburn Foundry WFS provide general guidelines for the choice of geotechnical parameters for preliminary design of WFS embankments. From a geotechnical perspective, the results indicate that WFS can be used successfully as embankment fill material for full-scale highway projects...|$|R

In {{the last}} decade, the {{deployment}} of information technology artefacts to enable and support processes and activities in organisations has increased tremendously. Organisations deploy information technology artefacts in different ways, but primarily for competitive advantage. Hence emphasis and resources (human included) are invested on information technology by many organisations. The deployment information technology artefacts are often carried out through projects. Irrespective {{of the size of}} the information <b>technology</b> <b>project,</b> there are potential risks associated to it. Risks associated to information <b>technology</b> <b>projects</b> are often not technical. Some of the risks are relative to the context in which the project is initiated and deployed. Over the years, the challenge to identify, assess and manage risk in information <b>technology</b> <b>projects</b> has become an increasing concern for many organisations. Many approaches and methods have been employed to address this challenge of risks identification, assessment and management. Unfortunately, the challenge persists. This could be attributed to the fact that there has been more focus on the technological aspect of the deployment. The research was aimed at understanding the sources of risks, and how they manifest themselves in {{the deployment of}} information <b>technology</b> <b>projects</b> in organisations. The research focused on how risk factors impact and influence information <b>technology</b> <b>projects.</b> This was done through examining how risk is identified, monitored and managed in information <b>technology</b> <b>projects</b> in organisations...|$|R

40|$|Many office <b>technology</b> <b>projects</b> fail. The {{outcomes}} {{of these projects}} are often not in line with initial expectations. This book assumes that this disappointing result is largely {{the result of the}} fact that office <b>technology</b> <b>projects</b> are too IT-driven. The basic assumption is that the problems experienced in a specific office environment can be solved by a technical solution. In this book, the author suggests that office <b>technology</b> <b>projects</b> should acknowledge the existence of a non-technical side to office technology, namely the underlying intentions of the technology, which {{is referred to as the}} spirit. The effects of new office technology are not a function of the quality of the technology itself, but of the extent to which end-users apply the technology in accordance with its spirit. This suggests that office technology is 'realized' while it is used, not during its technical development. Therefore, improving office <b>technology</b> <b>projects</b> means that they should be less IT-driven, and more IT-use driven...|$|R

Research methodology was discussed in general and the researcher chose the research methodology that was suitable for the study. The research methodology that was chosen for the study was used as a guideline for the researcher. Based on the title of the study the literature review was developed to understand project management and the role of project risk management to reduce failure of Information <b>Technology</b> <b>projects,</b> the causes of Information <b>Technology</b> <b>projects</b> failure was discussed. The methodology research design part of the study involved quantitative methods, to gather data that elaborated more on the role of project risk management to reduce Information <b>Technology</b> <b>project</b> failure. The data collected was evaluated according to the responses from the participants and Pareto Analysis (80 / 20) principle. The data collection methods used are interview and survey that included questions about risk management and Information <b>Technology</b> <b>project</b> failure, observation to check the way participants responds during the interview. The results were used to make recommendations for the study and Pareto analysis was used to determine the support of participants from largest to lowest.
