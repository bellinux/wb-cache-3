How the present legal provisions can be applied effectively and implemented appropriately by promoting a sound rapport between the parochus and the parish finance council in order to foster <b>the</b> efficacious <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> parish property is <b>the</b> subject matter <b>of</b> this dissertation. This study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal provisions which can be used for <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> parish property.

40|$|Ius puniendi {{represents}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state sovereignty. Therefore, the criminal law, as a normative mechanism {{used by the}} state for its rights to punishment, {{is closely related to}} <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> state sovereignty. However, this bond is not so rigid as in <b>the</b> traditional system <b>of</b> criminal law and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors, that has contributed, is <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal validity <b>of</b> criminal law. In this paper we have tried to explain <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal validity <b>of</b> criminal legislation providing the state courts to cross <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> its own i. e. national values, goods and interests through its implementation. Namely, the universal principle provides the opportunity for the state courts to protect certain supranational goods, values and interests that represent common heritage of humanity, more precisely the civilization we live in. Protecting those goods, values and interests the state courts become more than national state organ - they have become a sort of 'international community organs'. We came to this conclusion following <b>the</b> genesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal principle, in particular by analyzing appropriate international documents that have formed this principle. We have referred to comparative legal regulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal principle in the paper. Even though it differs worldwide, there is an impression that existing regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal principle <b>of</b> legislation offers possibility <b>of</b> adequate <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important <b>goods</b> <b>of</b> humanity...|$|R
40|$|Architectural {{constraints}} are {{a crucial}} aspect in energy retrofitting of historic buildings. Usual global interventions {{are often not}} allowed since preserving historical values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building stock is mandatory. In this paper, the authors provide an alternative procedure by identifying the most profitable local interventions {{in order to maintain}} the architectural values during the restoration and energy retrofitting operations. So, thermal zones prioritization is the key element considered in this study. Its aim is to analyse which energy efficiency measures could be applied to a listed building, but at certain technological elements rather than a unique choice for the entire building envelope. Thus it will prove that you can work with individual elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building without compromising <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> architectural <b>good.</b> <b>The</b> attention was placed in promoting single measures and improving <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> built environment. The case study is an historical building in Rome, currently used for university purposes. The analysis was carried out through a building simulation model so that to assess the building energy performance before and after the selected interventions. The chosen software is TRNSYS. This approach shows how interventions, usually not applicable at the building scale, would be beneficial if applied at local scale such as a single thermal zone or a single technological unit. The authors built a reference scenario and, for each identified thermal zone, tested the energy efficiency improvement in terms of heating demand reduction coming from the hypothesized local intervention...|$|R

Reuben was still confined to his couch by his wound, and was under <b>the</b> care and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> Major Ogilvy. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> gentleman came to see me more than once, and endeavoured to add to my comfort, until I made him understand that it pained me to find myself upon a different footing to the brave fellows with whom I had shared <b>the</b> perils <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign. One great favour he did me in writing to my father, and informing him that I was well and in no pressing danger. In reply to this letter I had a stout Christian answer from the old man, bidding me to be of good courage, and quoting largely from a sermon on patience by the Reverend Josiah Seaton of Petersfield. My mother, he said, was in deep distress at my position, but was held up by her confidence in <b>the</b> decrees <b>of</b> Providence. He enclosed a draft for Major Ogilvy, commissioning him to use it in whatever way I should suggest. This money, together with the small hoard which my mother had sewed into my collar, proved to be invaluable, for when the gaol fever broke out amongst us I was able to get fitting food for the sick, and also to pay for <b>the</b> services <b>of</b> physicians, so that the disease was stamped out ere it had time to spread.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hemangiomas are {{the most}} common type of {{congenital}} anomaly in childhood. Although many resolve spontaneously, intervention is required when their growth could damage vital adjacent structures. Various therapeutic approaches to childhood hemangiomas with different types of laser have been described previously. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> this study was to determine whether <b>the</b> cooling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidermis during irradiation of hemangiomas with a Nd:YAG laser prevents thermal damage and decreases <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> sessions required to treat these lesions. Methods Between 1993 and 2001, 110 patients aged 3 months to 4 years, with cutaneous hemangiomas were treated with a Nd:YAG laser. The lesion was cooled with ice prior to, during, and after the irradiation. During each session the laser beam passed through <b>the</b> pieces <b>of</b> ice. <b>The</b> laser power was between 35 – 45 W with a pulse length of 2 – 10 seconds. Results After 6 months <b>of</b> follow-up, from <b>the</b> first session <b>of</b> laser treatment, total resolution was obtained in 72 (65. 5 %) patients. A second or third session followed in 30 out of 38 patients in which, the initial results were good, moderate, or poor. <b>The</b> parents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining eight children refused this second session and these patients excluded from the study Complications were seen in nine (8. 8 %) patients. One patient had postoperative bleeding which stopped spontaneously, while atrophic scars occurred in six (5. 8 %) patients, and hypertrophic scars in two (1. 9 %) patients. Conclusions Nd:YAG laser irradiation in conjunction with ice <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidermis produces <b>good</b> cosmetic results for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> cutaneous hemangiomas in children, and decreases <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> sessions for treatment of these lesions. </p...|$|R
