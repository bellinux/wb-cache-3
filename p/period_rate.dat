50|$|Wilkes-Barre/Scranton {{suffered}} {{their first}} {{loss of the}} season on October 25, falling 4-3 to the Binghamton Senators. The Penguins rallied from a 3-1 deficit {{in the third period}} to tie the game, bringing their third <b>period</b> <b>rate</b> of outscoring opponents to 17-4, but nevertheless lost in the shootout. Gibbons scored his fifth goal of the season and 14th point, making him the second-leading scorer in the league. The game marked the seventh consecutive game with the Penguins scoring at least three goals, but also the first in which they allowed a power play goal in the first period. Wilkes-Barre/Scranton saw their first regulation loss on October 26 in a 2-1 decision against the Norfolk Admirals. In contrast to their previously strong third periods, the Penguins gave up the tie-breaking goal, took three penalties and failed to capitalize on two power plays. Goalie Eric Hartzell, who had not played a game all season due to an injury, was assigned to ECHL's Wheeling Nailers on October 31.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new method of investment performance analysis, {{based on the}} recent approach of Average Internal Rate of Return (AIRR).

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that Scotland faces {{population}} ageing and decline that will have potentially serious economic and social consequences, and that the origin of these processes lie in its low and declining fertility rates. After considering alternatives to the total <b>period</b> <b>rate</b> measure of fertility, empirical evidence and theoretical argument about low fertility and its consequences is briefly reviewed. The paper argues that low fertility in general may not be the problem it is often purported to be, that Scotland has relatively high fertility, and that pro-natalist policies are neither desirable nor necessary. It suggests that low fertility and population ageing may be viewed as positive developments, and that within Europe, Scotland is distinguished more by its excess of early deaths than by any shortage of births.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between monetary policy operations and interbank borrowing and lending of funds using sovereign bonds as collateral.

Official funding conditions did not meaningfully constrain repo market activity in the 2003 - 05 period but, in the immediate precrisis <b>period,</b> <b>rate</b> increases led to a sharp contraction in repo activity. Focusing on the crisis period, we identify potentially benign substitution effects between official auctions and repo market activity but our empirical analysis shows that positive innovations in the cost of official funding, due to aggressive bidding, and a limited allotment response, encouraged increased use of the interbank repo market. The analysis informs a discussion of the merits of returning to variable rate operations...|$|E
