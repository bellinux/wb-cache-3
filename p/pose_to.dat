5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{is notable}} for its beach and mudflats, the danger they <b>pose</b> <b>to</b> {{individuals}} and shipping, {{and the efforts}} to which locals have gone in defending their town and preventing loss of life. Burnham {{is close to the}} estuary of the River Parrett where it flows into the Bristol Channel, which has the second highest tidal range in the world. At , it is second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E

5|$|Ingres was self-critical and {{consumed}} by self-doubt. He often took months {{to complete a}} portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a <b>pose</b> <b>to</b> best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are signed and dated. Ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.|$|E

5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general anesthesia would <b>pose</b> <b>to</b> her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
5|$|On her eighteenth birthday, Bella Swan {{wakes up}} from a dream, in which she sees herself as an old woman. She expresses her distaste about growing older than her boyfriend Edward Cullen, a human with vampire powers, who stopped aging {{physically}} at seventeen. Despite her lack of enthusiasm, Edward's adoptive family host Bella a birthday party. While unwrapping a gift, Bella receives a paper cut. Edward's brother, Jasper, becomes overwhelmed by the scent of Bella's blood, and attempts to attack her. Realizing the danger {{that he and his}} family <b>pose</b> <b>to</b> Bella, Edward ends their relationship, and the Cullens leave Forks, Washington.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity <b>pose</b> <b>to</b> itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There {{may also be the}} possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E
30|$|The threat <b>posed</b> <b>to</b> the away players by an {{antagonistic}} hometown {{crowd and}} the threat <b>posed</b> <b>to</b> players on both teams by a growing roster of injured teammates lead to a preponderant (though rational) concern with the opposing players rather than their teammates; and in both cases this concern {{is reinforced by the}} literature on attentional narrowing.|$|R

5|$|The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York. Tilden was {{considered}} a formidable adversary who, like Hayes, {{had a reputation for}} honesty. Also like Hayes, Tilden was a hard-money man and supported civil service reform. In accordance with the custom of the time, the campaign was conducted by surrogates, with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns. The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election. Both candidates focused their attention on the swing states of New York and Indiana, as well as the three southern states—Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida—where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled, amid recurring political violence. The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and, to a lesser extent, the danger a Democratic administration would <b>pose</b> <b>to</b> the recently won civil rights of southern blacks. Democrats, for their part, trumpeted Tilden's record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration.|$|E
5|$|Composer Yoshihiro Ike infused {{the music}} with the sorrow {{borne by the}} karas, and the {{atmosphere}} conveyed by the background. Ike obliged the team's request for Japanese flavored music, and studied kabuki tunes accompanying actors as they strike their , a picturesque <b>pose</b> <b>to</b> establish their character. He planned to use taikos (Japanese drums) to further enhance the music, but felt the show had taken on an international outlook and discarded the notion. He wanted his music to match {{the quality of the}} show, and refrained from composing them until he had watched the pre-dubbed version of the first episode. He composed most of his music as he watched the pre-dubbed episodes to synchronize their tempo and dynamics with the action in the show. He chose Prague Symphony Orchestra to perform the main theme because he felt the background of their city and its people suited the character of Karas. Other departments also took extraordinary measures in producing the show. The sound crew procured a Nissan Skyline GT-R and recorded its engine noise for several runs. These were used for the tunnel chase scenes which involved a hand-drawn 1972–77 Skyline. The editing team took the additional step of editing cels post-voice recording to ensure lip movements were in synch with the voices. These extra work and the hybrid 2D-3D approach inflated the budget of the production to three times the usual amount spent on an original video animation.|$|E
5|$|Following Germany's {{success in}} Europe with the Fall of France in 1940 the United Kingdom {{was unable to}} spare tank {{production}} for Australia, {{and as a result}} a program to produce tanks in Australia to equip forces in the Middle East was initiated. Concern about the likely entry of Japan into the war and the threat it would <b>pose</b> <b>to</b> vital sea lanes, as well as the possibility of an invasion of the Australian mainland, also provided impetus for local manufacture. The Australian tank program developed and produced two tank designs, a cruiser tank called the Sentinel, and the Thunderbolt. The Sentinel was the only tank to be produced in quantity in Australia. The few Sentinels that were built never saw action as Australia's armoured divisions had been equipped by that time with British and American tanks. Due to a lack of experience in tank design a mission was sent to the US to examine the M3 design and a British officer with many years tank design experience was provided by the United Kingdom. The design used existing parts where available from the M3, simplified where necessary to match the machining capacity present in Australia. The hull was cast as a single piece, as was the turret; a technique not used on the hull of any other tanks of the era.|$|E

25|$|In the Harry Potter series (1997–2007) {{the most}} {{prominent}} werewolf is Remus Lupin who's portrayed as struggling with his curse and terrified of infecting someone. The series also includes a werewolf villain Fenrir Greyback, who fits more with the older image of werewolves. The Potter books, while showing the intense threat the humans transformed to bloodthirsty monsters <b>pose</b> <b>to</b> the population, essentially use werewolves {{as a metaphor for}} marginalised groups who have been discriminated against in modern society.|$|E
25|$|While posing, a {{model is}} {{expected}} to remain essentially motionless, and usually remains silent. Exact requirements may vary depending upon the artist or instructor, but an experienced model will not speak, wriggle, scratch, or readjust during the <b>pose.</b> <b>To</b> accommodate the physical limitations, a schedule such as 20 to 25 minutes of posing, with five- or ten-minute breaks is observed. These breaks—during which the model usually wears a robe or puts on clothing—allow the model to stretch, relax and attend to other needs.|$|E
