5|$|The {{objectives}} of the assault were to inflict casualties and to draw German troops away from the 3rd Battle of Ypres, rather than to capture territory. The Canadian Corps executed an operation to capture Hill 70 and then establish defensive positions from which combined small-arms and artillery fire, some of which used the new technique of <b>predicted</b> <b>fire,</b> would repel German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible. The goals of the Canadian Corps were only partially accomplished; the Germans were prevented from transferring local divisions to the Ypres Salient but failed to draw in troops from other areas.|$|E
500|$|Bad weather {{led to the}} {{postponement}} of {{the attack}} on Hill 70 from late July until mid-August. In the interim, special companies of the Royal Engineers augmented the regular level of harassment by firing a total of [...] drums and [...] shells into Lens by 15 August. The artillery neutralized [...] of an estimated [...] batteries in the area by zero hour, partly with the technique of <b>predicted</b> <b>fire</b> for the first time, using datum points and calibrated guns, which greatly improved the accuracy of the artillery. Troops were rotated through the reserve area to conduct training and rehearsals in preparation for the assault. These obvious preliminary actions to an attack did not go unnoticed by the Germans, which made it impossible to conceal the First Army's general intentions or even, as it turned out, the date of the assault. The best that could be done was to attempt to mislead the Germans with respect to time and place. To this end I Corps staged exercises with dummy tanks on 14 August, directly west of Lens.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Cambrai {{began with}} a secret {{deployment}} of British reinforcements for the attack. Instead of {{a long period of}} artillery registration (firing ranging shots before the attack) and wire-cutting, which would have warned the German defence that an assault was being prepared, massed artillery-fire did not begin until the infantryâ€“tank advance began on 20 November, using unregistered (<b>predicted)</b> <b>fire.</b> The British sent [...] to roll through the [...] (Hindenburg Line) barbed-wire fields, as a substitute for a long wire-cutting bombardment and the ground assault was accompanied by a large number of ground-attack aircraft. The British attack broke through the [...] but was contained in the rear battlezone (...) by the , which had been built {{on the east side of}} the St Quentin canal on this part of the front. Preparations for a further advance were hampered by the obstacles of the Hindenburg defences, which had been crossed but which limited the routes by which the most advanced British forces could be supplied. The German defence quickly recovered and on 30 November began a counter-offensive, using a similar short bombardment, air attacks and storm troop infantry tactics, which was contained by the British, in some parts of the battlefield using the Hindenburg Line defences captured earlier.|$|E

We also tested whether and for which time of the day MSG SEVIRI derived land surface temperature (MSG SEVIRI LST) data can be used to <b>predict</b> forest <b>fire</b> occurrence. Results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve show that both NDVI and land surface temperature data have high predictive capacity for forest fire occurrence (AUC> 0. 5). Furthermore, our results of jacknife of regularized training gain for fire show that March NDVI data significantly <b>predict</b> <b>fires</b> that occur in August and September while April NDVI data significantly <b>predict</b> <b>fires</b> that occur in October and mid-day temperatures (1200 - 1300 pm) are important in <b>predicting</b> <b>fire</b> occurrence...|$|R

2500|$|The Royal Navy {{equipped}} the Tribal {{class with}} a comparatively heavy anti-aircraft armament; all eight 4.7in guns could engage aircraft with <b>predicted</b> <b>fire</b> using the FKC computer, and thus provide a powerful augmentation to the battle-fleet's AA defence. The close range AA armament of a quad 2pdr and two quad Vickers machine guns was a marked advance over previous destroyer classes and heavier than most other nations' close range destroyer armament in 1939. However, prewar, the Royal Navy assumed that destroyers would be acting mainly as escorts for the battle-fleet, {{and would not be}} the primary focus of aerial attack. Events soon showed that destroyers often functioned independently and so became the main target of Luftwaffe attack, especially by dive bombers. After the loss of Afridi and Gurkha, the remaining ships were taken in hand to improve the situation. Each ship's 'X' turret, which held a [...] mounting, was removed and replaced by a twin [...] gun QF Mark XVI on the mounting HA/LA Mark XIX. The mainmast was cut down and the rear funnel was lowered to improve the arcs of fire for the anti-aircraft weapons. As they became available, the more effective 20 mm Oerlikon guns were added, at first adding to and eventually replacing the [...]50 in./12.7 mm machine guns. Depth charge storage was also increased, from 30 to 46 charges. Furthermore, the class initially had problems with leaks in feedwater tanks; this was traced to issues with the turbine blades caused by structural stress when steaming at high speed in rough weather.|$|E

30|$|Many studies {{focused their}} {{interest}} on <b>predicting</b> <b>fire</b> risk based on antecedent weather or climate variables (Cohen and Deeming 1985, Renwick et al. 2007) highly related to fire occurrence. However, {{most of them}} based their predictions on meteorological variables. Hence, our findings are novel as they relate fire occurrence to the LFMC levels observed {{in one or two}} 8 -day periods before the fire, as well as seasonal and annual trends of LFMC variation. In addition, our results are extremely useful since they offer the possibility of <b>predicting</b> <b>fires</b> one or two weeks before the beginning of the event, allowing fire managers to have more time to plan their strategies.|$|R

The model aims to <b>predict</b> <b>fire</b> risk from weather parameters, and to detect smoke using video monitoring systems as smoke is the early sign of fire. Further, the fire danger index (FDI) provided by the prediction algorithm would be utilized to enhance the certainty of fire detection and reduce false alarm rates.

40|$|Fire {{is widely}} used in {{conservation}} management of native grasslands. Burning is often carried out under conditions that are marginal for sustained fire spread, and therefore {{it would be useful}} to be able to <b>predict</b> <b>fire</b> sustainability. There is currently no model allowing such prediction in temperate grasslands. This study aims to identify the environmental variables that determine whether fires will sustain in native grasslands in Tasmania, Australia, and develop a model for <b>predicting</b> <b>fire</b> sustainability in this vegetation. Fuel characteristics and weather conditions were recorded for 111 test fires. Logistic regression modeling identified dead fuel moisture content, fuel load, and percentage dead fuel as predictors of fire sustainability. Classification tree modeling identified dead fuel moisture and fuel load threshold values for sustaining fires. There was also evidence indicating a percentage dead fuel threshold. The logistic regression model and a model combining the results of the classification tree and the percentage dead fuel threshold accurately predicted the outcomes of a small set of experimental fires. These models are likely to have utility in <b>predicting</b> <b>fire</b> sustainability in Tasmanian grasslands and are also likely to be applicable to similar grasslands elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{complexity}} and relative short length of current <b>predicting</b> system for <b>fire</b> behavior, it is inappropriate to be referred for planning fire-fighting budgets of BC government due to the severe uncertainty of fire behavior across fire seasons. Therefore, a simple weather derived index for <b>predicting</b> <b>fire</b> frequency and burned area is developed in this paper to investigate the potential feasibility to <b>predict</b> <b>fire</b> behavior and fire-fighting expenses for the upcoming fire season using climate indexes. Linear regression models with spatial dummy variables are employed to estimate necessary coefficients that describe relationships across climate events, regional weather conditions, fire behavior and direct fire-fighting expenses {{in the interior of}} British Columbia; and Monte Carlo simulation are then used to predict future situations. We conclude that the BC government can use the last-year average solely, or together with January through April climate indexes for planning wildfire budgets for the upcoming fire season...|$|R
50|$|The need {{to engage}} targets at night, in depth, or hit the target {{with the first}} rounds led to <b>predicted</b> <b>fire</b> being quickly {{developed}} in World War I. <b>Predicted</b> <b>fire</b> existed alongside the older method. After World War II, predicted methods were invariably applied, but the fall of shot usually needed adjustment because of inaccuracy in locating the target, the proximity of friendly troops, or the need to engage a moving target. Target location errors were significantly reduced once laser rangefinders, orientation, and navigation devices were issued to observation parties.|$|E
50|$|Barrages {{remained}} {{in use in}} World War II and later, but only {{as one of a}} variety of artillery tactics made possible by improvements in <b>predicted</b> <b>fire,</b> target location and communications.

50|$|<b>Predicted</b> <b>fire</b> aims {{to achieve}} {{tactical}} surprise when {{the target is}} to be engaged by indirect fire. Gun laying is based on calculations of the range and azimuth of the target relative to the gun position, {{without the need for}} ranging shots (or adjusting) or even observation of the target. Ranging shots take time, and alert the enemy both to the presence and position of the guns, and to the likelihood of an attack. <b>Predicted</b> <b>fire</b> enables enemy artillery, strongpoints or troop concentrations to be struck without warning, often shortly before a friendly attack so as to leave no time for recovery, or engagement of targets hidden from observation by friendly forces. It can be used to plan any type of fire, including concentrations or the creeping barrages commonly used in World War I.|$|E

50|$|<b>Predicted</b> <b>fire</b> (originally called map shooting) is a {{tactical}} technique {{for the use}} of artillery, enabling it to fire for effect without alerting the enemy with ranging shots or a lengthy preliminary bombardment.

50|$|<b>Predicted</b> <b>fire</b> {{requires}} precise surveying {{of the gun}} {{position and}} accurate maps. Ideally all firing batteries will have been surveyed onto a common survey grid.

30|$|The {{ability to}} <b>predict</b> <b>fire</b> {{progression}} and area burned {{is crucial to}} mitigating the immediate and far-reaching consequences of wildfires. Existing studies have attempted to fill this gap, mainly through mathematical models (e.g. Rothermel 1972), but predictive techniques would enable decision makers to deal with large amount of data in a more timely manner. The Wildland Fire Management Research, Development & Application Organization (2012) proposed a wildland fire decision support tool called FSPro (Fire Spread Probability). FSPro is a geospatial probabilistic model that <b>predicts</b> <b>fire</b> growth, and is designed to support long-term (more than five days) decision making. FSPro addresses fire growth beyond the timeframes of reliable weather forecasts by using historic climatological data. FSPro calculates and maps the probability that fire will spread to areas on the landscape based on the current fire perimeter or ignition point.|$|R
