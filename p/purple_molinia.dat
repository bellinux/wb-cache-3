There are also areas of grassland and a secondary woodland of downy birch, Betula pubescens, with a groundcover of rush, bog mosses and <b>purple</b> moor-grass, <b>Molinia</b> caerulea. The importance of the site is the mire vegetation, which, of this type, is scarce in County Durham.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site is a}} set of five {{unimproved}} fields grazed by ponies, of a type once {{typical in}} the area, but now rare. The fields sit on Namurian sandstone and quartzite covered in Pleistocene boulder clay. The SSSI citation for Caeau Pant-y-Bryn specifies that the main feature is [...] "a large stand of <b>purple</b> moor-grass (<b>Molinia</b> caerulea) and meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum) Fen-meadow". A number of sedges and other plants are notable at the site, including: ...|$|R
5|$|The Moss {{contains}} several {{varieties of}} heather, {{as well as}} the <b>purple</b> moor grass <b>Molinia</b> caerulea. Ferns and gorse are common too, and in areas where peat has been cut in the past, there are bog mosses, the bog bean Menyanthus trifoliata, and marsh pennywort.|$|R
50|$|Between Boscaswell Cliffs and Clodgy Point {{the site}} is characterised {{by a number of}} wet flushes and an {{extensive}} area of mire at Boswednack. The flushes are dominated by <b>purple</b> moor-grass <b>Molinia</b> caerulea and typical species occurring here include cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix, tormentil Potentilla erecta, sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus and royal fern Osmunda regalis. Other species of note associated with the wet flushes include bog asphodel Narthecium ossifragum, the cottongrass Eriophorum angustifolium and pale butterwort Pinguicula lusitanica.

50|$|Sphagnum squarrosum, {{commonly}} known as the spiky bog-moss or spreading-leaved bog moss is a species of moss which grows in nutrient-rich, damp soil. Typical habitats include woodland, the banks of streams and ditches; it can even be found at high altitude in damp cirques. The species often grows near sedges (Carex), rushes (Juncus) or <b>purple</b> moor grass (<b>Molinia</b> caerulea).|$|R
50|$|In the {{community}} {{in the western part}} of the mire, Blunt-flowered Rush, <b>Purple</b> Moor-grass (<b>Molinia</b> caerulea) and Carnation Sedge (Carex panicea) are abundant species, and this part of the mire is characterised by the presence of a number of species which favour base-rich conditions. Black Bog-rush is locally abundant along a wet drainage ditch in this western part of the site. In the eastern part of the mire Purple Moor-grass and Blunt-flowered Rush are again abundant, but the abundant sedge species here are Lesser Pond-sedge (Carex acutiformis) and Greater Pond-sedge (Carex riparia). Common Reed (Phragmites australis) and Marsh Horsetail (Equisetum palustre) are also frequent. This part of the site supports plant species associated with more neutral conditions.|$|R
40|$|It is {{the first}} record of this species in Hungary. new species {{was added to the}} list of the Hungarian {{avifauna}} on the 18 th of July, 2006, when the first individual of the Zitting Cisticola (Cisticola juncidis Rafinesque, 1810) was recor-ded at Lake Kolon (46 º 48 ’N, 19 º 20 ’E). At a dry-ing swamp meadow (Molinion coeruleae) the un-mistakable zitting song of a male Zitting Cisticola was heard.

5000|$|Woolmer Forest {{straddles}} two upland watersheds, {{that of the}} River Wey {{and that}} of the River Rother. In its sandy soil, streams have cut wide valleys into the gently undulating terrain. On upland sites, dry heath predominates, characterised by heather Calluna vulgaris and bell heather Erica cinerea. The driest sandy patches support some well-adapted (xeric) uncommon plants. Humid heath, which requires less free-draining subsoils, is characterized by cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and <b>purple</b> moor-grass <b>Molinia</b> caerulea, which are joined in the wettest valley bottoms by sphagnum moss and carnivorous sundews. These moisture-retaining habitats grade into complex acidic boggy wetlands of hummocks and pools, locally called [...] "mires". Here are the largest populations in England of the trailing bog cranberry Vaccinium oxycoccos.|$|R
5000|$|The site {{supports}} a [...] "very {{large number of}} plant species" [...] on the wetter fen areas. Dominant species tend to be black bog rush Schoenus nigricans, saw sedge Cladium mariscus and <b>purple</b> moor grass <b>Molinia</b> caerulea, with species such as fen orchid Dactylorchis praetermissa, devil’s bit scabious Succisa pratensis, long-stalked yellow sedge Carex lepidocarpa, quaking grass Briza media, parnassus Parnassia palustris {{and a number of}} rare mosses also found in these areas.|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{afforested}} {{portion of}} the site comprises relatively young conifer trees under which there still exists a bog flora, albeit modified and species-poor. A substantial area of high quality, uplanted blanket bog also occurs within the site and this area contains many large pools. The bog vegetation is generally dominated by <b>purple</b> moor-grass (<b>Molinia</b> caerulea) and black bog-rush (Schoenus nigricans) while the blanket bog pools are characterised by a sparse flora which includes bog bean (Menyanthes trifoliata), many-stemmed spike-rush (Eleocharis multicaulis) and pipewort (Eriocaulon aquaticum). The European distribution of this latter species is confined to lakes and pools in lowland blanket bog areas of Ireland and western Scotland. This area of bog has also a well- developed Sphagnum cover including some large hummocks of Sphagnum imbricatum and S. fuscum.|$|R
50|$|Wooded {{areas of}} Billsmoor Park support alder (Alnus glutinosa) with some hazel (Corylus avellana) on lower lying wet soils, and an {{undergrowth}} of soft rush (Juncus effusus), {{tufted hair grass}} (Deschampsia cespitosa), wood-sedge (Carex sylvatica), greater-tussock sedge (C. paniculata) and pendulous sedge (C. pendula). Birch is found on steeper sections of the valley. Above the woodlands, open areas of the site support bracken and occasional birch, with grassland composed of mat grass (Nardus stricta), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) and common bent (Agrostis capillaris). In very wet areas of the site, mire vegetation arises, including bog myrtle (Myrica gale), broad-leaved cottongrass (Eriophorum latifolium), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris) and <b>purple</b> moor-grass (<b>Molinia</b> caerulea) and, around springs, yellow pimpernel (Lysimachia nemorum), bugle (Ajuga reptans) and water mint (Mentha aquatica).|$|R
50|$|In the {{southern}} part of the site the land slopes gently eastwards within a draining gully system; the head of the stream West End Brook flows through here. On the northern part of the site a former gravel pit, now partially infilled after it was abandoned in the early 1980s, has developed into a mosaic of shallow pools, also supporting a large pond, some heathland and scrub. The area supports many wetland plants including bulrush Typha latifolia, common spike-rush Eleocharis palustris, as well as a locally scarce species marsh speedwell Veronica scutellata. The heathland and scrub areas are predominantly populated by heather Calluna vulgaris and are slowly being colonised by birch. Surrounding land comprises typically of secondary birch woodland with some heathland. There is also a small valley bog where <b>purple</b> moor-grass <b>Molinia</b> caerulea is particularly abundant.|$|R
25|$|The {{bush and}} shrublands, which {{characterize}} {{the remainder of}} the spaces (74% of the park), are dominated by dwarf (Ulex minor) and European (Ulex europaeus) gorse and heather (Erica umbellata and Calluna vulgaris), with a mixtures of common juniper (Juniperus communis), southern heather (Erica australis) in the upper altitudes, while lower altitude bush includes cross-leaved heather (Erica tetralix), dwarf gorse (Ulex minor), Dorset heath (Erica ciliaris), common sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), pale butterwort (Pinguicula lusitanica), marsh violet (Viola palustris) and <b>purple</b> moor grass (<b>Molinia</b> caerulea).|$|R
