5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As {{shown in figure}} 4, after an atomic exchange event the adatom has taken {{the place of a}} surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom. This <b>process</b> <b>may</b> take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate {{due to the fact that}} both atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination throughout the process.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas.

In this paper we study the set agreement problem and the weakest failure detector L used to solve it in asynchronous message passing systems where <b>processes</b> <b>may</b> crash and recover, with homonyms (i. e., <b>processes</b> <b>may</b> have equal identities) and without a complete initial knowledge of the membership. ...|$|R
5|$|In April 2011, the ESRB {{introduced}} a streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable {{games as a}} way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games. Rather than having raters review each product, publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this <b>process</b> <b>may</b> be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for mobile apps.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} <b>process</b> <b>may</b> be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{varieties}} of short-period comet: Jupiter-family comets (those with semi-major axes of less than 5AU) and Halley-family comets. Halley-family comets, named for their prototype, Halley's Comet, are unusual in that although they are short-period comets, it is hypothesized that their ultimate origin lies in the Oort cloud, not in the scattered disc. Based on their orbits, it is suggested they were long-period comets that were captured by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and sent into the inner Solar System. This <b>process</b> <b>may</b> have also created the present orbits of a significant fraction of the Jupiter-family comets, although the majority of such comets are thought to have originated in the scattered disc.|$|E

5|$|Those {{cells that}} {{recognize}} coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, {{as the name}} suggests, interact with the Fc region of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will phagocytose, mast cells and neutrophils will degranulate, natural killer cells will release cytokines and cytotoxic molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) – this <b>process</b> <b>may</b> explain the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies used in biological therapies against cancer. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole <b>process</b> <b>may</b> {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The <b>process</b> <b>may</b> be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M+), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M2) and alkali metal anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E

5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the <b>process</b> <b>may</b> begin again.|$|E
