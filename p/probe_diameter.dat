40|$|The {{assessment}} of manufactured surfaces by coordinate metrology techniques {{has changed in}} recent years. Speed, accuracy and flex-ibility have all improved {{with the introduction of}} coordinate measuring machines (CMM). However, some technical problems have yet to be solved, in particular those pertaining to freelform surfaces. This paper considers the influence of surface features and probe tip geometry on the {{assessment of}} freelform surfaces. Inaccurate measurements due to the problems of <b>probe</b> tip <b>diameter</b> and undulating surface curvature have been investigated, and a simple mathematical compensation technique for different <b>probe</b> <b>diameters</b> and an adaptive measuring point planning strategy have been developed. Experimental data confirm that the measuring errors are significantly reduced when the <b>probe</b> tip <b>diameter</b> compensation approach'is used. The problems of machined surface measurement have also been considered and a method, namely least-squares data fitting, is proposed to give a better qualgying technique for the cusped surfaces. This new technique has been implemented and the results from the case study indicate that the least-squares method can give a more precise representation of the quality of a machined surface than standard statistical measurement systems. Experimentation also indicates that the results of the least-squares data fitting method are consistent with the C M M computed values, which verifies the reliability of the method.

30|$|Preloading-based needle {{insertion}} {{was conducted}} with three preloading <b>probe</b> <b>diameters</b> (10, 15, and 20  mm) with a concave shape. They were alternately attached during the experiments to compare the geometry effect of the preloading probe (Figure  2 c). During the preloading phase, the preloading probe pressed the hog breast toward the tumor lesion. The probe pressed the breast at 4  mm/s as the probe axis was adjusted {{to the center of}} the tumor lesion using the camera information of tumor position. We stopped the preloading when the reaction force reached 2.0  N. We previously compared insertion accuracy with different loading forces and suggested 2.0  N as the appropriate pressing force that would enhance robustness in insertion accuracy [28]. After the preloading phase, we moved to the needle insertion phase. We inserted the needle at a constant velocity of 4  mm/s. During the needle insertion phase, the needle direction did not change. Insertion stopped when the tumor position and needle tip were closest. Again, we measured the force loaded on the needle, the tumor position, and the needle tip position to determine the placement error. For each of the three <b>probes</b> of different <b>diameters,</b> four trial insertions were performed on four hog breast samples at two different tumor depths (total of 96 trials).

This paper describes the effects of <b>probe</b> <b>diameter</b> on the optimum friction stir welding conditions of 5456 -H 116 alloy for leisure ship, measured by a tensile test. In friction stir welding using a <b>probe</b> <b>diameter</b> of 5 mm under various travel and rotation speed conditions, the best performance was achieved with a travel speed of 61 mm/min. Using a <b>probe</b> <b>diameter</b> of 6 mm, rotation speeds of 170 – 210 rpm, and a travel speed of 15 mm/min produced a rough surface and voids because of insufficient heat input produced by the low rotation speed. At 500 – 800 rpm, chips were observed, although there were no voids, and the weld surface was excellent. However, at 1100 – 2500 rpm, many chips were produced due to excessive heat input. Heat effects were very evident on the bottom. For a travel speed of 15 mm/min, heat input caused by friction increased as the rotation speed increased. The mechanical characteristics were degraded by accelerated softening due to increasing heat input...|$|E

30|$|Definition of the cost/benefit {{ratio is}} also {{paramount}} {{for the ultimate}} launch in the market of a competitive experimental product. Simple commercial considerations lead {{to the idea that}} utilization of bentonitic grouts doped at 10 % with graphite powder probably does not satisfy the cost/benefit ratio. Following evaluations have been, therefore, conducted considering only the bentonitic mixture with 5 % of graphite powder as additive. Pure graphite powder has rather elevated commercial cost, estimable in 0.0035  €/gm throughout the European market at the retail level. However, industrial supply of graphite powder may reasonably undergo to favorable discount up to 30 – 40 % depending on the requested amounts. The additional cost due to the graphite powder additive can be, therefore, estimable in ca. 1000 – 1200  € per ton of bentonitic grout. Principal benefits resulting from the improved thermal conductivity of the bentonitic mixture are consequent in sizing of the total thermal exchange surface between the geothermal probes and the subsoil, which is quantifiable taking into account the <b>probe</b> cross-section (<b>diameter)</b> and its total length (function of linear meters of perforation). Abatement of costs are, therefore, due to considerable reduction of the amount of bentonitic grout used to seal the borehole, in a way that: (1) fixing the borehole depth, the probe cross-section can be reduced (common <b>probes</b> <b>diameters</b> are 20, 25, 32 and 40  mm); (2) fixing the probe cross-section, the final depth of perforation can be shortened. In the former instance, savings principally come from lower costs of perforation, geothermal probes and their related cables/hoses, whereas in the latter chiefly from reduction of linear meters of the boreholes.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of seed {{moisture}} content, <b>probe</b> <b>diameter</b> and loading velocity (puncture conditions) on some mechanical properties of almond kernel and peeled almond kernel is considered to model {{a relationship between the}} puncture conditions and rupture energy. Furthermore, distribution of the mechanical properties is determined. The main objective is to determine the critical values of mechanical properties significant for peeling machines. The response surface methodology was used to find the relationship between the input parameters and the output responses, and the fitness function was applied to measure the optimal values using the genetic algorithm. Two-parameter Weibull function was used to describe the distribution of mechanical properties. Based on the Weibull parameter values, i. e. shape parameter (β) and scale parameter (η) calculated for each property, the mechanical distribution variations were completely described and it was confirmed that the mechanical properties are rule governed, which makes the Weibull function suitable for estimating their distributions. The energy model estimated using response surface methodology shows that the mechanical properties relate exponentially to the moisture, and polynomially to the loading velocity and <b>probe</b> <b>diameter,</b> which enabled successful estimation of the rupture energy (R²= 0. 94). The genetic algorithm calculated the critical values of seed moisture, <b>probe</b> <b>diameter,</b> and loading velocity to be 18. 11 % on dry mass basis, 0. 79 mm, and 0. 15 mm/min, respectively, and optimum rupture energy of 1. 97 · 10 -³ J.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{characteristics of the}} circular muscle of the human lower esophageal sphincter and esophagus were studied in subjects with competent and incompetent sphincters. Pressure-diameter curves were constructed by producing various degrees of circumferential stretch with pressure-measuring probes of increasing diameter. The circumferential membrane tension (force of closure) and the circumferential stress (muscle tension) of the circular muscle layer were also calculated from these data. The pressure-diameter curves of competent and incompetent sphincters were different in magnitude and shape. Incompetent sphincters had lower pressures at all diameters, with pressure gradually increasing with larger <b>probe</b> <b>diameter.</b> In contrast for competent sphincters the pressure was highest near closure, with an initial decline and then an increase in pressure with increasing <b>probe</b> <b>diameter.</b> Both shape and magnitude of pressure-diameter curves of competent and incompetent sphincters were interchangeable when manipulated by pharmacologic agents. Urecholine increased the pressures and changed the incompetent pressure-diameter curve to the levels of the competent sphincter; conversely. Pro-Banthine decreased pressures and changed {{the shape of the}} competent pressure-diameter curve to the levels of the incompetent sphincter. Force of closure and circular muscle tension curves of competent and incompetent sphincters were similar in shape but were higher at all diameters for competent sphincters.
