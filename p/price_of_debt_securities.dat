40|$|Credit Rating Agencies play a {{key role}} in European capital markets today, {{publishing}} ratings on the creditworthiness <b>of</b> issuers/issues <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities.</b> Independent, objective and internationally consistent credit ratings raise the integrity, transparency and competitiveness of capital markets, lower the costs of capital for issuers and contribute to investor protection. Moreover, ratings are widely used by investors as a guide to the creditworthiness of the issuers <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> and in financial covenants. As a result, credit rating agencies play a major role not only in the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities,</b> but also in the regulatory process. It may well happen, in fact, that regulators co-opt rating agencies as information-producing agents for regulatory purposes. In this way, when ratings serve not just as a tool for investors but become the very foundation for regulation, they become extremely powerful, and as a consequence, the risk that conflicts of interest will arise becomes much sharper...|$|R

40|$|The {{philosophy}} {{behind the}} debt market discipline approach to banking regulation presumes that the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>debt</b> <b>securities,</b> if accurate, conveys reliable signals to supervisors.

The paper proposes a quantile regression framework to draw novel inferences about the functioning of market discipline {{and the quality of}} private monitoring in European banking and provides a more comprehensive picture of the distribution of spreads conditional on its main explanatory factors.

50|$|The Panic of 1792 was a {{financial}} credit crisis {{that occurred during}} the months of March and April 1792, precipitated by the expansion of credit by the newly formed Bank of the United States as well as by rampant speculation on the part of William Duer, Alexander Macomb, and other prominent bankers. Duer, Macomb, and their colleagues attempted to drive up <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> US <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> and bank stocks, but when they defaulted on loans, prices fell, causing a bank run. Simultaneous tightening of credit by the Bank of the United States served to heighten the initial panic. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton was able to deftly manage the crisis by providing banks across the Northeast with {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to make open-market purchases of securities, which allowed the market to stabilize by May 1792.|$|R

We find that credit ratings are negatively related {{to the presence of}} antitakeover measures for firms with speculative grade ratings and positively related to the presence of antitakeover measures for firms with investment grade ratings. Moreover, we find that spreads are positively related to the presence of antitakeover measures, and this relation is significantly stronger for firms with less than investment grade credit ratings. Our findings also suggest that more stable boards, defined as having attributes relating to board tenure, director liability indemnification and classified board structures are related to higher credit ratings and lower bond spreads. We conjecture that boards with greater stability may be better positioned to take into consideration the longer term interests of the firm as a whole, thus benefiting the firm’s creditors...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend toward}} {{incorporating}} information derived from financial markets {{into the bank}} supervision process has gained momentum {{over the past several}} years. This in part reflects an evolution in the thinking about how private market information can contribute to the process. In light of the evolving view of the potential contributions of market information, this paper reviews the empirical evidence relevant to the usefulness of financial market information in the bank supervision process. This paper reviews the research on what information can be gleaned from the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> equity and <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> issued by banking organizations. The weight of the research leaves little room for doubt that financial market signals reflect underlying bank risk and that market evaluations of the risk of individual banking organizations are strongly correlated with supervisory findings. The evidence {{on the extent to which}} market signals can augment the information set of bank supervisors is more subtle, but overall it demonstrates that financial market signals should play a role in the bank supervision process. 1...|$|R
40|$|As {{long as one}} {{security}} is classified into AFS category, I document that banks strategically time the recognitions of gains and losses on AFS securities to smooth earnings, to meet earnings targets, to reduce regulatory costs, or to facilitate seasonal equity offering. These evidences collaborate with my previous results that banks prefer classifying credit risky securities into AFS rather than into trading category. Finally, I investigate market reactions to fair value changes on AFS securities and to trading revenues from trading assets. I show that trading revenues are more persistent, with greater value relevance, and drive more significant stock returns. This evidence indicates that artificially classifying securities which are held for trading purpose into AFS category may have negative impacts on firm values. Given the investment decisions made by the managers, the second issue studied in this thesis is the financial reporting decisions made by banks. To elaborate, banks have discretions to classify the <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> into available-for-sale (AFS) category vs. trading category depending on {{the purpose of the}} holding, while the classification decisions have very different impacts on firms' income statement. Therefore, I study how accounting treatments of AFS and trading category and their different impacts on firms' income statements affect reporting decisions. I find banks inclined to classify credit-riskier securities into AFS rather than into trading category, when banks have weak interest revenues, have high level of income-increasing discretional accruals, have concentrated assets, or have high level of risky assets. But I do not find classification decision is related to bank's capital adequacy ratio. Keywords: Bank holding companies; <b>debt</b> <b>security</b> investments; managerial compensation; trading assets; available-for-sale; SFAS 115; gains trading. This study examines U. S. banks' investment behaviors as well as their financial reporting decisions on <b>debt</b> <b>security</b> investments. Particularly, I focus on two separate but related issues. The first issue examined is whether and how managerial incentives, influenced by the compensation contracts, affect managers' investment decisions on <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> in the U. S. banking industry. Using a sample composed of top 1, 000 bank holding companies from 2001 to 2009, I find that managers, when their wealth is more sensitive to stock return volatility, tend to structure the firms' debt investments with a higher proportion of credit risky securities. Provided that <b>price</b> <b>of</b> credit risky <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> slumped during the recent financial crisis, that empirical evidence is consistent with the view that managerial compensation may induce excess risk-taking in the U. S. banking industry. The finding is relevant to both researchers and practitioners when they consider restructuring bankers' compensation. Zhou, Chunquan. Advisers: Woody Y. W. Wu; Danqing Young.

40|$|In this paper, we analyze data on trends since 2000 {{in foreign}} {{holdings}} of government <b>securities</b> and other <b>debt</b> <b>securities,</b> {{with emphasis on}} Japan and developing Asia. We find that foreign residents generally increased their holdings <b>of</b> Asian <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> during the sample period and in particular during the post-global financial crisis (GFC) period. Meanwhile, foreign holdings <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> have been declining in the eurozone. Foreign holdings <b>of</b> short-term <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> were very volatile during the GFC period (20092 ̆ 01311), with {{a sharp drop in}} foreign holdings <b>of</b> short-term Asian <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> that was followed by a renewed surge. Our empirical analysis suggests that despite the increase in foreign holdings <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> its share is still far lower than the optimal portfolio warranted by the capital asset pricing market theory. In other words, foreign investors 2 ̆ 019 home bias is still strong. The overall increase in foreign holdings <b>of</b> Asian <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> appears to be driven by relatively stable exchange rates and the higher risk-adjusted returns on the <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>of</b> the region.

40|$|In this paper, we {{find that}} home bias is still present in all economies and regions, {{especially}} in the case <b>of</b> short-term <b>debt</b> <b>securities,</b> but that there are substantial variations among economies and regions in the strength of home bias, with the Eurozone economies, the US, and developing Asia showing relatively weak home bias and advanced Asia, especially Japan, showing relatively strong home bias. We then examine trends over time in foreign holdings <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> and find that capital has been flowing from the US and the Eurozone economies to both advanced Asia (especially Japan) and developing Asia and that foreign holdings <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> have been increasing in advanced as well as developing Asia but for different reasons. The main reason in the case of advanced Asia (especially Japan) appears to be higher riskadjusted returns, whereas the main reason in the case of developing Asia appears to be the growth <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> markets combined with relatively weak home bias and (in the case of short-term securities) lower exchange rate volatility. Finally, {{we find that}} since the Global Financial Crisis, foreign holdings <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> have declined (i. e., that home bias has strengthened) in all economies and regions except developing Asia, where they have increased (except for a temporary decline in 2008) but where their share is still much lower than the optimal share warranted by the capital asset pricing market model...|$|R
