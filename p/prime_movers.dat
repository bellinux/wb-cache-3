5|$|M34 Prime Mover – M34 <b>Prime</b> <b>Movers</b> {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling towed {{artillery}} into place. It was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of towed loads, and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary 2 {{is not a}} {{steamship}} {{like many}} of her predecessors, but is powered primarily by four diesel engines, with two additional gas turbines used when extra power is required; this integrated electric propulsion configuration is used to produce the power to drive her four electric propulsion pods as well as powering the ship's hotel services. The spaces for these <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> are also split, and controls are also backed up, {{with the intention of}} preventing a single failure from disabling the ship.|$|E
5|$|Under the April 1942 organization, each {{infantry}} battalion had an anti-tank platoon {{with four}} 37mm guns (1/4 ton trucks, {{better known as}} jeeps, were authorized as <b>prime</b> <b>movers)</b> and each regiment an anti-tank company with twelve (towed by 3/4 ton trucks). Each of the four divisional artillery battalions possessed six anti-tank guns, the combat engineering battalion had nine pieces (towed by M2 halftracks); in addition, the division's headquarters company had four (towed by 3/4ton trucks) and the divisional maintenance company two.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Eddy was a Massachusetts-born {{resident}} of Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, where the fort was located. He and John Allan, {{both of whom}} served in the provincial assembly, were the <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> of Patriot activity in the area, {{which was one of}} several hotbeds of agitation in Nova Scotia. The other major areas of Patriot activity were Maugerville in the St. John River valley of Sunbury County (present-day New Brunswick), and Cobequid, and there were also pockets of activity in Pictou and the Passamaquoddy Bay area, which separates present-day Maine and New Brunswick. Patriots in these communities were in contact with each other, and those of Cumberland and Maugerville were active in trying to interest nearby natives (Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi'kmaq) in their cause.|$|E
5|$|The basic prototypes of the M32 {{were created}} by Lima Locomotive on January 11, 1943. The prototypes were labeled T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and T5E4. These designs competed against the T2 and T7 designs, which both had a turret mounted boom, at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The T5 was {{declared}} superior to the T2 and T7 designs after several weeks of testing. The four prototypes were sent to Aberdeen (T5 and T5E1), Camp Hood (T5E2), and Camp Seely (T5E4). However, during the testing the T5E3's engine was damaged, so it could not go through further testing. OCM 21553 standardized the designs of the T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and the T5E4 as the M32, M32E1, M32E2, M32E3, and the M32E4 in June 1943. This protocol also terminated the T7 project. However, the M32E4 did not enter production. Many M32s were converted into M34 <b>Prime</b> <b>Movers,</b> which were used to tow heavy artillery. The M34s were unarmed, and had special equipment to pull heavy artillery.|$|E
5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM <b>prime</b> <b>movers,</b> are noticeably louder.|$|E

5000|$|A speed {{reference}} as {{percentage of}} actual speed {{is set in}} this mode. As the generator is loaded from no load to full load, the actual speed of the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> tends to decrease. In order to increase the power output in this mode, the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> speed reference is increased. Because the actual <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> speed is fixed by the grid, this difference in speed reference and actual speed of the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> is used to increase the flow of working fluid (fuel, steam, etc.) to the <b>prime</b> <b>mover,</b> and hence power output is increased. The reverse will be true for decreasing power output. The <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> speed reference is always greater than actual speed of the <b>prime</b> <b>mover.</b> The actual speed of the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> is allowed to [...] "droop" [...] or decrease {{with respect to the}} reference, and so the name.|$|R
25|$|<b>Prime</b> <b>movers</b> and tankers had 10.00x22 size tires, while bridge, crane, and semi-tractor trucks had 14.00x20s with {{a larger}} cross-section. All had dual rear tires. Brakes were full air with drum brakes on all wheels. <b>Prime</b> <b>movers</b> had {{adjustable}} electrical brake connections for trailer brakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} did {{not improve}} much after the war. The <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> were in constant need of repairs and spare parts were scarce, {{and most of the}} time no more than one of the units was in revenue service. They were taken out of service in April 1951 and the district asked that new <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> be delivered before they be taken back into use. NSB's board approved this and new Hercules <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> were installed. Unit 823 completed it retrofitting on 21 November 1953. The other two received the upgrade on 9 April and 10 June 1954, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe dissertation constitutes the first detailed theoretical and experimental {{investigation of a}} thermoacoustic <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> with periodic boundary conditions. There are five significant aspects to this research: (1) using DeltaE to analyze an annular <b>prime</b> <b>mover,</b> (2) developing an entirely new analysis program using MATLAB, (3) designing, building, and experimentally investigating a single stack, annular <b>prime</b> <b>mover,</b> (4) experimentally investigating a constricted, single stack annular <b>prime</b> <b>mover,</b> (5) predicting {{the performance of a}} two stack annular <b>prime</b> <b>mover.</b> The major conclusions are: (1) A single stack annular <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> will not reach onset because the eigenmodes of the system do not support thermoacoustic growth. (2) A constricted annular <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> will reach onset because the constriction forces dominating boundary conditions that alter the eigenmodes. (3) A two stack <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> is predicted to reach onset because one of the eigenmodes of the symmetric system does support thermoacoustics[URL] Republic of China Arm...|$|R
50|$|In engineering, a <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> is {{an engine}} that {{converts}} fuel to useful work. In locomotives, the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> is thus {{the source of}} power for its propulsion.

25|$|Trial revenue {{services}} commenced in February 1946 on the Bergen Line from Oslo to Geilo. After a month {{there were}} {{issues with the}} pinions, causing them {{to have to be}} replaced. The unit continued on the Geilo service until September. By then the roller bearings in the prime mover's big ends were sufficiently weakened that they were causing engines to malfunction. Low standards caused by wartime manufacturing combined with dust and rust in the engines through four years of storage required a major clean-up of the <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> before they could be returned to service. The <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> were manufactured in 1939 and their big ends had to be replaced with sleve bearings to improve reliability.|$|E
50|$|In a diesel-mechanical locomotive, the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> is {{the diesel}} engine that is {{mechanically}} coupled to the driving wheels (drivers). In a diesel-electric locomotive, the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> is the diesel engine that rotates the main generator responsible for producing electricity {{to power the}} traction motors that are geared to the drivers. The <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> {{can also be a}} gas turbine instead of a diesel engine. In either case, the generator, traction motors and interconnecting apparatus are considered to be the power transmission system and not part of the <b>prime</b> <b>mover.</b> A wired-electric or battery-electric locomotive has no on-board <b>prime</b> <b>mover,</b> instead relying on an external power station.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{the design of}} a {{toroidal}} <b>prime</b> <b>mover.</b> The primary design tool is a MATLAB program based on a standing wave analysis of thermoacoustics. A conventional <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> that has been well studied, was used for validating the program. DeltaE, a program developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for designing thermoacoustic engines, was also used as an auxiliary tool for validation test purposes. The validation suggested that the MATLAB program models the onset conditions of a conventional <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> with fair accuracy. The program was then applied to a toroidal <b>prime</b> <b>mover.</b> A series of analyses were conducted on a toroidal <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> to determine the influence of <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> circumference, stack length, and duct radius. The final design calls for a 150 cm circumference, 2. 54 cm duct radius, and 1. 9 cm stack length. The contributions of this thesis are: (1) to develop and validate the MATLAB simulation program; (2) to provide a draft design for a toroidal <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> for future research.

40|$|Reaching {{movements}} are initiated by {{activity of the}} <b>prime</b> <b>mover,</b> i. e. the first activated arm muscle. We aimed to investigate the relationship between <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> activity and kinematics of reaching in typically developing (TD) infants in supine and sitting position. Fourteen infants were assessed at 4 and 6 months during reaching in supine and supported sitting. Kinematics and EMG-activity of deltoid, pectoralis major, biceps (BB) and triceps brachii were recorded. Kinematic analysis focused on number of movement units (MUs) and transport MU (MU with longest duration). <b>Prime</b> <b>mover</b> use was variable, but at 6 months a dominance of BB emerged in both testing conditions. Kinematics were also variable, but with increasing age the number of MU decreased and the relative proportion of the transport MU increased. BB as <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> at 6 months was related to a larger transport MU. Conclusion: Between 4 and 6 months BB <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> dominance emerges which is related to relatively efficient reaching characteristics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
