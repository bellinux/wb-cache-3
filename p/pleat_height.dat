40|$|Pleated {{membrane}} cartridge {{filters are}} used extensively throughout a typical bioprocess. They {{are exposed to}} a range of operating conditions and feedstocks. Discrepancies between the performance of the flat sheet membrane and pleated membrane have previously been identified, although little has been done to fully characterise the effects of pleating. As current scale-up techniques use the flat sheet membrane to predict the performance of the large-scale pleated cartridge, the discrepancy in performance between flat sheet and pleated cartridge leads to inaccuracy in scale-up. This inaccuracy is accounted for by over-sizing of the equipment. In turn this reduces the efficiency of the bioprocess and increases capital costs. At the present time no accurate and reliable scale-up methodology exists that accounts for the effects of pleating. A systematic investigation into the effect of pleating has been conducted. By varying the key pleat characteristics: <b>pleat</b> <b>height,</b> type and packing density, the impact upon cartridge performance of these characteristics has been determined. Using this knowledge, new scale-down cartridge filters have been developed, fabricated and tested. When faced with both clean water and a pepsin protein solution, performance was within 10...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to combine {{numerical}} and experimental approaches to evaluate the influence of pleat geometrical parameters on the pressure drop and air velocity field at the vicinity of pleated fibrous filters. For a given filter, three different geometrical pleat configurations (with various <b>pleat</b> <b>heights</b> and widths) are investigated at similar filtration velocities. Numerical simulations are validated based on experimental measurements in terms of pressure drop versus filtration velocity, and enable the influence of the filter geometry on the air flow pattern in its vicinity to be investigated. The influence of filter geometry on the pressure drop is evaluated from experiments carried out in a lab-scale air handling unit. For this purpose, pleated filter prototypes were designed in the laboratory...|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Dalton {{took office}} he {{appointed}} Metford Watkins as Director of Civilian Clothing as the Board of Trade. Watkins, {{aware of the}} high price of clothes at the time, promised to introduce cheaper clothes via 'austerity' provisions but not, as had been done during the First World War, using standardisation. Shortly after the government announced the production of 'national footwear'. The austerity provisions governed exactly what could or could not be used in the manufacture of clothes and shoes (for example, number of buttons, <b>pleats</b> or pockets, <b>height</b> of heels, amount of lace or embroidery, no turn-ups on trousers and no double-breasted suits).|$|R
40|$|Asset {{protection}} {{in the form of}} fluid filtration makes up an ever-increasing part of the civilized and industrialized world. Fluid filtration applications in the conditioned environment and life sciences are affording the worldâ€™s population a chance to better realize their potential, while industrial applications help ensure that high demand processes can be carried out safely, reliably, and effectively. In the present work, a tool has been developed, using the computational fluid dynamics package FLUENT, to allow the designer to better predict the magnitude of geometric imperfections within a given pleat configuration. Pleated rectangular filters, intended {{to improve the quality of}} air for human occupants, with a U-shaped pleat form have been chosen as the focus of this study. A simulation study is developed to investigate the maximum local velocity normal to the filtration surface and to characterize the magnitude of the pleatwise velocity distribution across a range of pleated geometries and flow conditions. The geometry of the U-shaped pleat form can be characterized by, amongst other parameters, the width of the pleat channel, the overall height of the individual pleat, as well as the thickness of the filtration medium. The various geometries of the current study were developed by changing the width of the pleat channel, as well as the channel height, while keeping the medium thickness constant throughout. Changing the width of the pleat channel allows the designer to achieve varying pleat densities, expressed as a number of pleats along a one inch section of the overall pleated pack. Pleat densities of 6. 5, 7, 7. 5, 8, and 8. 5 pleats per inch are considered in the current study. <b>Pleat</b> <b>heights</b> of 1. 0, 0. 75, and 0. 50 inches are also investigated in the current study. Furthermore, the filter velocity can be characterized by the free stream velocity at the face of the filter pack, termed the face velocity, and by the velocity of the fluid at the interface with the filtration medium, referred to as media velocity. In the present work, the face velocity was adjusted in each case to achieve the desired media velocities across the study, which are 10. 5, 9. 0, 7. 5, and 6. 0 feet per minute. In an effort to more clearly communicate the results of the study, the results are presented in the form of a non-dimensionalized plots which present the designer with a way to quickly gauge the effect of pleat geometry on maximum velocity. Additionally, two tools are presented to aid the designer in more accurately predicting the maximum filtration velocity. These tools are then evaluated for effectiveness using the method of absolute relative percent error. The assumption of uniform flow through the filtration media leads to an average absolute relative percent error of 27 %. The first tool the reader is presented with is a simple correction factor which predicts the maximum filtration velocity with an average absolute relative percent error of 10 % over the study domain. The second tool, which takes a slightly more complicated y-intercept form, characterizes the maximum filtration velocity as a function of average velocity and aspect ratio. This approach further reduces the average absolute relative percent error to 4 %. The results of the simulation herein are successfully employed to develop a set of simple yet effective tools that allow the filter designer to more accurately predict maximum velocities through a pleated air filter...|$|R
