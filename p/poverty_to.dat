5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. In most {{instances}} the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, A Warning to the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by <b>poverty</b> <b>to</b> seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of what he is doing.|$|E
5|$|When Eva {{was a year}} old, Duarte {{returned}} permanently to {{his legal}} family, leaving Juana Ibarguren and her children in penury. Ibarguren and her children were forced {{to move to the}} poorest area of Junín. Los Toldos was a village in the dusty region of Las Pampas, with a reputation as a desolate place of abject <b>poverty.</b> <b>To</b> support herself and her children, Ibarguren sewed clothes for neighbors. The family was stigmatized by the abandonment of the father and by the illegitimate status of the children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated. A desire to expunge this part of her life might have been a motivation for Eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in 1945.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused <b>poverty</b> <b>to</b> escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E

40|$|Background In many {{developing}} countries, policies {{aimed at improving}} welfare through <b>poverty</b> reduction tend <b>to</b> target the current poor {{to the neglect of}} the vulnerable. An understanding of household susceptibility <b>to</b> future <b>poverty</b> will be crucial for sustainable growth and development. The objective of the study is to assess ex-ante welfare through vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>poverty</b> estimates among households in Ghana and to examine the effect of various socioeconomic characteristics on vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>poverty.</b> Method The study uses cross section data from the fifth round of the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) with a nationally representative sample of 8, 687 households from all administrative regions in Ghana. The study employs a three step Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) estimation procedure to estimate vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>poverty</b> and <b>to</b> model the effect of household socioeconomic status on expected future consumption and variations in future consumption. Results The results show that, about 56 % of households in Ghana are vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>poverty</b> and this is significantly higher than observed poverty level of about 28 %. While the Eastern region was found to have the highest average vulnerability of approximately 73 %, the Upper West region had the least vulnerability with about 21 % average vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>poverty.</b> Other regions with relatively high incidence of vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>poverty</b> include the Western region (70 %) and the Volta region (69 %). Vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>poverty</b> was estimated <b>to</b> be 61 % among urban households and 25 % among rural households. Moreover, household health status, household size and education attainments significantly influence vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>poverty.</b> Male headed households were found to be less vulnerable <b>to</b> future <b>poverty.</b> Conclusion The results suggest that <b>poverty</b> and vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>poverty</b> are independent concepts. This implies that policies directed towards <b>poverty</b> reduction need <b>to</b> take into account the vulnerability of current non-poor households. Also, various household characteristics should be considered in developing poverty reduction strategies. ...|$|R

25|$|Violence in Portuguese schools {{became an}} {{educational}} {{issue for the}} first time during the 1990s, mainly through the persistence of parental associations and teacher claims. However, it must be said that {{this was not the first}} time that violence appeared in Portuguese schools as a significant situation. After the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974 the occurrence of violent situations reached the highest point. This was a politically socialized and framed violence, quite different from the kind of violence we can find today. That one had political programs, this one is quite anomic. Its origin is very diverse, from <b>poverty</b> <b>to</b> psychological problems. Theft, random or systematic physical aggression, bullying, destruction of school or teachers properties are realities which become current in many schools.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} aspect of analyzing the feminization of poverty is understanding how it is measured. It is inaccurate to assume that income is the only deprivation that affects women’s <b>poverty.</b> <b>To</b> examine the issue from a multidimensional perspective, there must first be accurate and indices available for policy makers interested in gender empowerment. Often aggregate indices are criticized for their concentration on monetary issues, especially when data on women's income is sparse and groups women into one large, undifferentiated mass. Three indexes often examined are Gender-related Development Index, Gender Empowerment Measure, and Human Poverty Index. The first two are gendered- indices, in that they specifically gather data on women to evaluate gender inequalities, and are useful in understanding disparities in gender opportunities and choices. HPI, however, focuses on deprivation measures rather than income measures.|$|E

25|$|The {{income of}} women with status living off-reserve was on average $13,870 a year, {{according}} to a 1996 Canadian census. This is about $5500 less than non-Indigenous women, such as Inuit and Métis women,which recorded slightly higher average annual incomes; regardless of the small discrepancy, {{all of which are}} substantially less than Statistics Canada’s estimated amount of which an individual living in a large Canadian city would require to meet their needs. It is not unlikely for Aboriginal women living in <b>poverty</b> <b>to</b> not only tend to their own needs, but often tend to the needs of their elderly parents, care for loved ones in ill-health, as well as raising children; all of which is often supported only on a single income.

25|$|PAC, {{with its}} {{operational}} headquarters in Iquitos, dominated {{the city and}} the region. The area was separated from the main population of Peru by the Andes, and it was 1900 miles from the Amazon's mouth at Pará. The British-registered company was effectively controlled by the archetypal rubber baron Julio Cesar Arana and his brother. Born in Lima, Arana had climbed out of <b>poverty</b> <b>to</b> own and operate a company harvesting great quantities of rubber in the Peruvian Amazon, which was much in demand on the world market. The rubber boom had led to expansion in Iquitos as a trading center, as all the company rubber was shipped down the Amazon River from there to the Atlantic port. Numerous foreigners had flocked to the area seeking their fortunes in the rubber boom, or at least some piece of the business. The rough frontier city, both respectable businesses and the vice district, was highly dependent on the PAC.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, some {{chocolate}} producers began {{to engage in}} fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries.

25|$|In 1684, the {{beginning}} of the Morean War between Venice and the Ottoman Empire resulted in the temporary reconquest of {{a large part of the}} country by the Republic. In 1687 the Venetian army arrived in Piraeus and captured Attica. The number of the Athenians at that time exceeded 6000, the Albanians from the villages of Attica excluded, whilst in 1674 the population of Aegina did not seem to exceed 3000 inhabitants, ⅔ of which were women. The Aeginetans had been reduced to <b>poverty</b> <b>to</b> pay their taxes. The most significant plague epidemic began in Attica during 1688, an occasion that caused the massive migration of Athenians toward the south; most of them settled in Aegina. In 1693 Morosini resumed command, but his only acts were to refortify the castle of Aegina, which he had demolished during the Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid as long as the war lasted by the Athenians, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero as Governor. This caused the Athenians to send him a request for the renewal of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. He died in 1694 and Zeno was appointed at his place.|$|E
25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{for the reason}} that laborers in Africa are marginalized in world trade is because the colonial division of labor kept Africa from developing its own industries. Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused <b>poverty</b> <b>to</b> abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system. Most cocoa comes from small family-run farms in West Africa. These farms have little market access and thus rely on middlemen to bring their products to market. Sometimes middlemen are unfair to farmers. Farmers do not get a fair price for their product despite relying on cocoa sales for the majority of their income. One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees. One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but {{this does not mean that}} the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. In reality, much of this money goes to community projects such as water wells rather than to individual farmers. Nevertheless, cooperatives such as fair trade-endorsed Kuapa Kokoo in Ghana are often the only Licensed Buying Companies that will give farmers a fair price and not cheat them or rig sales. Farmers in cooperatives are frequently their own bosses and get bonuses per bag of cocoa beans. These arrangements are not always assured and fair trade organizations can't always buy all of the cocoa available to them from cooperatives.|$|E

After in vain exhorting the royalists to resist, he managed by a succession of adroit stratagems to reach Ireland, and on 1 April 1647 was presented to the rectory of Rathfarnham, near Dublin. He resided in that city until its surrender in the same year, when he was included by name in the benefits of the capitulation. Ormonde sent him a sum of money to relieve his necessities, but on his way to Wales, to live on a small patrimony he possessed there, he was taken prisoner by Captain Beeche, who robbed him of all he had and left him to make his way back to Dublin in a destitute condition. Dr. Loftus furnished him with money to carry him to London, and he appealed to the committee of sequestrations for the benefits of the Dublin capitulation. On learning that he was the author of Vindiciæ Regum, the committee told him he deserved to have his head cut off, and passed on to the next business without giving him any redress. Armed with a letter from Fairfax, he had better fortune with the committees at Northampton and Anglesey, to which he was driven by <b>poverty</b> <b>to</b> resort on foot. After regaining his small possessions, he lived at his house in Llanllechid in great poverty, preparing his Great Antichrist for press. His old patron, Pembroke, offered him a valuable living in Lancashire if he would submit to parliament; but this he refused, as well as an offer of Henry Cromwell's of £100 a year on the same terms. In 1651, when Charles was marching on Worcester, he preached before the judges at Conway, and manifested such strong royalist tendencies that he saved himself only by flight.|$|E
