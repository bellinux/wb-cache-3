25|$|Elm phloem {{necrosis}} (elm yellows) {{is a disease}} of elm trees that is spread by leafhoppers or by root grafts. This very aggressive disease, with no known cure, occurs in the Eastern United States, southern Ontario in Canada, and Europe. It is caused by <b>phytoplasmas</b> which infect the phloem (inner bark) of the tree. Infection and death of the phloem effectively girdles the tree and stops {{the flow of water}} and nutrients. The disease affects both wild-growing and cultivated trees.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{pathogens}} {{and their}} mechanics differ greatly {{from those of}} animals, plants are subject {{to a wide variety}} of diseases, including those caused by fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, <b>phytoplasmas,</b> protozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants. [...] Damage caused by insects, mites, vertebrate, and other small herbivores is not considered a part of the domain of plant pathology. The field is deeply connected to plant disease epidemiology and the horticulture of species that are of high importance to the human diet or other uses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phytoplasmas</b> {{are spread}} principally by insects of the {{families}} Cicadellidae (leafhoppers), Fulgoridae (planthoppers), and Psyllidae (jumping plant lice), which feed on the phloem of infected plants, ingesting <b>phytoplasmas</b> and transmitting them to the next plant on which they feed. Thus, the host range of <b>phytoplasmas</b> is strongly dependent upon that of the insect vector. <b>Phytoplasmas</b> contain a major antigenic protein constituting most of the cell surface protein. This protein associates with insect microfilament complexes and is believed to control insect-phytoplasma interactions. <b>Phytoplasmas</b> can overwinter in insect vectors or perennial plants. <b>Phytoplasmas</b> can have varying effects on their insect hosts; examples of both reduced and increased fitness have been noted.|$|E

50|$|<b>Phytoplasmas</b> are obligate {{bacterial}} parasites {{of plant}} phloem tissue {{and of the}} insect vectors {{that are involved in}} their plant-to-plant transmission. <b>Phytoplasmas</b> were discovered in 1967 by Japanese scientists who termed them mycoplasma-like organisms (MLOs). Since their discovery, <b>phytoplasmas</b> have resisted all attempts at in vitro culture in any cell-free medium; routine cultivation in an artificial medium thus remains a major challenge. Although <b>phytoplasmas</b> have recently been reported to be grown in a specific artificial medium, no repetition have been reported. <b>Phytoplasmas</b> are characterized by the lack of a cell wall, a pleiomorphic or filamentous shape, a diameter normally less than 1 μm, and a very small genome.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{their small}} genomes, many {{predicted}} phytoplasma genes {{are present in}} multiple copies. <b>Phytoplasmas</b> lack many genes encoding standard metabolic functions and have no functioning homologous recombination pathway, {{but they do have}} a sec transport pathway.

50|$|References to {{diseases}} {{now known}} {{to be caused by}} <b>phytoplasmas</b> can be found as far back as 1603 (mulberry dwarf disease in Japan.) Such diseases were originally thought to be caused by viruses, which, like <b>phytoplasmas,</b> require insect vectors, and cannot be cultured. Viral and phytoplasmic infections share some symptoms. In 1967, <b>phytoplasmas</b> were discovered in ultrathin sections of plant phloem tissue and were termed mycoplasma-like organisms (MLOs) due to their physiological resemblance The organisms were renamed <b>phytoplasmas</b> in 1994, at the 10th Congress of the International Organization for Mycoplasmology.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s, {{a new and}} devastating disease was noticed among ashleaf maples in {{nurseries}} and urban areas of southern and central Poland. Symptoms include severe growth abnormalities, shoot proliferation and decline, which may indicate that the disease in Poland {{is caused by a}} <b>phytoplasma.</b> To test the hypothesis, we tested diseased ashleaf maples for the presence of <b>phytoplasma.</b> PCR and RFLP revealed that one particular strain of <b>phytoplasma,</b> the aster yellows <b>phytoplasma,</b> was present in diseased ashleaf maple trees. To further test this hypothesis, we inoculated Catharanthus roseus test plants with bud grafts from infected trees, and then inoculated young, healthy maple seedlings with shoot grafts from symptomatic periwinkles. Although the infection rate was low and the course of the disease was milder, or even latent, the presence of the aster yellows <b>phytoplasma</b> in both symptomatic and asymptomatic plants was present. The results suggest that the aster yellows <b>phytoplasma</b> is connected with the ashleaf maple disease. The aster yellows <b>phytoplasma</b> has been assigned to group 16 SrI, subgroup B (16 SrI-B). Now this group is reclassified as ‘Candidatus <b>Phytoplasma</b> asteris’.

Phytoplasma Mali. <b>Phytoplasmas</b> have very small genomes, with {{extremely}} {{small amount of}} G and C nucleotides (sometimes as little as 23%, which {{is thought to be}} the lower threshold for a viable genome). In fact, the Bermuda grass white-leaf phytoplasma has a genome size of only 530 kb, one of the smallest known genomes of all living organisms. The larger phytoplasma genomes are around 1350 kb in size. The small genome size of phytoplasma is attributable to reductive evolution from Bacillus/Clostridium ancestors. <b>Phytoplasmas</b> have lost ≥75% of their original genes, and can thus no longer survive outside of insects or plant phloem.
