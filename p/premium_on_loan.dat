40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} the influence of public-private partnerships (PPPs) on social and economic conditions in Kazakhstan and Russia from a public economics perspective, namely, {{through the lens of}} a market failure and PPPs’ negative externalities. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on the concept of a market failure and using the externalities perspective, the paper investigates whether partnerships are instrumental in solving market problems, which is illustrated by the evidence from ongoing PPP projects in Kazakhstan and Russia. Findings – Results show that citizens face expansion of monopolistic trends in the service provision and decreased availability of public services. Additionally, the government support to partnerships recreates a negative externality {{in the form of a}} higher risk <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> <b>loan</b> interest rates that banks use to finance PPPs. The partnerships’ impact on sustainable development often appears detrimental, as they significantly intensify the struggle between sub-national governments for increased transfers from the national budget. Practical implications – The government agencies must incorporate the appraisal of the PPP externalities and their effects on the society in the decision-making regarding the PPP formation. Originality/value – The authors suggest that, although government is interested in PPPs’ positive externalities, in reality many negative externalities may offset the positive spillover effects. As a result, the partnerships’ contributions to economic and social sustainability remain controversial. Extending the value-for-money concept to incorporate the assessment of PPP externalities might significantly enhance the partnership conceptualisation by more comprehensive and accurate assessment of PPPs’ economic and social value...|$|E

While internal risk ratings have little explanatory power for future loan performance, they do help predict future CAMEL downgrades. These findings suggest that supervisors might consider using interest rates in the off-site surveillance of banks.

5000|$|The {{subprime}} mortgage crisis {{arose from}} 'bundling' American subprime and American regular mortgages into MBSs which were traditionally isolated from, and sold in a separate market from, prime loans. [...] These 'bundles' of mixed (prime and subprime) mortgages were based on asset-backed securities so the 'probable' rate of return looked superb (since subprime lenders pay higher <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> <b>loans</b> secured against saleable real-estate, which was commonly assumed [...] "could not fail"). Many mortgages had a low interest for the first year, and poorer buyers' defaults were 'swapped' regularly at first, but finally, such borrowers began to default in large numbers. The inflated house-price bubble burst, property valuations plummeted and the real {{rate of return on}} investment could not be estimated, and so confidence in these instruments collapsed, and all less than prime mortgages were considered to be almost worthless toxic assets, regardless of their actual composition or performance. Because of the [...] "originate-to-distribute" [...] model followed by many subprime mortgage originators, there was little monitoring of credit quality and little effort at remediation when these mortgages became troubled.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the onset}} of {{financial}} crisis, the System of National Accounts method for measuring the value added in the banking sector has become subject to criticism. Some authors argue that the value added by banks should be the residual net interest income after subtracting the required term and risk <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> <b>loans</b> and deposits. For the first time, we apply this method to evaluate bank output for France for the period 2003 to 2012. First, we show that on average, using the traditional method, bank output is overestimated by between 31 % and 74 %. This overestimation is especially pronounced in times of financial stress. Second, we establish that the proposed new method is robust to the choice of various reference rates. Third, we find negative FISIM (Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured) on deposits from 2009. Finally, we check {{the existence of a}} single or multiple structural unknown breaks in the long run relationship between retail interest rates and driving market reference rates. We find existence of break dates that are coincident with negative FISIM on deposits. We explain this result by a change in banking behavior that may result from the new banking regulation on liquidity and from banks' adaptation to "near" zero interest rate polic...|$|R

30|$|This study {{introduces}} a Real Options Model that describes option values of loan portfolios for actively traded Philippine Universal Banks. The model assumes that these banks may continually invest funds; the loan portfolio and deposit accounts are positively and strongly correlated; and banks operate {{in an environment}} of imperfect information. From simulation, the study finds that the Value of Waiting functions similar to a risk-adjusted discount factor to Operating Income from the Loan Portfolio. Resulting cumulative distribution factors (from the equilibrium condition) adjust asset values, and inflows for lending risks. A put option <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> the <b>loan</b> portfolio results from the difference between the salvage value of a loan, and its inflows. This put option values the strategy of not lending, or idling, the loan portfolio. The call option values the strategy of lending, essentially expanding the loan portfolio. Call option premiums result from the difference between the risk-adjusted inflows, and the risk-adjusted value of the loan portfolio.|$|R
40|$|Mortgage lenders {{impose a}} default <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> the <b>loans</b> they {{originate}} {{to compensate for}} the possibility that borrowers won’t make payments. The housing boom of the 2000 s was characterized by increasing riskiness of the borrowers approved for mortgages and the structures of the loans themselves. Despite these changes in risk, a pricing model can justify the spreads contained in mortgages made during this period based on what at the time seemed to be reasonable expectations for house price appreciation. Contrary to those expectations, prices fell dramatically. One of the enduring questions about the housing market of the past decade is the role of lax lender underwriting standards and pricing of risk in the lead-up to the collapse of home prices and wave of defaults that began in 2007. This Economic Letter seeks to shed light on those issues by examining how lenders price the risk that a mortgage borrower will default. Specifically, we look at how default premiums behaved during the housing boom years of the past decade. Declining standards and loan prices Throughout the housing market boom of the 2000 s, the risk characteristics of the average mortgage borrower steadily increased. Moreover, mortgage loans themselves became riskier. Subprime loans as...|$|R
40|$|I {{estimate}} {{a dynamic}} model of durable and non-durable consumption choice and default behavior {{in an economy}} where risky borrowing is allowed and bankruptcy protection is regulated by law. I exploit the substantial difference in the generosity of bankruptcy exemptions across the U. S. states to assess the role of durable goods as both informal collateral for unsecured debt and self-insurance against bad shocks to earnings. The model accounts for the equilibrium effects of bankruptcy protection on both consumer saving behavior and the credit market. The individual-specific borrowing limits are endogenously derived from the equilibrium condition of the banking sector. The default risk <b>premium</b> charged <b>on</b> unsecured <b>loans</b> is decreasing in durable wealth and increasing in the exemption level. The generosity of bankruptcy protection does change both the incentives {{and the ability of}} households to accumulate durable wealth. The proposed Bankruptcy Reform H.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the amount of}} tightening in bank commercial and industrial (C&I) loan rates during the financial crisis. After controlling for loan characteristics and bank fixed effects, as of 2010 :Q 1, the average C&I loan spread was 66 basis points or 23 percent above normal. From about 2005 to 2008, the loan spread averaged 23 basis points below normal. Thus, from the unusually loose lending conditions in 2007 to the much tighter conditions in 2010 :Q 1, the average loan spread increased by about 1 percentage point. I find that large and medium-sized banks tightened their loan rates more than small banks; while small banks tended to tighten less, they always charged more.; Using loan size to proxy for bank-dependent borrowers, while small loans {{tend to have a}} higher spread than large loans, I find that small loans actually tightened less than large loans in both absolute and percentage terms. Hence, the results do not indicate that bank-dependent borrowers suffered more from bank tightening than large borrowers.; The channels through which banks tightened loan rates include reducing the discounts <b>on</b> large <b>loans</b> and raising the risk <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> more risky <b>loans.</b> There also is evidence that noncommitment loans were priced significantly higher than commitment loans {{at the height of the}} liquidity shortfall in late 2007 and early 2008, but this premium dropped to zero following the introduction of emergency liquidity facilities by the Federal Reserve.; In a cross section of banks, certain bank characteristics are found to have significant effects <b>on</b> <b>loan</b> prices, including loan portfolio quality, capital ratios, and the amount of unused loan commitments. These findings provide evidence o n the supply-side effect of loan pricing. Bank loans...|$|R
40|$|A {{tutorial}} {{program for}} use on personal computers is being developed to evaluate the sensitivity of geothermal energy costs to potential technological improvements. Reservoir engineering R&D will reduce risk to the funding organization and in turn reduce the risk <b>premium</b> paid <b>on</b> a <b>loan.</b> The use of a risk premium was described as an investment banker’s option at the November 1986 “Future of Geothermal Energy Conference” in San Diego, California. In the sensitivity analysis, we propose to calculate an energy cost: (1) at the predicted production parameters of temperature, drawdown rate, etc., and (2) at the most likely worse case values. The differential higher cost of the worse case over the predicted case is the risk premium. Thus R&D that improves reservoir definition will reduce the worse-case-minus-predicted-case difference and the financial risk premium. Improvements in reservoir engineering can then be quantified in terms of reduced energy costs. This paper will discuss the proposed approach to obtain critique of the procedure and provide the best logic for use in evaluating {{the potential impact of}} reservoir engineering R&D...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the {{financial}} crisis central banks experienced a situation where standard monetary measures failed to create stability and restore growth to {{the financial}} markets and the overall economy. Therefore new response methods where introduced. One of the key responses was to extend longer maturity loans through auctions supported by {{a wider range of}} collateral (The Term Auction Facility or TAF program). In the aftermath of the crisis in financial markets the effect of this monetary measure has been widely discussed. A key topic of interest is how it affected the term structure of interbank interest rates and whether it restored access to liquidity for financial institutions. In this thesis we develop and apply three statistical tests to study if the TAF had the intended effect on US interbank rates, and whether or not spillover effects to other markets have been seen as well. First we compute the frequency of a directional move following term auctions, and compare this with the frequency in the overall financial crisis. Then we compute the expected size in such a move following auction dates, and compare expected sizes in such moves during the rest of {{the financial crisis}}. Third we use an event study to look for abnormal movements following auction dates. Here we estimate an affine term structure model driven by a vector autoregressive model with the credit premium, liquidity premium and short rate as driving factors in an affine term structure model. The thesis has four major findings; First, we find that the probability of drops in interbank interest rates and spreads tended to be more likely and larger in size following the notification of information regarding the results of TAF-auctions. Second, the Term Auction Facility caused international spillover effects which varied from market to market. Specifically we found that unsecured loans with more than 5 months to maturity became less expensive compared to unsecured loans with less than 5 months to maturity. These results were found in the UK and EU, and were highly significant. The same results indicate that interest rate levels tended to fall, but these results were not significant. Third, interest rates <b>on</b> <b>loans</b> with more than 4 months to maturity dropped more than what could be expected, even when credit and liquidity factors could be perfectly predicted. This suggests that the results from TAF-auctions went a long way in reducing <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> unsecured <b>loans</b> in the interbank marked with longer maturities (5 - 12 months). Last, the Term Auction Facility seem to have pulled down <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> credit and liquidity beyond what could be expected following the notification of results from the TAF auctions. These effects were seen to spill over to the settlement day as well...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to examine the {{influence}} of variables that affect the pricing of commercial loans {{within the context of}} the R 2 ̆ 6 I Bank. This will be achieved by collecting financial information <b>on</b> past business <b>loan</b> pricing decisions from a specific R 2 ̆ 6 I Bank branch selected. The information so collected would be analysed from the viewpoint of understanding the pricing of risk. Of specific interest is the examination of loans in a branch to find out the distribution of loans across the spread of credit risk premiums. A credit risk premium, also referred to as the interest rate margin (IRM), is arrived at by subtracting the base rate (or reference rate) from the interest rate charged <b>on</b> the <b>loan.</b> The distribution of loans across a given credit risk premium will be examined by looking at the number of loans in a particular credit risk premium spread (Chp. 4). Subsequently this paper also seeks to identify variables which play a important role in the decision to grant credit (i. e. give a loan). The latter part of the paper will seek to examine the degree of relationship these variables have in influencing the credit risk <b>premium</b> charged <b>on</b> business <b>loans.</b> Thus this paper involves two analyses. The first part looks at the distribution of the loans across a spread of credit risk premiums.
