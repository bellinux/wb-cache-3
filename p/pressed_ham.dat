[...] Joe Gross of Rolling Stone rated the album three-and-a-half out of five stars, and noted that [...] "Many were born to rock; Mogwai were born to score." [...] Consequence of Sound called the band to likely [...] "stand as the genre’s last immobile pillar" [...] and listed [...] "Remurdered" [...] and [...] "The Lord Is Out of Control" [...] as essential tracks.

On their return to Toronto ten days later, the women discussed their professional exclusion from male journalists' gatherings and <b>press</b> clubs. Col. <b>Ham,</b> who traveled with them and was smoking his pipe nearby, quietly suggested they form their own press club, which they promptly did.|$|R
5000|$|Matthew Fiander of Popmatters {{gave the}} album a mixed review, writing [...] "There’s still a solid core to Tomorrow’s Hits, one that cleans up the band’s talents {{and puts them}} on display in {{innovative}} songs. Unfortunately, for every look forward on Tomorrow’s Hits, there’s another one still stuck in the past." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes also gave the album a mixed review, writing that the album [...] "comes across as methodic in whichever mirror you choose to view it in." [...] The review continued: [...] "It’s their 'highest fidelity album yet,' but it actually being medium rare-fi in the grand relative scheme of the music fidelity scale seems boring." [...] At Alternative <b>Press,</b> Robert <b>Ham</b> rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that [...] "The majority of the tracks on Tomorrow's Hits feel like they were cooked in the backyards of Laurel Canyon with ambling rhythms, the lilt of lap steel guitar and an air of stoned desperation lingering over it all like smog." ...|$|R
2500|$|Mutch scored {{his first}} senior goal {{just a minute}} after Burnley's equaliser, and David Murphy made the final score 3–1. The {{scoreline}} was repeated at home to Crystal Palace; Birmingham were 3–0 up after 32 minutes, {{and the result was}} never in doubt. Mutch's second, a clever solo goal, opened the scoring at West Ham United, and King's 17th of the season gave Birmingham a two-goal lead. Ricardo Vaz Tê pulled one back going into half-time, but Burke restored the two-goal margin even further into stoppage time when his downward volley bounced over everyone. After the interval, West <b>Ham</b> <b>pressed</b> repeatedly but caused few problems until N'Daw, a big, strong, defensive midfielder, went off injured. Within two minutes, Kevin Nolan touched a long ball to Carlton Cole, who drove it low past Myhill, and West Ham equalised through Vaz Tê's 89th-minute penalty awarded for handball when [...] "Lansbury's vicious shot struck the raised arm of Burke, who was in close proximity to the effort." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clive {{used to give}} droll {{accounts}} of the young disciples at Gandish's, who were of various ages and conditions, and in whose company the young fellow took his place with that good temper and gaiety which have seldom deserted him in life, and have put him at ease wherever his fate has led him. He is, in truth, as much {{at home in a}} fine drawing-room as in a public-house parlour; and can talk as pleasantly to the polite mistress of the mansion, as to the jolly landlady dispensing her drinks from her bar. Not one of the Gandishites but was after a while well inclined to the young fellow; from Mr. Chivers, the senior pupil, down to the little imp Harry Hooker, who knew as much mischief at twelve years old, and could draw as cleverly as many a student of five-and-twenty; and Bob Trotter, the diminutive fag of the studio, who ran on all the young men's errands, and fetched them in apples, oranges, and walnuts. Clive opened his eyes with wonder when he first beheld these simple feasts, and the pleasure with which some of the young men partook of them. They were addicted to polonies; they did not disguise their love for Banbury cakes; they made bets in ginger-beer, and gave and took the odds in that frothing liquor. There was a young Hebrew amongst the pupils, upon whom his brother-students used playfully to <b>press</b> <b>ham</b> sandwiches, pork sausages, and the like. This young man (who has risen to great wealth subsequently, and was bankrupt only three months since) actually bought cocoa-nuts, and sold them at a profit amongst the lads. His pockets were never without pencil-cases, French chalk, garnet brooches, for which he was willing to bargain. He behaved very rudely to Gandish, who seemed to be afraid before him. It was whispered that the Professor was not altogether easy in his circumstances, and that the elder Moss had some mysterious hold over him. Honeyman and Bayham, who once came to see Clive at the studio, seemed each disturbed at beholding young Moss seated there (making a copy of the Marsyas). [...] "Pa knows both those gents," [...] he informed Clive afterwards, with a wicked twinkle of his Oriental eyes. [...] "Step in, Mr. Newcome, any day you are passing down Wardour Street, and see if you don't want anything in our way." [...] (He pronounced the words in his own way, saying: [...] "Step id, Bister Doocob, ady day idto Vordor Street," [...] etc.) This young gentleman could get tickets for almost all the theatres, which he gave or sold, and gave splendid accounts at Cavendish's of the brilliant masquerades. Clive was greatly diverted at beholding Mr. Moss at one of these entertainments, dressed in a scarlet coat and top-boots, and calling out, [...] "Yoicks! Hark forward!" [...] fitfully to another Orientalist, his younger brother, attired like a midshipman. Once Clive bought a half-dozen of theatre tickets from Mr. Moss, which he distributed to the young fellows of the studio. But, when this nice young man tried further to tempt him on the next day, [...] "Mr. Moss," [...] Clive said to him with much dignity, [...] "I am very much obliged to you for your offer, but when I go to the play, I prefer paying at the doors." ...|$|R
2500|$|Days {{after the}} Nye video was posted, the YEC {{ministry}} Answers in Genesis (AiG) posted a video response featuring AiG scientists David Menton and Georgia Purdom. AiG founder {{and executive director}} Ken Ham also objected to the claims in Nye's video in a post on his blog, Answers with Ken Ham. Soon after, Ham began trying to convince Nye to visit AiG's Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, which presents a YEC viewpoint that the Earth was created by God approximately 6,000 years ago and dinosaurs and humans once co-existed, {{in contrast to the}} scientific consensus that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old and the existence of dinosaurs and humans is separated by about 60 million years. On January 2, 2014, Ham announced on his Facebook page that Nye had accepted his invitation to a debate at the museum. AiG agreed to pay Nye's travel expenses, and the date [...] February 4, 2014 [...] was close to one of Nye's previously-scheduled speaking engagements at Kentucky's Murray State University. In an AiG <b>press</b> release, <b>Ham</b> commented that [...] "having the opportunity to hold a cordial but spirited debate with such a well-known personality who is admired by so many young people will help bring the creation-evolution issue to the attention of many more people, including youngsters." [...] Of Ham and AiG, Nye said, [...] "This guy and his beliefs are in their midst, and we can't have this way of thinking for our science students, to have people like this organization try to insinuate themselves in our schools is not appropriate and a formula for a darker future." [...] Nye told the Associated Press that he didn't mind holding the debate at the Creation Museum: [...] "It either makes me anxious, or it's an opportunity to influence that many more people and, frankly, have that much more fun." ...|$|R
