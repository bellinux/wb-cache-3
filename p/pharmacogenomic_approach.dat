40|$|Major {{classes of}} {{medication}} in asthma management include bronchodilating β 2 -agonists, anti-inflammatory inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers and theophyllines. However, all asthmatics {{do not respond}} to the same extent to a given medication. Available data suggest that a substantial range of individual variability, as much as 70 %, may be due to genetic characteristics of each patient. Pharmacogenomics offers the potential to optimize medications for individual asthmatics by using genetic information to improve efficacy or avoid adverse effects. The best-studied case of the potential contribution of pharmacogenomics to treatment response in asthma comes from studies on human β 2 adrenergic receptors. In addition, genetic variation in β 2 -adrenergic receptor (Arg 16 Gly) may predict response to anticholinergics for the treatment of asthma. In case of inhaled corticosteroids, a recent investigation using a traditional SNP-based approach identified a gene for corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 as a potential marker of response. Another major pathway that has been investigated is the pathway underlying response to cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist.

40|$|AbstractThe {{usefulness}} of the results so far published on genetics of primary hypertension for establishing the clinical impact of candidate gene polymorphisms is weakened by the scanty information regarding: a) the functional effect of the gene variants of interest in humans; b) the regulatory genetic network (RGN) where the gene is operating with all the interacting environmental–biological factors and the respective hierarchical organization; c) the consistency between {{the natural history of}} the established pathophysiological mechanisms underlying hypertension and the new molecular mechanism detected with genetics; d) the limitations regarding the translation of animal data to human due to the differences among species of the genetic molecular mechanisms underlying similar organ function changes in the different species. Of course, not all these information are available for adducin polymorphisms. In this review, being aware of their importance, the evaluation of the clinical impact of adducin has been focused on data obtained together with the interacting genetic-environmental or biological factors. Adducin polymorphisms and endogenous ouabain (EO) were detected by a top-down approach in rodents after having demonstrated, at cellular and kidney level, that an increase in tubular Na reabsorption could underlies the transition from normotension to hypertension both in rodents and humans. Therefore, we hypothesized that adducin polymorphisms and EO may operate within the triggering RGN that initiates the increase in blood pressure in both species. The distinction between triggering RGN and the secondary RGN is important both to limit the level of genetic complexity arising from secondary changes, and to detect the molecular target to develop tailored therapeutic approach. The <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approach,</b> both in rodents or humans, with newly discovered and never treated hypertension, may be useful to strengthen the “causation” of genetic mechanism. Mutant adducin increases tubular reabsorption: diuretics, because of their effect on overall tubular reabsorption, or rostafuroxin, because of its selective inhibition of the adducin and ouabain effects, may be used for this purpose. Indeed the <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approach</b> with both drugs have provided data consistent with the role of adducin and EO. Taken together, all these findings indicate a clear impact of adducin polymorphism and EO in a subset of patients when the appropriate environmental, biological or genetic context is taken into account.

40|$|Adducin is a heterodimeric {{cytoskeleton}} protein {{consisting of}} an alpha-subunit and either a beta- or gamma-subunit. In rats and humans, mutation of the alpha-adducin subunit {{leads to the}} stimulation of the sodium (Na(+)), potassium (K(+)) -adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -ase activity in renal tubular cells, increased renal Na(+) reabsorption, and, subsequently, hypertension. Ouabain is a hormone that is released by the hypothalamus and, possibly, the adrenal glands. In renal tubular cells it modulates Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity and regulates natriuresis. Plasma ouabain levels increase {{with the number of}} copies of the mutated alpha-adducin allele. Rostafuroxin is a digitoxygenin derivative that selectively displaces ouabain from the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase receptor and lowers blood pressure in rats and humans. In this short editorial review, we summarize the recent experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that contributed {{to our understanding of the}} pathogenetic mechanisms that lead to hypertension associated with the alpha-adducin Gly 460 Trp polymorphism and its interaction with ouabain.

40|$|Given {{on behalf}} of Dr. Elizabeth Phillips, Dr. Mallal {{presents}} pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in clinical practice. Polymorphisms in both hosts and pathogens constitute a large challenge in therapy. Pathogenic adaptability, as seen in HIV, will shape the response to particular drug interventions. Similarly, the host genetic makeup will also affect the response to treatment. Drugs therefore help us elucidate these polymorphic backgrounds. Pharmacogenetics refers to a clinical entity (phenotype) that is further characterized by genetics (genotype). Conversely, pharmacogenomics attempts to identify the genotype in order to predict {{the risk of developing}} a particular phenotype. Pharmacogenetic and <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approaches</b> in choosing an optimal antiretroviral regimen are exemplified in abacavir hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical diagnosis of abacavir hypersensitivity has been shown to yield false positives (CNA 3005, CNA 30024). This over diagnosis subsequently leads to prompt discontinuation of abacavir which incurs significant healthcare costs. A study by Dr. Phillips and colleagues (2005) demonstrated that disrupting treatment too early resulted in increased consultations with emergency physicians and/or specialists with higher costs for services. Furthermore, it took longer for these patients to achieve undetectable viral loads. Studies show that abacavir hypersensitivity can be more accurately diagnosed with the patch test. Dr. Mallal reiterates the differences between pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics by pointing out that patch testing should be employed in abacavir sensitized individuals, therefore serving as a diagnostic test and not a predictive test...|$|R
40|$|Context: Asthma is {{a complex}} disease with {{multiple}} genetic and environmental factors contributing to it. A component of this complexity is a highly variable response to pharmacological therapy. Pharmacogenomics {{is the study of}} the role of genetic determinants in the variable response to therapy. A number of examples of possible <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approaches</b> that may prove of value in the management of asthma are discussed below. Evidence Acquisition: A search of PubMed, Google scholar, E-Medicine, BMJ and Mbase was done using the key words "pharmacogenomics of asthma", "pharmacogenomics of &# 946;-agonist, glucocorticoids, leukotriene modifiers, theophylline, muscarinic antagonists in asthma". Results: Presently, there are limited examples of gene polymorphism that can influence response to asthma therapy. Polymorphisms that alter response to asthma therapy include Arg 16 Gly, Gln 27 Glu, Thr 164 Ile for &# 946;-agonist receptor, polymorphism of glucocorticoid receptor gene, CRHR 1 variants and polymorphism of LTC 4 S, ALOX 5. Polymorphic variants of muscarinic receptors, PDE 4 and CYP 450 gene variants. Conclusion: It was concluded that genetic variation can improve the response to asthma therapy. However, no gene polymorphism has been associated with consistent results in different populations. Therefore, asthma pharmacogenomic studies in different populations with a large number of subjects are required to make possible tailoring the asthma therapy according to the genetic characteristic of individual patient...|$|R

Moreover, it has been demonstrated that COX- 2 and 5 -LO enzymes play a considerable role in the pathophysiology of AD. In order to assess the possible role of COX- 2 and 5 -LO single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AD, we examined their distribution in 341 AD patients and 190 controls from Northern Italy. A significant difference was observed in the distribution of the - 765 G COX- 2 and - 1708 A 5 -LO alleles between AD cases and controls (p= 0. 03 for - 765 G/C COX- 2 SNP; and p= 0. 007 for - 1708 G/A 5 -LO SNP). Hence, COX- 2 - 765 G and 5 -LO - 1708 A alleles were overrepresented in AD patients and underrepresented in controls.

However, despite the increasing appreciation of the role of genetics in CHD and myocardial infarction (MI) pathogenesis, <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approaches</b> to uncover drug target have not been extensively explored. Cyclo-oxygenases (COXs) and 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO) are the key enzymes in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PG) and leukotrienes (LT) and are implicated in a wide variety of inflammatory disorders, including atherosclerosis. In fact, PGE 2 activates Matrix Metallo-proteinases whereas LTB 4 is a chemoactractant for monocytes and activates gene expression in inflammatory cells. We have tested the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory variants of these genes confer genetic resistance to MI and conversely favour longevity. So, we analyzed MI patients, age-related controls and centenarians. The pro-inflammatory alleles of COX- 2 and 5 -LO were overrepresented in MI and under-represented in centenarians whereas age-related controls displayed intermediate values. MI is a multifactorial disease, hence MI might be the result of a cumulative effect which contributes with different timing to achieve a threshold where the chance to develop the diseases is very high. In particular, differences in inflammatory status can contribute to the chance of developing a risk phenotype. However, these studies might contribute to the determination of a risk profile which may allow both the early identification of individuals susceptible to disease and the possible discovery of potential targets for dru...|$|R

This failure is attributable to our inability to identify clinically-relevant subtypes of this disease. Thus, a more systematic approach to drug discovery for SCLC is needed. In this regard, two comprehensive studies recently published in Nature, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the Cancer Genome Project, provide a wealth of data regarding the drug sensitivity and genomic profiles of many different types of cancer cells. In the present study we have mined these two studies for new therapeutic agents for SCLC and identified heat shock proteins, cyclin-dependent kinases and polo-like kinases (PLK) as attractive molecular targets with little current clinical trial activity in SCLC.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent work, {{using both}} cell culture model systems and tumour derived cell lines, {{suggests}} that the differential recruitment into polysomes of mRNA populations may be sufficient to initiate and maintain tumour formation. Consequently, a major effort is underway to use high density microarray profiles to establish molecular fingerprints for cells exposed to defined drug regimes. The aim of these <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approaches</b> is to provide new information on how drugs can impact on the translational read-out within a defined cellular background. Methods We describe an approach that permits the analysis of de-novo mRNA-ribosome association in-vivo during short drug exposures. It combines hypertonic shock, polysome fractionation and high-throughput analysis to provide a molecular phenotype of translationally responsive transcripts. Compared to previous translational profiling studies, the procedure offers increased specificity due to {{the elimination of the}} drugs secondary effects (e. g. on the transcriptional read-out). For this pilot "proof-of-principle" assay we selected the drug rapamycin because of its extensively studied impact on translation initiation. Results High throughput analysis on both the light and heavy polysomal fractions has identified mRNAs whose re-recruitment onto free ribosomes responded to short exposure to the drug rapamycin. The results of the microarray have been confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. The selective down-regulation of TOP transcripts is also consistent with previous translational profiling studies using this drug. Conclusion The technical advance outlined in this manuscript offers the possibility of new insights into mRNA features that impact on translation initiation and provides a molecular fingerprint for transcript-ribosome association in any cell type and {{in the presence of a}} range of drugs of interest.

Methods: To detect potential predictor gene variants for risperidone response in schizophrenic subjects, we performed a convergent analysis based on 1) a genomewide (100 K SNP) SNP pharmacogenetic study of risperidone response and 2) a global transcriptome study of genes with mRNA levels influenced by risperidone exposure in mouse prefrontal cortex. Results: Fourteen genes were highlighted as of potential relevance to risperidone activity in both studies: ATP 2 B 2, HS 3 ST 2, UNC 5 C, BAG 3, PDE 7 B, PAICS, PTGFRN, NR 3 C 2, ZBTB 20, ST 6 GAL 2, PIP 5 K 1 B, EPHA 6, KCNH 5, and AJAP 1. The SNPs related to these genes that were associated in the pharmacogenetic study were further assessed for evidence for association with schizophrenia in up to three case-control series comprising 1564 cases and 3862 controls in total (Japanese [JPN] 1 st and 2 nd samples and UK sample). Of 14 SNPs tested, one (rs 9389370) in PDE 7 B showed significant evidence for association with schizophrenia in a discovery sample (pallele �. 026 in JPN_ 1 st, two-tailed). This finding replicated in a joint analysis of two independent case-control samples (pJPN_ 2 nd�UK �. 008, one-tailed, uncorrected) and in all combined data sets (pall �. 0014, two-tailed, uncorrected and pall �. 018, two-tailed, Bonferroni correction). Conclusions: We identified novel candidate genes for treatment response to risperidone and provide evidence {{that one of these}} additionally may confer susceptibility to schizophrenia. Specifically, PDE 7 B is an attractive candidate gene, although evidence from integrated methodology, including pharmacogenomics, pharmacotranscriptomic, and case-control association approaches...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent work, {{using both}} cell culture model systems and tumour derived cell lines, {{suggests}} that the differential recruitment into polysomes of mRNA populations may be sufficient to initiate and maintain tumour formation. Consequently, a major effort is underway to use high density microarray profiles to establish molecular fingerprints for cells exposed to defined drug regimes. The aim of these <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approaches</b> is to provide new information on how drugs can impact on the translational read-out within a defined cellular background. METHODS: We describe an approach that permits the analysis of de-novo mRNA-ribosome association in-vivo during short drug exposures. It combines hypertonic shock, polysome fractionation and high-throughput analysis to provide a molecular phenotype of translationally responsive transcripts. Compared to previous translational profiling studies, the procedure offers increased specificity due to {{the elimination of the}} drugs secondary effects (e. g. on the transcriptional read-out). For this pilot "proof-of-principle" assay we selected the drug rapamycin because of its extensively studied impact on translation initiation. RESULTS: High throughput analysis on both the light and heavy polysomal fractions has identified mRNAs whose re-recruitment onto free ribosomes responded to short exposure to the drug rapamycin. The results of the microarray have been confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. The selective down-regulation of TOP transcripts is also consistent with previous translational profiling studies using this drug. CONCLUSION: The technical advance outlined in this manuscript offers the possibility of new insights into mRNA features that impact on translation initiation and provides a molecular fingerprint for transcript-ribosome association in any cell type and {{in the presence of a}} range of drugs of interest. Such molecular phenotypes defined pre-clinically may ultimately impact on the evaluation of a particular drug in a living cell...|$|R
40|$|Asthma is {{a complex}} genetic {{disorder}} involving the interplay between various environmental and genetic factors. In this review, efforts {{have been made to}} provide information on the recent advances in these areas and to discuss the future perspective of {{research in the area of}} developing personalized drugs using <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approach.</b> Atopic asthma is found to be strongly familial, however the mode of inheritance is controversial. A large number of studies have been carried out and a number of candidate genes have been identified. In addition, a number of chromosomal regions have been identified using genome-wide scans, which might contain important unknown genes. It has been shown in studies carried out in different populations that the genetic predisposition varies with ethnicity. In other words, genes that are associated with asthma in one population may not be associated with asthma in another population. In addition to the involvement of multiple genes, gene-gene interactions play a significant role in asthma. The importance of environmental factors in asthma is beyond doubt. However, it remains controversial whether a cleaner environment or increased pollution is a trigger for asthma. Despite the increasing prevalence of the disorder, only a limited number of therapeutic modalities are available for the treatment. A number of novel therapeutic targets have been identified and drugs are being developed for better efficacy with less side-effects. With the rapid progress in the identification of genes involved in various ethnic populations combined with the availability in future of well-targeted drugs, it will be possible to have appropriate medicine as per the genetic make-up of an individual...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a clear}} {{case for}} drug {{treatments}} to be selected according to the characteristics of an individual patient, {{in order to improve}} efficacy and reduce the number and severity of adverse drug reactions 1, 2. However, such personalization of drug treatments requires the ability to predict how different individuals will respond to a particular drug/dose combination. After initial optimism, there is increasing recognition of the limitations of the <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approach,</b> which does not take account of important environmental influences on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 3 – 5. For instance, a major factor underlying inter-individual variation in drug effects is variation in metabolic phenotype, which is influenced not only by genotype but also by environmental factors such as nutritional status, the gut microbiota, age, disease and the co- or pre-administration of other drugs 6, 7. Thus, although genetic variation is clearly important, it seems unlikely that personalized drug therapy will be enabled {{for a wide range of}} major diseases using genomic knowledge alone. Here we describe an alternative and conceptually new ‘pharmaco-metabonomic’ approach to personalizing drug treatment, which uses a combination of pre-dose metabolite profiling and chemometrics to model and predict the responses of individual subjects. We provide proof-of-principle for this new approach, which is sensitive to both genetic and environmental influences, with a study of paracetamol (acetaminophen) administered to rats. We show pre-dose prediction of an aspect of the urinary drug metabolite profile and an association between predose urinary composition and the extent of liver damage sustained after paracetamol administration...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{association}} between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and polymorphisms in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor KDR gene polymorphisms. A complex, multifactorial disease in which genetic and environmental factors interact, AMD {{is the leading cause}} of blindness in the elderly. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of angiogenesis, is considered an important factor for the pathogenetic processes of AMD. Previous studies investigated the possible association between VEGF-A gene polymorphisms and AMD, with contrasting data. No study examined the possible role of VEGF receptor KDR gene polymorphisms. DESIGN: Case-control study. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: We enrolled 226 AMD cases and 248 controls from an ophthalmology hospital center. METHODS: Genotypying for 16 polymorphic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) in VEGF-A and KDR genes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of genotypes in AMD cases and controls. RESULTS: Two polymorphisms (rs 833069 in intron 2 of the VEGF-A gene, rs 2071559 in the promoter of the KDR gene) were significantly associated with risk of AMD. In particular, for VEGF-A rs 833069 the AMD risk was increased > 5 -fold for G homozygotes compared with homozygous carriage of the A allele. For KDR rs 2071559 the AMD risk was increased > 3 -fold for T homozygotes compared with homozygous carriage of the C allele. Carriers of risk alleles for both markers have a > 6 -fold increased risk of AMD with respect to carriers of non-risk alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We expand previous data on the association of AMD with VEGF-A gene variations and identify for the first time an association with variations in the KDR gene. Because the SNP- 604 T-bearing KDR promoter has higher transcription activity, our findings further support the role of the VEGF pathway in the pathophysiology of AMD. It is possible that applications of haplotype/genotype analysis in these genes will play a role in risk assessment and <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approaches</b> to AMD diagnosis and management...|$|R
40|$|Salt {{sensitivity}} {{is probably}} caused by either a hereditary or acquired defect of salt excretion by the kidney, {{and it is}} reasonable to consider that this is the basis for differences in hypertension between black and white people. Dopamine acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to promote natriuresis in the proximal tubule and thick ascending loop of Henle. G-protein receptor kinases (or GRKs) are serine and threonine kinases that phosphorylate G protein-coupled receptors in response to agonist stimulation and uncouple the dopamine receptor from its G protein. This results in a desensitisation process that protects the cell from repeated agonist exposure. GRK 4 activity is increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats, and infusion of GRK 4 antisense oligonucleotides attenuates the increase in blood pressure (BP). This functional defect is replicated in the proximal tubule by expression of GRK 4 variants namely p. Arg 65 Leu, p. Ala 142 Val and p. Val 486 Ala, in cell lines, with the p. Ala 142 Val showing the most activity. In humans, GRK 4 polymorphisms were shown to be associated with essential hypertension in Australia, BP regulation in young adults, low renin hypertension in Japan and impaired stress-induced Na excretion in normotensive black men. In South Africa, GRK 4 polymorphisms are more common in people of African descent, associated with impaired Na excretion in normotensive African people, and predict blood pressure response to Na restriction in African patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The therapeutic importance of the GRK 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was emphasised in the African American Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) where African-Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis were randomised to receive amlodipine, ramipril or metoprolol. Men with the p. Ala 142 Val genotype were less likely to respond to metoprolol, especially if they also had the p. Arg 65 Leu variant. Furthermore, in the analysis of response to treatment in two major hypertension studies, the 65 Leu/ 142 Val heterozygote predicted a significantly decreased response to atenolol treatment, and the 65 Leu/ 142 Val heterozygote and 486 Val homozygote were associated in an additive fashion with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, independent of BP. In conclusion, there is considerable evidence that GRK 4 variants are linked to impaired Na excretion, hypertension in animal models and humans, therapeutic response to dietary Na restriction and response to antihypertensive drugs. It may also underlie the difference in hypertension between different geographically derived population groups, and form a basis for <b>pharmacogenomic</b> <b>approaches</b> to treatment of hypertension...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In the {{pancreatic}} beta-cell, ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels couple metabolism with excitability and {{consist of}} Kir 6. 2 and SUR 1 subunits encoded by KCNJ 11 and ABCC 8, respectively. Sulfonylureas, which inhibit the K(ATP) channel, {{are used to}} treat type 2 diabetes. Rare activating mutations cause neonatal diabetes, whereas the common variants, E 23 K in KCNJ 11 and S 1369 A in ABCC 8, are in strong linkage disequilibrium, constituting a haplotype that predisposes to type 2 diabetes. To date {{it has not been}} possible to establish which of these represents the etiological variant, and functional studies are inconsistent. Furthermore, there have been no studies of the S 1369 A variant or the combined effect of the two on K(ATP) channel function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The patch-clamp technique was used to study the nucleotide sensitivity and sulfonylurea inhibition of recombinant human K(ATP) channels containing either the K 23 /A 1369 or E 23 /S 1369 variants. RESULTS: ATP sensitivity of the K(ATP) channel was decreased in the K 23 /A 1369 variant (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50) ] = 8. 0 vs. 2. 5 mumol/l for the E 23 /S 1369 variant), although {{there was no difference in}} ADP sensitivity. The K 23 /A 1369 variant also displayed increased inhibition by gliclazide, an A-site sulfonylurea drug (IC(50) = 52. 7 vs. 188. 7 nmol/l for the E 23 /S 1369 variant), but not by glibenclamide (AB site) or repaglinide (B site). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the common K 23 /A 1369 variant K(ATP) channel displays decreased ATP inhibition that may contribute to the observed increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the increased sensitivity of the K 23 /A 1369 variant to the A-site sulfonylurea drug gliclazide may provide a <b>pharmacogenomic</b> therapeutic <b>approach</b> for patients with type 2 diabetes who are homozygous for both risk alleles...|$|R
40|$|For {{two decades}} the {{scientific}} community has sought to understand why some people clear hepatitis C virus (HCV) and others do not. Recently, several large genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to interferon lambda 3 (IFNλ 3) {{that are associated with}} the spontaneous resolution and successful treatment of HCV infection. These observations are generating intense research activity; the hope is that IFNλ 3 genetic variants may serve as important predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome and offer new insights into the biological pathways involved in viral control. A <b>pharmacogenomic</b> treatment <b>approach</b> for HCV can now be envisaged, with the incorporation of host genetic variants into a predictive treatment algorithm with other factors. The SNPs associated with the clinical outcome of HCV infection are located some distance from the IFNλ 3 gene itself, and causal genetic variants have yet to be clearly defined. Locating these causal variants, mapping in detail the IFNλ 3 signalling pathways and determining the downstream genetic signature so induced will clarify the role of IFNλ 3 in the pathogenesis of HCV. Clinical studies assessing safety and efficacy in the treatment of HCV with exogenous IFNλ 3 are currently underway. Early results suggest that IFNλ 3 treatment inhibits HCV replication and is associated with a limited side effect profile. However, hepatotoxicity in both healthy volunteers and HCV-infected patients has been described. This review discusses the genetic studies that link IFNλ 3 to both the spontaneous resolution and treatment-induced clearance of HCV and the potential impact of this in clinical practice, the biology of IFNλ 3 as currently understood and how this may impact on HCV infection, and describes the early studies that assess the role of this cytokine in the treatment of patients with HCV...|$|R
