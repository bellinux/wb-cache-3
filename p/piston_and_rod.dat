5000|$|The {{steering}} rack is almost conventional. As {{with a normal}} power-assisted steering setup, there is a rack-and-pinion, and a stepped hydraulic ram with a dividing plate (the piston) in the middle. On {{one side of the}} plate, the piston area is half the area of the other, giving twice the area for the fluid to work on. Thus, with full system pressure on the small area side of the ram, and half system pressure on the large area side, the ram remains perfectly balanced and centred. This is because the lower pressure is working on a larger surface area. The smaller side of the piston is at constant hydraulic pressure, the other side only varies in pressure. NOTE: The author seems to be describing the DS power steering <b>piston</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod,</b> on which the piston {{is in the middle of}} the rod. The SM's steering cylinder has the piston on the end of the rod, which rod's cross-sectional area is half the area of the other side of the piston.

Before this work could be accomplished, the Navy Department {{became aware of}} renewed and {{intensified}} threats {{to the security of}} the California mail steamers from Confederate cruisers and from groups of Southern passengers who were plotting to seize these ships. To help in countering these dangers, Augusta — the only vessel available at New York for convoy duty — departed that port on the morning of 6 November in the wake of North Star, about two and one-half days after that steamer had sailed for Panama. Upon reaching Panama Augusta was to escort North Star back home. She arrived at Aspinwall on the morning of 16 November and, two days later, followed her charge out to sea. With great difficulty, she managed to keep North Star in sight for over three days; but, on the evening of 21 November, a loud and vibrant thump developed in her engine. She followed North Star to the Bahamas: and both ships stopped at Mathew Town, Great Inagua, in that island group. There, engineers inspected Augustas machinery and confirmed that the piston rod was loose. Nevertheless, the commanding officers of the vessels decided to proceed north. About an hour after midnight on 25 November, the loose <b>piston</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> separated with a violent concussion.

40|$|With {{operating}} anvil hammers, {{there are}} rigid impacts of die tools, {{and as a}} result, almost instantaneous impact stops of the falling parts of hammer. Such operating conditions lead to the accelerated breakdowns of rods because of significant wave stresses arising in them. Common differential and integral methods to estimate wave stresses are widespread in engineering practice. However, to use them a researcher has to possess certain skills and special software. We consider the method for estimating the wave stresses in the rods of anvil hammers based on Laplace transforms (LT) of wave equation. The article shows a procedure {{to set up and}} solve differential wave equations by operator method. These equations describe the wave propagation process of strains and stresses in the rods of anvil hammers with rigid impact and taking into account a damping rod connection with the head of hammer. The method takes into consideration an influence of both <b>piston</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> weights and of mechanical and geometrical characteristics of rod on the stress value in the placement of rod in hammer head. Results analysis shows that a sufficiently efficient method for practical improving the durability of rods is the method of damping impact load on the rod through setting the damping devices in the form either of elastic "pad" of one or another design or of hydraulic shock absorbers in the placement of its connection with the hammer head. In this case there is a change of the wave front, it becomes flatter. It is shown that the stresses in the rod are proportional to the amount of wave stresses because of the own impact of rod and piston, which make a total weight of the system. Effect of piston weight on the stresses value at the rod during impact is directly proportional to the ratio of its weight to the rod weight. The geometric parameters of rod and the speed of the falling parts before the impact also influence on the value of stresses in the rod. The represented method of the stresses analysis can be successfully applied to the selection of optimal weights and the geometric parameters of the <b>piston</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> during rigid impact of falling parts without damping and taking into account the energy dissipation until the stiff stop of falling parts of the anvil hammer. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{compressibility}} of the actuating fluid of a {{pneumatic drive}} (compressed air) leads to significant landing of the pneumatic cylinder piston {{at the time}} of stop and hold of the load, a constant component of which can fluctuate significantly for the holding period. There are a lot of factors, which {{have a significant impact on}} the landing value of piston. Those are: an initial position of the piston at its stop, which determines the volume of the an active area of the piston, a value of the constant load component {{at the time of}} stop and its variation for the holding period, a transfer coefficient of the position component of the load, an active area of the pneumatic cylinder piston, as well as reduction in atmospheric pressure, which can significantly affect the operation of the control systems of small aircrafts flying at high altitudes. To reduce the landing value of piston due to changing value of the constant load component for its holding period, it is proposed to use a hydraulic positioner, which comprises a hydraulic cylinder the rod of which is rigidly connected to the rod of the pneumatic cylinder through the traverse, a cross-feed valve of the hydro-cylinder cavities with discrete electro-magnetic control, and adjustable chokes. A programmable logic controller provides the hydraulic positioner control. At the moment the piston stops and the load is held the cross-feed valve overlaps the hydro-cylinder cavities thereby locking the pneumatic cylinder piston and preventing its landing. With available pneumatic cylinder-controlled signal the cross-feed valve connects the <b>piston</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> cavities of the positioner hydro-cylinder, the pneumatic cylinder piston is released and becomes capable of moving. A numerical estimate of landing of the pneumatic cylinder piston and its positioning quality is of essential interest. For this purpose, a technique to calculate the landing of piston has been developed taking into consideration that different factors, which determine operation conditions of the pneumatic cylinder, have the impact on it. Experimental investigation of piston landing was conducted using the pneumatic cylinder with <b>piston</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> diameters of 32 and 16 mm, respectively, at operating pressure of 0. 8 MPa. With a vertical arrangement of the pneumatic cylinder axis, the control weights of a dead-weight pressure-gauge tester created a constant component of the load and its variation, and an indicator with resolution of 0. 05 mm estimated a landing value. The article shows the calculated data of piston landing, which are in good compliance with the experimental results. To substantially reduce the piston landing for the holding period of the load varying in value and sign was designed a hydraulic positioner of pneumatic cylinder piston, and its operation quality is studied on the physical layout of electro-pneumatic control system operating in the discrete and tracking modes. For control system service, work programs of the programmable logic controller integrated in the control circuit of the hydraulic positioner in discrete mode, and, as a digital discriminator, in tracking mode are developed. In conclusion as a result of the research activities the article estimates the impact of factors on the quality of the load position at the time of its hold and notes a high efficiency of the hydraulic positioner of pneumatic cylinder piston both in discrete mode and in tracking one. </p...|$|E

40|$|When {{operating}} the anvil hammers there occur impacts of die tooling {{and as a}} consequence, virtually instantaneous impact stops of motion of drop hammer parts. Such operating conditions come with accelerated failures of the anvil hammer rods because of emerging significant wave stresses. Engineering practice widely uses variation, difference, and integral methods to calculate wave stresses. However, to use them a researcher has to acquire certain skills, and the special programs should be available. The paper considers a method for estimating the wave stress changes in the anvil hammer rods, {{which is based on}} the wave equation of the Laplace transform. It presents a procedure for generating differential equations and their solution using the operator method. These equations describe the wave processes of strain and stress propagation in the anvil hammer rod under non-rigid impact with the compliance obstacle of the drop hammer parts. The work defines how the <b>piston</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> mass and also the mechanical and geometric parameters of the rod influence on the stress level in the rod sealing of the hammer ram. Analysis of the results shows that the stresses in the rod sealing are proportional to the total amount of wave stresses caused by the rod and piston impact included in the total weight of the system. The piston influence on the stresses in the rod under impact is in direct proportion to the ratio of its mass to the mass of the rod. Geometric parameters of the rod and speed of drop parts before the impact influence on the stress value as well. It was found that if the time of impact is less than the time of the shock wave running in forward and backward direction, the impact with a compliance obstacle is equivalent to that of with a rigid obstacle, and the dependence of the wave stresses follows the Zhukovsky formula of direct pressure shock. The presented method of stress calculation can be successfully used to select the optimal mass and the rod and piston geometric parameters under non-rigid impact without damping and taking into account the energy dissipation until stiff stop of drop hammer parts...|$|E
40|$|Sliding {{lip seals}} {{are used in}} {{pneumatic}} cylinders to prevent leakage past the <b>piston</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod.</b> Though they guarantee excellent sealing, the friction forces at contact between lip and counterpart can be relatively high. This results in energy losses and problems with wear on components in relative motion, as well as difficulties in controlling actuator positioning. Standards for compressed air cleanliness restrict the use of greases and lubricants, especially in applications such as the food processing and pharmaceutical industries. A number of studies are thus under way {{in order to find}} effective alternatives to the use of common lubricants. These studies address both seal configuration [1 - 4], and the use of innovative materials [5 - 7]. Other approaches employ systems permitting small amounts of air leakage that operate as lubricated supports, variable-profile pistons [8], or rings with special micromachined surfaces [9 - 10]. Such solutions are not always economical, both because they require precision tolerances and geometries, and because they use special seals, often produced ad hoc. This paper discusses the possibility of using commercial lip seals with a non-conventional mounting on the piston in order to obtain a simple controlled-leakage system that reduces friction forces in pneumatic cylinders economically and effectively. The non-conventional mounting consists of positioning the lip seal in the direction opposite to that used in a conventional installation, so that the contact pressure reduces as air pressure in the chamber rises. In this way, an air gap is created at the sliding interface which allows air in the pressurized chamber to escape past the seal lip, thus reducing the contact force on the barrel. The piston is provided with a hole which exhausts the leakage flow to the atmosphere. To evaluate the validity of this approach, a number of preliminary tests were carried out in [11] to measure flow rate on a type of spring-loaded lip seal consisting of graphite-filled PTFE for barrel diameters of 50 mm. In particular, the tests determined air leakage behavior for different mounting tolerances. This paper presents further tests conducted on the same samples examined in [11] and on another PTFE and graphite-filled PTFE configuration, measuring leakage flow rates and friction forces. Leakage flow rate measurements were carried out with single and double seal installations. The results obtained are discussed together with the advantages of the proposed solution compared to the conventional mountings in ordinary us...|$|E
40|$|Compressibility of air used as {{a working}} medium in {{pneumatic}} control systems raise certain difficulties in calculating dynamic characteristics of the pneumatic drive and solving problems of its regulation. These difficulties are due {{to a number of}} factors:    - flow of compressed air through the narrow working splits of distributive and throttling devices of pneumatic control;    - filling in and discharging the pneumatic actuator cavities of variable volume (<b>piston</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> cavities of the air-cylinder) under conditions of heat and mass transfer;    - simultaneous filling in and discharging a pneumatic cavity of permanent volume (receiver);    - pneumatic cylinder piston end positioning alteration under variable loading and at the moment of shutdown; A number of factors {{have a significant impact on}} the piston end positioning alteration value, namely an initial positioning of the piston at the moment of its shutdown, which determines the volume of the pneumatic cylinder cavity; a value of the permanent component of the load at the moment the piston shuts down and its change during keeping time period; transmission coefficient of the positioning component of the load; a working area of the air-cylinder piston and also an atmospheric pressure reduction, which can significantly affect the operation of control systems of a small aircraft at high altitudes. With a view to deepening the problem of calculation and design of pneumatic actuators, it is shown that the relationship between the parameters of compressed air and their changes is determined by the properties of thermodynamic processes under conditions of heat and mass transfer. In pneumatic actuators for general industrial use, the pressure of compressed air does not exceed a value equal to 1 MPa. In this case, the working medium can be regarded as an ideal gas in simplified calculations. Based on the general equation of thermodynamics, the paper considers the particular cases of a changing gas state process under its constant temperature, pressure, and volume and also in the absolute or partial absence of heat exchange with the surrounding medium. The inconstancy of the compressed air mass during filling in and discharging of pneumatic cavities of variable volume causes non-stationary thermodynamic processes in the pneumatic actuators and requires their specifying in conditions of heat and mass exchange. The pneumatic actuator piston speed is related to the peculiarities of the working medium movement through the narrow slits of distribution and control devices of pneumatic automation due to dependency of the flow on the outflow parameter, which in turn is related to the criticality of the outflow process (the ratio of the pressure at the outlet of the throttling device and at its inlet). It is shown that when calculating and designing the pneumatic drives, including closed-loop ones, as well as for evaluating their dynamic characteristics, a system solution of the equations determining the processes of filling and discharging the cavities of the pneumatic cylinder is required, taking into account the peculiarities of compressed air movement through the narrow slits of pneumatic automation devices. The outflow parameter available in the equations of the pneumatic drive dynamics and determined by the outflow process criticality and by the heat exchange conditions (a poly-tropic index) requires their numerical solution. </p...|$|E
