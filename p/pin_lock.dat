5000|$|The quick-connector {{fittings}} {{which allow}} hoses {{to be easily}} attached and removed from the ports come in two mechanical varieties, namely <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> and ball lock, which are not interchangeable. Historically, <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> kegs were used primarily by the Coca-Cola company, while ball lock kegs were used primarily by Pepsi. On a <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> keg, there are metal posts (pins) extending horizontally from around the port. When the connector is attached, these pins hold it in place. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has two pins, while the [...] "liquid out" [...] has three, {{making it impossible to}} accidentally switch the gas-versus-liquid hoses (which would harmlessly result in carbon dioxide bubbling up through the drink, while gas but no drink would be dispensed). Ball lock kegs have ridges in the ports, which are gripped by small metal balls in the connectors. Both types of kegs are fairly easy to find, though ball-lock seem to be more common.As a result of demand from home brewers, second hand kegs are becoming progressively more scarce and in recent years brand new kegs have come onto the market, manufactured in China to the same specifications.|$|E

50|$|Rekeying a lock is {{replacing}} the old <b>lock</b> <b>pins</b> with new <b>lock</b> <b>pins.</b> <b>Locks</b> are usually re keyed to build master-key systems, make {{a set of}} locks share a common key, or to eliminate compromised keys. Sometimes worn pins are replaced with new pins if the old pins become too short to reach the shear-line. The shear-line is the thin line shared by the plug and it's cylindrical housing. If a pin sits flush with the circumference of the plug it will allow lock rotation. Lock cylinders use different length pins in different combinations to create relatively unique key bitting. Most keys have 5 cuts from bow to tip. If a key has 5 cuts, the <b>lock</b> has 5 <b>pins.</b> Different brand <b>locks</b> each vary in many small ways, this is most true when servicing them. Many manufacturers offer product specific manuals. Information disclosed in manufacturer manuals is often otherwise difficult to find, as is locksmith material in general.|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{artificial}} limbs {{are attached}} to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by suction. The stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a <b>pin</b> <b>lock.</b> Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other stump shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the stump. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the stump, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.|$|E

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded devices continue to integrate more into our daily lives. For this reason, security for embedded devices is a vital issue to address. Attacks such as stack smashing, code injection, data corruption and Return Oriented Programming (ROP) are still a threat to embedded systems. As new methods are developed to defend embedded systems against such attacks, a benchmark to compare these methods is not present. In this work, a benchmark is presented that is aimed at testing the security of new techniques that defend against these common attacks. Two programs are developed that carry three key values needed for a benchmark: realistic embedded application, complex control flow, and being deterministic. The first application is a <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> system and the second is a compression data logger. A complexity evaluation of the two applications revealed that the <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> system contained 171 functions and 190 nodes with 252 edges in the control-flow graph, and the compression data logger contained 192 functions and 1, 357 nodes with 2, 123 edges in the control-flow graph. The current benchmark will be improved in the future by adding more applications with a wider range of complexity...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare the effects of a newly designed magnetic suspension system with that of two existing suspension methods on pistoning inside the prosthetic socket and to compare satisfaction and perceived problems among transtibial amputees. DESIGN: In this prospective study, three lower limb prostheses with three different suspension systems were fabricated for ten transtibial amputees. The participants used each of the three prostheses for 1 mo in random order. Pistoning inside the prosthetic socket was measured by motion analysis system. The Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire was used to evaluate satisfaction and perceived problems with each suspension system. RESULTS: The lowest pistoning motion was found with the suction system compared with the other two suspension systems (P < 0. 05). The new suspension system showed peak pistoning values {{similar to that of the}} <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> system (P = 0. 086). The results of the questionnaire survey revealed significantly higher satisfaction rates with the new system than with the other two systems in donning and doffing, walking, uneven walking, stair negotiation, and overall satisfaction (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The new suspension system has the potential to be used as an alternative to the available suspension systems. The pistoning motion was comparable to that of the other two systems. The new system showed compatible prosthetic suspension with the other two systems (suction and <b>pin</b> <b>lock).</b> The satisfaction with donning and doffing was high with the magnetic system. Moreover, the subjects reported fewer problems with the new system...|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a <b>lock</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>lock</b> block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle.

40|$|Silicone socket {{suspension}} {{technology for}} the upper extremity amputee has been proven to provide increased suspension and range of motion over conventional self suspending sockets. Application of silicone socket suspension has greatly benefitted clients with very short residual limbs and disarticulation level amputations.

Managing the interface between silicone socket and hard socket without compromise to signal loss via an electrical-mechanical interface about the <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> has been investigated, and although function was acceptable, this approach was technically complex. An alternate and potentially simple solution is the use of an electrically conductive silicone interface within the silicone socket and localized at the electrode site. To investigate the feasibility of this approach, a prosthetic socket and silicon sleeve using the conductive material was fabricated and evaluated on a single subject. Signal quality was found to be acceptable but further work is needed to assess the factors that can be targeted to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This approach has the potential to reduce the technical requirements in achieving usable EMG signal capture...|$|E

With the increasing number of features, security locks are the main concern to make the device secure.

In this research paper we evaluated how easy is to use mobile security locks including text or <b>pin</b> <b>lock,</b> pattern lock, face lock. Fingerprint lock. This paper discusses the security issues and compares the existing security solution and technologies. Four different types of security locks were compared pattern lock, pin/text lock, fingerprint lock and face reorganization lock. Participants then completed a questionnaire that asked them to rate the usability of the design, security, functionality, and future use, ease of use, system reliability and error handling of each security lock used in devices. The result will show that which security lock is best for user and help the users to secure their important data with better ratings. Keywords [...] Mobile, Security, Phone lock, secure devices.
