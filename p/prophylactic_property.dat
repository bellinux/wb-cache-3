40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the antimalarial and antioxidant properties of stem bark extracts of Haematostaphis barteri (H.  barteri). Methods: The prophylactic {{activity of the}} plant was performed by dosing mice with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (1. 2  mg/kg), aqueous extract (30, 100, 300  mg/kg) and dichloromethane/methanol (D/M) (30, 100, 300  mg/kg) extracts of H.  barteri for 3 days. On the 4 th day, the mice were inoculated with Plasmodium berghei. The parasite density was estimated for each mouse 72  h post-parasite inoculation. The curative activity of the plant was also performed by inoculating mice with Plasmodium berghei. Three days later, they were treated with artemether-lumefantrine (4  mg/kg), aqueous and D/M extracts of H.  barteri stem bark for 5 days. The in vitro antioxidant property of the aqueous extract was determined by using the reducing power, nitric oxide and total antioxidant capacity assays. Results: The aqueous extract exerted significant (P <  0. 05) curative and prophylactic antimalarial activities. The D/M extract exhibited significant curative (P <  0. 05) but not prophylactic antiplasmodial effect. The aqueous extract exhibited in vitro antioxidant property with IC 50 's of (0. 930  ±  0. 021) mg/mL, (0. 800  ±  0. 001) mg/mL and (0. 22  ±  0. 05) mg/mL in the total antioxidant capacity, reducing power and nitric oxide assays. Histological assessment of the liver of aqueous and D/M treated animals did not reveal any sign of toxicity. Conclusions: H.  barteri is not toxic which exerted significant curative antiplasmodial effects but the <b>prophylactic</b> <b>property</b> was however fraction dependent. The mechanism of the antiplasmodial activity of H.  barteri may partly be mediated by its antioxidant property...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Highly conserved {{intracellular}} proteins from Leishmania {{have been}} described as antigens in natural and experimental infected mammals. The present study aimed to evaluate the antigenicity and <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties</b> of the Leishmania infantum Poly (A) binding proteins (LiPABPs). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three different members of the LiPABP family {{have been described}}. Recombinant tools based on these proteins were constructed: recombinant proteins and DNA vaccines. The three recombinant proteins were employed for coating ELISA plates. Sera from human and canine patients of visceral leishmaniasis and human patients of mucosal leishmaniasis recognized the three LiPABPs. In addition, the protective efficacy of a DNA vaccine based on the combination of the three Leishmania PABPs has been tested in a model of progressive murine leishmaniasis: BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major. The induction of a Th 1 -like response against the LiPABP family by genetic vaccination was able to down-regulate the IL- 10 predominant responses elicited by parasite LiPABPs after infection in this murine model. This modulation resulted in a partial protection against L. major infection. LiPABP vaccinated mice showed a reduction on the pathology that was accompanied by a decrease in parasite burdens, in antibody titers against Leishmania antigens and in the IL- 4 and IL- 10 parasite-specific mediated responses in comparison to control mice groups immunized with saline or with the non-recombinant plasmid.

40|$|Abstract: Interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β) and tumor {{necrosis}} factor α (TNF-α) are key cytokines {{that drive}} {{the production of}} inflammatory mediators and matrix-degrading enzymes in osteoarthritis (OA). These proinflammatory cytokines bind to their respective cell surface receptors and activate inflammatory signaling pathways culminating with the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor that can be triggered {{by a host of}} stress-related stimuli including, excessive mechanical stress and ECM degradation products. Once activated, NF-κB regulates the expression of many cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, inflammatory mediators, and several matrix-degrading enzymes. Therefore, proinflammatory cytokines, their cell surface receptors, NF-κB and downstream signaling pathways are therapeutic targets in OA.

The instability of a major component, allicin 5, limits the commercial viability of garlic oil extracts. The synthesis of garlics organosulfur compounds has been performed in batch reactors. In this thesis, flow reactors were utilised to improve the throughput, reduce the operating conditions. The thermolysis of allicin 5 is the solitary approach to produce the garlic metabolite, ajoene 14. Ajoene 14 has greater stability compared to allicin 5 that possesses interesting biological activity. The primary three-step synthesis investigated consisted of dialkyl polysulfide synthesis, subsequent oxidation and finally the terminal thermolysis. In addition, other garlic metabolites have also been produced. The synthesis of unsymmetrical monosulfides and their subsequent oxidation was investigated using novel heterogeneous packed-bed flow reactors. The stable amino acid, alliin 15, is the precursor of allicin 5. Alliin 15 was also synthesised in homogeneous flow mode.

Recombinant {{versions of the}} four ribosomal proteins from Leishmania major were recognized by sera from human and canine patients suffering different clinical forms of leishmaniasis. The <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties</b> of these proteins were first studied in the experimental model of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major inoculation into BALB/c mice. The administration of two of them, LmL 3 or LmL 5 combined with CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) was able to protect BALB/c mice against L. major infection. Vaccinated mice showed smaller lesions and parasite burden compared to mice inoculated with vaccine diluent or vaccine adjuvant. Protection was correlated with an antigen-specific increased production of IFN-Î³ paralleled by a decrease of the antigen-specific IL- 10 mediated response in protected mice relative to non-protected controls. Further, it was demonstrated that BALB/c mice vaccinated with recombinant LmL 3 or LmL 5 plus CpG-ODN were also protected against the development of cutaneous lesions following inoculation of L. braziliensis.

However, there are concerns about the use of DNA vaccines in certain populations such as newborns and pregnant women. Thus, the optimization of vaccination strategies that circumvent this limitation is a priority. This study evaluated the efficacy of a single dose subunit vaccine based on recombinant Hsp 65 protein against infection with M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv. The Hsp 65 protein in this study was either associated or not with immunostimulants, and was encapsulated in biodegradable PLGA microspheres. Our results demonstrate that the protein was entrapped in microspheres of adequate diameter to be engulfed by phagocytes. Mice vaccinated with a single dose of Hsp 65 -microspheres or Hsp 65 + CpG-microspheres developed both humoral and cellular-specific immune responses. However, they did not protect mice against challenge with M. tuberculosis. By contrast, Hsp 65 +KLK-microspheres induced specific immune responses that reduced bacilli loads and minimized lung parenchyma damage.

The recent role out of antiretroviral therapies and new antimalarials, such as artemisinin combination therapies, raise additional concerns regarding possible synergistic and antagonistic effects on efficacy and toxicity. Co-trimoxazole, {{which is used to}} prevent opportunistic infections, has been shown to have strong antimalarial <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties,</b> despite its long-term use and increasing antifolate resistance. The administration of efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with amodiaquine– artesunate has been associated with increased toxicity.

Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and artemether–lumefantrine have a synergistic effect in terms of improved malaria treatment outcomes, with no apparent increase in the risk of toxicity. Overall, for the prevention and treatment of malaria in HIV-infected populations, the current standard of care is similar to that in non-HIV-infected populations. The available data show that the wider use of insecticide-treated bed-nets, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy might substantially reduce the morbidity of malaria in HIV-infected patients.

The recent role out of antiretroviral therapies and new antimalarials, such as artemisinin combination therapies, raise additional concerns regarding possible synergistic and antagonistic effects on efficacy and toxicity. Co-trimoxazole, {{which is used to}} prevent opportunistic infections, has been shown to have strong antimalarial <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties,</b> despite its long-term use and increasing antifolate resistance. The administration of efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with amodiaquine–artesunate has been associated with increased toxicity. Recent in vivo observations have confirmed that protease inhibitors have strong antimalarial properties. Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and artemether–lumefantrine have a synergistic effect in terms of improved malaria treatment outcomes, with no apparent increase in the risk of toxicity. Overall, for the prevention and treatment of malaria in HIV-infected populations, the current standard of care is similar to that in non-HIV-infected populations. The available data show that the wider use of insecticide-treated bed-nets, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy might substantially reduce the morbidity of malaria in HIV-infected patients. These observations show that those accessing care for HIV infection are now, paradoxically, well protected from malaria. These findings therefore highlight the need for confirmatory diagnosis of malaria in HIV-infected individuals receiving these interventions, and the provision of different artemisinin-based combination therapies to treat malaria only when the diagnosis is confirmed...|$|R
40|$|In {{competitive}} and constantly changing market conditions special {{attention has been}} paid to market researches. The results of these studies become the basis for formation of sales estimates, and projected levels of revenues and profits from sales. Market researches are the essential condition to make offered goods successful at the market. It is market researches that help companies to realize the control of consumers' needs changing. The market researches on demand for dietary and prophylactic nutrition in the Saratov Region have been the research objective. In accordance with the given objective the following goals have been formed: 1) finding out the most spread diseases among the population; 2) determination of the average age of people suffering from one or another disease; 3) studying demand of products with food fiber additives; 4) analysis of respondent's preference regarding the addition of natural vegetable additives to foodstuff; 5) demand for dietary and prophylactic foodstuff among the population. Since the survey has been carried out among people suffering from various diseases, particular attention during the market research has been turned to the medical and <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties</b> of food fibers to find out the attitude of the respondents to functional foodstuff. The dynamics of noninfectious diseases, the population health status depending on age, and increase of overweight people during 2012 – 2014 have been shown. As a result of questionnaire data processing it has been ascertained that the population is of low awareness regarding the necessity to consume foodstuff with radioprotective and chelator properties. The researches have demonstrated that dietary and prophylactic foodstuff is in demand and consequently the development of such products is reasonable...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Тhe {{principal}} problems, {{which the}} food industry of Ukraine is confronted with, is to provide the population with foodstuffs of high biological value. At the moment the technology of producing traditional foodstuffs is being improved and new generation of foodstuffs, which meet today’s requirements, is being made. These are foodstuffs with balanced composition, low calorie, sugar and fat content, high content of healthy ingredients for functional and therapeutic purposes. Taking into account that bread {{is one of the}} principal foodstuffs, the task of reducing caloric content of baked goods and enriching them with dietary fibers, vitamins and mineral substances is important and urgent. One of the main tasks of {{the food industry}} in Ukraine today is the search for new types of additives that contain a complex of functional ingredients and can give therapeutic and <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties</b> for food products. The article presents the results of a clinical study of dietary additive "Rapamid" and flour products using this additive for the human body. The authors studied radioprotective properties of dietary additive "Rapamid" and flour products with it. Also it was investigated the influence of these additives and products with it on the general clinical condition of the children who receive high doses of radiation. The obtained results show that additional appointment to the normal diet and the basic treatment of dietary аdditive "Rapamid" and flour products with the use of this additive promotes children's immunity, disease prevention with stress and physical stress. Dietary additive "Rapamid" and flour products using this have antioxidant, anti-allergic and radioprotective properties, have positively influences on the cardio - vascular and hematopoietic systems, displays the body of toxic elements and radionuclides...|$|R
40|$|Several human {{monoclonal}} antibodies (hmAbs) exhibit relatively potent {{and broad}} neutralizing activity against HIV- 1, {{but there has}} not been much success in using them as potential therapeutics. We have previously hypothesized and demonstrated that small engineered antibodies can target highly conserved epitopes that are not accessible by full-size antibodies. However, their potency has not been comparatively evaluated with known HIV- 1 -neutralizing hmAbs against large panels of primary isolates. We report here the inhibitory activity of an engineered single chain antibody fragment (scFv), m 9, against several panels of primary HIV- 1 isolates from group M (clades A-G) using cell-free and cell-associated virus in cell line-based assays. M 9 was much more potent than scFv 17 b, and more potent than or comparable to the best-characterized broadly neutralizing hmAbs IgG 1 b 12, 2 G 12, 2 F 5 and 4 e 10. It also inhibited cell-to-cell transmission of HIV- 1 with higher potency than enfuvirtide (t- 20, Fuzeon). M 9 competed with a sulfated CCR 5 N-terminal peptide for binding to gp 120 -CD 4 complex, suggesting an overlapping epitope with the coreceptor binding site. M 9 did not react with phosphatidylserine (pS) and cardiolipin (CL), nor did it react with a panel of autoantigens in an antinuclear autoantibody (ANA) assay. We further found that escape mutants resistant to m 9 did not emerge in an immune selection assay. these results suggest that m 9 is a novel anti-HIV- 1 candidate with potential therapeutic or <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties,</b> and its epitope is a new target for drug or vaccine development. © 2010 Landes Bioscience. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Medicinal {{plants are}} {{possible}} sources for future novel antioxidant compounds {{in food and}} pharmaceutical formulations. Recent attention on medicinal plants emanates from their long historical utilisation in folk medicine {{as well as their}} <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties.</b> However, there is a dearth of scientific data on the efficacy and stability of the bioactive chemical constituents in medicinal plants after prolonged storage. This is a frequent problem in African Traditional Medicine. Methods The phytochemical, antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase-inhibitory properties of 21 medicinal plants were evaluated after long-term storage of 12 or 16 years using standard in vitro methods in comparison to freshly harvested materials. Results The total phenolic content of Artemisia afra, Clausena anisata, Cussonia spicata, Leonotis intermedia and Spirostachys africana were significantly higher in stored compared to fresh materials. The flavonoid content were also significantly higher in stored A. afra, C. anisata, C. spicata, L. intermedia, Olea europea and Tetradenia riparia materials. With the exception of Ekebergia capensis and L. intermedia, {{there were no significant differences}} between the antioxidant activities of stored and fresh plant materials as measured in the β- carotene-linoleic acid model system. Similarly, the EC 50 values based on the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay were generally lower for stored than fresh material. Percentage inhibition of acetylcholinesterase was generally similar for both stored and fresh plant material. Stored plant material of Tetradenia riparia and Trichilia dregeana exhibited significantly higher AChE inhibition than the fresh material. Conclusions The current study presents evidence that medicinal plants can retain their biological activity after prolonged storage under dark conditions at room temperature. The high antioxidant activities of stable bioactive compounds in these medicinal plants offer interesting prospects for the identification of novel principles for application in food and pharmaceutical formulations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Jonathan I. Israel {{claims that}} Christian ‘controversialists’ endeavoured first to obscure or efface Spinozism, materialism, and non-authoritarian free thought, and then, {{in the early}} eighteenth century, to fight these openly, and desperately. Israel appears to have adopted the view of {{enlightenment}} as a battle against what Voltaire has called ‘l’infâme’, and David Hume has labelled ‘stupidity, Christianity, and ignorance’. These authors’ barbs were launched later in the century, however, {{in the period of}} the high Enlightenment, following polarizing controversies of mid-century. This chapter argues that many Enlightenment figures, including Hume and Voltaire, were far more involved within a culture {{in the second quarter of}} the century that was less divided against Christian interlocutors, less rigid, and more complex than these two wished to suggest, in retrospect, after mid-century. A Christian literary and scientific circle was productive and prominent in French Enlightenment culture, particularly in the personages of François Prévost, Pierre Desfontaines, Samuel Formey and Noël Pluche, and in the pages of ubiquitous journals and occasional publications. Many of the Catholics among these lumières held the education and retained the status of ‘abbé’, a title with <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties</b> that legitimated expansive inquiry – into topics such as libertinism and atheism – and facilitated in-print exchanges with Voltaire and other less orthodox figures. This wing of the Enlightenment developed a culture that reflected, and sometimes promoted, Christian theology – especially in the tradition of natural theology – and displayed broadly Christian and politically conservative values. The latter aspect served in part to motivate concerted efforts toward their marginalization by others, but the French Enlightenment of the eighteenth century’s second quarter was actually very mixed, and not so very radical; rather, it became polarized at mid-century, and in retrospect, the Christians of this wing were written out of the history by the likes of Voltaire and Hume...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the <b>prophylactic</b> <b>properties</b> of integrin CD 18 -βA peptide in a murine model of abdominal polymicrobial peritonitis and sepsis. Methods: Bacterial sepsis was induced in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery. Inflicted mice were then injected with either sterile saline or CD 18 -βA peptide intraperi-toneally at 2 h after surgery, and were sacrifced at 12 and 24 h after surgery. Blood samples were immediately collected, and analyzed for endotoxin activity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interleukin (IL) - 6. Lungs and liver were studied for CD 45 + leukocyte and CD 3 mRNA content. Pulmonary expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1, vascular {{cell adhesion molecule}} (VCAM) and E-selectin was also determined. Results: Intraperitoneal injection of CD 18 -βA peptide signifcantly suppressed circulating endotoxin activity (P < 0. 01) at 24 h, as well as serum levels of TNF-α (P < 0. 05 at 12 and 24 h) and IL- 6 (P < 0. 01 at 12 h, P < 0. 05 at 24 h) in CLP-inflicted mice. CD 18 -βA peptide also abrogated leukocyte infiltration into liver and lungs as unveiled by reduced CD 45 + leukocyte and CD 3 mRNA contents. Furthermore, the peptide significantly reduced pulmonary expression of VCAM (P < 0. 01 at 12 h, P < 0. 001 at 24 h), E-selectin (P < 0. 01 at 12 and 24 h), and ICAM- 1 (P < 0. 01 at 12 h, P < 0. 001 at 24 h). These actions of CD 18 -βA peptide collectively protected septic mice against lethality (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: CD 18 -βA peptide is a potent endotoxin antagonist that can protect surgical patients against sepsis-associated lethality. © 2010 Baishideng.
