This is often highly temperature dependant, and may be the result of either a <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> or a high defect concentration. These materials are used in all solid-state supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells, and in various kinds of chemical sensors.|$|E
5|$|Lithium's {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion is {{twice that of}} aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E

40|$|Metal cutting is {{a complex}} {{material}} removal process with elastic deformation (ED) and plastic deformation (PD) together taking place in chip formation and surface generation. PD consists of shear PD (SPD) and normal PD (NPD) intrinsically relevant to cutting mechanism, such as pure cutting and ploughing. In ultra-precision machining, PD induces <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> of Zn-Al alloy once, i. e., phase decomposition. In this study, the distinctive effects of SPD and NPD in surface generation on <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> of Zn-Al alloy in ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM) with horizontal cutting under up-cutting mode were firstly discussed. At the machined surfaces of Zn-Al alloy, NPD and SPD both results in <b>phase</b> <b>changes,</b> but only NPD changes preferred crystal orientation; and PD under high-speed cutting induces <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> twice, i. e., four-phase transformation occurs after phase decomposition, namely twin <b>phase</b> <b>changes,</b> which were firstly observed.

5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and the core part of optical fibers. It has replaced titania as the dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption. GeSbTe is a <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> material used for its optic properties, such as that used in rewritable DVDs.|$|E

The <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> allows a substantial reduction in {{the mass of the}} material required for effective heat storage (the heat of fusion of sodium sulfate decahydrate is 82 kJ/mol or 252 kJ/kg), with the further advantage of a consistency of temperature as long as sufficient material in the appropriate phase is available.|$|E

25|$|Indium {{lowers the}} melting point and {{improves}} ductility. In presence of lead {{it forms a}} ternary compound that undergoes <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> at 114°C. Very high cost (several times of silver), low availability. Easily oxidizes, which causes problems for repairs and reworks, especially when oxide-removing flux cannot be used, e.g. during GaAs die attachment. Indium alloys are used for cryogenic applications, and for soldering gold as gold dissolves in indium much less than in tin. Indium can also solder many nonmetals (e.g. glass, mica, alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia, porcelain, brick, concrete, and marble). Prone to diffusion into semiconductors and cause undesired doping. At elevated temperatures easily diffuses through metals. Low vapor pressure, suitable for use in vacuum systems. Forms brittle intermetallics with gold; indium-rich solders on thick gold are unreliable. Indium-based solders are prone to corrosion, especially in presence of chloride ions.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. States {{of matter}} and <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> are {{important}} topics in {{the teaching and learning}} of physical science. It is a common fact that learners find it difficult to understand the states {{of matter and}} <b>phase</b> <b>changes.</b> One of the main reasons is that learners do not abandon their own naive perceptions when the scientific concepts are taught. They do not connect their experiences outside the laboratory / classroom with their experience in science lessons. Learners consequently hold their own views even after instruction. According to the constructivist view on teaching and learning educators need to take learners' perceptions into account in the teaching of these topics. The first aim with {{this study was to determine}} learners' alterative conceptions about the states of matter and <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> from a literature study. The second was to determine by means of an empirical study the alterative conceptions Grade 11 learners still hold after instruction of the topics. The empirical survey was conducted amongst a group of 110 Grade 11 learners studying physical science. A questionnaire was used to obtain information on this group of learners' knowledge on the states of matter and of <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> after instruction of these topics. From the results of the questionnaire alternative conceptions could be identified. The results of the empirical study indicate that learners still have alternative conceptions about the states of matter and <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> after instruction. Alternative conceptions were identified and recommendations on how to teach the states of matter and <b>phase</b> <b>changes</b> more effectively were made. Master...|$|R
