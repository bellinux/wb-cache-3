40|$|Essay II: Optimal <b>Procyclical</b> <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Policy</b> Without Procyclical Government Spending <b>Procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> can {{be caused}} by either procyclical {{government}} expenditure, countercyclical taxes or both. The majority of models which try to explain <b>procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> as the result of optimal policy have procyclical government expenditures. This paper develops a model which optimally generates <b>procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> while keeping government expenditures acyclical. Instead, taxes are optimally countercyclical. The model uses endogenous sovereign default to generate an environment where interest rates are lower in booms than in recessions. If household's have insufficient access to financial instruments it is optimal for the government to lower taxes and borrow during booms. This enables impatient households to benefit from the lower interest rates in booms by helping the consumer bring consumption forward...|$|E

40|$|The Financial Crisis has hit {{particularly}} hard countries like Ireland or Spain. <b>Procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> {{has contributed to}} a boom-bust cycle that undermined fiscal positions and deepened current account deficits during the boom. We set up an RBC model of a small open economy, following Mendoza (1991), and introduce the effect of fiscal policy decisions that change over the cycle. We calibrate the model on data for Ireland, and simulate the effect of different spending policies in response to supply shocks. <b>Procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> distorts intertemporal allocation decisions. Temporary spending boosts in booms spur investment, and hence the need for external finance, and so generates very volatile cycles in investment and the current account.

The idea that fiscal policy in developing countries is procyclical has all but reached the status of conventional wisdom.

The introduction of a political friction, in which successive governments disagree on the desired distribution of public spending, can lead to <b>procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies.</b> Numerical simulations of the model allow us to compare quantitatively the relative role of common explanations for fiscal procyclicality.

40|$|Rainy Day Funds (RDFs) have an {{important}} role in the USA. They allow States Â– which usually have rules requiring a balanced budget for current revenue and spending Â– to limit <b>procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies.</b> This paper examines the possible role of RDFs in the European fiscal framework. The analysis suggests that RDFs would not fundamentally alter the incentive problems at the root of the difficulties in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, RDFs are not an option for countries with high deficits. However, for low-deficit countries, RDFs can lessen the rigidity of the 3 per cent threshold in bad times. RDFs could be introduced on a voluntary basis at the national level and could contribute to make the rules more country-specific. The introduction of RDFs would require a change in the definition of the Â“Maastricht deficitÂ”: deposits and withdrawals should be considered respectively as budget expense and revenue. In this way, the balances held in RDFs could be spent in bad times without an increase in the deficit. To ensure that RDFs are not used opportunistically, deposits should only be made out of budget surpluses and circumstances allowing withdrawals should be specified ex ante. rainy day funds, fiscal rules, EMU...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to three important topics on {{the conduct of}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> First, although {{the positive effects of}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> on the aggregate economy are often discussed, the literature frequently omits a normative analysis and, moreover, fails to consider political frictions to policy: something frequently observed in <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> debates. This thesis attempts to address these omissions through constructing New Keynesian `dynamic stochastic general equilibrium' (DSGE) models with heterogeneous agents. Exogenous shocks are shown to impact households differently and in polarizing ways, and the results imply that there is a normative justification for countercyclical <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> but on redistributive rather than aggregate grounds; austerity is observed to have the biggest impact on those agents who do not engage in capital markets, unless targeted on raising production taxes. Second, DSGE models frequently fail to replicate the empirical regularity that private consumption crowds in fiscal stimuli. This thesis overcomes this anomaly through combining the assumptions of external habit persistence and credit-constrained households, both of which are frequently used in the literature, but often in isolation of one another. External habit persistence creates an interaction between the heterogeneous agents whereby the consumption of one impacts the future preferences of others, and in so doing, introduces herding behaviour into an otherwise standard DSGE model. Finally, there is widespread evidence that <b>procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> have been prevalent in developing countries and often in some industrial nations. It is therefore surprising that, in contrast to the wealth of studies on the sources of such policy, potential consequences have been largely ignored in the existing literature.

A related strand of papers has attempted to catalog current account reversals and capital account "sudden stops. " This paper offers an encompassing approach with an algorithm cataloging capital inflow bonanzas in both advanced and emerging economies during 1980 - 2007 for 181 countries and 1960 - 2007 for a subset of 66 economies from all regions. In line with earlier studies, global factors, such as commodity prices, international interest rates, and growth in the world’s largest economies, have a systematic effect on the global capital flow cycle. Bonanzas are no blessing for advanced or emerging market economies. In {{the case of the}} latter, capital inflow bonanzas are associated with a higher likelihood of economic crises (debt defaults, banking, inflation and currency crashes). Bonanzas in developing countries are associated with <b>procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> and attempts to curb or avoid an exchange rate appreciation - very likely contributing to economic vulnerability. For the advanced economies, the results are not as stark, but bonanzas are associated with more volatile macroeconomic outcomes for GDP growth, inflation, and the external accounts.

40|$|The {{opposite}} {{should occur}} in recessions. 1 In practice, {{in many developing}} countries <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> has the opposite properties: it is procyclical. In particular, government spending as a share of GDP goes up during booms and down in recessions, and deficits increase in booms and decrease in recessions. In OECD countries, in contrast, <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is generally countercyclical. 2 Gavin and Perotti (1997) were the first to point out that in Latin America <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is procyclical; then Talvi and Vegh (2005), Catão and Sutton (2002), Manasse (2005), and Kaminski, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) noted {{that this is not a}} Latin American phenomenon only: Procyclicality of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is common in many—though not all—developing countries. Why do many countries follow seemingly sub-optimal <b>procyclical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> that add to macroeconomic instability? A common answer relies upon the supply of credit. In bad times, many developing countries cannot borrow, or can do so only at very high interest rates, therefore they cannot run deficits and have to cut spending; in booms, they can borrow more easily and choose to do so, increasing public spending (cf. Gavin and Perotti 1997; Catão and Sutton 2002; Riascos and Vegh 2003; Kaminski, Reinhart, and Vegh 2004). 3 In our view, however, this argument is incomplete, because it begs two critical questions. First, why don’t these countries self-insure by accumulating reserves in good times, so that they are less likely to face binding credit constraints in recessions? Second, why would lenders not provide funds to countries, even in recessions, if they were convinced that the borrowing would optimally smooth out the cycle? To answer both questions one needs to consider the political arena, as others have done and as we do in this paper. In Talvi and Vegh (2005), the presence of surpluses increases the government propensity to spend; the present article and Talvi and Vegh (2005) are complementary because they focus on how a political distortion interacts with different economic structures (in particular with the variability of revenues). In this article, we focus on deriving the political distortion. A different but not mutually exclusive political explanation is the “voracit...|$|R
