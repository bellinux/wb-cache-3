5|$|After {{the brigade}} had been disbanded in June 1948, its battalions were reformed, by {{renumbering}} {{those in the}} 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade. The 5th (Scottish) <b>Parachute</b> Battalion became the 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, the 4th/6th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion the 1st <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, and the 7th (Light Infantry) <b>Parachute</b> Battalion the 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion. Finally, in July 1948, the 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade was renumbered the 16th <b>Parachute</b> Brigade Group, taking its one and six numbers from the two wartime divisions.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{the brigade}} {{comprised}} the 1st, 2nd, 17th <b>Parachute</b> Battalions and the 16th (<b>Parachute)</b> Field Ambulance. The 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion {{had left to}} join the 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade, replacing the 1st Canadian <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, who had returned to Canada at the cessation of hostilities. The 1st Airborne Division was disbanded in November 1945, and the brigade assigned to the 6th Airborne Division in Palestine. In 1946 the 17th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion amalgamated with the 7th (Light Infantry) <b>Parachute</b> Battalion retaining {{the number of the}} senior unit. The brigade formation changed again in 1948. Further amalgamations and the general reduction in the post war British Army resulted in the brigade being formed from the 1st <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, the amalgamated 2nd/3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion and the amalgamated 8th/9th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion. By July 1948 the 6th Airborne Division had been withdrawn to England and disbanded, leaving the 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade as the only regular British Army <b>parachute</b> formation.|$|E

5|$|Brigadier Richard N. Gale, {{who would}} later command the 6th Airborne Division, took command of the 1st <b>Parachute</b> Brigade on its {{formation}} in September 1941. A triangular brigade formation with three battalions, Gale decided that rather than dividing the 11th Special Air Service Battalion among the brigade's battalions, he would keep the already trained unit together. On 15September it was renamed the 1st <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, which, together with the newly raised 2nd and 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalions, now formed the 1st <b>Parachute</b> Brigade. These battalions were formed from volunteers aged between twenty-two and thirty-two years of age. Only men in infantry units were selected and only ten men from any one unit were allowed to leave. Early in 1942 the brigade was joined by the 4th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, the 16th (<b>Parachute)</b> Field Ambulance, and the 1st (<b>Parachute)</b> Squadron, Royal Engineers (RE). The 4th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion left the brigade in July {{to become the first}} battalion in the 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a new 4th <b>Parachute</b> Brigade {{was raised}} {{as part of}} Territorial Army and {{assigned}} to the 16th Airborne Division.

In 1950, the brigade was renumbered the 44th <b>Parachute</b> Brigade (TA).|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a new 5th <b>Parachute</b> Brigade (Territorial) {{was raised}} {{as part of}} the Territorial Army and {{assigned}} to the 16th Airborne Division.

5|$|In October 1947, the War Office {{announced}} {{its intention to}} reduce the division's strength by one brigade. The 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade, being more recently established than the other units, was selected to be disbanded. However, instead of disbanding its battalions, {{it was decided to}} amalgamate them. The 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion joined with the 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion and was renumbered the 2nd/3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, and the brigade's other two battalions were amalgamated to become the 8th/9th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion. Both of these new units would serve in the 1st <b>Parachute</b> Brigade. The amalgamation of the 2nd and 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalions was completed in December, and the 8th and 9th <b>Parachute</b> Battalions in early January. Finally, the brigade headquarters was disbanded at the end of January. During their service in Palestine, nine men from the brigade had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Permission {{was granted}} to form another <b>parachute</b> brigade in July 1942, {{numbered}} the 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade, and Brigadier Ernest E.

At the same time the 5th <b>Parachute</b> Brigade crossed the canal further south. The 7th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion were ordered to secure the area to the east of Putot-en-Auge, while the 12th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion assaulted the village. En route, the 7th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion came under fire from German machine-guns, then observed a line of troops approaching them.

5|$|By 04:30 on 14July, the 1st <b>Parachute</b> Battalion was {{in control}} of Primosole Bridge, but the Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion were well dug in to the south. Beyond them, 140 men of the 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion had {{occupied}} the three small hills, and taken 500Italian prisoners. In numbers, both battalions had little more than company strength. The 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion had suffered {{the worst in the}} scattered <b>parachute</b> drop, and only a few of their men had arrived at the bridge. With no command structure, they were attached to the 1st <b>Parachute</b> Battalion to help defend the bridge. To the north, the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the 10th Arditi Regiment had been informed of the <b>parachute</b> landings. Many of the 372nd Battalion had disappeared, while the Arditi mounted the first of a number of attacks on the British positions. Without the support of any heavy weapons, they were easily fought off.|$|E
5|$|By 1944 {{the brigade}} had {{increased}} {{in size and}} now comprised the 1st, 2nd, 3rd <b>Parachute</b> battalions, the 16th (<b>Parachute)</b> Field Ambulance and the 1st (<b>Parachute)</b> Squadron Royal Engineers (RE) {{as well as the}} 3rd (Airlanding) Light Battery Royal Artillery (RA) with 75mm howitzers, 1st (Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery RA with 6pounder and 17pounder guns along with a Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) detachment.|$|E
5|$|Defence {{cuts in the}} British {{armed forces}} after the war forced a {{reduction}} in the number of <b>parachute</b> brigades.

5|$|Despite the setbacks, {{the units}} {{assembled}} with only slight casualties but the changing circumstances at Arnhem meant that their roles were quickly changed. The 11th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion {{and the rest}} of the South Staffords were immediately despatched to Arnhem to assist in the attempt to break through to the bridge, where they linked up with the 1st and 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalions after dark. Hicks' decision to send the 11th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion to Arnhem (thus weakening the 4th <b>Parachute</b> Brigade) dismayed Hackett, who remonstrated with Hicks to no avail. However, he was given command of the King's Own Scottish Borderers who were moving toward LZ 'L' to secure it for Tuesday's landing. The 10th and 156th <b>Parachute</b> Battalions moved north of the railway line to take up their planned defensive positions north west of Arnhem but the leading elements of 156th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion made contact with the main 9th SS blocking line after dark and withdrew for the night.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the {{division}} comprised the 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade and 5th <b>Parachute</b> Brigade, both consisting of <b>parachute</b> infantry, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade, composed of glider infantry. However the 5th <b>Parachute</b> Brigade {{had been sent}} to] India ahead {{of the rest of}} {{the division}}. So when the division was dispatched to the Middle East, the 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade was assigned to bring them up to strength. In May 1946, after the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded, the 1st <b>Parachute</b> Brigade joined the division, replacing the 6thAirlanding Brigade. In August1946, the 5thParachute Brigade returned from the Far East, and joined the division, but was disbanded soon afterwards. The next major manpower development came in 1947, when the 3rdParachute Brigade was disbanded and the 2ndParachute Brigade, while remaining part of the division, was withdrawn to England, then sent to Germany.|$|E
5|$|During this period, 1st Airborne Division was {{composed}} of only two <b>parachute</b> battalions, of which only one (1st <b>Parachute</b> Battalion), was fully trained.
