Hitler did not speak publicly about the killings, and seems never to have visited the concentration camps.|$|E

5|$|Human rights organisations accuse {{police and}} {{military}} forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and political activists. Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities, and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding <b>political</b> <b>opponents</b> {{at the behest of}} the government. However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Himmler {{organised}} an SS {{intelligence service}} which {{became known as}} the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service) under his deputy, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich. This organisation was tasked with locating and arresting communists and other <b>political</b> <b>opponents.</b> Himmler hoped it would eventually totally replace the existing police system.

This holding company owned housing corporations, factories and publishing houses.|$|E

Some experts, officials, members of Congress and <b>political</b> <b>opponents</b> contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred {{against the backdrop of}} Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.|$|E
5|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, {{they agreed that}} Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new {{civilian}} government could be formed. However, because of their disunity, the trio did little. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiêm and Minh. The US military commander in Vietnam William Westmoreland deplored the concessions Khánh made to <b>political</b> <b>opponents</b> and lobbied Washington for permission to attack North Vietnam, saying that Khánh could not survive without it.|$|E
5|$|Although Michael VIII Palaiologos engaged {{him in a}} {{marriage}} alliance and awarded him with the high title of sebastokratōr, John remained the foremost of Palaiologos' Greek opponents throughout the latter's reign. A staunch opponent of the Union of the Churches promoted by Palaiologos for political reasons, he provided refuge to several <b>political</b> <b>opponents</b> of the emperor, and even convoked synods that anathematized Palaiologos and the supporters of the Union. He resisted several attempts by Byzantine armies to conquer Thessaly, and allied himself with Palaiologos' Latin enemies, including the Duchy of Athens and Charles of Anjou. He died in 1289, leaving the rule of Thessaly to his sons, Constantine and Theodore.|$|E

The ISA was later used to oppress <b>political</b> <b>opponents</b> or those dedicated to non-violent activities, which Hickling later said was not his intention.|$|E
5|$|Described as the {{definitive}} deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, {{and contributed to}} long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Attempting to justify the coup, the CIA launched Operation PBHISTORY, which sought evidence of Soviet influence in Guatemala among documents from the Árbenz era: the effort was a failure. Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers, banning opposition parties, imprisoning and torturing <b>political</b> <b>opponents,</b> and reversing the social reforms of the revolution. Nearly four decades of civil war followed, as leftist guerrillas fought a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities included a genocide of the Maya peoples.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosed with a {{brain tumor}} in March 2017, Noriega {{suffered}} complications during surgery, and died two months later.

He was known for his complicated relationship with the U.S., being described as being its ally and nemesis at the same time.

5|$|During the 20s, Sejanus {{gradually}} accumulated {{power by}} consolidating his influence over Tiberius and eliminating potential <b>political</b> <b>opponents,</b> including the emperor's son Drusus Julius Caesar. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in AD 26, Sejanus {{was left in}} control of the administration of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power in AD 31, the year his career culminated with the consulship. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.|$|E
5|$|During the Revolutionary War, Lyon {{initially}} {{served under}} Horatio Gates in upstate New York and Vermont. In {{a version of}} the event later circulated by his <b>political</b> <b>opponents,</b> he was cashiered for cowardice and ordered to carry a wooden sword to represent his shame. In Lyon's version, he and his men were assigned to guard wheat growing in the fields near Jericho, Vermont; unhappy at not being put to good use, he asked to leave Gates' command and join the regiment commanded by Seth Warner. Lyon's conduct was vindicated by both Arthur St. Clair and James Wilkinson.|$|E
5|$|Each republican {{magistrate}} held certain constitutional powers. Only the People of Rome (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer these powers on any individual magistrate. The most powerful constitutional power was imperium. Imperium was held by both consuls and praetors. Imperium gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. All magistrates also had the power of coercion. This was used by magistrates to maintain public order. While in Rome, all citizens could seek judgment against coercion. This protection was called provocatio (see below). Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power would often be used to obstruct <b>political</b> <b>opponents.</b>|$|E
