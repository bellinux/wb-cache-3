25|$|The Demoiselles is {{generally}} {{referred to as}} the first Cubist <b>picture.</b> <b>This</b> is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, expressionist element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the Demoiselles is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it.|$|E
25|$|Les Baigneuses, {{along with}} other {{compositions}} by Gleizes and his fellow Salon Cubists from this period (1911-1912), tend to coordinate a variety of views of the same subject, or a multiplicity (in the Bergsonian sense) of different angles in one <b>picture.</b> <b>This</b> attempt clearly shows the importance of both the time element and the mobile properties in the sequence of events. According to Gleizes, the artist would accommodate either several successive moments in time projected onto a single space, or multiple spaces projected onto the canvas at the same time. These kinematic compositions that took into account both staticity and dynamism were not just a new description of the external world created by the artist, but also the inner world.|$|E
25|$|Le Chemin (Meudon) is a {{large and}} {{important}} painting made by Albert Gleizes {{in the summer of}} 1911 {{at the height of his}} new friendship and collaboration with fellow Cubist Jean Metzinger. One of his largest and most ambitious paintings from this period, made in direct response to the inspiration of Metzinger, it was exhibited by Gleizes at the groundbreaking exhibition of the so-called 'Salon Cubists', Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger, Henri Le Fauconnier and Gleizes, at the Salon des Indépendants in June 1911. With its prismatic Cubism, shifting multiple perspective points and its holistic integration of landscape and figure centred around this lone figures journey through a path in the woods and through the heart of the <b>picture,</b> <b>this</b> work represents a radical extension of Gleizes' Cubism into an entirely new integrated and simultaneous style of composition.|$|E

500|$|A quark of one flavor can {{transform}} into a quark of another flavor {{only through the}} weak interaction, {{one of the four}} fundamental interactions in particle physics.

500|$|Frank Capra's The Bitter Tea of General Yen was {{not quite}} the same type of film: Stanwyck plays a missionary who goes to civil-war-torn China and meets the titular general (played by Nils Asther) after his car kills the driver of her rickshaw. When she is knocked {{unconscious}} in a riot, he takes her out of the rabble and onto a train car. She has lurid, horror-themed, symbolic dreams about the General, in which she is both titillated and repulsed by him. The film breaks precedent by developing into an interracial love story, but his army ends in ruins. Yen kills himself at the film's conclusion—by drinking poisoned tea—rather than be captured and killed. Capra adored the script and disregarded the risk of making a film that broke California's (and 29 other states') laws concerning the portrayal of miscegenation. Cinematographer Joseph Walker tested a new technique he created, which he dubbed [...] "Variable Diffusion", in filming the <b>picture.</b> <b>This</b> rendered the entire picture in very soft focus.|$|E

The album does not included the songs from Off the Wall (1979) & Invincible (2001).

Film critic Leonard Maltin praised the film, awarding it 3 1/2 {{out of a possible}} 4 stars. In his review he wrote that The Great Silence is a [...] "brutal, bleakly beautiful spaghetti Western filmed on stark locations in the Dolomites, {{with one of the most}} uncompromising and unforgettable finales ever filmed". Kyle Anderson of Nerdist News described the film as Corbucci's [...] "most artful and daring" [...] Western, one that [...] "pushes the genre to new levels and creates a story unlike anything people were used to, even though it's likely more historically accurate".

500|$|Music {{remained}} {{an important element}} in establishing the atmosphere of Halloween III. Just as in Halloween and Halloween II, there was no symphonic score. Much of the music was composed to solicit [...] "false startles" [...] from the audience. The soundtrack was composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, who had also worked on the score for Halloween II. The score of Halloween III differed greatly from the familiar main theme of the original and its first sequel. Carpenter replaced the familiar piano melody with a slower, electronic theme played on a synthesizer with beeping tonalities. Howarth explains how he and Carpenter composed the music for the third film:The music style of John Carpenter and myself has further evolved in this film soundtrack by working exclusively with synthesizers to produce our music. This has led to a certain procedural routine. The film is first transferred to a time coded video tape and synchronized to a 24 track master audio recorder; then while watching the film we compose the music to these visual images. The entire process goes quite rapidly and has 'instant gratification', allowing us to evaluate the score in synch to the <b>picture.</b> <b>This</b> is quite an invaluable asset.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} and produced entirely in Hokkaido, including the album's cover artwork and music videos. When writing the songs, Yamaguchi thought up imagery for each song, {{and asked the}} other band members to <b>picture</b> <b>this</b> while creating and performing the songs. Yamaguchi created the album's music and melody while thinking about how they would be received by other people, but wrote the lyrics entirely introspectively. [...] "Mikazuki Sunset" [...] and [...] "Shiranami Top Water" [...] were the first songs produced by the band, and were the band's first attempts at making club-style music. Due to their success on college radio, Yamaguchi felt like this was proof that the mix of dance music with Japanese melodies was a good direction, and continued to make music in this style. Yamaguchi {{was inspired by the}} differences in house and techno music styles when writing the album. Yamaguchi was mindful about how to reach a wide audience, and considered that live instruments were important to stress how the album was rock music, as pure dance music was based on electronic and sampled instruments. One convention the band kept for the album was to record everything at 126BPM, {{to make it easier for}} the band's drummer, who had not experienced performing dance music before.|$|E
500|$|The rhyme {{has also}} {{been used as a}} {{reference}} in more serious literary works, including as a recurring motif of the Fall of Man in James Joyce's 1939 novel Finnegans Wake. Robert Penn Warren's 1946 American novel All the King's Men is the story of populist politician [...] Willie Stark's rise to the position of governor and eventual fall, based on the career of the corrupt Louisiana Senator Huey Long. It won the 1947 Pulitzer Prize and was twice made into a film All the King's Men in 1949 and 2006, the former winning the Academy Award for best motion <b>picture.</b> <b>This</b> was echoed in Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward's book All the President's Men, about the Watergate scandal, referring to the failure of the President's staff to repair the damage once the scandal had leaked out. It was filmed as All the President's Men in 1976, starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman. Similarly, Humpty Dumpty is referred to in Paul Auster's 1985 novel City of Glass, when two characters discuss him as [...] "the purest embodiment of the human condition" [...] and quote extensively from Through the Looking Glass. Luis d'Antin van Rooten's 1967 book Mots d'Heures, a collection of homophonically translated poetry, includes a version of the rhyme in nonsensical French text, beginning [...] "Un petit d'un petit, S'étonne aux Halles...".|$|E
