40|$|Background: Rhinitis {{still be}} a global health problem in Indonesia.

Aim: To determine the risk factors associated with occupational rhinitis due to spray paint exposure on car painting workshop workers. Methods: This study was conducted on 49 car painting workshop workers who used spray paint in Semarang city which aimed to determine the factors associated with the incidence of occupational rhinitis. This study used cross sectional design. Data was processed and presented in frequency distribution tables, then analyzed through three stages: univariate analysis, bivariate by using chi square and Fisher’s exact test, and multivariate used regression logistic test. Result: From the analysis of chi square and Fisher’s exact test were known, there was no relationship between age with the incidence of occupational rhinitis (p-value= 0. 058), there was no relationship between duration of exposure with the incidence occupational rhinitis (p-value= 0. 348), there was {{a relationship between the}} availability of special car <b>painting</b> <b>room</b> with the incidence of occupational rhinitis (p-value= 0. 000), there was a relationship between wearing mask with the incidence of occupational rhinitis (p-value= 0. 019).
