500|$|The building's {{elevator}} {{was designed}} and added to the foyer after the building was occupied. [...] It is encased in a backlit <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> shaft at one edge of the open-air lobby. Scalloped steel railings line the central staircase which is anchored by a <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> column. Sandblasted designs are featured in glass plate windows above the entrance.|$|R

5000|$|James Wardrop is {{also the}} {{architect}} responsible for designing Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance. [...] One {{of the most striking}} features of the building is the use of Glazed architectural terra-cotta and <b>glass</b> <b>brick.</b> It was, in fact, the first building in Australia to use <b>glass</b> <b>bricks</b> in its construction. [...] Cleverly designed, the black and white vertical terracotta tiles on the façade take the eye on a journey over six levels to the 'empire-state-like' steeple on top, forming an architectural spine through the centre of the building.|$|R
50|$|The lounge has {{a corner}} brick {{fireplace}} with a chrome hood and mirrored panels above the mantelpiece. The south wall has twin rows of vertical <b>glass</b> <b>bricks</b> {{and the east}} wall is rounded. A vertical row of <b>glass</b> <b>bricks</b> {{is located in the}} south wall of the informal dining room, which also has a servery to the L-shaped kitchen which has been refitted. The original garage is used as a guest bedroom, but retains the timber and glass garage doors which have also been reproduced for the more recent garage located on the northwest.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{has also}} been accused of impracticality: it is locally infamous for the <b>glass</b> <b>bricks</b> set into its floor, which can become {{slippery}} in the wet climate of the city.|$|R
25|$|The east-facing {{cross-arm}} of {{the church}} contains the altar, and also contains a half-round apse that is recognisable from outside. The apse contains a mullion which, like the two smaller windows next to the apse, is filled with colourful <b>glass</b> <b>bricks.</b> The red, green, yellow and blue <b>glass</b> <b>bricks</b> provide the only exterior light into the chancel, that is otherwise only lit through the opened doors of the iconostasis, or through it from the inner part {{of the church}}. North of the chancel, at the Northeast side of the building, is a narrow bell-gable with four bells that can be rung from outside using bell ropes.|$|R
40|$|This MSc. Thesis {{research}} {{attempts to}} research the spatial distribution of natural light as it interacts with the <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> masonry façade, {{in terms of both}} its quantitative- and qualitative characteristics, with the aim of applying this material in the transformation of historic buildings. An elaborate research on the visual effects of light is provided, and the relationship between daylight and the <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> façade is determined through photometric experiments and visual analysis that were conducted during this research. These experiments were conducted during three different sky conditions outside of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at TU Delft.

50|$|In the past, Redcliff {{was known}} for the {{production}} of <b>glass,</b> <b>brick</b> and pottery products. Some of these factories have since moved to Medicine Hat, such as the IXL brick plant, while others are no longer in existence.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} is a prominent example of early 20th-century Italian rationalist architecture, notable for its widespread use of innovative materials such as <b>glass</b> <b>brick,</b> clinker brick and linoleum, and is also the first Italian building with a welded metal structural frame.|$|R
50|$|Hohauser {{studied at}} the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York before coming to Florida in 1932. Features of his work include {{symmetry}} on the front elevation, Art Deco stylings such as a ziggurat or stepped roofline, <b>glass</b> <b>bricks,</b> curved edges, and neon lighting.|$|R
50|$|The former Redcliffe Town Council Chambers is a {{symmetrical}} single-storeyed white rendered masonry {{building with}} a two-storeyed entrance section. The main facade is curved with stepped parapets which conceal flat roofs. The building incorporates decorative relief shields, <b>glass</b> <b>bricks</b> and stained <b>glass.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{windows on}} both {{levels of the}} south street {{alignment}} are rectangular while those on the western elevation are arched, flanking a semi-circular headed window with projecting keystone, surmounted by a further horizontal window; most windows on this elevation are now filled with <b>glass</b> <b>bricks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Service {{lighting}} {{consisting of}} windows that run {{all the way}} around the outside of the toilet using electric lights behind the windows, to create the illusion of extensive natural light, even when the toilets are underground or otherwise do not have access to natural light. The windows are sometimes made of <b>glass</b> <b>brick,</b> permanently cemented in place. Lighting installed in service tunnels that run around the outside of the toilets provides optimum safety from electrical shock (keeping the lights outside the toilet), hygiene (no cracks or openings), security (no way for vandals to access the light bulbs), and aesthetics (clean architectural lines that maintain a continuity of whatever aesthetic design is present, e.g., the raw industrial urban aesthetic that works well with <b>glass</b> <b>brick).</b>|$|R
25|$|When a {{stratified}} {{hot water}} storage tank has closed water circuits, the water temperatures can be up to 90 to 95°C at the top and 20 to 40°C at the bottom. Calm, undisturbed water is a relatively poor heat conductor when compared to <b>glass,</b> <b>bricks</b> and soil.|$|R
25|$|Le Corbusier {{constructs}} Notre Dame du Haut signaling his postmodern {{return to}} an architectural expressionism of form. He also constructs the Unité d'Habitation, which emphasizes the architectural expression of materials. The brutalist use of béton brut (reinforced concrete) recalls the expressionist use of <b>glass,</b> <b>brick,</b> and steel.|$|R

50|$|Glass block, {{also known}} as <b>glass</b> <b>brick,</b> is an {{architectural}} element made from glass used in areas where privacy or visual obscuration is desired while admitting light, such as underground parking garages, washrooms, and municipal swimming baths. Glass block was originally developed in the early 1900s to provide natural light in industrial factories.|$|R
50|$|The State Theater {{is an art}} deco-style {{theater in}} Clovis, New Mexico, which opened in 1936. It is still in use, {{although}} today it presents live musical acts rather than movies.

50|$|His works {{include the}} Crown Fountain at Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It opened in July 2004. The {{fountain}} {{is composed of}} a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> towers. The towers are 50 ft tall, and they use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display digital videos on the inward faces.|$|R
5000|$|Buonagurio has had {{her work}} in many {{exhibitions}} and has a permanent installation in the 42nd Street Times Square subway station. Titled [...] "Times Square Times: 35 Times" [...] it {{is made up of}} 35 separate pieces embedded in a <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> wall. Buonagurio teaches art at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.|$|R
50|$|The four storey {{building}} is constructed of reinforced concrete frame with brick walls, which were plastered smooth and painted white {{to give a}} sleek, minimalist appearance.

The windows are steel framed hung on pivots and with casements.|$|R
