5000|$|Aalto {{constrained}} his material palate to one {{dominated by}} brick and accented by timber and copper. Though Aalto practiced {{at the same}} time as Modernist Architects Le Corbusier and others, he rejected the Machine Aesthetic for the majority of his architecture. Instead, he saw his buildings as organisms made of up of individual cells. This principle informed Aalto's use of traditional building materials such as brick which is, by nature, <b>cellular.</b> The <b>bricks</b> were even laid slightly off-line to create a dynamic and enlivened surface condition due to the shadows.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, NADES 4 {{exhibited}} the lowest viscosity at 30  °C (36  mPa s) {{as well as}} the highest cytotoxicity values. With reference to Table  4, NADES 2 is slightly more viscous than NADES 1. Their cytotoxicity values are roughly similar if the SEM is taken into account. Viscosity or micro-viscosity (in cellular terms) is an important property to consider in intracellular activities. Not only does it affect diffusion within biological systems, but it is also involved during processes such as protein–protein interactions, transportation of small solutes and macromolecules, and signal transduction in living cells. The local micro-viscosity in cells ranges from 1 to 400  mPa s (Liu et al. 2014). The highest viscosity values (≥ 200  mPa s) are usually associated with the microviscosity in the hydrophobic domains of living cells (lipid bilayers of cell surfaces); whereas, values between 1 and 3  mPa s are attributed to the aqueous phases of the cellular cytoplasm (Juneidi et al. 2015; Kuimova et al. 2009). A variation or a disturbance of these homeostatic values leads to the onset of various diseases (atherosclerosis, diabetes) as well as cell death (Deliconstantinos et al. 1995; Nadiv et al. 1994). The understudied NADESs possess viscosities higher than 500  mPa s; with the exception of NADES 4 (36  mPa s), which happens to be the least toxic mixture tested (with IC 50 values 1.6 – 32 times lower than the other NADESs). Hence, {{it is not difficult to}} perceive the substantial influence that these highly viscous materials can have on cells. Just like DESs <b>perforate</b> <b>cellular</b> membranes (Hayyan et al. 2015), NADESs can probably enhance cellular membrane permeability. As such, the introduction of such viscous substances in cellular medium can result in a major variation of cytoplasmic microviscosity, and eventually lead to cell death.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cellular</b> {{concrete}} <b>bricks</b> {{were obtained}} by using a lightweight mortar with recycled expanded polystyrene aggregate instead of sandy materials. After determining the block properties (absorption, compressive strength, and tensile stresses), {{it was found that}} this brick meets the requirements of the masonry standards used in Mexico. The obtained material is lighter than the commercial ones, which facilitates their rapid elaboration, quality control, and transportation. It is less permeable, which helps prevent moisture formation retaining its strength due to the greater adherence shown with dry polystyrene. It was more flexible, which makes it less vulnerable to cracking walls due to soil displacements. Furthermore, it is economical, because it uses recyclable material and has properties that prevent deterioration increasing its useful life. We recommend the use of the fully dry EP under a dry environment to obtain the best properties of brick...|$|R

In this paper, fly ash uses are classed into three main categories: low technology applications; medium technology applications; and, (3) high technology applications. The low technology applications {{include the use of}} fly ash in fills and embankments, pavement base and subbase courses, subgrade stabilization, landfill cover, soil improvement, land reclamations, slurried flowable ash, water pollution control, etc. The medium technology applications involve the use of fly ash in blended cements, lightweight aggregates, concretes, prestressed/precast concrete products, concrete pipe, roller compacted concrete, autoclaved <b>cellular</b> concrete, <b>bricks,</b> blocks, paving stones, high-strength ceramic products, filler in asphalt mixture, artificial reefs, etc. The high technology application of fly ash include metal recovery, fillers for composite materials and other applications, mineral wool, etc. Silica fume is available in several forms. Considerable amounts of research have been pursued on the utilization of silica fume as a construction material over the last decade. Typical properties of silica fume and its different uses in densified cement, blended cement, concrete, bricks, blocks, grouts, etc. have been briefly mentioned. The use of slag in cements, concrete, aggregate, flowable backfills, grouts, bricks, blocks, and other applications have also been discussed...|$|R
40|$|The thermal diode {{consists}} {{in a common}} brick empty inside, where the internal cavity is geometrically arranged as two rectangles, disposed {{one over the other}} but not aligned. When the lower side is heated, natural convection in the air inside yields high heat transfer rates from this side to the other. When the upper side is heated, the heat transfer should run by pure conduction, and the brick with air inside works as a thermal insulator. As this brick allows a good conductance in one direction and insulation in the opposite sense, it behaves as an electric diode, being known as thermal diode. This principle is already known for a long time, but its use is still not extensive, and there are no basic rules for the cavity design or even a theoretical study of viability for this use replacing the conventional insulation systems. The objective of this work is to simulate the heat transfer process inside a thermal diode, in order to obtain the optimal geometry and dimensions and to verify the viability of its use in buildings for thermal optimization. The numerical data are validated through comparing with that obtained from the test applied to <b>cellular</b> concrete <b>bricks...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn extreme climates {{like the}} desert climate of Northwest Mexico, indoor thermal {{conditions}} in buildings, {{and particularly in}} low-cost housing developments, are very uncomfortable. In buildings where the use of air conditioning devices can be afford, excessive energy is spent, leading to high acclimatization costs. In many cases, construction materials for low-cost houses are selected according to the lowest price, and not {{taking into account the}} best thermal behavior according to the local climate. Different types of blocks are widely used as a construction material for walls, such us earth blocks, adobe, concrete hollow blocks, <b>cellular</b> blocks, <b>bricks,</b> because of their low price and easy installation. Designstrategies must be very carefully selected according to the local climate, because they have a great impact on energy consumptions and in {{the quality of life of}} the occupants. The selection of the appropriate materials for the envelope is part of these design strategies, and is the main subject of this paper. In this work we analyze the thermal behavior of a wall compound of two different materials: cellular concrete blocks and stabilized earth blocks. The monitored wall is part of a low-cost house constructed for demonstrative and experimental purposes. External and internal superficial temperatures have been measured and infrared images of the same areas have been analyzed. Infrared thermography is particularly useful to evaluate non-homogeneous materials or non-traditional materials, from which not all thermal properties are known. The thermal behavior is analyzed, in relation to the expected characteristics according to the climate, such as adequate thermal insulation and thermal inertia of the envelope, which are different for air-conditioning and non air-conditioning situations...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of a polyurethane-cement hybrid foam are investigated. The hybrid foam, {{based on the}} combined, synergic use of rigid polyurethane foam and portland cement, was introduced for application in the building field.

Here, a broad mechanical characterization including compressive, tensile, and shear tests is conducted according to ASTM standard methods for cellular plastic materials. The compressive tests show a brittle behavior of the hybrid foam, with the maximum strength achieved at large values of strain, compared to concrete. The material exhibits more strength under tension than under compression.

This work reports a comprehensive investigation of thermal performance characteristics which include thermal transmittance, thermal admittance, decrement factor and the time lag for both homogeneous and composite building walls. A computer program with the cyclic admittance method was developed to study unsteady thermal performance characteristics. The Five building materials such as, <b>cellular</b> concrete, mud <b>brick,</b> concrete block, burnt brick and fly ash bricks were selected for the study. The heat transfer characteristics of five homogeneous building walls and their five composite walls were studied in detail. From the results, it is observed that fly ash brick homogeneous walls and their composite walls are energy efficient from the lowest decrement factor and the highest time lag perspective among five homogeneous and five composite walls studied. The decrement factor and time lag values of homogeneous fly ash bricks were observed to be 0. 401 and 8. 159 h, respectively, whereas the values of composite fly ash brick walls were observed to be 0. 342 and 9. 199 h, respectively...|$|R

The hybrid foam, based on the conjunct use of Portland cement and rigid polyurethane foam, was introduced for applications in the building field. Property of acoustic and thermic insulation, water vapor permeability and the fire resistance were earlier investigated. Here, to evaluate the potential use of this new material in the building field for the seismic protection of nonstructural components, the results of compressive, tensile and shear tests, conducted according to ASTM standards, are reported. The compressive tests showed a brittle behavior of the hybrid foam.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{researchers}} study alternative connection {{designs for}} steel seismic-resistant frames {{by reducing the}} beam section in different ways including that of creating an opening in its web (RWS connections). A similar design is applied in the fabrication of <b>perforated</b> (i. e. <b>cellular</b> and castellated) beams mostly used to support the service integration, {{as well as the}} significant mass reduction in steel frames. This paper presents a comprehensive finite element (FE) analysis of extended end-plate beam-to-column connections, with both single and multiple circular web openings introduced {{along the length of the}} beam while subjected to the cyclic loading proposed by the SAC protocol from FEMA 350 (2000). The three-dimensional (3 D) FE solid model was validated against FE and experimental results and the chosen configuration was capable of representing the structural behaviour of a partially restrained connection, without the necessity to be idealised as fully fixed. The study focuses in the interaction of such connections and the mobilisation of stresses from the column to the perforated beam. The parameters introduced were the distance from the face of the column, S, and the web opening spacing, So, with closely and widely spaced web openings. It is found that RWS connections with cellular beams behave in a satisfactory manner and provide enhanced performance in terms of the stress distribution when subjected to cyclic loading. The design of partially restrained RWS connections should be primarily based on the distance of the first opening from the face of the column...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the comprehensive {{investigation of the}} effect divided air space thickness within the wall on unsteady heat transfer characteristics such as thermal transmittance, thermal admittance, decrement factor and time lag of five building material walls for energy efficient building enclosure design. The five building material composite walls such as laterite stone, mud <b>brick,</b> <b>cellular</b> concrete, dense concrete and cinder concrete with total thirty configurations were studied. A computer simulation program was developed to compute unsteady heat transfer characteristics using the cyclic admittance procedure. From the results, {{it is observed that}} the decrement factor decreases with the increase in the divided air space thickness within the composite wall for all building materials. Dense concrete was observed to be the energy efficient from the lowest decrement factor point of view among five studied building materials. Dense concrete decrement factor decreases by 23. 65 % for 0. 02 m air space thickness compared to the conventional composite wall without air space. It is also noticed that the time lag increases with the increase in the divided air space thickness within the composite wall for all building materials. Cellular concrete was observed to be the energy efficient from highest time lag perspective among five studied building materials. Cellular concrete time lag increases by 6. 23 % for 0. 02 m air space thickness compared to the conventional composite wall without air space.
