5|$|Shepard {{was born}} July 10, 1899, in Oxford, North Carolina, {{the son of}} Robert Shepard and <b>Pattie</b> Gilliam Shepard. Robert Shepard was born a slave and later became a Baptist {{minister}} and the superintendent of the Colored Orphanage Asylum of North Carolina. <b>Pattie</b> Shepard was also involved in charitable work and served {{as the head of}} the Women's Baptist Home Convention of North Carolina. Marshall Shepard followed his parents in joining the First Baptist Church of Oxford. He attended Slater State Normal School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, then received his Doctor of Divinity in 1921 from Virginia Union University, a historically black university in Richmond, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The secular popular {{tradition}} of music continued, despite {{attempts by the}} Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played. Large numbers of musicians continued to perform, including the fiddler <b>Pattie</b> Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson (1550–1620).|$|E
5|$|Harrison's first marriage, {{to model}} <b>Pattie</b> Boyd in 1966, {{ended in divorce}} in 1977. The {{following}} year he married Olivia Harrison (née Arias), {{with whom he had}} one son, Dhani. Harrison died in 2001, aged 58, from lung cancer attributed to years of cigarette smoking. His body was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India, in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition. He left an estate of almost £100 million.|$|E
50|$|He {{offers to}} be at <b>Pattie's</b> side despite the changed circumstances, and care for her for an {{unspecified}} period of time. Amy Bates in particular jumps at the suggestion; she has not had an hour off since <b>Pattie's</b> accident and is stranded in the house without {{the chance to go}} even to the hairdressers or do some window-shopping.|$|R

5|$|Harrison {{attended}} {{the world premiere}} of Wonderwall, held at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 1968, accompanied by his wife <b>Pattie</b> Boyd, Starr and Birkin. Although he had expected the film's producers to purchase the soundtrack rights and issue the album independently, they declined to do so, leading Massot to suggest that Harrison release it on the Beatles' new label, Apple Records. Wonderwall Music therefore became Apple's first album release, as well as the first solo album {{by a member of the}} Beatles.|$|E
5|$|Shankar's {{original}} {{hope was}} to raise $25,000 through a benefit concert of his own, compered perhaps by actor Peter Sellers. With Harrison's commitment, {{and the record}} and film outlets available to him through the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation, the idea soon grew to become a star-studded musical event, mixing Western rock with Indian classical music, and {{it was to be}} held at the most prestigious venue in America: Madison Square Garden, in New York City. According to Chris O'Dell, a music-business administrator and former Apple employee, Harrison got off the phone with Shankar once the concept had been finalised, and started enthusing with his wife, <b>Pattie</b> Boyd, and herself about possible performers. Ringo Starr, Lennon, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Jim Keltner, Voormann, Billy Preston and Badfinger were all mentioned during this initial brainstorming.|$|E
5|$|Since 1965, George Harrison and his wife, <b>Pattie</b> Boyd, {{had lived}} in Kinfauns in Surrey, south of London. The house was a {{bungalow}} and too small to accommodate a home recording studio, so the couple began a year-long search for a larger property, concentrating on an area west of London encompassing the counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire. In January 1970, Harrison purchased the 120-room Friar Park, set on 33 acres of land, just west of Henley-on-Thames. Previously the home of an order of Roman Catholic nuns, the Salesians of Don Bosco, the four-storey house and its grounds were in a dilapidated state, {{and it was not}} until the start of March that the Harrisons moved from a worker's cottage and into the main residence.|$|E
5|$|Before Donald <b>Pattie's</b> {{research}} {{during the}} late 1960s, when his team studied marsh shrews in captivity, little was known about their behavior. Before then, most information about the marsh shrew was from notes about the mammal's habitat and information about trapping it. Its descriptions in the literature were largely derived from the examination of museum specimens.|$|R

5|$|The Beatles {{hosted the}} orchestral session as a 1960s-style happening, with guests {{including}} Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Donovan, <b>Pattie</b> Boyd, Michael Nesmith, {{and members of}} the psychedelic design collective The Fool. Overseen by Tony Bramwell of NEMS Enterprises, the event was filmed for use in a projected television special that never materialised. Reflecting the Beatles' taste for experimentation and the avant garde, the orchestra players were asked to wear formal dress and then given a costume piece as a contrast with this attire. This resulted in different players wearing anything from fake noses to fake stick-on nipples. Martin recalled that the lead violinist performed wearing a gorilla paw, while a bassoon player placed a balloon on the end of his instrument.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} the guise of a comic book; FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{receives}} a letter from Shaineh Berkowitz (<b>Pattie</b> Tierce), a single mother who claims to have been mysteriously impregnated, while unconscious, by an unknown presence 18years ago, resulting in the birth of her son, Izzy (Stewart Gale). Now, following a similarly unexplained attack, she is pregnant again. She has heard about Mulder's expertise in the paranormal from The Jerry Springer Show and wants him to investigate. Mulder and his partner, special agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), travel to rural Albion, Indiana. They meet Shaineh and her son Izzy and learn that the description of the creature that attacked her, with a lumpy head and two mouths, is very similar to a comic book character invented by Izzy. His monstrous creation, called The Great Mutato, is inspired by a mysterious creature that has been seen by many of the locals. Izzy and his friends take the agents to a wooded area where they see Mutato (Chris Owens) from a distance.|$|E
5|$|The secular popular {{tradition}} of music continued, despite {{attempts by the}} Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played. Large numbers of musicians continued to perform, including the fiddler <b>Pattie</b> Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson (1550–1620). In the Highlands the seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairlock. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen in Lewis alone. The oppression of secular music and dancing began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 {{and the level of}} musical activity was reflected in a flood musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723) and William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius (1725). The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay.|$|E
50|$|Bracebridge Hall is a {{historic}} house and national historic district located near Macclesfield, Edgecombe County, North Carolina. The district encompasses eight contributing buildings, two contributing sites, and three contributing structures associated with the Bracebridge Hall plantation complex. The original house was built about 1830-1832, and enlarged about 1835-1840, 1880-1881, and 1885. It is a two-story, five bay, weatherboarded frame dwelling with Greek Revival and Victorian style design elements. It features a one-story Doric order portico. Also on the property are the contributing Metal boiler/basin (c. 1880-1900), Plantation Office (c. 1860-1885), Servants’ House (Aunt <b>Pattie’s</b> House) (c. 1860-1885), Tobacco Barn (c. 1920), Troughs (c. 1890-1920), Large Barn (c. 1890-1915), Barn (c. 1920), Overseer’s House (c. 1860-1885), Carr Cemetery (1820), and the Agricultural landscape.

500|$|On 17 March 1970, {{despite the}} property's state of disrepair, the Harrisons threw {{a party to}} {{celebrate}} <b>Pattie's</b> 26th birthday and St Patrick's Day. According to their friend and assistant Chris O'Dell, the guest list comprised all the other Beatles and their wives, as well as insiders such as Derek and Joan Taylor, Neil Aspinall and his wife Susie, Peter Brown, and Klaus and Christine Voormann. In what was a rare social get-together for the Beatles, three weeks before Paul McCartney announced he was leaving the band, the party was a [...] "great success", O'Dell writes. Shortly afterwards, Harrison invited members of the London-based Hare Krishna movement {{to help with the}} restoration work, primarily in the grounds of Friar Park, and accommodated the devotees and their families in a wing of the house. While satisfying Harrison's spiritual convictions, these visitors proved less welcome to Boyd, who found herself shut out of her husband's life.|$|R
