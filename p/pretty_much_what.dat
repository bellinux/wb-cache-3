Spencer described Five Finger Death Punch as [...] "kind of like stepping on a garden rake while looking at a supermodel. Blissful yet fucking devastating". He then said, [...] "We have an energy and a rhythmical style that's different than what's happening out there. We have songs that grab you and stay with you and rip your face off. Hooks, balls, melodies and energy — that's us".|$|E
500|$|TV Guide Matt Roush {{wrote that}} [...] "Audition" [...] was [...] "far from [...] {{favorite}} episode", disliking the [...] "cruelty and dirty tricks" [...] {{employed by the}} characters, though he commented that [...] "the moments that soar remind us why this is a genuine pop-culture phenom". James Poniewozik of Time called it a [...] "solid" [...] episode, one which was [...] "neither awful nor amazing", but set up promising storylines for the season ahead. He felt there were no stand out musical performances, but commented, [...] "it gave the season some emotional grounding [...] It showed us a Glee that's not working double-time to give us everything we want all at once, and that's <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> I want from it." [...] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that, with [...] "Audition", Glee had become formulaic, and asserted that [...] "Glee fanatics won't be disappointed. The rest of us are." ...|$|E
500|$|Blue Shift {{received}} a mixed reaction from critics, holding overall scores of 67.40% and 71/100 [...] on the review aggregator sites GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. The game has sold around 800,000 copies at retail (this figure {{does not include}} later sales on Steam). In a review for IGN, critic Tal Blevins noted that Blue Shifts gameplay [...] "is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> we've come to expect out of Half-Life" [...] by blending action and puzzle solving, stating that the latter [...] "were all logical and well done, {{although some of the}} jumping puzzles were frustrating". Though IGN praised the game for maintaining the [...] "epic" [...] feel of the original, Blevins was critical of the relatively short length of the game. GameSpot reviewer Greg Kasavin agreed with many of IGN's criticisms, stating that [...] "it's not that the game is easy so much that it's extremely short" [...] and that Blue Shift [...] "doesn't amount to much on its own terms". In addition, Kasavin described the graphical enhancements brought about by the High Definition pack as [...] "helpful", but noted that [...] "they still don't make Half-Life look like a new game—nor are many of the changes themselves very noticeable".|$|E
5000|$|Critic Mordaunt Hall, {{writing for}} the New York Times, liked the acting but was troubled by some of Rouben Mamoulian's direction. He said, [...] "The opening {{chapters}} are none too interesting and subsequently one anticipates <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what's</b> going to happen...however, Mr. Mamoulian commits the unpardonable sin of being far too extravagant. He becomes tedious in his scenes of the convent {{and there is nothing}} but viciousness in his stage passages." ...|$|R

500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a couple hundred dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: [...] "I gave them the impression that I knew <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> I was doing, and they sort of got the idea that I wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things." ...|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{wrote that}} [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] was a [...] "nice holiday outing {{with a lot}} of great gag-writing", however [...] "...I wouldn't put this up there with the show's best Christmas episodes. But I'd say it fits in nicely with the general run of {{competency}} to excellence we've been seeing so far this season. It was modestly funny, a little sweet, and not at all horrible." [...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix who is not a fan of Elaine Stritch's role on the show enjoyed her in this episode, writing that along with the appearances of Elizabeth Banks and Alan Alda [...] "I decided to hope their presence would counteract my feelings about hers – which is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> happened." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed the subplots commenting that Tracy's [...] "played well" [...] and Jenna and Paul's [...] "was both sweet and ridiculous". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student said it was [...] "a ton of fun to watch" [...] all the subplots play out and considered [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] as [...] "probably one of the two or three best episodes of the season thus far. In fact... {{it may have been the}} best Christmas episode of 30 Rock yet." [...] Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline enjoyed Stritch and Alda's [...] "wonderfully funny roles".|$|E
500|$|British {{graffiti}} {{artist and}} political activist Banksy {{is credited with}} creating the opening titles and couch gag for this episode, in what amounted to {{the first time that}} an artist has been invited to storyboard the show. Executive producer Al Jean first took note of Banksy after seeing his 2010 film Exit Through the Gift Shop. According to Jean, [...] "The concept in my mind was, 'What if this graffiti artist came in and tagged our main titles?'" [...] Simpsons casting director Bonnie Pietila was able to contact the artist through the film's producers, and asked if he would be interested in writing a main title for the show. Jean said Banksy [...] "sent back boards for <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> you saw." [...] Series creator Matt Groening gave the idea his blessing, and helped try to make the sequence as close to Banksy's original storyboards as possible. Fox's standards and practices department demanded some changes, and Jean agreed to them [...] "for taste"; Jean said that [...] "95 percent of it is just the way he [...] wanted," [...] but declined to say what was in the censored 5%, only saying that the original version was [...] "even a little sadder." [...] In January 2011, Banksy published the original storyboard on his website. It appears that a poster of Rupert Murdoch could be the 5% that was left out of the final cut.|$|E

2500|$|It {{would be}} easy to scent a kind of 'orientalism' here: the belief that ‘ex-communist' is synonymous with 'poor', 'nasty' and 'ignorant'.

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{most of the}} {{existing}} staff left SPI, and negotiated a deal with Avalon Hill. [...] Avalon Hill formed a subsidiary company, Victory Games, staffed by the former SPI employees. Victory Games was allowed to publish <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> they wanted, and produced many commercially and critically successful wargames. [...] However, there were no new hires to replace departing personnel, and the company slowly died a death of neglect in the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The serial was {{released}} on Blu-ray Disc in July 2013. Due to the serial being shot entirely on film, {{this is the only}} Doctor Who story from the classic series where a complete high-definition release (with no upconversion) is feasible. Reviewing this release, Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian praised the film look of Spearhead From Space, claiming, [...] "It sounds like a small thing but it made an incredible difference; this {{is the only one of}} the vintage stories to have the picture quality worthy of a HD transfer. The Blu-ray looks superb, as if they shot a (very) low-budget Doctor Who movie late in 1969, which is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> they did. The sets look sturdier, more colourful and far better than their usual overlit, studio-bound video camerawork." ...|$|E
5000|$|Angie Sage had {{compared}} book five to Robinson Crusoe with [...] "tentacles - [...] lots of them". Commenting on the book, she says:I've {{planned the}} ending, and I'm already just drawing everything in, so with number seven, I can <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> think <b>what's</b> going to happen. But {{on the other}} hand, there's always the unknown. I write in the character's shoes, so I'm never entirely sure what they're going to do.|$|R

[...] While noting that the song was doomed to make little impact in the charts, it was described as [...] "one of the greatest Australian singles ever made." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} {{to some of}} the other Accept albums, Wolf Hoffmann recalls Objection Overruled as an easy one to record: [...] "That was great!

We had a ball back then," [...] adding, [...] "we just really <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> made records like we always did and felt like we should use the old formulas with no more sort of experiments and just <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> do <b>what</b> Accept is known for; and that's what we did." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 2008 {{television}} interview, Cornell {{said about}} religion, [...] "I don't follow any particular one. … Ultimately I think I'm {{sort of a}} freethinker and kind of open. … So many bad things–as well as good things–have happened based on people just sort of blindly following religion that I kind of feel like I want {{to stay away from}} any type of specific denomination or any religion period. If {{for no other reason than}} just that. I don't want to be involved with anything or condone any school of thought that at some point and in some way causes the death of innocent people, or tragedies where initial fantastic ideas [...] distorted. Like the life, for example, of Jesus is well-documented. It's corroborated by different people, who had different backgrounds, and different levels of education. And they wrote about it. We know that this guy existed, and we know <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> he said, and it's pretty simple. Everything from that point on in terms of wars and fighting over land and territories and religious things, none of that was even included in anything he said. His message was pretty simple, be really nice to each other and everything will be okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|His next {{release was}} Ashu Trikha's Deewaanapan, in which Rampal was paired with Dia Mirza. He earned {{critical}} acclaim for his performance, {{but the film}} flopped at the box office. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal carries the film on his broad shoulders and {{comes up with a}} sincere performance that is consistent throughout. He is wonderful in action sequences and springs a pleasant surprise in the emotional moments by delivering the apposite expressions." [...] Ashish Magotra of Rediff gave negative reviews on Rampal, writing: [...] "Among the actors, Arjun Rampal as the hero does <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> he has been known to do. He models. His acting capabilities leave a lot to be desired." [...] His last release of the year was Ashok Mehta's Moksha. It was actually his first film, but was released after Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat. Rampal was paired with famous actress Manisha Koirala in a lead role in Moksha. This film marked Rampal's third consecutive flop at the box office, but Rampal earned critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal excels in a role that was difficult to portray. He takes giant strides as a performer and proves that he's an actor with an amazing range." [...] Priyanka Bhattacharya of Rediff considered the movie to be [...] "more a 70-mm portfolio for Arjun Rampal than a story." ...|$|E
