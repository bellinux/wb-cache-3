However, due to the cutbacks of this agency, licensing of <b>private</b> <b>investigators</b> in the UK was halted indefinitely.

40|$|Effectively {{regulating}} {{the conduct of}} <b>private</b> <b>investigators</b> is a difficult task. The broad scope of their activities exposes them {{to a number of}} areas of common law and various statutes. Unfortunately, the State and Territory legislation relating to the licensing of investigation and commercial agents does not come close to a comprehensive code of conduct and there is little consistency across the different jurisdictions. The licensing schemes have contributed little to the effective regulation of <b>private</b> <b>investigators,</b> largely {{due to the lack of}} effective mechanisms to enforce accountability. The piecemeal regulation also leaves <b>private</b> <b>investigators</b> uncertain as to their rights and obligations under the law and members of the public unsure as to what to do when they are aggrieved by a <b>private</b> <b>investigator's</b> conduct. This article reviews the laws relating to <b>private</b> <b>investigators,</b> including the various licensing schemes. It also considers the relationship between <b>private</b> <b>investigators,</b> their clients and the public. It concludes that the law as it currently stands is generally adequate to balance the rights and interests of all, but that there is a need to improve accountability mechanisms by improved uniform licensing schemes, training and an enforceable code of conduc...|$|R
50|$|<b>Private</b> <b>investigators</b> in Canada are {{licensed}} at {{the provincial}} level by the appropriate body. For instance, {{in the province}} of Ontario, <b>private</b> <b>investigators</b> are licensed and regulated by the Ministry of Community Safety & Correctional Services (MCSCS). In the province of Alberta, <b>private</b> <b>investigators</b> are licensed and regulated by the Alberta Justice and Solicitor General. Similar licensing requirements apply in other provinces and territories of Canada. As per the Ontario text of the Private Security and Investigative Services Act of 2005, <b>private</b> <b>investigators</b> are forbidden from referring to themselves as detective or private detective. In order to become a licensed <b>private</b> <b>investigator,</b> you must be 18 years of age or older in Ontario (in other Provinces and territories of Canada the eligible age to work may be higher); have a clean criminal record or obtain a waiver; and submit a correctly completed application for a license. You are required to complete 50-hours of basic training with an accredited source such as a university, college, or through private agencies licensed to administer the course. Upon completion of basic training, you are required to write and pass the basic test to obtain a <b>private</b> <b>investigator's</b> license.|$|R
