25|$|Although the {{symptoms}} of atopic dermatitis vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin. Typical affected skin areas include {{the folds of the}} arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face and hands. <b>Perioral</b> dermatitis refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Status epilepticus: Although rare, focal motor {{status or}} hemiconvulsive status epilepticus {{is more likely}} to occur than {{secondarily}} generalised convulsive status epilepticus, which is exceptional. Opercular status epilepticus usually occurs in children with atypical evolution or may be induced by carbamazepine or lamotrigine. This state lasts for hours to months and consists of ongoing unilateral or bilateral contractions of the mouth, tongue or eyelids, positive or negative subtle <b>perioral</b> or other myoclonus, dysarthria, speech arrest, difficulties in swallowing, buccofacial apraxia and hypersalivation. These are often associated with continuous spikes and waves on an EEG during NREM sleep.|$|E
25|$|Facial angiofibromas {{occur in}} 80% of {{patients}} with TSC, and the condition is very disfiguring. A retrospective review of English-language medical publications reporting on topical sirolimus treatment of facial angiofibromas found sixteen separate studies with positive patient outcomes after using the drug. The reports involved a total of 84 patients, and improvement was observed in 94% of subjects, especially if treatment began {{during the early stages}} of the disease. Sirolimus treatment was applied in several different formulations (ointment, gel, solution, and cream), ranging from 0.003 to 1% concentrations. Reported adverse effects included one case of <b>perioral</b> dermatitis, one case of cephalea, and four cases of irritation.|$|E
500|$|Many skin {{conditions}} can mimic acne vulgaris and are collectively known as acneiform eruptions. [...] Such conditions include angiofibromas, epidermal cysts, flat warts, folliculitis, keratosis pilaris, milia, <b>perioral</b> dermatitis, and rosacea, among others. Age is one factor which may help distinguish between these disorders. Skin {{disorders such as}} <b>perioral</b> dermatitis and keratosis pilaris can appear similar to acne but tend to occur more frequently in childhood, whereas rosacea tends to occur more frequently in older adults. Facial redness triggered by heat or the consumption of alcohol or spicy food is suggestive of rosacea. The presence of comedones helps health professionals differentiate acne from skin disorders that are similar in appearance. [...] Chloracne, due to exposure to certain chemicals, may look very similar to acne vulgaris.|$|E

These people often have <b>perioral</b> itching and local urticaria. Only occasionally have these food-induced allergies induced systemic responses. Researchers suspect that the cross-reactivity of latex with banana, avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut occurs because latex proteins are structurally homologous with some other plant proteins.|$|E
50|$|When {{periorbital}} dermatitis {{is found}} in otherwise healthy prepubertal children, with a profusion of grouped papules on the <b>perioral,</b> periocular, and perinasal areas, the condition {{is referred to as}} Granulomatous <b>perioral</b> dermatitis.|$|E
50|$|A {{diagnosis}} of <b>perioral</b> dermatitis is typically made {{based on the}} characteristics of the rash. A skin biopsy is usually not required to make the diagnosis but can be helpful to rule out other skin diseases which may resemble <b>perioral</b> dermatitis.|$|E

5000|$|The {{terminology}} {{used in this}} field can be complex, and occasionally contradictory. Some sources consider acne vulgaris part of the differential diagnosis for an acneiform eruption. Other sources classified acne vulgaris under acneiform eruption.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{potential}} causes of <b>perioral</b> dermatitis including chewing gum, certain medications, hormone changes, and autoimmune diseases. Lip licking, lip chewing, sucking, and allergies to ingredients in certain dental products {{have also been}} reported as causes. Balsam of Peru and cinnamic aldehyde (both often used as flavoring in food, lipstick, mouthwash, and toothpaste), rosin in some chewing gum, cinnamon, and peppermint are other potential allergens that may cause <b>perioral</b> dermatitis.|$|E

50|$|Cheilitis is {{inflammation}} of the lips. This inflammation may include the <b>perioral</b> skin (the skin around the mouth), the vermilion border, and/or the labial mucosa.
