5000|$|Currently, {{specific}} {{controls for}} Ascochyta leaf spot diseases {{have not been}} clearly described. [...] Effective controls for a similar disease, Septoria leaf blotch, have been prescribed for Ascochyta leaf spot diseases. These include: crop rotation, fungicide application, variety selection, irrigation management, tillage to reduce residue, and good grassy weed control. [...] Fungicides that are listed as providing 'Very Good' control of Septoria leaf blotch include Azoxystrobin 22.9%, <b>Pyraclostrobin</b> 3.6%, and Propiconazole 41.8%. [...] Applying fungicides {{at the beginning of}} the season reduces the number of sporulating pycnidia and mycelium that overwintered. Sanitation through removing all plant debris from the field at the end of the season reduces the inoculum for the following season. Reduced irrigation prevents the spread of conidia from infected leaves to healthy leaves by decreasing dispersal of conidia. Removing grassy weeds that can harbor the pathogen also decreases the presence of inoculum.|$|E
50|$|Early {{leaf spot}} of peanut {{can be treated}} {{through the use of}} {{fungicides}} applied at the very early pod stage, and applied every two weeks thereafter. After analyzing the incidence and severity of the disease, strip-tillage techniques have also proven to be effective in delaying an epidemic by reducing the amount of initial infection. Furthermore, the delay in disease caused by the strip-tillage technique proposes that initial application of fungicides for use in disease management may be delayed without having negative effects on the treatment of early leaf spot of peanut. Nevertheless, fungicides, such as the protectant fungicide, chlorothalonil, have been the standard for control leaf spots since the mid-1970s and is still widely used today. Tebuconazole, a systemic ergosterol biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide, and <b>Pyraclostrobin,</b> a strobilurin-type fungicide have also both proven effective in controlling early leaf spot, even more so than chlorothalonil. Usually, fungicides need to be applied multiple times every few weeks; a typical treatment using chlorothalonil or tebuconazole requires fungicides application around seven times starting just 30-45 days after planting. The use of resistant cultivars is the most successful way to be overcome the pathogen and maintain yields. Sources of resistance have been reported and prolong incubation and latent period by reducing the number of lesions per unit area of leaf surface, defoliation, and sporulation.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} {{structures of}} modern agrochemicals {{are much more}} complex than in older products, but lower than of their pharma counterparts. The average molecular weight of the top 10 is 330, as compared with 477 for the top 10. In comparison to reagents used in pharmaceutical fine chemical syntheses, hazardous chemicals, e.g. sodium azide, halogens, methyl sulfide, phosgene, phosphorus chlorides, are more frequently used. Agrochemical companies sometimes outsource just these steps, which require specialized equipment, on toll conversion deals. With exception of the pyrethroids, which are photostable modifications of naturally occurring pyrethrums, active ingredients of agrochemicals rarely are chiral. Examples within herbicides are the world’s longstanding top-selling product, Monsanto’s round-up (glyphosate). Syngenta’s cyclohexadione-type mesotrione and paraquat dichloride. Within insecticides, the traditional organophosphates, like malathion, and pyrethroids such as γ-cyhalotrin are being substituted for by neonicotinoids, like Bayer’s imidacloprid and Syngenta’s thiamethoxam and pyrazoles, such as BASF’s fipronil. Chloranthaniliprole {{is the most important}} representative of Du Pont’s award-winning anthranilic diamide family of broad spectrum insecticides. Within fungicides, the strobilurins, a new class, are growing rapidly and already have captured more than 30% of the $10 billion global fungicide market. Syngenta’s azoxystrobin was the first product launched. Also BASF’s F-500 Series, a.o. <b>pyraclostrobin</b> and kresoxim-methyl, Bayer CropScience, and Monsanto are developing new compounds in this class. Combination pesticides, such as Monsanto’s Genuity and SmartStax are more and more frequently used.|$|E
50|$|Necrotic ring spot can {{be managed}} through {{chemical}} and cultural controls. Cultural control includes the use of ammonium sulfate or other acidifying fertilizers to suppress the pathogen by lowering the pH of the soil to between 6.0 and 6.2. The more acidic soil discourages the activity of O. korrae (9) When reducing pH to these levels, additional manganese applications should be undertaken to compensate for lower pH. As of now, {{there are only two}} resistant cultivars of bluegrass, which are ‘Riviera’, and ‘Patriot’ (9). One component of their resistance could be that they are tolerant to low temperature, because the grass is more susceptible to the pathogen under colder temperatures(8). In addition, reducing watering inputs and growing turf on well drained soils can lessen disease symptoms. Many different fungicides are used to control the pathogen, Fenarimol, Propiconazole, Myclobutanil, and Azoxystrobin (8). Historically, Fenarimol and Myclobutanil were predominantly used (14). In a study where diluted pesticides were sprayed throughout infested test plots, Fenarimol was found to be the most effective with a 94.6% reduction of the disease. Myclobutanil also decreased the amount of disease, but only by 37.7% (8). Myclobutanil is generally recognized as a very weakly acting demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide and fenarimol is no longer registered for turf so a number of other DMI fungicides have been employed successfully, including Propiconazole, Tebuconazole, Metconazole and others. <b>Pyraclostrobin</b> and Fluoxastrobin have also been used to control the pathogen.|$|E

ASR develops slower in resistant cultivars than in susceptible ones, allowing a reduction {{of the number of}} fungicide sprays, but chemical control is still necessary. A field trial was conducted in Ponta Grossa, Parana State, in order to compare the effects of ASR chemical control with four fungicide formulations, in both resistant (BRSGO 7560) and susceptible (CD 249 RR) soybean cultivars. The fungicides were applied twice, beginning at soybean growth stage R 3 ?R 4, when first uredinia were observed, and at soybean stage R 5. 3 ?R 5. 4. The fungicides used were premix formulations of <b>pyraclostrobin</b> + epoxiconazole + fluxapyroxad (40 + 64. 8 + 40 g a. i. /ha), azoxystrobin + cyproconazole (60 + 24 g a. i. /ha), <b>pyraclostrobin</b> + epoxiconazole (79. 8 + 30 g a. i. /ha), and epoxiconazole (125 g a. i. /ha). The ASR severity at soybean growth stage R 7 on nonsprayed plots reached 75. 4 % on the resistant cultivar and 98. 6 % on the susceptible cultivar. Lower ASR severity index were observed in the resistant cultivar, with the treatments <b>pyraclostrobin</b> + epoxiconazole (9. 8 %), <b>pyraclostrobin</b> + epoxiconazole + fluxapyroxad (10. 5 %), and azoxystrobin + cyproconazole (10. 9 %), with an average of disease control ranging from 90. 8 to 91. 3 %. The treatments with <b>pyraclostrobin</b> + epoxiconazole and <b>pyraclostrobin</b> + epoxiconazole + fluxapyroxad provided the lower yield reductions on both soybean cultivars. The yield and grain weight reductions in the nonsprayed treatment were 32 and 28 %, respectively, on the resistant cultivar and 44 and 32 %, respectively, on the susceptible cultivar. 201...|$|E
40|$|Pasmo of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), {{caused by}} Septoria linicola (Speg.) Garassini, is {{commonly}} observed in western Canada every year. Severe pasmo infection can reduce both {{quality and quantity}} of flaxseed. As no flax cultivar is pasmo resistant, flax growers depend on fungicide application to manage this disease. However, continuous use of the same fungicide or fungicides may result in the development of fungicide insensitivity in the pathogen population. The first objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of three fungicide products, <b>pyraclostrobin,</b> fluxapyroxad and fluxapyroxad+pyraclostrobin; and application timing (early-flower, mid-flower and at both stages) on pasmo severity, seed yield and quality of flaxseed. Field studies were conducted at four locations in western Canada in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The results indicated that among the three fungicide products, fluxapyroxad+pyraclostrobin was the most effective. It decreased disease severity to 15 % compared with 59 % for the unsprayed control, followed by <b>pyraclostrobin</b> (20 %) and fluxapyroxad (39 %). Application of fluxapyroxad+pyraclostrobin also increased the seed yield to 2562 kg ha- 1 compared with 1874 kg ha- 1 for the unsprayed control, followed by <b>pyraclostrobin</b> (2391 kg ha- 1) and fluxapyroxad (2340 kg ha- 1). However, application of these products also delayed crop maturity. Fungicide application at mid-flowering stage was the most cost effective and decreased disease severity and improved seed yield. The second objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of S. linicola isolates to <b>pyraclostrobin</b> and fluxapyroxad fungicides by spore germination and microtiter assay methods. In the spore germination assay, the EC 50 of <b>pyraclostrobin</b> for most of the isolates was between 0. 0005 to 0. 007 µg mL– 1 and fluxapyroxad between 0. 001 to 0. 05 µg mL– 1. In the microtiter assay, the EC 50 of <b>pyraclostrobin</b> was between 0. 003 to 0. 021 µg mL– 1 and fluxapyroxad was between 1 and 4 µg mL– 1. No fungicide insensitivity was observed among the isolates of S. linicola to these fungicide products. The findings of these studies will help to make effective pasmo management recommendations and provide a baseline against which to measure future S. linicola isolates suspected of insensitivity to <b>pyraclostrobin</b> and fluxapyroxad fungicides...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} the physiological races of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum isolates, causal agent of anthracnose, collected in green bean producing regions, and assessed the in vitro and in vivo sensitivity of isolates to fungicides. Physiological races of isolates {{were determined by}} inoculation of bean differential cultivars under controlled conditions. In vitro sensitivity of colony growth and conidial germination were evaluated for carbendazim, chlorothalonil, copper oxide, mancozeb, <b>pyraclostrobin,</b> thiophanate-methyl and for the mixtures of mancozeb + copper oxychloride, metiram + <b>pyraclostrobin</b> and thiophanate-methyl + chlorothalonil at concentrations of 1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg/mL on PDA medium. In vivo sensitivity was determined in detached primary leaves of green beans previously treated with the same fungicides (commercial doses) recommended for the crop, and then inoculated with conidial suspensions of C. lindemuthianum. C. lindemuthianum isolates were identified as belonging to races 65 and 81. Treatments with <b>pyraclostrobin</b> and the mixture metiram + <b>pyraclostrobin</b> were the most effective in inhibiting the colony growth and conidial germination in vitro, a result also observed for the in vivo experiments, where these chemicals were the most effective in controlling the green bean anthracnose...|$|E
40|$|There {{are reports}} that strobilurin besides having a {{fungicide}} effect can promote physiologic benefits to the plants. However, this effect on banana plants was not studied yet. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of strobirulins on the physiology of banana plantlets. For this purpose, cultivar Grand Naine banana plantlets were transferred to pots containing substrate and kept in a nursery with 50 % shading. The experimental design was a completely randomized design with three treatments (water, azoxystrobin and <b>pyraclostrobin)</b> and five replications. The treatments were applied at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 days after transplanting at a dose 100 g a. i. ha(- 1) with manual spray. Plant height, pseudostem diameter, shoot dry matter in strobilurin treated plants were higher than the untreated plants, however, the effect of fungicide treatment was different, being the most pronounced effect of <b>pyraclostrobin</b> compared to azoxystrobin. Plants treated with <b>pyraclostrobin</b> had higher leaf area, nitrate reductase activity and chlorophyll content of leaf total nitrogen than the plants treated with azoxystrobin and water, which did not differ. Strobilurins affect the physiology of the banana plantlets differently, the effect being more pronounced by <b>pyraclostrobin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present work {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} strobilurins, boscalid, plant growth regulators and vegetal extracts on the physico-chemical quality of tomato fruits (Solanum lycopersicum L.), hybrid Giuliana. The fruits from each treatment were selected and separated in 4 repetitions: control, <b>pyraclostrobin,</b> boscalid, <b>pyraclostrobin</b> + boscalid, IBA + GA 3 + kinetin, GA 4 + 7 + benzylaminopurine and vegetal extract. The first application was carried out at 30 days after transplant and the following at every 15 days. The evaluations were: weight loss, titratable acidity (TA), soluble solids (SS), SS/TA relation, pH, ascorbic acid content, texture, total soluble sugars (TSS), activity of pectin methyl esterase (PME) and polygalacturonase (PG). The SS content, responsible for fruit flavor, varied accordingly to the treatment, being highest for GA 4 + 7 + benzylaminopurine and lowest for the control. The same occurred regarding the SS/AT relation. The fruits were kept on the shelf for 9 days, at room temperature, being {{that at the end}} of this period several treatments still presented fruit in optimal consumption conditions, notably the boscalid treatment, which presented lowest weight loss, followed by <b>pyraclostrobin.</b> Therefore, it can be concluded that the application of the treatments did not modify the values for pH, AT and AST of the fruits. The highest PME activity was observed for the treatments with boscalid and the mixture of boscalid and <b>pyraclostrobin,</b> while the lowest PG activity occurred in the control and the <b>pyraclostrobin</b> treatment, indicating that some products accelerated the process of demethylation of pectins by PME, facilitating the action of PG. ...|$|E
