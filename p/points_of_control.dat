5000|$|Intervention {{strategies}} and techniques for Bobath consist of therapeutic handling, facilitation, and activation of key <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Therapeutic handling {{is used in}} order to influence {{the quality of the}} patients movements and incorporates both facilitation and inhibition. [...] Facilitation is a key technique used by Bobath practitioners to promote motor learning. It is the use of sensory information (tactile cue through manual contacts, verbal directions) to reinforce weak movement patterns and to discourage overactive ones. The appropriate provision of facilitation during the motor task is regulated in time, modality, intensity and withdrawal, all of which affects the outcome of motor learning. [...] Inhibition can be described as reducing parts of movement/posture that are abnormal and interfere with normal performance. Key <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> generally refers to parts of the body that are advantageous when facilitating or inhibiting movement/posture.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental to the {{development}} of musical or artis-tic creative work is the ability to transform raw materi-als. This ability implies the facility to master many facets of the material, and to shape it with plasticity. Computer music environments typically provide <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> to manipulate material by supplying parameters with con-trollable values. This capability to control the values of parameters is inadequate for many artistic endeavors, and does not reflect the analogous tools and methods of artists working with physical materials. Rather than viewing parameters in computer-based systems as single <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> the authors posit that parameters must become more multifaceted and dynamic in order to serve the needs of artists. The authors propose an expanded notion of how to work with parameters in computer-centric environments for time-based art. A pro-posed partial solution to this problem is to give parameters additional properties that define their behavior. An exam-ple implementation of these ideas is presented in Jamoma. 1...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{internet}} {{defies the}} classic state law model, {{according to which}} the sovereign state makes and enforces the law on its territory, including {{by the use of}} force (Frydman, 1997; Svantesson, 2005). The required bond between state sovereignty, national territory and law is loose when dealing with internet regulation. In addition, international law does not answer the question of which court(s) should have jurisdiction over internet litigation and what law(s) should be applied (Berman, 2002; Svantesson, 2005). In other words, the internet engages regulators to use new methods of drafting and implementing legal rules. Co-regulation is one of the techniques that can be used. Despite the fact that defining “co-regulation” remains challenging and unsettled (Poullet, 2004; Lievens, Dumortier and Ryan, 2006; Hennebel and Lewkowicz, 2007), a theoretical sketch of what the co-regulation model entails can be produced. For analytical purposes, it is convenient to make a distinction between regulators and what Jonathan Zittrain (2003) calls “points of control. ” Regulators are public or private bodies willing to influence the behaviors of actors in a field of action. <b>Points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> are any public or private actors that, for any reason, play a strategic role in a particular area. Regarding internet regulation, the method used by regulators consists in leaning on these <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> as regulatory levers. The so-called “co-regulatory mechanism” must be understood in this chapter as a legal device designed to put pressure on the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> to achieve some regulatory result.

40|$|Abstract. Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are {{increasingly}} used in software engineering methodologies and tools to capture, for instance, system requirements, test scenarios, and simulation traces. They have been standardized by ITU-T in Recommendation Z. 120 [IT 96]. However, {{various aspects of}} environment behavior remain underspecied in MSCs, e. g., the presence of resources for inter-process communication and the coordination of concurrent processes at <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> branching. Such underspeci cations can result in ambiguities in an MSC specication and discrepancies between an MSC specication and its implementation. In this paper we characterize two consequences of harmful underspecica-tions: process divergence and non-local branching choice. We also present two syntax-based analysis algorithms that detect both problems. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} aspect {{in the design}} of hardware/software systems is design-for-test. Improving the testability of a hardware/software system typically implies improving the controllability and observability of the internal system behavior. This can be achieved by introducing <b>Points</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> and Observation (PCOs) in a system. In this paper, we examine the effects of PCO insertion in a behavioral system specification expressed in the CCS process algebra. We define a collection of behavior-preserving transformations that enable PCOs to be inserted in a correct way, i. e. without disturbing the initial system behavior. The transformations are proven to preserve the observational system behavior and therefore they make the time-consuming process of a posteriori formal verification superfluous. 1...|$|E
