40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe research using the Helical Turbine for hydropower with particular focus on fish safety in the presence of a spinning mechanical rotor. Two possibilities of fish mortality are discussed, namely for the case of free flow in kinetic scheme (without dam), and constrained flow (with dam). Correspondingly, the following two conclusions are formulated. <b>Probability</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>kill</b> by kinetic turbines in free flow approaches zero since fish can easily detect and avoid the spinning rotor. The <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>kill</b> in constrained flow is also very low because peripheral, helical blades of the turbine provide sufficient open space for fish passage. The latter conclusion leads to a recommendation of using a dam with helical turbines to generate much more and less expensive power than the plain kinetic scheme can provide at similar sites. Also, an inexpensive flexible barrier instead of conventional rigid dam is discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{military}} operations research, {{it is often}} desired to estimate the expected casualties that would accrue to each side in a battle between opposing forces. One way to obtain credible estimates is to use field tests in which battles with engagements between battle units (such as tanks, armored personnel carriers and ground-to-ground missile systems) are simulated. One common feature of such simulated battles {{is the use of}} real time casualty assessment to determine the outcome of each engagement. Real time casualty assessment uses pre-set <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>kill,</b> or Pk values; a Bernoulli trial with a Pk appropriate for the conditions of the engagement determines whether the battle unit fired upon is killed and thus removed from further play in the battle. For various reasons, it may be desired to estimate the expected numbers of battle units of given types that would be killed for Pk values different from those used in the experiment. This can be accomplished, using adjustments to the estimates obtained for the original experiment. Such estimators can be based on the computed aliveness of surviving battle units. We discuss two formulations of the aliveness concept, and compare the resulting estimators[URL]...|$|R
5000|$|This measure {{may also}} be used to express the {{accuracy}} of a weapon system.

50|$|The LAHAT is {{designed}} to achieve a 95 percent <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>kill</b> under most conditions.

With a low launch signature, the missile’s trajectory can be set to match either top attack (armoured fighting vehicle, warship) or direct attack (helicopter gunship) engagements.|$|E
40|$|A unique {{multicomponent}} vaccine against serogroup B meningococci {{incorporates the}} novel genome-derived proteins fHbp, NHBA, and NadA that may vary in sequence {{and level of}} expression. Measuring the effectiveness of such vaccines, using the accepted correlate of protection against invasive meningococcal disease, could require performing the serum bactericidal assay (SBA) against many diverse strains for each geographic region. This approach is impractical, especially for infants, where serum volumes are very limited. To address this, we developed the meningococcal antigen typing system (MATS) by combining a unique vaccine antigen-specific ELISA, which detects qualitative and quantitative differences in antigens, with PorA genotyping information. The ELISA correlates with killing of strains by SBA and measures both immunologic cross-reactivity and quantity of the antigens NHBA, NadA, and fHbp. We found that strains exceeding a threshold value in the ELISA {{for any of the}} three vaccine antigens had ≥ 80 % <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> being <b>killed</b> by immune serum in the SBA. Strains positive for two or more antigens had a 96 % <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> being <b>killed.</b> Inclusion <b>of</b> multiple different antigens in the vaccine improves breadth of coverage and prevents loss of coverage if one antigen mutates or is lost. The finding that a simple and high-throughput assay correlates with bactericidal activity is a milestone in meningococcal vaccine development. This assay allows typing of large panels of strains and prediction of coverage of protein-based meningococcal vaccines. Similar assays may be used for protein-based vaccines against other bacteria...|$|R

50|$|As the Vespine wasps {{approach}} {{the entrance to}} the honeybee nest, more guard bees are alerted, which in turn increases their <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> being <b>killed</b> by heat-balling bees.

Alternatively, however, {{in the presence of a}} wasp, the bees may also just withdraw into their nests and await the heat-balling circumstances to develop naturally. Furthermore, other bees may just decide to fly away as an evasive measure in times of conflict, often altering their specific flight styles in order to avoid predation.|$|R
50|$|Computer games, simulations, models, and {{operations}} research programs often require {{a mechanism to}} determine statistically whether the engagement between a weapon and a target resulted in a kill, or the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>kill.</b> Statistical decisions are required {{when all of the}} variables that must be considered are not incorporated into the model, similar to the actuarial methods used by insurance companies to deal with large numbers of customers and huge numbers of variables.

50|$|The Sky Dragon {{air defense}} system (SD ADS) is an SAM {{system based on}} the DK-10.

40|$|In Central Europe, {{protected}} areas {{are too small}} to ensure survival of populations of large carnivores. In the surrounding areas, these species are often persecuted due to competition with game hunters. Therefore, understanding how predation intensity varies spatio-temporally across areas with different levels of protection is fundamental. We investigated the predation patterns of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) on roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) in both {{protected areas}} and multi-use landscapes of the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem. Based on 359 roe and red deer killed by 10 GPS-collared lynx, we calculated the species-specific annual kill rates and tested for effects of season and lynx age, sex and reproductive status. Because roe and red deer in the study area concentrate in unprotected lowlands during winter, we modeled spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>kills</b> separately for summer and winter and calculated-the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a deer <b>killed</b> by lynx and-the expected number <b>of</b> <b>kills</b> for areas with different levels of protection. Significantly more roe deer (46. 05 - 74. 71 /year/individual lynx) were killed than red deer (1. 57 - 9. 63 /year/individual lynx), more deer were killed in winter than in summer, and lynx family groups had higher annual kill rates than adult male, single adult female and subadult female lynx. In winter the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a deer <b>killed</b> and the expected number <b>of</b> <b>kills</b> were higher outside the most protected part of the study area than inside; in summer, this probability did not differ between areas, and the expected number <b>of</b> <b>kills</b> was slightly larger inside than outside the most protected part of the study area. This indicates that the intensity of lynx predation in the unprotected part of the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem increases in winter, thus mitigation of conflicts in these areas should be included as a priority in the lynx conservation strategy...|$|R

50|$|The 9K38 Igla (NATO {{reporting}} name is S-18 Grouse) is a 72.2 mm man-portable {{air defense}} missile weighing 10.6 kilograms with a 1.3 kilogram warhead. The missile itself is 1.67 meters long, the container is 1.708 meters {{and the whole}} system weights 17 kilograms. The system is designed to engage fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, cruise missiles and UAVs flying at speeds of 360-400 m/s in head-on engagement (approaching target) and up to 320 m/s in tail chase (receding target) within their optical visibility and in the night-time conditions in background clutter and thermal countermeasures environment. The system uses thermal battery/gas bottle, and is armed with a high-explosive warhead fitted with a contact and grazing fuse. The missile has a maximum range of 5200 meters and operates at altitudes from ten and up to 3500 meters. The 9M39 missile SA-18 employs an IR (infrared) guidance system using proportional convergence logic.

50|$|The S-300PMU-1 was {{introduced}} in 1999 {{and for the first}} time introduces several different kinds of missiles in a single system. In addition to the 5V55R and 48N6E missiles the S-300PMU-1 can utilise two new missiles, the 9M96E1 and 9M96E2. Both are significantly smaller than the previous missiles at 330 and 420 kg respectively) and carry smaller 24 kg warhead. The 9M96E1 has an engagement range of 1 - 40 km and the 9M96E2 of 1 - 120 km. They are still carried 4 per TEL. Rather than just relying on aerodynamic fins for manoeuvring, they use a gas-dynamic system which allows them to have an excellent <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>kill</b> (Pk) despite the much smaller warhead. The Pk is estimated at 0.7 against a tactical ballistic missile for either missile. The S-300PMU-1 typically uses the 83M6E command and control system, although it is also compatible with the older Baikal-1E and Senezh-M1E CCS command and control systems. The 83M6E system incorporates the 64N6E (BIG BIRD) surveillance/detection radar. The fire control/illumination and guidance radar used is the 30N6E(1), optionally matched with a 76N6 low altitude detection radar and a 96L6E all altitude detection radar.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{avalanche}} {{risk from}} backcountry skiing and {{its dependence on}} the regional danger ratings have not been estimated—notably in North America. To get around this data gap, {{we have tried to}} calculate the risk using an event tree which breaks the avalanche risk to backcountry skiers into the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> triggering, the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> being caught in a triggered avalanche, and the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> death if caught. An expert survey estimated the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> triggering a potentially fatal avalanche while making fresh tracks in a trigger zone for each level of regional avalanche danger. A previous study found that 40 % of people who trigger a potentially fatal avalanche are caught. Based on accident reports, the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> being <b>killed</b> depends on the avalanche size, the distribution of which is known for skier-triggered avalanches in Canada. To calculate the daily risk, we modelled making fresh tracks in a specified number of trigger zones as an encounter probability. Based on our assumptions, a person can directly ski a dozen or so trigger zones in a day while the regional danger is Low or Moderate with comparable risk to kayaking. For a person skiing directly 5 - 10 trigger zones while the avalanche danger is Considerable, the daily risk is likely higher than kayaking and in the range of rock climbing or mountaineering...|$|R
