The authors {{demonstrate that the}} zero-sum nature of league play renders past estimates inappropriate. Adjusted for league play, Gini coefficients reveal a much larger competitive balance problem than shown in previous estimates. However, additional complexities involving unbalanced schedules, interdivisional play, and now interleague play must be overcome before winning percentage Gini coefficients can give precise estimates of competitive balance. The authors suggest using the traditional measures of winning <b>percentage</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> and their idealized values to analyze within-season competitive balance over time until these issues are overcome. ...|$|R

We reproduce all these facts in a multi-sector growth model with the following characteristics: different final goods are produced using different proportions of the same set of intermediate inputs, construction is relatively labor intensive, residential investment is relatively construction intensive, and housing depreciates much more slowly than business capital.

30|$|Among the {{different}} possible methods of data treatment, the Box-Whiskers graphs were chosen since {{they provide the}} main information on the differences recorded throughout the monitoring period by each data-logger, i.e. median values, 5 °, 10 °, 25 °, 90 °, 95 ° percentiles and spreads. Moreover, in order to highlight the daily maximum variation two graphs showing the average Temperature and Relative Humidity measured at 6 -hour intervals, along the vertical profile are also reported. Original data are shown, as run-plots, in Additional file 1 : Figure S 9. Furthermore, Additional file 1 : Figure S 10 compares standard deviation (SD) of T and RH data measured by all indoor sensors, during the whole monitoring period, with the corresponding parameters measured by the outdoor sensor, while, Additional file 1 : Figure S 11 compares the <b>percentage</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Deviation</b> calculated for T and RH.

Hence, the precision of nominated potentiometric method was measured as <b>percentage</b> relative <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (RSD %) using the sensors under evaluation.
