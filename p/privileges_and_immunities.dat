However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs {{are entitled to a}} pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunities.</b> To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.|$|E

This study also highlights how the secrecy authorized by Ohio audit privilege challenges our conception of democracy {{and the way in which}} democratic participation and personal liberty are exercised in the United States. In conclusion, the findings of this research and analysis suggest that Ohio audit privilege should be abolished based on the tenants of environmental law and democratic theory...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} voluntary efforts to self-audit on compliance with Clean Air Act regulations. It also {{examines the}} effect that state audit <b>privilege</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunity</b> laws have on the incentives for auditing and for improving compliance. Using data for a sample of S&P 500 firms, we correct for the endogeneity of the environmental audit decision by estimating a bivariate probit model with 'compliance status’ and 'decision to self-audit’ as two discrete choice variables. Our empirical analysis controls for compliance and self-auditing incentives created by regulatory and community-based pressures. We find that those facilities belonging to firms that {{have been subject to}} inspections in the past, that face a stronger threat of liabilities for Superfund sites, and that are more visible due to size are more likely to undertake an environmental audit. State audit <b>privilege</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunity</b> laws are not found to have a statistically significant effect on incentives for self-auditing. Facilities that self-audit {{are more likely to be}} in compliance with Clean Air Act regulations. However, audit privilege policies are found to have a statistically significant negative impact on compliance while audit immunity laws are found to have an insignificant impact on compliance. ...|$|R
