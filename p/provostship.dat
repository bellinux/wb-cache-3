At the Restoration of the king in 1660, he was favourably received at court and in 1665 would have received the <b>provostship</b> of Eton College had he agreed to take holy orders, but this he refused {{to do on the}} ground that his writings on religious subjects would have greater weight coming from a layman than a paid minister of the Church.|$|E
25|$|A papal {{privilege}} dated 26 January 1386, {{admitted the}} Provost of St Mary's to the chapter of St Andrews; {{he became one}} of the three secular dignitaries of the chapter, along with the diocese's two archeadecons:Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. At the petition of king Robert, the pope hereby constitutes as a secular dignity with cure of the cathedral of St Andrews, that dignity of the Chapel Royal of St Andrews, immediately subject to the Apostolic See, which is commonly known as the <b>provostship</b> of St Andrews, assigning to the provost and his successors a stall in the choir and a place in the chapter, with a voice in the election of the bishop, or of any other office, and in all capitular acts and negotiations, and the said provost nevertheless remaining subject to the bishop, who has the power to correct him, and if necessary even deprive him of office. Although in the cathedral there are no dignities, there are two archdeaconries which are reckoned as dignities, and the seculars holding them have stalls in the choir and places in the chapter, with a voice in all capitular matters. Avignon, 9 Kal. Feb., anno 9. In the 1440s, the Chancellor of the Church of St Mary was added to the chapter of the cathedral (1447 x 1449), but this lasted less than two decades, being dissolved between 1461 and 1462.|$|E

On 23 May a mandate was sent to the senior clergy of the bishopric of Glasgow authorising them to collate Thomas to the archdeaconry of Galloway, at that point occupied [...] "unlawfully" [...] by Patrick Smerles; the mandate gave dispensation for Thomas to retain control of both the <b>provostship</b> of Maybole and the vicarage of Lochrutton. He was still litigating with Smerles on 9 August 1393, by which point in time he had resigned Lochrutton; he was in firm possession of the archdeaconry by 21 October 1394. During his time as Archdeacon of Galloway, the church of Penninghame was annexed as a prebend of the office.|$|E

500|$|On 1 February 1388, {{a letter}} from Avignon Pope Clement VII to the {{official}} of the diocese of Glasgow says that Thomas [...] "holds the <b>provostship</b> of the chapel of St Mary de Mayboyl, Glasgow diocese, which is a simple benefice without cure". The collegiate church of Maybole was founded under the patronage of John Kennedy, Lord of Dunure, a short time before 2 February 1382, when a mandate was issued by the papacy confirming its erection. A year previously the Lord of Dunure had founded a chapel to St Mary beside the parish church of Maybole, and the erection established a provost, two chaplains and a clerk. Thomas de Buittle held the vicarage there. It is possible that Thomas was the senior priest there when it was erected into a collegiate church; Thomas is certainly the earliest known provost, and neither the appointment nor the death of any predecessor are noted anywhere.|$|E

He again held that office from Michaelmas 1502 till 1504, and from 1505 to 1513. He is noted also as holding concurrently {{the office of}} Justice-Depute with the <b>provostship</b> in 1508 and 1512, if not consecutively. George Touris of Inverleith was appointed caretaker Provost on 19 August 1513, when Lauder left for Flodden.|$|E
2500|$|Besides the Brobergens and Haseldorfs further noble {{families}} from the Elbe–Weser triangle (Bremian ministerialis {{such as the}} [...] ) bestowed land and dues on the convent.

The provost and the convent's prioress stewarded its possessions together. Until the secularisation Porta Coeli's provosts were usually simultaneously capitular canons residing in Bremen city.

2500|$|Under the <b>provostship</b> of Richard Okes, from 1850 {{until his}} death in 1888, the college began a period of reform. [...] On 1 May 1851 it was agreed to abolish the {{privilege}} of King's members to be granted a degree without passing the university examinations. [...] In 1861 the college statutes were amended so as to expand the college and, more radically, to allow for the election of non-Etonian King's members: the new statutes provided for forty-six Fellows, twenty-four scholarships reserved for boys from Eton, and twenty-four [...] "open" [...] scholarships for boys from any school. [...] At the same time all formal obligation to take Holy Orders – unenforced since the seventeenth century – was removed. [...] The statutes were again amended in 1882, this time ensuring fellowships were not always for life and were awarded on merit after submissions of original research. [...] The first non-Etonian students were admitted to study at King's in 1865, and the first non-Etonian scholars and the first non-Etonian fellow were elected in 1873.|$|E
6000|$|While these controversies were raging, Dryden's {{time was}} {{occupied}} with the translations or imitations of Chaucer and Boccacio. Among these, the [...] "Character of the Good Parson" [...] is introduced, probably to confute Milbourne, Blackmore, and Collier, who had severally charged our author with the wilful and premeditated contumely thrown upon the clergy in many passages of his satirical writings. This too {{seems to have}} inflamed the hatred of Swift, who, with all his levities, was strictly attached to his order, and keenly jealous of its honours.[37] Dryden himself {{seems to have been}} conscious of his propensity to assail churchmen. [...] "I remember," [...] he writes to his sons, [...] "the counsel you gave me in your letter; but dissembling, although lawful in some cases, is not my talent; yet, for your sake, I will struggle with the plain openness of my nature, and keep in my just resentments against that degenerate order."[38] Milbourne, and other enemies of our author, imputed this resentment against the clergy, to his being refused orders when he wished to take them, in the reign of Charles, with a view to the <b>Provostship</b> of Eton, or some Irish preferment.[39] But Dryden assures us, that he never had any thoughts of entering the Church. Indeed, his original offences of this kind may be safely ascribed to the fashionable practice, after the Restoration, of laughing at all that was accounted serious before that period.|$|E

50|$|Other North American {{universities}} and colleges created <b>provostships</b> during and after World War II when dramatic increases in undergraduate enrollments (due to the G.I.

By the 1960s, {{most of the other}} Ivy League institutions (Dartmouth, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, and Brown) had provosts (or equivalents), as did other private research universities such as the University of Chicago, Stanford University, Rice University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tufts University, Emory University, Wake Forest University and Duke University.|$|R

Provosts were entrusted with and carried out local royal power, including the collection of the Crown's domainal revenues and all taxes and duties owed the King within a <b>provostship's</b> jurisdiction. They were also responsible for military defense such as raising local contingents for royal armies. The provosts also administered justice though with limited jurisdiction.|$|R

These churches mostly disappeared during the centuries, but their spatial organisation can be partly reconstructed. One of their common features is the complexity of the western parts. On the one hand, various architectural types can be found (western apse with crypt, transversal mass with towers, two-tower façade), but origins of an architectural tradition can also be detected. The main element of this tradition, complementary to former research, is not the westwork, but the presence of two western towers which will be a "leitmotiv" of the later Romanesque architecture in Hungary...|$|R

50|$|Since the 11th century, the provosts tended {{increasingly}} {{to make their}} positions hereditary and thus became more difficult to control. One of the King's great officers, the Great Seneschal, became their supervisor. In the 12th century, the office of provost was put up for bidding, and thereafter provosts were farmers of revenues. The provost thus received the speculative right to collect the King's seignorial revenues within his <b>provostship.</b> This remained his primary role. Short-term appointments also helped stem the heritability of offices. Very early, however, certain provostships were bestowed en garde, i.e., on condition the provost regularly render accounts to the King for his collections. Farmed provostships (prévôtes en ferme) were naturally a source of abuse and oppression. Naturally, too, the people were discontent. Joinville told of how under St Louis the <b>provostship</b> of Paris became an accountable <b>provostship</b> (prévôté en garde). With the death of Louis XI, farmed provostships were still numerous and spurred a remonstrance from the States General in 1484. Charles VIII promised to abolish the office in 1493, but the office is mentioned in the Ordinance of 1498. They disappeared in the 16th century, by which time the provosts had become regular officials, their office, however, being purchasable.|$|E
