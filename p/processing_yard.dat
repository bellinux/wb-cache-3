40|$|The {{harvesting}} {{and use of}} in-forest residues as bioenergy is {{not common}} in New Zealand. However, most of the large wood-processing plants (pulpmills, papermills, and sawmills) have co-generation plants for converting woody residues from wood processing (bark, shavings, and sawdust) into process steam and electricity. In a number of New Zealand's major areas of forestry, changes in harvesting practices have recently taken place, from conventional landing-based stem-to-log processing {{to the use of}} two-stage extraction with full stems being taken to central <b>processing</b> <b>yards</b> or super skids for conversion into logs. These changes have brought about a concentration of stem-to-log processing waste at the central processing sites. This waste is of such a volume as to create a disposal problem (cost). Use of this material as bioenergy fuels at nearby processing plants, or as panel fibre, is economically and environmentally desirable...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a case study on the effects of {{extended}} working hours on the productivity and value recovery of an off-forest, central <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> in New Zealand. Results are based on long-term data that have been collected by indirect methods.|$|E
30|$|A database, {{containing}} over 120, 000 {{records on}} Pinus radiata D.Don (radiata pine) stems processed during 214 work shifts, was analysed {{in order to}} determine the impact of time of day on value recovery and productivity of log-handling equipment that consisted of a scanning optimiser and two mechanised processors operating in an off-forest central <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> in New Zealand.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Over {{the next}} quarter century {{there will be}} about an eight-fold {{increase}} in the volume of wood harvested annually from New Zealand's steep terrain radiata pine plantations. With the move to steeper terrain {{it is expected that}} there will be a trend towards considerably smaller landings. With smaller landings final log manufacture could have to take place at alternative locations to the large landings normally used. The locations examined in this thesis were: at the stump, at a landing, and at a central <b>processing</b> <b>yard.</b> Comparisons were made on the basis of value recovery, harvesting productivity and costs, and land taken out of production by landings. A field trial indicated that value recovery at the landing was better than at the stump but the magnitude of difference was dependent on individual log manufacturers. Better value recovery on the landing was generally due to more logs meeting specification and more accurate length measurements. Radiata pine stems are too long to be hauled to a central <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> without some initial cuts being made at the stump. Initial cuts preempt future log manufacturing decisions. An analysis of fixed long length patterns indicated that about 5 ? of possible value would be foregone by these preemptive cuts. To analyse the effect of alternative log manufacturing locations on harvesting productivity and costs a stump-to-milldoor simulation model was constructed. Tree-length logging to large landings was the most productive and least costly alternative, the stump was the second best alternative, and the central <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> was the most expensive and least preferred alternative. In an overall economic analysis it was concluded that where possible large landings and yarders should continue to be used. Where it is not possible to use large landings, final log manufacturing should be carried out at the stump, provided log manufacturers have handheld computers to assist them in decision making so that value recovery is kept as high as possible...|$|E
40|$|Possibilities {{for energy}} wood {{procurement}} in the Leningrad region are assessed in this report. As sources for energy production, wood from thinnings, logging residues, non-industrial round wood and residues from sawmilling are considered. The costs for energy wood procurement are also calculated. Available energy wood, {{based on the}} 2004 actual cut, if collected, is approximately 4 million m 3. Nearly 86 % of it is non-industrial round wood and felling residues in cutting areas (56 %) and central <b>processing</b> <b>yards</b> (30 %), the rest (14 %) are by-products from sawmilling. The deciduous tree species (birch and aspen) dominate and are valued at 65 % of {{the total amount of}} felling residiues and non-industrial wood. It is possible to intensify utilisation of forest resources and thereby also to increase the use of wood in energy production. The total amount could be 54 % higher if the allowable cut could be utilised completely and 124 % higher if thinnings could also be utilised completely. There are, however, big differences within the region, as the current rate of utilisation of forest resources varies in the region. Currently, pre-commercial thinning is an economically unfeasible source of energy wood. Despite well developed technologies, the high costs of the pre-commercial thinning make supply of energy wood unprofitable. Commercial thinnings are economically more attractive as sources of energy wood. However, a choice of energy wood procurement chain for the 1 st commercial thinning is limited by cost factors. There are more possibilities for energy wood supply from the 2 nd commercial thinning. The most cost-efficient supply chain based on a harvester and a forwarder allows a profitable energy wood supply from a distance of up to 150 km. Currently, at final felling areas non-industrial wood is an economically feasible resource for energy production. The same applies to the availability of process residues at central <b>processing</b> <b>yards</b> and sawmills, where lump wood and slabs are the most cost-efficient resources for wood chip production and at present these sources of energy wood look very attractive. The issue of how much energy wood may enter the market depends almost entirely on the market situation, i. e. supply and demand, which is influenced by the price of energy wood and competing energy sources...|$|R
40|$|The energy wood {{procurement}} {{possibilities for}} the eight regions making up Northwest Russia were assessed. Wood byproducts from roundwood harvesting and sawmilling were considered for energy production based on actual harvesting, sawmill and plywood production figures for 2006. Of the total calculated potential of 31 million solid m 3 (62 TWh), nearly 70 % (21. 8 million m 3) is from harvesting. The remainder (9 million m 3) is from saw and plywood milling. The approximate available energy wood by region would be: 2. 3 million m 3 from the Republic of Karelia, 2. 7 million m 3 from the Republic of Komi, 5. 4 million m 3 from Arkhangelsk, 4. 6 million m 3 from Vologda, 3. 8 million m 3 from Leningrad, 2. 0 million m 3 from Novgorod, 0. 8 million m 3 from Pskov, and 41, 000 m 3 from the Murmansk regions. There are large differences in the potentials between and within the regions. This {{is due to the}} differences in their forest resources; differences in their utilisation of these resources; the available intrastructures; some limitations on wood harvesting. A part of this calculated potential is already utilised, since some non-industrial roundwood from central <b>processing</b> <b>yards</b> sawmills and plywood mills are currently used in energy production. Nearly 65 % of all the potential energy wood from roundwood harvesting is non-industrial roundwood, 19 % is spruce stumps removed after final felling, 8 % is unused branches and tops, and 8 % is defective wood resulting from logging. About 58 % of the total potential energy wood from roundwood harvesting is coniferous. However, there are large differences between the regions and within the regions in the species proportions. Currently about 40 % of the allowable cut is used. This means that {{it would be possible to}} intensify the utilisation of the forest resources and thereby also to increase the use of wood for energy production. Full implementation of the allowable cut could provide 73. 5 million m 3 of energy wood (147 TWh). In addition, if the technical potential for thinnings was utilised, the total potential energy wood provided by roundwood harvesting, saw and plywood milling could be 104 million m 3 (208 Twh) ...|$|R

30|$|Traditionally, initial {{assessment}} of logs in New Zealand has occurred at landing {{areas in the}} forest close to felling operations.

Purported advantages of centralised processing include the provision of many wood-marketing and value-capturing services via concentrating, merchandising, processing, and sorting of logs (Dramm et al.

Additional advantages may include savings in road construction and transportation costs, reduced logging and landing construction costs, reduced environmental impacts resulting from smaller landings, improved utilisation of logging residues, and greater opportunities resulting from artificial lighting to work longer hours in a yard than in a forest (McKerchar & Twaddle [1987]).|$|E

40|$|Locomotive {{planning}} {{has been}} a popular application of classical optimization models for decades, but with very few success stories. There {{are a host of}} complex rules governing how locomotives should be used. In addition, it is necessary to simultaneously manage locomotive inventories by balancing the need for holding power against the need for power at other yards. At the same time, we have to plan the need to return foreign power, and move power to maintenance facilities for scheduled FRA appointments. An additional complication arises {{as a result of the}} high level of uncertainty in transit times and delays due to <b>yard</b> <b>processing,</b> and as a result we may have to plan additional inventories in order to move outbound trains on time despite inbound delays. We describe a novel modeling and algorithmic strategy known as approximate dynamic programming, which can also be described as a form of “optimizing simulator ” which uses feedback learning to plan locomotive movements in a way that closely mimics how humans plan real‐world operations. This strategy can be used for strategic and tactical planning, and can also be adapted to real‐time operations. We describe the strategy, and summarize experiences at Norfolk Southern with a strategic planning system.

The f. ishery resources of the sea have been exploited by man from time immemorial and the recent rapid strides in technology have enabled him to utilise the vast and deep expanses of the oceans effectively. The total annual world fish production is estimated as 92. 86 million tonnes in 1999. Of this, production from marine fisheries alone accounted for 84. 6 million tonnes (FAO, 1999). India ranks eighth (FAO, 1999) in the total fish production in the world.

In the 3651 fishing villages situated along the coastline, about one million people are employed full time in marine capture fisheries. The fish ing sector dominated by small scale and semi industrial operations, support several ancillary industries such as boat building <b>yards,</b> <b>processing</b> plants etc (Devaraj and Vivekanandan, 1999). Marine fisheries operations have grown from a subsistence level carried out almost exclusively by the traditional fishermen in the preindependence days, to that of a capital-intensive industry requiring close monitoring and management for their sustainability.

The mechanisation of indigenous artisanal fishing craft and the introduction of modern gear materials during the fifties, introduction of synthetic gear materials during the sixties, advent of purse seining and the motorisation of artisanal craft in the seventies and the substantial growth of motorised artisanal craft operating ring-seines in the eighties were some of the factors contributing to the phenomenal growth of the fisheries sector (Devaraj et al., 1997) ...|$|R

40|$|Dried ginger {{for export}} Cue: Drying fruits and {{vegetables}} preserves them and ensures that they retain all of their nutritional goodness. But there is another reason that drying fruits or vegetables can be rewarding ? it can produce profit, especially if your organisation or farmers? group can export to International markets. But as Adu Domfeh found out when he visited the Yogi Botanicals ginger exporting group, the standards are strict, and the work is hard. There are rules to follow for washing, slicing, drying and packaging ? particularly for organic produce. But the task is not impossible ? if you are hard working and able to get financial credit for investing in processing technology, you could reap the rewards. To explain more, director Daniel A. Mensah takes us on a tour through the <b>processing</b> <b>yards</b> of Yogi Botanicals. IN:	?I am Daniel A. Mensah? OUT:	? to meet the international standard. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 50 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Adu Domfeh reporting from Kumasi in Ghana. He was speaking to Daniel Mensah and Kojo Tera from Yogi Botanicals, a cooperative exporting ginger to Europe. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mensah	I am Daniel A. Mensah {{and this is where}} we do our processing. This is our site, this is where we receive our ginger and then we process for exports. Domfeh	So what do you consider when you want to dry these products? Mensah	Yes what we consider is we need to have stages, we need to have labourers and then we need to get our necessary things for slicing and other things before we start our drying. Domfeh	So what is involved in the drying of such produce? Mensah	Actually, the only thing that we need is to get our stages ready, our plastic sheets and all the sacks ready for our drying and then after slicing we take it to the drying. When we dry we have people there as you can see yourself, they are disturbing the ginger like how they process cocoa and this should be a continual disturbance, maybe after three hours, every two hours they have to disturb the ginger so that it dries very quickly. It takes about three to four days to dry finally. You know {{we have to be very}} careful that we do not have any sun or any other bad materials within it so that it does not affect our international markets you know. Domfeh	So talking about international market, what standards need to be met and how do you obtain certification, especially organic certification? Mensah	Ok, concerning the international standards we have certifiers who will certify our produce throughout the world. We make sure that we have followed organic standards, to meet the standards. So this is where we store the fresh ginger and then here also we have about six women who work on sorting and then breaking of the ginger before we finally wash for slicing. So for now they have almost finished with the one that they have sorted out and they have also washed them all here. So we are coming to start some slicing right now. SFX	(Moving towards drying area) Mensah	We need to construct more stages, that is why we are even using the ground, the bare floor to dry the ginger. So we need more stages in order to expand our drying. Domfeh	Is using the bare floor? is it ideal? Mensah	That is why we have cleared all those spaces. We make sure that there is not anything that will contaminate the ginger. We lay the necessary things on the ground before we dry on it. Domfeh	Can we get to the stand there to see basically what they are doing there? Mensah	Yes of course we can. SFX	Walking. Domfeh	Good afternoon. Is it difficult to do? Worker	But it is ok! Domfeh	So what are they all doing here? Mensah	As you can see this is where we dry. They have gathered the ginger, they are collecting the ginger, they have to transfer after one day to the ground so that we have enough space to slice more for drying. We are using the solar as you can see we are using the sun energy to dry that is why purposely this Harmattan season getting to the rainy season we would not be able to process ginger. But for now and what we are doing, the technology we are using with these little machines we are able to process the quantity of ginger we need per day. SFX	(Washing the ginger) Domfeh	So I can see the lady over there washing the ginger. Is it the ideal process? Mensah	Yes, that is the ideal process. After washing with a washing machine we have to wash it for three times after which we dip it into hot water to kill the microbial all these things before we slice the ginger. So that is the ideal. Domfeh	So that is why you have the fire over there burning? Mensah	That is why we have the fire over there. We have boiling water. Domfeh	So after washing she puts them inside this particular machine, what is this called? Mensah	This is the washing concrete mixing machine as you can see but with our technology we have been able to use this thing to wash our ginger. So this is where we wash it first, it gets rid of all the sands and all the other particles before we transfer into the other bowls for them to wash with their hands. Because if they are supposed to wash with their hands alone it becomes very difficult to get rid of the sand particles and other things. Domfeh	So from the machine it goes to? Mensah	Yes, from the machine and washing here we go to the slicing. This ginger is completely washed and ready for slicing here. So this is our slicing machine and this slicing machine can slice over a hundred bags weighing 80 kilogrammes to 100 kilogrammes a day. Domfeh	So from here it goes to the drying stand? Afterwards, what next? Mensah	We package it, we put it in a nice package and then we put it at the warehouse until we get the total quantity that we need before we export it outside. Domfeh	Does packaging mean a lot in this business? Mensah	In our area I would say packaging it does not mean a lot but we need to be very strict because it is organic project. We need to make sure that what we are using to package does not have any contaminations and then we have our labels on it. Tera	My name is Kojo Tera. Domfeh	And what do you do here? Tera	Actually, I am the administrative and finance officer for the company. Domfeh	What sort of investment do you need to go into this business of drying produce? Tera	Concerning investment, we need maybe all the necessary things for the processing of the ginger. Maybe we need slicing machine, we need the washing machine and also we need stages for drying and other materials for the drying. And also some equipment for our workers and other important things needed for the processing of the ginger. Domfeh	For people who want to go into this sector of drying produce for exports what advice can you give to them? Tera	My little advice for them you know if only it is for export because it is going outside we need to work very hard to meet the international standard because if it does not happen you have your product there but then it is going to be cancelled, nobody is going to buy it and it will be a waste and a whole lot of you know debt will come. So we have to be very careful, if anybody wants to enter into this the only thing we need to do is to try as much as possible to meet the international standard.

30|$|We {{also showed}} that daily {{production}} did not increase linearly with increases in hours worked; marginal productivity for shift lengths greater than 9 hours was lower than average productivity for 9 -hour shifts. Doubling {{the number of hours}} worked resulted in average drops in marginal productivity of 61 % and 42 % for processors and harvesters, respectively. These drops in marginal productivity are higher than those reported by Nichols et al. (2004) where doubling the hours worked for mechanised harvesting operations in Australia resulted in a 22 % drop in marginal productivity. They are similar to those reported by Mitchell (2008) where almost doubling the hours worked for harvesting operations in the south-eastern USA resulted in a drop in marginal productivity of about 40 %. However, our findings run counter to those of Rose (2007) who essentially found no drop in marginal productivity for the second shift of a large centralised <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> in New Zealand, and those of H. Marshall (Interpine Forestry, Rotorua, New Zealand. personal communication, October 20, 2011) who found a 21 % increase in marginal productivity for the second shift of a mill yard mechanised log processing operation in New Zealand. Since their findings do run counter to ours possible reasons for the difference are necessary. Both these New Zealand studies were of long duration (over 6 months in length) so the “observer” effect is not expected to have greatly influenced their findings. However, very good lighting outside of normal daylight hours was a feature of the operations they studied; this was considerably better than the illumination from the halogen or xenon lighting packages attached to the in-forest log processing and harvesting operations in this study. Additionally, the processing equipment in the operations they studied was in fixed locations and did not have to navigate amongst trees or across difficult terrain, unlike the harvesters in this study.|$|E
