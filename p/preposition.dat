5|$|Possession can be {{expressed}} either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the <b>preposition</b> of. Historically the -s possessive {{has been used for}} animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the <b>preposition</b> to, is used for verbal clauses that are {{syntactically}} subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prepositions</b> tell {{us where}} an object is or what {{direction}} it is going. Some cases of nouns, such as the genitive, accusative and instrumental, take <b>prepositions.</b> Some cases never take <b>prepositions</b> (such as locative and nominative). Certain <b>prepositions</b> are used with certain cases. Below {{is a list of}} some common <b>prepositions</b> used in Lithuanian.|$|R

A total of 53 Jordanian English Majors {{participated in the study}} from the department of English language at Princess Alia University College. In collecting the needed data for the purpose of the study, the researchers employed fifteen items of a multiple choice test. The results of the study showed that Jordanian learners of English encountered moderate difficulty in learning the three aforesaid usages of <b>prepositions.</b> This difficulty is ascribed mainly to first language interference more than intralingual interference. It was also found that <b>prepositions</b> of standard are the most difficult to learn by the participants, followed by <b>prepositions</b> of accompaniment and <b>prepositions</b> of possession respectively.        Keywords: First language Interference, Intralingual Interference, <b>Prepositions</b> of Standard, <b>Prepositions</b> of Accompaniment, <b>Prepositions</b> of Possessio...|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the <b>preposition</b> ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally a new <b>preposition</b> is coined. Because a {{bare root}} may {{indicate}} a <b>preposition</b> or interjection, removing the grammatical suffix from {{another part of}} speech {{can be used to}} derive a <b>preposition</b> or interjection. For example, from fari (to do, to make) we get the <b>preposition</b> far (done by).|$|E
25|$|Each <b>preposition</b> is {{associated}} {{with one or more}} grammatical cases. The noun governed by a <b>preposition</b> must appear in the case required by the <b>preposition</b> in the given context (e.g. from friends = od priateľov). Priateľov is the genitive case of priatelia. It must appear in this case because the <b>preposition</b> od (= from) always calls for its objects to be in the genitive.|$|E
50|$|In Quenya {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between <b>prepositions</b> and adverbs. Many Quenya <b>prepositions</b> have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these <b>prepositions</b> were postpositions instead, and later became inflectional endings. Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas <b>prepositions</b> can combine with phrases of many different categories. This is why most <b>prepositions</b> in Quenya are used with a noun in the nominative case.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} on the spatial span of Persian <b>prepositions</b> in colloquial speech, {{focusing on the}} locative use of <b>prepositions.</b> The results are compared with English <b>prepositions</b> as well. In order to show the functional span of various <b>prepositions,</b> the Typological Relations Picture Series known as TRPS or BowPed is used. This study demonstrates that the spatial span of Persian locative <b>prepositions</b> consists of twenty-eight <b>prepositions,</b> including three primary, seven compound and sixteen secondary <b>prepositions.</b> In some unusual relations in the BLCs (basic locative construction), the Persian <b>prepositions</b> reflect the opposite relation between the figure and ground. In addition, this study shows that there is greater variety of locative <b>prepositions</b> in Persian than English. Finally, the study concludes that like English, Persian allows the use of BLC over {{the entire range of}} the (eight) scenes; however, there is an overlap with the scope of BLC construction, which allows the use of resultative construction in Persian as well...|$|R

25|$|There {{are cases}} where pied-piping can be optional. In English, this occurs most notably with prepositional phrases (PPs).

25|$|The c-examples {{are cases}} of <b>preposition</b> stranding, which is {{possible}} in English, but not allowed in many languages {{that are related to}} English. For instance, <b>preposition</b> stranding is largely absent from many of the other Germanic languages and it may be completely absent from the Romance languages. Prescriptive grammars often claim that <b>preposition</b> stranding should be avoided in English as well; however, in certain contexts pied-piping of prepositions in English may make a sentence feel artificial or stilted.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{spells out}} the syntax, semantics, and morphology of spatial <b>prepositions</b> in German. I {{do this by}} using a parsimonious model of grammar with only one combinatorial engine that generates both phrases and words: syntax (Marantz 1997, Bruening 2016). I follow the tenets of the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995) with Bare Phrase Structure as its phrase structural module. I show that using Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993, Embick 2015) to model Phonological Form and Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle 1993, Kamp et al. 2011) to model Logical Form {{makes it possible to}} gain deeper and new insights into the system of German spatial <b>prepositions.</b> Spatial <b>prepositions</b> are classified along a widely accepted typology (Jackendoff 1983, Piñón 1993, Zwarts 2005, a. o.) : (i) place <b>prepositions</b> denote static locations and (ii) path <b>prepositions</b> denote dynamic locations that can be directed, {{as in the case of}} goal and source <b>prepositions,</b> or undirected, as in the case of route <b>prepositions.</b> In addition, I propose a classification of spatial <b>prepositions</b> that is orthogonal to the above typology: (i) geometric <b>prepositions</b> express geometric locative relations, which I spell out in a parsimonious, perception-driven model of space (Kamp and Roßdeutscher 2005); (ii) pseudo-geometric <b>prepositions</b> look like geometric <b>prepositions</b> but express functional locative relations instead of geometric ones; and (iii) non-geometric <b>prepositions</b> express a special type of functional locative relations. The fine-grained syntacticosemantic analysis presented in this thesis not only makes it possible to spell out Phonological Form and Logical Form for spatial <b>prepositions,</b> but it also serves as input to a morphological case approach (Marantz 1991, McFadden 2004) that accounts for the case assignment of spatial <b>prepositions...</b>|$|R

5|$|In Quenya, {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between <b>prepositions</b> and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines the relation of verb and object. Many Quenya <b>prepositions</b> have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these <b>prepositions</b> were postpositions instead, and later became inflectional endings. Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas <b>prepositions</b> can combine with phrases of many different categories.

If it is the direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to leave it in. (If it is suppressed, then the special <b>preposition</b> et, used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) If it is the object of a <b>preposition,</b> it must be left in, because in Hebrew—unlike in English—a <b>preposition</b> cannot appear without its object. When the pronoun is left in, she- might more properly be called a relativizer than a relative pronoun.|$|E

40|$|This essay investigates native Swedish speakers’ {{problems}} {{in the area of}} <b>prepositions.</b> A total of 19 compositions, including 678 <b>prepositions,</b> written by native Swedish senior high school students were analysed. All the <b>prepositions</b> in the material were judged as either basic, systematic or idiomatic. Then all the errors of substitution, addition and omission were counted and corrected. As hypothesised, least errors were found in the category of basic <b>prepositions</b> and most errors were found in the category of idiomatic <b>prepositions.</b> However, the small difference between the two categories of systematic and idiomatic <b>prepositions</b> suggests that the learners have greater problems with systematic <b>prepositions</b> than what was first thought to be the case. Basic <b>prepositions</b> cause little or no problems. Systematic <b>prepositions,</b> i. e. those that are rule governed or whose usage is somehow generalisable, seem to be quite problematic to native Swedish speakers. Idiomatic <b>prepositions</b> seem to be learnt as ‘chunks’, and the learners are either aware of the whole constructions or do not use them at all. They also cause some problems for Swedish speakers. Since <b>prepositions</b> are often perceived as rather arbitrary without rules to sufficiently describe them, these conclusions might not be surprising to teachers, students and language learners. The greatest error cause was found to be interference from Swedish, and a few errors could be explained as intralingual errors. It seems as if the learners’ knowledge of their mother tongue strongly influences the acquisition of English <b>prepositions...</b>|$|R
