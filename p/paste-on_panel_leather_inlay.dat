5000|$|<b>Leather</b> <b>inlays,</b> {{which are}} similar in form to [...] inlays in woodworking, are shaped pieces of leather the same {{thickness}} as the covering leather on a book. A piece of leather the same shape, size, and thickness as the inlay {{is removed from the}} covering <b>leather,</b> and the <b>inlay</b> is placed into the resulting space. The edge of the inlay can be tooled, in which case the edge of the inlay is beveled, with the skin side of the leather slightly larger than the flesh side. This gives a smooth, well-supported surface for the impressions of the finishing tools.|$|R

5000|$|In 1899 Thomas Sturge Moore was {{introduced}} to her family and she developed a close life-long friendship. After Moore introduced her to Charles Ricketts, the artist and book designer, she grew an interest in bookbinding. [...] She taught herself, learning from Douglas Cockerell's classic, Bookbinding and the Care of Books, but also used Moore and Ricketts as advisors and critics throughout her career. By 1906 she had produced her first binding after establishing a workshop in her father's house at Priest Hill in Limpsfield, Surrey. Early bindings were in white or natural pigskin but she increasingly used colored goatskin <b>leather</b> <b>inlays</b> and by 1934 bound a book with 6 different colored inlays.|$|R

5000|$|After jewelled {{bookbinding}} enjoyed its renaissance, {{the practice}} waned until it experienced a revival near {{the turn of}} the twentieth century in England. Highly influential in the revival of this style were Francis Sangorski and George Sutcliffe of the Sangorski & Sutcliffe bindery. Their bindings were not large uncut gems as in Mediaeval times, but semi-precious stones en cabochon set into beautifully designed bindings with multi-coloured <b>leather</b> <b>inlays</b> and elaborate gilt tooling. The craftsmanship of these bindings was unsurpassable; only their competitors Riviere produced work of similar quality. The most famous of these bindings is [...] "The Great Omar" [...] (1909) on a large copy of FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, which included good tooling, <b>inlays</b> of coloured <b>leather,</b> and 1050 jewels in a peacock design scheme. It went down with the Titanic in 1912. Today, a third reproduction of this binding is the only one to survive, after the second one, reproduced to Sutcliffe’s design by his nephew Stanley Bray, was damaged in the Blitz during World War II. Bray’s second attempt at recreating the design, the third version that survives, was placed in the British Library in 1989.|$|R

5000|$|Monjett Graham created {{portraits of}} historical, {{military}} leaders {{from around the}} world, using pencil and conte as a medium. These drawings were then applied to T-shirts and sportswear via silk screen. This fashioned a marketable commodity, which involved a mail order business, complete with a color catalogue, that supplied retail buyers and sports shops across America. The business,incorporated in 1981, known as the [...] "California Corporation" [...] advertised in major nationwide magazines such as Soldier of Fortune, American Handgunner and Guns and Ammo. Eventually, it also included illustrations of warplanes and military vehicles. The business due to increased competition, ended in the late 1980s. During this time Monjett also expanded his artwork to a mixed media collage technique, which he used paper, thin bits of fabric on canvas. He would then experiment with larger objects, such as wood <b>panel,</b> <b>leather,</b> metal and plastic parts, as well as boots, and entire pieces of clothing. Starting out as abstract imagery, Monjett's mixed media collage technique evolved into illustrating animals {{and a variety of}} scenarios involving the human form.|$|R
