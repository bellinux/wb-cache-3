40|$|This study {{dealt with}} the problem of {{estimating}} constant time delay embedded into a received signal that was noisy, delayed and damped image of a known reference signal. The received signal was filtered, normalized with respect to the peak value it achieved and then transformed by the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) into DCT coefficients. Those DCT coefficients that were most sensitive to time delay variations were selected and grouped to form the Reduced Discrete Cosine Transform Coefficients set (RDCTC). The time delays embedded in the filtered signals were efficiently encoded into those RDCTC sets. The RDCTC sets were applied to a <b>pre</b> <b>trained</b> multi layer feedforward Neural Network (NN), which computed the time-delay estimates. The network was initially trained with large sets of RDCTC vectors, in which each RDCTC vector corresponded to a signal delayed by a randomly selected constant time-delay. Using the RDCTC as input to the NN instead of the full length incoming signal itself resulted in a major reduction in the NN size. Accurate time delay estimates were obtained through simulation and compared against estimates obtained through classical cross-correlation technique...|$|E
40|$|Ethnicity {{is a key}} {{demographic}} {{attribute of}} human beings and it plays {{a vital role in}} automatic facial recognition and have extensive real world applications such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI); demographic based classification; biometric based recognition; security and defense to name a few. In this paper we present a novel approach for extracting ethnicity from the facial images. The proposed method makes use of a <b>pre</b> <b>trained</b> Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the features and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel is used as a classifier. This technique uses translational invariant hierarchical features learned by the network, in contrast to previous works, which use hand crafted features such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP); Gabor etc. Thorough experiments are presented on ten different facial databases which strongly suggest that our approach is robust to different expressions and illuminations conditions. Here we consider ethnicity classification as a three class problem including Asian, African-American and Caucasian. Average classification accuracy over all databases is 98. 28 %, 99. 66 % and 99. 05 % for Asian, African-American and Caucasian respectively.

Methods: After Ethical approval for the study a two-day workshop on teaching effective communication skills and principles of medical ethics was planned and conducted by the department of Medical Education through multidisciplinary faculty of Foundation University Medical College, Pakistan. A total of 102 last year medical students participated in this workshop. The students were divided into 8 groups each containing 12 students. A team of <b>pre</b> <b>trained</b> facilitators for each group conducted the group activities. Teaching strategies including interactive discussions on basic principles of doctor-patient relationship, power point presentations, day to day case scenarios, video clips and presentations involving students in role plays were used. Pre and post workshop self evaluation proformas about knowledge and skills of communication and medical ethics were rated (0 =none, 1 =below average, 2 =average, 3 =above average, 4 =very good, 5 =excellent) by the students.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of dreaming in {{childhood}} and in adulthood are still equally enigmatic fields {{yet to be}} explored. However {{while there is a}} consensus at least about the typical content and formal characteristics of adult dream reports, these features are still a matter of debate in case of young children. Longitudinal developmental laboratory studies concluded that preschoolers’ dreams usually depict static images about mostly animals and body states of the dreamer but they basically lack the active representation of the self, human characters, social interactions, dream emotions and motion imagery. Due to methodological arguments these results became the reference points in the literature of developmental dream research, in spite of the significantly different results of some more recent studies using extra-laboratory settings. This study aims to establish a methodologically well-controlled and valid way to collect children’s dreams for a representative period of time in a familiar home setting to serve as a comparison to the laboratory method. <b>Pre</b> <b>trained</b> parents acted as interviewers {{in the course of a}} 6 week-period of dream collection upon morning awakenings. Our results suggest that even preschoolers are likely to represent their own self in an active role (70 %) in their mostly kinematic (82 %) dream narratives. Their dream reports contain more human, than animal characters (70 % and 7 % of all dream characters respectively), and that social interactions, self-initiated actions and emotions are usual part of these dreams. These results are rather similar to those of recent extra-laboratory studies, suggesting that methodological issues may strongly interfere with research outcomes especially in the case of preschoolers’ dream narratives. We suggest that nighttime awakenings in the laboratory setting could be crucial in understanding the contradictory results of dream studies in case of young children...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{developing}} countries, mothers usually manage diarrhea at {{home with}} the pattern of management depending on perceived disease severity and beliefs. The study was carried out with the objective of determining mothers’ beliefs and barriers about diarrhea and its management. Methods Qualitative methods involving two focus group discussions and eight in-depth interviews were used to collect the data. The study was conducted at the following places: Tankisinuwari, Kanchanbari and Pokhariya of Morang district, Nepal during the months of February and March 2010. Purposive sampling method was adopted to recruit twenty mothers based on the inclusion criteria. A semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct the interviews. Written informed consent was obtained from all of the participants before conducting the interviews. The interviews were moderated by the main researcher with the support of an expert observer from Nobel Medical College. The interviews were recorded with the permission of the participants and notes were written by a <b>pre</b> <b>trained</b> note-taker. The recordings were transcribed verbatim. All the transcribed data was categorized and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results Twenty mothers participated in the interviews and most (80 %) of them were not educated. About 75 % of the mothers had a monthly income of up to 5000 Nepalese rupees (US$ 60. 92). Although a majority of mothers believed diarrhea to be due to natural causes, there were also beliefs about supernatural origin of diarrhea. Thin watery diarrhea was considered as the most serious. There was diversity in mothers’ beliefs about foods/fluids and diarrhea management approaches. Similarly, several barriers were noted regarding diarrhea prevention and/or management such as financial weakness, lack of awareness, absence of education, distance from healthcare facilities and senior family members at home. The elderly compelled the mothers to visit traditional healers. Conclusions There were varied beliefs among the mothers about the types, causes and severity of diarrhea, classification of foods/fluids and beliefs and barriers about preventing or treating diarrhea. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: The study {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of progressive resistance exercise (PRE) {{in the treatment of}} low back pain conditions among miners in Obuasi municipality of Ghana. Methods: Low back pain miners (n= 22) between 20 - 59 years participated in the eight weeks <b>PRE</b> <b>training</b> after signing informed consent. Pretest-posttest low back pain conditions data were collected via seven components (pain intensity, pain scale, physical activity rating, pain frequency, lifting, personal care and sex life) of Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire. Analysis of data was done using frequency count, percentage, factor loading and paired t-test of SPSS package of 2010 version. Results: Results showed that most (40. 9 %) of the participants were 40 - 49 years, 90. 1 % were male, 86. 4 % were married, and 59. 1 % weighed between 70 – 89 kg. Factor loading analysis revealed PRE effects order as pain intensity (2. 49 ± 0. 66), pain scale (2. 18 ± 0. 71), pain frequency (2. 17 ± 0. 71), physical activity rating (2. 16 ± 0. 86), lifting (2. 16 ± 0. 94), personal care (1. 40 ± 0. 49) and sex life (1. 33 ± 0. 47). There were significant differences in the effects of <b>PRE</b> <b>training</b> on pain intensity (t= 8. 386, p < 0. 05), pain scale (t= 12. 990, p < 0. 05), pain frequency (t= 18. 177, p < 0. 05), lifting (t=- 2. 806, p < 0. 05) and personal care (t= 2. 738, p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The low back pain conditions of miners were significantly improved using PRE, especially pain intensity, pain scale and pain frequency. Hence, exercise and physical activity that followed <b>PRE</b> <b>training</b> patterns should be majorly incorporated into the lifestyles of the miners...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several {{studies have}} shown that patients' active {{participation}} to their medical interaction is beneficial for their information processing and their quality of life. Unfortunately, cancer patients often act rather passively in contact with their oncologists. We investigated whether cancer patients' participation in radiation therapy consultations could be enhanced by specific communicative behaviours of the radiation oncologists (ROs). METHODS: Eight ROs and 160 patients participated; 80 patients in the <b>pre</b> <b>training</b> group and 80 patients in the post training group. The ROs were trained to use specific communicative behaviours that are supposed to encourage patient participation. In the training special attention was paid to communicative requirements in the first minutes of the consultation. The communicative behaviours of the ROs and the cancer patients were measured by the Roter Interaction Analysis System, and compared before and after the RO training. RESULTS: From the start throughout the entire consultation, patients in the post training group participated more in interactions than patients in the <b>pre</b> <b>training</b> group: they discussed more psychosocial issues, expressed more concerns and contributed more to decision-making. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients' participation in the initial radiation oncology consultations can be increased by training of ROs.

40|$|Background. In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} {{the effect of a}} 6 -month aerobic exercise programme on the morphology of the gastrocnemius muscle of endstage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Methods. Twenty-four ESRD patients volunteered to participate in the training programme and underwent muscle biopsy before training. Eighteen patients completed the training programme of whom nine agreed to a post-training biopsy (one woman and eight men, mean age 56 ± 15 years). Data are presented for the nine subjects who were biopsied before (<b>PRE)</b> and after <b>training</b> (POST) and separately for the 15 subjects for whom we only have a biopsy before training (cross-sectional group). Results. There were no significant differences (P > 0. 05) in fibre type distribution or myosin heavy chain (MyHC) expression between the cross-sectional and PRE/POST groups. The mean cross-section fibre area after training (POST) increased by 46 % compared with the <b>PRE</b> <b>training</b> status (P < 0. 01). The proportion of atrophic fibres decreased significantly after training in type I, IIa and IIx fibre populations (from 51 to 15 %, 58 to 21 % and 62 to 32 %, respectively). Significant differences were also found in capillary contact per fibre (CC/F), with the muscle having 24 % (P < 0. 05) more CC/F compared with the <b>PRE</b> <b>training</b> status. No significant differences in cytochrome c oxidase concentration were found between the groups. Conclusions. In conclusion, exercise appeared to be beneficial in renal rehabilitation by correcting the fibre atrophy, increasing the cross-section fibre area and improving the capillarization in the skeletal muscle of renal failure patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of functional progressive resistance exercise (<b>PRE)</b> <b>training</b> on walking ability in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Fifty-one ambulant children with spastic CP (mean age 10 years 5 months, 29 boys) were randomized to an intervention (n= 26) or control group (n= 25, receiving usual care). The intervention consisted of 12 weeks functional <b>PRE</b> circuit <b>training,</b> for 3 times a week. Main outcome measures were walking ability and participation. Secondary outcomes were muscle strength and anaerobic muscle power. Possible adverse outcomes were spasticity and passive range of motion (ROM). Muscle strength increased significantly in the training group compared to the control group, but walking ability, participation and anaerobic muscle power did not change. Spasticity and ROM remained unchanged, except for a significant decrease in rectus femoris length in the intervention group. It is concluded that twelve weeks of functional PRE-training does not improve walking ability, despite improved muscle strength. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
