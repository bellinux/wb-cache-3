40|$|The {{results of}} the study on {{production}} of the <b>protein</b> <b>spectrum</b> by the dermal fibroblasts in relatively healthy children and children with Crohn’s disease during consecutive passages are shown in this article. Aim : to establish characteristics of <b>protein</b> <b>spectrum</b> of supernatants derived from the repeated cultivation of fibroblasts under normal and pathological conditions. Patients and methods : supernatants of 4 fibroblast cultures obtained from cutaneous tissue samples of 2 relatively healthy and 2 children with Crohn’s diseases aged from 14 to 17 years old were examined. The assessment of <b>protein</b> <b>spectrum</b> was performed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF (Bruker Autoflex, USA); phenotyping was performed by flaw cytometry assay (FACS Cantu II, USA). Results : 5 clusters of protein distribution according to the molecular weight were distinguished by the methods of statistical analysis:  from 0, 8 to 3, 3 kDa, from 3, 3 to 6, 0 kDa, from 6, 0 to 11, 0 kDa, from 11, 0 to 16, 6 kDa and > 16, 6 kDa. Proteinograms of patients with Crohn’s disease and relatively healthy children differ from each other. Conclusions: certain special features of proteomic profile, characterizing supernatants of fibroblastic cultures of children with Crohn’s disease were found. The established characteristics of proteomic spectrum of fibroblast secretory components can be used as marker of their activity at different stages of cultivation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Here we {{investigate}} {{an extension of}} a previously suggested &quot;automatic amide I frequency selection procedure &quot; where we introduce an additional criterion utilizing empirical knowledge on regions within the amide I band (1600 - 1700 cm- 1) found to be particularly sensitive to protein secondary structure. We show that the genetic algorithm provides a solution with good protein secondary structure prediction accuracy. Based on an evaluation set of 13 <b>protein</b> infrared <b>spectra</b> from <b>proteins</b> not contained in the reference set, it is demonstrated that our method is capable of making good predictions for proteins it has never seen before during training. In the present study, where the genetic algorithm is guided towards a solution with a higher number of empirically determined, structure sensitive amide I frequencies selected, minor improvement in prediction accuracy for α-helix and β-sheet structure could be achieved compared to our previous study, where no such knowledge has been provided. Despite the very limited number of <b>protein</b> <b>spectra</b> in the reference set (18), the neural networks were able to generalize with an overall average of standard errors of prediction of 4. 36 % based on the evaluation set of <b>protein</b> <b>spectra,</b> which is even better than that achieved during the analysis based on the reference set of <b>protein</b> <b>spectra</b> (4. 8 %).

40|$|Abstract. Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) {{as well as}} blind source separation (BSS) often faces the problem of assigning the indepen-dent or uncorrelated components estimated with ICA or BSS techniques to underlying source signals, artifacts or noise contributions. In this work an automatic assignment tool is presented which uses a priori knowledge about the form {{of some of the}} signals to be extracted. The algorithm is applied to the problem of removing water artifacts from 2 D NOESY NMR spectra. The algorithm uses local PCA to approximate the water artifact and defines a suitable cost function which is optimized using simulated annealing. The blind source separation of the water artifact from the remaining <b>protein</b> <b>spectrum</b> is done with the recently developed algorithm dAMUSE. ...|$|E

Addition of ligands to the 12 kDaN-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of sialoadhesin result in resonance shifts in the <b>protein</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{that have been used}} to determine the affinities of sialoadhesin for several sialosides.

The resonances corresponding to the methyl protons within the N-acetyl moiety of sialic acid undergo upfield shifting and broadening during titrations, reflecting an interaction of this group with Trp # in sialoadhesin as observed in co-crystals of the terminal domain with bound ligand.

40|$|Summary. In {{an earlier}} paper {{we showed that}} {{depending}} on seed yield, the variants of mineral deficiency studied could be set in order as follows: control (100 %), Fe-deficiency (100 %), deficiency of N, S and K (30 – 40 %), B and complete mineral deficiency (0 – 1 %). This study demonstrates that N, K, B and S deprivation causes alterations in all cases of mineral deficiencies where the yield is reduced – the quantitative changes in <b>protein</b> and polypeptide <b>spectra</b> are established. The degree of these changes does not correlate with the degree of yield reduction. The most drastic are the changes in electrophoretic spectra of S-deficient seeds. On the other hand, both N and K deficiencies provoke similar yield reduction whereas {{the changes in the}} <b>protein</b> <b>spectra</b> are not so significant. On the contrary, no differences between the <b>protein</b> <b>spectra</b> of the B-deficient and the control seeds are observed. Electrophoretic patterns of complete mineral deficiency seeds {{are similar to those of}} S-deficient seeds. Based on these data the following conclusions are made: 1) the production of small number of seeds not in all cases overcomes the adverse effect of mineral deficiency on seed quality, 2) the degree of changes in <b>protein</b> <b>spectra</b> of seeds depends mainly on the type of mineral element under deficiency, 3) in sulfur-deficient seeds the effect of natural aging on polypeptide spectrum is additive to the effect of S-deficiency itself.

Here we report the identification and characterization of pCKII from the monocotyledonous species Oryza sativa. OspCKII activity was enriched from isolated rice chloroplasts using heparin-Sepharose chromatography, in which it co-elutes with the transcriptionally active chromosome (TAC) and several ribosomal proteins. Inclusion mass scanning of the kinase-active fraction identified the gene model for OspCKII. Transient expression of GFP fused to the 184 N-terminal amino acids of the OspCKII sequence in rice confirmed the chloroplastic localization of the kinase. OspCKII activity shows the characteristic features of casein kinase II, such as the utilization of GTP as phosphate donor, inhibition by low concentrations of heparin and poly-lysine, and utilization of the canonical pCKII motif E-S-E-G-E in the model substrate RNP 29. Phosphoproteome analysis of a protein extract from rice leaves combined with a meta-analysis with published phosphoproteomics data revealed differences in the target <b>protein</b> <b>spectrum</b> between rice and Arabidopsis.
