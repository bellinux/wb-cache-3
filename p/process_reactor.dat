50|$|On {{the day of}} the explosion, {{operations}} appeared normal {{until after}} the steam was turned off and the polymer initiating solution was pumped into the reactor. The operator in charge noted that initially the reaction did not proceed as vigorously as expected, but later the solvent evaporated and the condensed solvent flow returning to the reactor appeared within normal range. A few minutes later, the operator heard a loud hissing and saw vapor venting from the reactor manway. The irritating vapor forced him out of the building. Three other employees also left the building because of the vapors. The operator reentered the building wearing a respirator and started emergency cooling water flow to the reactor. The building exploded less than 30 seconds after he exited the second time. The US Chemical Safety Board (CSB) stated that the solvent vapor leaked from the overheated and over-pressurised <b>process</b> <b>reactor,</b> forming a flammable vapour cloud inside the building that ignited.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of high brightness LEDs is being studied worldwide {{due to the}} expectation to replace present light sources because of the higher efficiency and estimated lifetime. The deposition of the epitaxial layers is the most critical step of the LED manufacturing process {{and has to be}} carried-out in well controlled conditions to get the necessary uniformity of the epitaxial layers and the proper cleanliness. The most common technology to grow the epitaxial layers is MOVPE, a technology that requires a large quantity of gas to transport the precursors into the <b>process</b> <b>reactor.</b> Control of the cleanliness of the gases used during the process (hydrogen, ammonia, arsine, etc) is necessary to obtain highly efficient and reproducible devices. However, even the use of the cleanest gas source cannot avoid the introduction of impurities when the gas is used in the <b>process</b> <b>reactor.</b> In fact there are several causes that can degrade the actual purity level: the degree of emptiness of the source cylinder, improper procedures during the change out of the cylinder or outgassing from the components in the gas distribution system.

Simulations presented allow direct comparison between different flowsheets and refolding schemes using a dimensionless economic objective.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{adaptation}} of network weights using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was proposed as a mechanism to improve the performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in modeling a chemical process. This is particularly useful for cases involving changing operating conditions as well as highly nonlinear processes. As a case study, a Tennessee Eastman (TE) chemical <b>process</b> <b>reactor</b> was considered. Four subsystems of the reactor were considered. They are the reactor level, the reactor pressure, the reactor cooling water temperature, and the reactor temperature. PSO is proposed to allow automatic update of network weights to increase the adaptability to dynamic environment. Comparisons were also made to training the ANN using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The results obtained in this paper confirmed the potential of PSO-based ANN model to successfully model the TE process. The results are explored with a discussion using the Mean Square Error (MSE) and Variance-Account-For (VAF) to illustrate the usability of the proposed approach. Finally, conclusions and future works are derived. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a procedure for locating profit maximizing operating conditions when the input variables {{are subject to}} control by the experimenter and observations on physical output may be taken subject to experimental error at any combination of these inputs. This procedure uses the Box-Wilson technique, a well-known statistical search procedure, together with the pria of the output {{and the cost of}} the inputs so as to search for maximum profit points rather than maximum output points. The result is an experimental search method which maximizes profit when the functional form of the physical response surface (production function) is unknown. In this case, of course, standard mathematical programming models are of no use {{in the absence of the}} required functional forms. This functional form, though unknown, is determined by the existing investment in capital equipment. These procedures, like the Box-Wilson technique, are more likely to be applicable to flow <b>process</b> <b>reactor</b> systems in the chemical and oil industries, but are certainly not limited to such applications...|$|E
