40|$|Background. Before the {{introduction}} of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) rarely died of liver disease. In resource-rich countries, cART dramatically increased longevity. As patients survived longer, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection became {{a leading cause of}} death; however, because patients with AIDS continue to have 5 -fold greater mortality than non-AIDS patients, it is unclear whether HCV infection increases mortality in them. Methods. In this investigation, {{which is part of the}} Longitudinal Studies of the Ocular Complications of AIDS, <b>plasma</b> <b>banked</b> at enrollment from 2025 patients with AIDS as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were tested for HCV RNA and antibodies. Results. Three hundred thirty-seven patients had HCV RNA (chronic infection), 91 had HCV antibodies and no HCV RNA (cleared infection), and 1597 had no HCV markers. Median CD 4 + T-cell counts/µL were 200 (chronic), 193 (cleared), and 175 (no markers). There were 558 deaths. At a median follow-up of 6. 1 years, patients with chronic HCV had a 50 % increased risk of mortality compared with patients with no HCV markers (relative risk [RR], 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 2 – 1. 9; P =. 001) in an adjusted model that included known risk factors. Mortality was not increased in patients with cleared infection (RR, 0. 9; 95 % CI,. 6 – 1. 5; P =. 82). In patients with chronic HCV, 20. 4 % of deaths were liver related compared with 3. 8 % in patients without HCV...|$|R

METHODS: Plasma samples from 1 101 consecutive blood donations made in November 2000 at HEMORIO, the largest blood bank in the state of Rio de Janeiro, were tested for measles immunoglobulin G, using a commercial enzyme immunoassay and a plaque reduction neutralization test. We calculated the proportion (and 95 % confidence interval (CI)) of samples seronegative for measles antibody for the total sample of blood donors and also for subgroups categorized by age, sex, neighborhood of residence, education, and occupation. We used the chi-square test to assess the statistical significance of differences in proportions and linear trends in proportions. RESULTS: Of the total group of blood donors, 6. 9 % of them (95 % CI: 5. 4 %­ 8. 4 %) were seronegative for measles. Women had a higher proportion (10. 1 %; 95 % CI: 6. 8 %­ 13. 4 %) of seronegative results than did men (5. 6 %; 95 % CI: 4. 0 %­ 7. 2 %). In terms of age, 86. 8 % of seronegative individuals were born between 1971 and 1982. Seronegativity was inversely proportional to age (chi-square = 58. 0; P < 0. 0001). With regard to occupation, students had the highest proportion of seronegative individuals (17. 8 %). In terms of education, most of the susceptible persons were in the categories of "incomplete university degree" or "incomplete high school.

40|$|Being {{the fourth}} most widely grown food {{plant in the}} world, the potato has become a {{tropical}} research target and numerous attempts are being made to produce a variety suited to developing countries to help solve their food problems. Much effort has therefore gone into developing an improved variety, adapted to tropical climates and resistant to both disease and parasites. However, until now genetic improvement of the potato has been difficult because of the incompatibility problems when crossing commercial high-yield varieties with wild disease-resistant ones. One of the factors of incompatibility {{has to do with}} the difference in the number of chromosomes in the variety involved the wild species having generally 24 chromosomes as against 48 for the cultivated species. An American researcher, Mr. John Helgeson, of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, has just made an important breakthrough in this field, having successfully carried out 5 fusions between cells from cultivated potatoes and those from the wild species. He was assisted in his work by staff of the Department of Agriculture's Germinating <b>Plasma</b> <b>Bank,</b> which has 3, 500 accessions of which 110 are wild species.

40|$|In {{the spring}} and fall of 1978 we made an {{extensive}} series of plasma line and correlative observations with the Chatanika incoherent scatter radar. To make these measurements, we greatly modified the radar receiving system. In addition to enlarging the <b>plasma</b> line filter <b>bank</b> the most significant change was the incorporation of a high-speed correlator provided by the French. This was the first use of a correlator in a monostatic radar to obtain the intensity spectra of naturally occurring plasma lines. In this paper we develop the signal-processing theory that we use to obtain the plasma line intensities from these measurements; we also show that these intensities compare well with those obtained from the filter bank. To show the richness of the phenomena and to explore the capabilities of the correlator, we examine a wide variety of spectra that have been enhanced by secondary electrons in the auroral E layer. From the other simultaneous measurements we are able to relate these spectra and their variations to the auroral situation. We also obtained the first measurements in the auroral region of photoelectron-excited plasma lines in the E and F layers. Perhaps most significant, in the plasma line spectra we detected a Doppler shift that we then used to determine the Birkeland current carried by ambient electrons. Although there is a large estimated uncertainty for this first determination, we obtained a downward Birkeland current of 10 μA/m² in the diffuse aurora in what is, most likely, the equatorward portion of the evening sector auroral oval...|$|R

We sought to define baseline immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration in neonates and infants with congenital heart disease, determine their course after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and determine if post-CPB hypogammaglobulinemia was associated with increased morbidity. MethodsThis was a single-center, retrospective analysis of infants who underwent cardiac surgery with CPB between June 2010 and December 2011. The Ig concentration was obtained from <b>banked</b> <b>plasma</b> of 47 patients from a prior study (pre-CPB, immediately post-CPB, and 24 and 48 hours post-CPB). In addition, any Ig levels drawn for clinical purposes after CPB were included. Ig levels were excluded if drawn after chylothorax diagnosis or intravenous IgG administration. ResultsThe median age was 7 days. Preoperative Ig concentration was similar to that described in healthy children. IgG level decreased to less than 50 % of preoperative concentration by 24 -hour post-CPB and failed to recover by 7 days. Of 47 patients, 25 (53 %) had low IgG (< 248 mg/dL) after CPB. Despite no difference in demographics or risk factors between patients with low and normal IgG, low IgG patients had more positive fluid balance at 24 hours and increased proinflammatory plasma cytokine levels, duration of mechanical ventilation, and cardiac intensive care unit length of stay. In addition, low IgG patients had an increased incidence of postoperative infections (40 % vs 14 %; P = . 056). ConclusionsHypogammaglobulinemia occurs in half of infants after CPB. Its association with fluid overload and increased inflammatory cytokines suggests it may result from capillary leak. Postoperative hypogammaglobulinemia is associated with increased morbidity, including more secondary infections...|$|R

We detected perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) most often of all PFASs. Following a sharp increase from 1982 to 1986, median PFOS concentrations remained in the range of 20 - 24 ng/mL {{until the end of the}} 1990 s. Between 2001 and 2010, PFOS concentrations decreased stea dily to 4 ng/mL in plasma. Except for a similar strong increase from 1982 to 1986, we observed PFOA concentrations fluctuating between 4. 8 and 6. 3 ng/mL in the following years. Since 2008, ESB data suggest a decreasing trend of PFOA. PFHxS concentrations increased continuously between 1982 and 2001 from about 1 - 2 ng/mL. After nearly unchanged concentrations until 2005, a downward trend of PFHxS in plasma became apparent and in 2010 resulted in levels which were about 20 % lower than those observed in the early 1980 s.

Competitive enzymatic vitamin D assays were performed on <b>banked</b> <b>plasma</b> specimens and pregnancy outcomes were collected after delivery. Logistic regression was performed on patients stratified by plasma vitamin D concentration and the following combined clinical outcomes: preeclampsia, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, gestational diabetes, and spontaneous abortion. Vitamin D concentrations were obtained from 235 patients (mean age 24. 3 years, range 18 - 40 years). Seventy percent of our study population was vitamin D insufficient with a serum concentration less than 30 ng/mL (mean serum concentration 27. 6 ng/mL, range 13 - 71. 6 ng/mL).

We report quality control outcomes and nucleic acid yields of our RCC submissions (N= 16) to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, as well as newer discovery platforms, by describing mass spectrometry analysis of albumin oxidation in plasma and 6 ChIP sequencing libraries generated from nephrectomy specimens after histone H 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H 3 K 36 me 3) immunoprecipitation. From June 1, 2010, through January 1, 2013, we enrolled 328 patients with RCC.

For ChIP sequencing, the FastQC score for average read quality was at least 30 for 91 % to 95 % of paired-end reads. In parallel, we analyzed frozen tissue by RNA sequencing; after genome alignment, only 0. 2 % to 0. 4 % of total reads failed the default quality check steps of Bowtie 2, which was comparable to the disqualification ratio (0. 1 %) of the 786 -O RCC cell line that was prepared under optimal RNA isolation conditions. The overall correlation coefficients for gene expression between Mayo Clinic vs TCGA tissues ranged from 0. 75 to 0. 82.
