5|$|Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, {{have won}} the most Tours with five each. Lance Armstrong was the winner of seven {{consecutive}} Tours between 1999 and 2005, but he was stripped of these titles in October 2012 by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) after it emerged that he had used <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Athletes {{train to}} achieve endurance, strength, speed, skill and {{flexibility}} {{at different levels}} of intensity. Offseason training often occurs on dry land, sometimes on roller skis. The organization of cross-country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences. As with other sports that require endurance, strength and speed, some athletes have chosen to use banned <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs.</b>|$|E
5|$|B. Lance Armstrong was {{declared}} winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005. However, in October 2012 he {{was stripped of}} all titles by the UCI due {{to the use of}} <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs.</b> The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that if this happened, there would be no alternate winners for those years, but this has not yet been made official.|$|E

5|$|British rider David Millar won stage 12 of the 2012 Tour de France on the 45th {{anniversary of}} Simpson's death and, having {{previously}} been banned from cycling for using <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> himself, {{paid tribute to}} Simpson and reinforced the importance of learning from his– and Simpson's– mistakes. Millar wrote the introduction for a reissue of Simpson's autobiography, Cycling is My Life, published in 2009.|$|E
5|$|C. Floyd Landis was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Paris {{on the last day}} of the 2006 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> during stage 17 of the race. The United States Anti-Doping Agency found him guilty of using synthetic testosterone during the race and stripped him of his title on 20 September 2007.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, Ramirez hit his 537th career home run, passing Mickey Mantle for 15th {{place on}} the all-time home run list.

5|$|Chambers ran a 100m world junior {{record of}} 10.06s in 1997 {{and became the}} {{youngest}} ever world medallist in the event at the 1999 World Championships, taking the bronze. On his Olympic début at the 2000 Sydney Olympics {{he was the best}} European performer in fourth place. He broke the 10-second barrier twice at the 2001 World Championships. He began using <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> in 2002 and he was later stripped of the 100m European title and record he achieved that year.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} later on March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted on its website another article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned that ten other professional wrestlers were implicated to have received <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> from the same drug ring, including four WWE wrestlers and Eddie Guerrero. Angle never failed a drug test for pain pills, but he did fail a steroid test under WWE's Wellness Policy because his prescription for nandrolone had expired.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{reflected}} {{on drug use}} in athletics {{in an interview with}} Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC's Inside Sport programme. Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> because drug testers did not keep pace with advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E

5|$|Despite not testing {{positive}} {{during the race}} or season, the Gewiss-Ballan team has since been speculated to have executed a systematic doping program that utilized EPO throughout the 1994 season. The team achieved several victories in stage races and one-day races during the year, including a sweep of the podium at La Flèche Wallonne weeks {{before the start of}} the Giro. Team doctor Michele Ferrari was banned for life from sports in 2012 by United States Anti-Doping Agency for distribution of <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> to several of his clients.|$|E
5|$|From 1924 to 1988, {{the tournament}} {{started with a}} {{round-robin}} series of games and ended with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round. The games of the tournament follow {{the rules of the}} International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), which differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL. The tournament follows the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) rules on <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> and the IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, a list of top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. Several players have tested positive for banned substances since the 1972 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Bonds {{first became}} {{embroiled in a}} scandal when Greg Anderson of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), Bonds's trainer since 2000, was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and charged with {{supplying}} anabolic steroids to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet, and legitimate supplements.|$|E

5|$|In February 2013, Yahoo! Sports {{reported}} that Braun's name appeared {{three times in}} records of Biogenesis of America, a Coral Gables clinic alleged to have distributed <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> {{to a number of}} Major League Baseball players who tested positive for banned substances. One entry noted that Braun owed the clinic between $20,000 and $30,000. Braun's name was not listed next to any specific PEDs, unlike some of the other players mentioned in the records. Braun released a statement maintaining that his attorneys had retained the clinic's operator, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant during his appeal of his positive drug test the previous season, and denied any further dealings with the clinic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the thirteenth}} {{stage of the}} 1967 Tour de France, Simpson {{collapsed}} and died during the ascent of Mont Ventoux. He was 29 years old. The post-mortem examination found that he had mixed amphetamines and alcohol; this diuretic combination proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and a stomach complaint. A memorial near where he died has become a place of pilgrimage for many cyclists. Simpson was known to have taken <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> during his career, when no doping controls existed. He is held in high esteem by many cyclists for his character and will to win.|$|E
5|$|Players earn {{credits for}} {{knocking}} out opponents, scoring points, and impressing {{the crowd with}} violence and skill. The credits can be used towards player enhancements such as black market <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs.</b> A crowd meter displays audience support, which boosts the player's team abilities when filled. IGN found the game to heavily rely on teamwork. Computer players on teams rated with low teamwork will not take initiative to pursue the disc or to help teammates in need. This attribute can be raised {{over the course of}} a game. Players can call plays including physical offense, fast offense, neutral, defense, and goal defense.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{injuries}} throughout his later years, Thome totaled, according to Fangraphs, 71.6 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), a sabermetrics baseball statistic intended to quantify a player's total contributions to a team. He {{was one of}} few players whose prime was during the steroid era and was not suspected of using steroids; Thome adamantly denies ever using <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs.</b> Soon after the announcement of his front office position (which signified {{the end of his}} playing career), writers began to speculate {{as to whether or not}} Thome would make it to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and more specifically, whether he would gain entrance in his first year of eligibility in 2018. Writers also questioned whether Thome's candidacy would be hindered by his lack of self-promotion and others' tendency to overlook him.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the IOC began {{enacting}} {{drug testing}} protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but {{his team was}} still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs.</b> The problem with testing during this time {{was a lack of}} standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of the tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 2007, Anderson gave an {{interview}} in which he admitted to using steroids when he was performing on the independent wrestling scene, stating that he had quit using them in November 2005 to comply with WWE's Talent Wellness Program, implying that his job in the promotion was worth more than extra muscle mass. 12 days later, on August 30, his statements were shown to be incorrect when he, along with nine other WWE wrestlers, were named in a Sports Illustrated article as having received <b>performance-enhancing</b> <b>drugs</b> in direct non-compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness Program. Anderson received anastrozole, somatropin, and testosterone between October 2006 and February 2007. He later claimed that the steroids were for a legitimate medical reason, {{saying that they were}} from when he tore his latissimus dorsi muscle in 2005.|$|E
