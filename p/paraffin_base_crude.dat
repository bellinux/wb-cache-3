40|$|In {{the last}} decade the hybrid {{propulsion}} has been considering as a viable alternative of chemical energy conversion stored in propellants into kinetic energy. This energy is applied in propulsive systems of manned platforms, maneuvering procedures {{and even in the}} repositioning process of micro satellites. It presents attractive features and good balance between performance and environmental impact. <b>Paraffin</b> <b>based</b> grains are the hybrid solid fuels appointed as polymeric fuel substitute. The liquid layer formed on the burning surface ensures high regression rate when driven into the flame front. Paraffin grains allow raw material recovery and reduce the risk of explosion in the presence of erosive burning. The structure of the grain and the control of the liquefying burning surface layer depend on the additives concentration, such as carbon black, which are added to the fuel matrix during the production process. In the solid propellant <b>paraffin</b> <b>based</b> grain a cylindrical center port developed during the centrifugation tends to concentrate carbon black in the outer region of the grain. The influence of carbon black distribution and hardness gradient in <b>paraffin</b> <b>based</b> grain were evaluated in this work. Despite being a well-known material, scarce data on the relation of activation energy (Ea) of paraffin is available. In this work, the kinetic parameters (activation energy and pre-exponential factor) of microcrystalline 140 / 1450 F paraffin have been raised through Thermo Gravimetric Analysis in conjunction with the Arrhenius kinetic mechanism, according to ASTM-E 1461. The analysis indicated that the microcrystalline 140 / 1450 F paraffin presents activation energy of 242 kJ. mol- 1 and pre-exponential factor from 1. 42 x 1020 min- 1 to 2. 90 x 1025 min- 1. Ignition was achieved with a 50 W pyrotechnic igniter. Firing tests with 140 / 1450 F paraffin as solid fuel and gaseous oxygen (GOX) as oxidizer were carry on at pressure above 3. 8 MPa. The study suggests that multiple thin layers grain may generate burning surfaces with hardness and carbon black concentration almost constant. In this work combustion instability presented by rocket engine was calculated applying the frequency and boundary layer delay time relationship as proposed by Karabeyoglu. The frequency instability up to was evaluated using LabVIEW data acquisition system. In hybrid propulsion the carbon black has been playing {{a key role in the}} gas production process on the burning surface, the contribution of carbon black in the combustion instability suppression of hybrid propulsion system with paraffin-based propellant was evaluated.

It was found that for slide-roll ratios with the disk moving faster anomalous elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) films were obtained characterized by a “dimple” in the central region of the contact. Numerical thermal–elastohydrodynamic analyses were carried out to simulate both film thickness and friction corresponding to the experimental conditions using Newtonian and Ree-Eyring rheological models. Initial results from this study suggest that neither of these lubricant models predict the correct detailed film shape and the experimental friction at the same time.

Among agricultural residues, maize cob is one worthy of notice, and an alternative use for maize cob would be to produce particleboard panels in association with wood particles. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using maize cob for production of particleboard panels.

The test motor in these experiments had a 45 inch long fuel grain with the initial port diameter ranging between 3 and 5 _inches. The c* efficiency is defined as the ratio of measured and theoretical characteristic velocities and is related to how completely the fuel and oxidizer are converted to combustion products.

The mechanical instability related to liquid breakdown was studied to reveal the threshold levels for the liquids. The interaction of these mechanisms was studied within process. The results showed dross-free cutting is achievable by submerging the Mg alloy in 0. 5 mm alcohol-water solution, which shows a processing condition that enables chemical dissolution of dross without excessive fluence loss or liquid instability.

A <b>paraffin</b> <b>base</b> mineral oil {{is used as a}} lubricant. First experiments are carried out under steady-state conditions. To include effects due to different thermal properties of contacting materials, a steel-on-steel and a glass-on-steel contact with different slide-to-roll-ratios are tested. If the contacting materials have different thermal properties, {{as in the case of}} a glass-on-steel contact, thermal effects like the temperature viscosity wedge action could clearly be shown.

Under transient conditions the entraining velocity is varied with a sinusoidal law. Squeeze effects explain “loops” of friction- and film thickness found also in previous works.

The feasibility of the use of such materials as fuels in hybrid rockets is under study at SPLab in Politecnico di Milano and at the DLR Institute of Space Propulsion in Germany.

Mechanical uniaxial tensile tests were performed according to Standard ISO 527 - 1, on pure macro paraffin and microcrystalline wax and on these waxes doped with stearic acid and graphite; elastic modulus, elongation and maximum stress were calculated. Data indicates that ductile rupture is achievable even on pure tested macro paraffin.

Aim: To study the safety and efficacy of topical rapamycin in treatment of FA in Type IV-VI skin type. Materials and Methods: Five female patients with FA were included in the study, four of whom had TS, whereas one had isolated angiofibromas without systemic involvement. The age of the patients varied from 6 to 44 years. After baseline evaluation, they were advised to apply topical rapamycin (0. 1 - 1 %) in white soft <b>paraffin</b> <b>base</b> twice daily.
