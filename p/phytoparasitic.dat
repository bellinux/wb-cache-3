40|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{sequences}} {{were obtained}} from the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND 3), large rRNA, and cytochrome b genes from Meloidogyne incognita and Romanomermis culicivorax. Both species show considerable genetic distance within these same genes when compared with Caenorhabditis elegans or Ascaris suum, two species previously analyzed. Caenorhabditis, Ascaris, and Meloidogyne were selected as representatives of three subclasses in the nematode class Secernentea: Rhabditia, Spiruria, and Diplogasteria, respectively. Romanomermis served as a representative outgroup of the class Adenophorea. The divergence between the <b>phytoparasitic</b> lineage (represented by Meloidogyne) and the three other species is so great that virtually every variable position in these genes appears to have accumulated multiple mutations, obscuring the phylogenetic information obtainable from these comparisons. The 39 and 42 % amino acid similarity between the M. incognita and C. elegans ND 3 and cytochrome b coding sequences, respectively, are approximately the same as those of C. elegans-mouse comparisons for the same genes (26 and 44 %). This discovery calls into question the feasibility of employing cloned C. elegans probes as reagents to isolate <b>phytoparasitic</b> nematode genes. The genetic distance between the <b>phytoparasitic</b> nematode lineage and C. elegans markedly contrasts with the 79 % amino acid similarity between C. elegans and A. suum for the same sequences.

Five of the bacterial isolates were different (P ≤ 0. 01) in sporangium diameter, endospore width, and ratio of sporangium diameter to endospore width. All locations surveyed had one or more isolates present, suggesting that the Pasteuria penetrans group is widespread in its distribution in southern Florida. Three survey sites had high densities of Belonolaimus longicaudatus, with more than 60 % of the host population encumbered with a large-spored isolate of Pasteuria (mean sporangium diameter = 6. 10 μm). One of these sites was monitored for 16 months during which the proportion of nematodes encumbered with this Pasteuria isolate remained constant.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{quantify}} the role of runoff in nematode transport, compared with soil particle transport, {{during the rainy season}} in the Sudano-Sahelian area. The measurements were made at the outlet of a 58 ha watershed located in the Nioro du Rip region, south of the Senegalese peanut-growing basin. Every time the rainfall was sufficiently strong to cause a runoff, water was collected to estimate the volume of runoff, the soil particles and the nematode contents. Soils in the different agronomic areas were also collected to determine the nematode infestation. Some 6000 m 3 of water run off during the rainy season, together with 18. 6 t of soil and 279. 5 million of nematodes, 127 million of which were major <b>phytoparasitic</b> species. The transport of the different species was not uniform. The first five runoff episodes supplied one-half the volume of runoff water and transported approximately half the <b>phytoparasitic</b> nemtodes, but nearly three-quarters of the solid particles. Fifteen percent of the nematodes were transported during the intermediate stage of the rainy season, and approximately 30 % during the final period, with equivalent water proporitons but smaller quantities of soil. Of the 15 genera and species observed in the area. #Tylenchorhynchus gladiolatus$, #Scutellonema cavenessi$, #Helicotylenchus dihystera$ and #Gracilacus parvula$ represented 87 % of the soil population, 61 % being accounted for by the first two species.

All phytonematodes possess a stylet {{which is used to}} puncture the cell walls, a set of oesophageal glands which empty into the anterior region of the oesophagus, and a muscular pump-like organ between the stylet and intestine. Many plant parasitic nematodes damage plant cells to various degrees by removing cell contents or by inducing cell lysis. In the group of more sophisticated nematode parasites, the plant is induced to form specific sites consisting of specialised nutritive cells upon which the nematode feeds. Besides the changes induced in the plant cells by the penetration of the nematode, there are frequently effects on cells further away from the parasite. Certain nematodes induce pronounced alteration in the growth of their host such as stunting and swelling of lucerne shoots by the stem nematode, or the galling of tomato roots by root knot nematode...|$|E
40|$|Major surface {{protease}} (MSP or GP 63) is {{the most}} abundant glycoprotein localized to the plasma membrane of Leishmania promastigotes. MSP plays several important roles in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis, including {{but not limited to}} (i) evasion of complement-mediated lysis, (ii) facilitation of macrophage (Mø) phagocytosis of promastigotes, (iii) interaction with the extracellular matrix, (iv) inhibition of natural killer cellular functions, (v) resistance to antimicrobial peptide killing, (vi) degradation of Mø and fibroblast cytosolic proteins, and (vii) promotion of survival of intracellular amastigotes. MSP homologues have been found in all other trypanosomatids studied to date including heteroxenous members of Trypanosoma cruzi, the extracellular Trypanosoma brucei, unusual intraerythrocytic Endotrypanum spp., <b>phytoparasitic</b> Phytomonas spp., and numerous monoxenous species. These proteins are likely to perform roles different from those described for Leishmania spp. Multiple MSPs in individual cells may play distinct roles at some time points in trypanosomatid life cycles and collaborative or redundant roles at others. The cellular locations and the extracellular release of MSPs are also discussed in connection with MSP functions in leishmanial promastigotes...|$|E
40|$|Melia azedarach fruit {{extracts}} {{have recently}} raised a substantial interest {{for their use}} in crop protection against <b>phytoparasitic</b> nematodes. The effect of M. azedarach on the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita on cucumber, {{as well as the}} effect on the plant deference mechanism, is reported herein. Crushed fruits of M. azedarach, tested in the soil at the rates of 30 and 60 g kg 1, exhibited nematicidal activity similar to the one of fenamiphos (0. 02 g a. i. kg 1) in terms of nematode population in roots and soil as well as reproduction rate. M. azedarach water extracts, rich in aldehydes, alcohols and carboxylic acids, showed nematicidal activity against M. incognita. Moreover, all M. azedarach treatments decreased the activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX) involved in host H 2 O 2 detoxiﬁcation. Soil application of M. azedarach fruits could be favourably considered in the control of M. incognita on cucumber in a sustainable agriculture, since they act directly as nematicidals. Furthermore, M. azedarach elicits plant defence and helps the host to ﬁght the nematodes infestation in an indirect way...|$|E
40|$|The State of California {{requires}} specific soil {{treatments and}} handling procedures to ensure against nematode pest infestation of field and container, flat, and frame-grown nursery stock for farm planting (California Code of Regulations, Sections 3055 - 3055. 6 and 3640). In addition to methyl bromide fumigation and steam treatments, a “double tent ” solarization technique {{was approved by}} the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) in 1999 to ensure against nematode pest infestation of soil and other planting media used for container, flat, and frame-grown nursery stock for farm planting. The approved treatment stipulated, among other conditions, soil maintained at 70 0 C (158 0 F) for 30 continuous minutes (1). Additional laboratory and field data demonstrating the destruction of <b>phytoparasitic</b> nematodes in soil subjected to 60 0 C (140 0 F) solarization for 60 continuous minutes were submitted, along with a proposal to amend the existing regulations to allow this additional treatment option. The proposal was accepted by CDFA, and wording of amended solarization treatment protocols for CDFA Nursery Inspection Procedures Manual (NIPM) Item # 12 is as follows...|$|E
