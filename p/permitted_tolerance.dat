40|$|The divergences of the {{geometric}} {{features of the}} concrete elements are usually detected after the construction’s erection. These divergences are of prominent importance in precast concrete construction, since they might prove responsible for the deterioration of its bearing ability. Using geodetic methodology, they can be reliably estimated and their values compared against the <b>permitted</b> <b>tolerances,</b> set from the precast construction rules. For this purpose, a geodetic control network is established and its elements are measured using instruments of high precision. After the adjustment of the observations, the vectors of divergences are estimated and their statistical significance is tested. The special requirements {{in the design and}} optimization of such a network are analyzed in this paper, and a case study dealing with the detection of the divergences of a two floor precast construction is presented. The finally estimated divergences were all statistically significant; their values ranged up to 52 mm and exceeded the <b>permitted</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Since the geodetic control network can also be used for the monitoring of the kinematic behavior of the construction, the possibility of using GPS measurements for this purpose is examined through the results of an experiment. 1...|$|R

The report mentioned, amongst others, the following defects: during a test run, an iron plate of the roof bent towards the overhead wire, axles were severely rusted, with a risk of breaking in moving trains, the brakes were not suited for high-speed trains, wiring was not shielded from rain and snow, a bottom plate came loose and fell down on the railtrack, batteries overheated in carriages that had been already taken out of service, resulting in fire and subsequent scorches in the carriages, earthing points were wrongly connected, causing electric driven heavy oxidation, the door sliding mechanisms were faulty, assembly varied from train to train. On the same day the report was published, the Belgian public broadcasting organizations RTBF and VRT got hold of photographs showing the wrecked conditions the V250 trains were in. However, because of major technical problems with these trains, the trains were taken out of rotation within weeks after the start of the service. On the 31st of May 2013, the NMBS/SNCB cancelled the Fyra project entirely. On June 3, NS also announced it was stopping operation of V250 trains. According to their survey of the trains it would take at least 17 months to repair all construction flaws, and entry into service would not be expected before 2018. In addition, even if trains were to be repaired, the maintenance cost would be much higher and the lifetime of the trains much lower than agreed in the contracts with AnsaldoBreda. It is currently unlikely that the V250 will enter commercial service again. In a response to the Dutch and Belgian complaints about damage to the trains, AnsaldoBreda blamed the operators for being irresponsible in running the trains at the certified top speed of 250 km/h in winter, and not performing the recommended daily maintenance. Belgian rail operators claim the latter is not true, and that the problems encountered can only be caused by structural problems with the trains.|$|E

40|$|IκBα is an {{inhibitor}} of the transcriptional factor NF-κB, {{and it is}} {{an essential}} component of the signaling pathways that lead to expression of inflammatory molecules. These include cytokines and costimulatory molecules associated with antigen presentation in an inflammatory immune response. In this study, we report that antigen-presenting cells exposed to TGF-β induce peripheral tolerance by increasing IκBα expression. Exposure of antigen presenting cells (APCs) to TGF-β is known to impair their ability to secrete IL- 12, and such impairment correlated with reduced NF-κB activity as indicated by significantly reduced nuclear levels of p 50, an essential subunit of NF-κB for IL- 12 transcription. Blockade of increased nuclear IκBα in APCs by expression of small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) targeting IκBα transcripts prevented IL- 12 impairment and the decline in nuclear p 50 levels. Furthermore, such IκBα blockade also interfered with the tolerogenic property of TGF-β- exposed APCs. However, increased expression of IκBα in APCs, independent of TGF-β exposure, reduced nuclear p 50 levels and <b>permitted</b> <b>tolerance</b> induction by APCs. Thus, our findings attribute a direct and significant role to IκBα in the tolerogenic potential of APCs.

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} is {{an important}} parameter for ensuring that the dimension of geometry is within the <b>permitted</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The ideal surface roughness {{is determined by the}} feed rate and the geometry of the tool. However, several uncontrollable factors including work material factors, tool angle, and machine tool vibration, may also influence surface roughness. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the measured surface roughness (from experiment) to the theoretical surface roughness (from theoretical calculation) and to investigate the surface roughness resulting from two types of insert, `C' type and `T' type. The experiment was focused on the turning process, using a lathe machine Colchester 6000. The feed rate was varied within the recommended feed rate range. We found that there were large deviations between the measured and theoretical surface roughness at a low feed rate (0. 05 mm/r) from the application of both inserts. A work material factor of AISI D 2 steel that affects the chip character is presumably responsible for this phenomenon. Interestingly, at a high feed rate (0. 4 mm/r), the `C' type insert resulted in 40 % lower roughness compared to the `T' type due to the difference in insert geometry.

40|$|Model equifinality is the {{property}} by which very similar model outputs {{can be generated}} by many different combinations of model inputs. It is known in numerical models used in other disciplines, and {{is thought to be}} likely in landscape evolution models (“LEMs”) also, as they incorporate many process parameters of uncertain value. LEM equifinality, if pervasive, would be a serious obstacle to falsifying working hypotheses and would frustrate landscape evolution research, but to date it has not been quantified. This is attempted here, by sampling a LEM’s response in its parameter space. A well known LEM (‘GOLEM’, Tucker & Slingerland, 1994), used here as an exemplar, is applied to evolution of a c. 38 km 2, 4 th order catchment in the Oregon Coast Range. Ten of GOLEM’s parameters are selected for variation, covering mass movement, channel formation, fluvial erosion and weathering processes, and value ranges appropriate for the catchment are established from published data and calibration. Parameter space sampling is then carried out using a response surface methodology approach which reduces by c. 3 orders of magnitude the simulation run size needed to explore the 10 -D parameter space. Initial simulations are run sampling the space according to a central composite design of 149 targeted parameter value combinations, which afford estimation of all parameter main and two-way interaction effects. Model outputs at 100, 000 years are summarised by four metrics (sediment yield, drainage density, sediment delivery ratio, and a topographic metric), which serve as landscape descriptors. Equations, or “metamodels”, are derived by regression to describe each metric {{as a function of the}} GOLEM parameters, and further simulations allow testing and improvement of model fits (R 2 of c. 98 % for the sediment yield, drainage density and sediment delivery ratio, and c. 92 % for the topographic metric). The parameter space is then sampled rapidly and densely (>> 106 times), using each metamodel to predict GOLEM’s output at each sample point. Results are compared with a reference value for each metric, to obtain equifinal proportions in a range of <b>permitted</b> <b>tolerance</b> bands around the reference, and using a bootstrap to aid calculation of confidence intervals. The likelihood of obtaining an equifinal result is found to depend on the tolerance band and the metric e. g. the equifinal probabilities for drainage density are estimated to be c. 26 % and 58 % respectively in the 2 % and 5 % tolerance bands, compared with c. 68 % and 99 % for the sediment delivery ratio in the same bands. Where combinations of metrics are used, the polymetric equifinal probability is often lower (and never higher) than it would be for any of the component metrics used singly. Also, the equifinal probability for any metric and tolerance band usually decreases as the number of parameters employed in the model increases. More generally, equifinal probabilities are seen to result from the combinations of parameter main effects and interactions driving each metric, thus allowing equifinality to be explored through the use of metamodel archetypes. Further research using other LEMs is needed, and the response surface methodology is recommended for both its computational efficiency and clarity in this respect.
