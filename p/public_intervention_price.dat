Without <b>public</b> <b>intervention,</b> <b>price</b> dynamics {{are driven by}} domestic productive shocks and international prices. Trade and/or storage policies are optimally designed to increase welfare, in a context where consumers are risk-averse and markets are incomplete. An optimal storage policy on its own is detrimental to consumers, since its stabilizing benefits leak into the world market. In contrast, optimal combination of storage and trade policies results in a powerful stabilization of domestic food prices. Such a policy mix includes export restrictions, which are harmful to export partners, but to refrain from using them is costly and entails substantial transfers from consumers to producers.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyzes}} {{the use of}} storage and trade policies to achieve food price stabilization in a small open developing country. Optimal stabilization policies are identified using a rational expectations storage model with risk-averse consumers and incomplete markets. Without <b>public</b> <b>intervention,</b> <b>price</b> dynamics are driven by domestic productive shocks and international prices. On its own, an optimal storage policy {{is found to be}} detrimental to consumers because its stabilizing benefits leak to the world market. In contrast, an optimal combination of storage and trade policies results in a powerful stabilization of domestic food prices. However, such an optimal combination is shown to entail two serious drawbacks: its distributive impacts are large compared to its efficiency benefits, and by distorting excess supply curves, it may aggravate high world price episodes...|$|E

It sets out how the standard EU import duties are designed to raise the price of imported brown indica rice to 180 % of the EU <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> the price of imported japonica rice to 188 % of the <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> and of milled rice to 267 % of the <b>intervention</b> <b>price.</b> However, this duty may not exceed the duty fixed in the EU's Common Customs Tariff, which is a maximum of € 264 /tonne for brown indica rice (currently the <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> is € 298. 35 /tonne so the maximum duty paid import price is € 537 /tonne). According to this report, because of the low price of rice on world markets in the past year, import duties for brown rice have continued at 264 /t.

The Common Market Organization for Sugar sets an <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> of € 63. 19 but actual transaction pries are 10 - 20 percent higher. The only reasonable explanation for the observed market behavior is tacit collusion. We analyze the effects of a number of proposed reform alternatives and we find that lowering the <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> or the export subsidies will only serve to strengthen the tacitly collusive behavior whereas tariff reductions will always be beneficial to the EU consumer.

50|$|Monetary {{compensatory}} amounts (MCAs) were border {{measures in the}} EU consisting of taxes and subsidies formerly applicable to intra-EC trade in agricultural and food products for which <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> were set. These border measures were made necessary {{by the fact that}} <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> were set in ECUs and converted into national currency terms at green rates, set at levels different from commercial market rates. This gave rise to price differentials between member nations (in market ECUs) that would influence intra-EC trade if not offset by the MCAs. The system worked by subsidizing exports (and taxing imports) from strong-currency countries, and taxing exports (subsidizing imports) from weak- currency countries.|$|R

Intervention by central banks, through their monetary policy and as lenders of last resort, constitutes the fourth means of regulating the banking system, and the main form of intervention in financial markets. Central banks intervene in order to ensure the stability of financial systems. The financial crisis has shown that traditional modes of <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in the financial system are ineffective and insufficient.

40|$|Spatial {{concentration}} of economic activities {{is one of}} the most salient features of economic development. The almost parallel urge by policymakers to counteract such a trend through public polices is also striking. This is not only reserved to those countries, especially in Europe, which have a long tradition of <b>public</b> <b>intervention.</b> To a lesser extent, the United States has (for example during the New Deal period) put into place policies aimed at correcting uneven patterns of regional development. <b>Public</b> <b>intervention</b> is usually defended on either efficiency or equity grounds. In the case of economic geography, a justification in terms of efficiency implies identifying the various market failures, specific to the issue of space, that make the optimal economic geography differ from the one induced solely by market forces. Although one also needs to show that <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> will make a better job than market forces, the identification of market failures is a necessary first step to justify <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> on efficiency grounds. Whereas this type of analysis has been standard for <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in the fields of education, technology, pollution, etc., the counterpart for regional policies is much less developed. There are two ways forward: the first is to analyse how some 'standard' market failures are modified by the introduction of space and distance and how in turn, this should affect the definition of public policies; the second is to understand how space and distance themselves can be at the origin of market failures...|$|R

While the optimal size of <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> is shown to depend on the natural influence of economic development on longevity and on the extra-productivity of public spendings in terms of longevity, its optimal structure is determined by (1) differences in the productivity of each public policy; (2) how economic expansion would influence each aspect of longevity without public in-tervention; (3) the dependence of each longevity aspect on past achievements. In the presence of various competing effects, it is concluded that the optimal long-run <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> cannot, given the complementarity of different policies under standard additive expected lifetime utility, be strongly unbalanced...|$|R
