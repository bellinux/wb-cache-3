5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At <b>periodic</b> <b>intervals,</b> the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E

5|$|Penrose tilings {{are simple}} {{examples}} of aperiodic tilings {{of the plane}}. A tiling is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; the tiles normally have {{a finite number of}} shapes, called prototiles, and a set of prototiles is said to admit a tiling or tile the plane if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles. The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are periodic: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by translating all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a period of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in <b>periodic</b> <b>intervals.</b> If a tiling has no periods it is said to be non-periodic. A set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.|$|E

25|$|As {{commercial}} use of electric energy {{spread in the}} 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing gas meters, was required to properly bill customers {{for the cost of}} energy, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month. Many experimental types of meter were developed. Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an electrolytic cell to totalise current consumption. At <b>periodic</b> <b>intervals</b> the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyze {{periodic}} maintenance strategies for managing replicated objects in mobile wireless environments. Under periodical maintenance strategies, the system periodically checks local cells {{to determine if}} a replicated object should be allocated or deallocated in a cell to reduce the access cost. We develop a performance model based on Petri nets that considers the missing-read cost, write-propagation cost and the periodic maintenance cost with the objective to identify optimal <b>periodic</b> maintenance <b>intervals</b> to minimize the overall cost. The analysis results show that the overall cost is high when the user arrival-departure ratio and the read-write ratio work against each other and is low otherwise. In all cases, there exists an optimal <b>periodic</b> maintenance <b>interval</b> that would yield the minimum cost. Further, the optimal <b>periodic</b> maintenance <b>interval</b> increases as the arrival-departure ratio and the read-write ratio work in harmony...|$|R

500|$|Horses {{normally}} require {{free access}} to all the fresh, clean water they want, and to avoid dehydration, should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time. However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at <b>periodic</b> <b>intervals,</b> provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources. [...] But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30â€“90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process. [...] A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked. [...] Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.|$|E

In this paper we focus on on-demand broadcast system. We propose a new ondemand scheduling algorithm that takes scheduling decision at <b>periodic</b> <b>interval,</b> unlike previous algorithms that take decision after broadcasting every data item. This reduces the time client spends monitoring the broadcast channel for data items. We study its behavior with a detailed simulation study and show that our algorithm performs better than the pervious algorithms for on-demand systems. ...|$|R

For temperatures below the critical value and suitably prescribed masses, there is a non homogeneous solution, the double soliton, which is a minimizer of the entropy functional. We prove the stability, up to translations, of the double soliton under small perturbations. The same arguments imply the stability of the pure phases, as well as the stability of the mixed phase above the critical temperature. The mixed phase is proved to be unstable below the critical temperature...|$|R

Remarkably, the correlation length of the field amplitude is, within a constant factor, equal to the length scale defined by the dimension density. This suggests that a correlation measurement may suffice to estimate the fractal dimension of some large homogeneous chaotic systems. Comment: 18 pages including 4 figures, uses REVTeX macros.

As a consequence, the number of intruded nodes may potentially be maintained above the threshold f for durations much longer than Î´Ã—n. Moreover, for a sequential-attack there are paths of attack with different effectivenesses, because of their relation with the ordering of rejuvenations.
