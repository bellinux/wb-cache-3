We investigated the prevalence of B 19 V DNA and anti-B 19 V antibodies in Chinese <b>plasma</b> <b>pools,</b> <b>plasma</b> derivatives and plasma donations to evaluate the risk posed by B 19 V. Methods Using a Q-PCR assay developed in-house, we tested for B 19 V genomic DNA in 142 <b>plasma</b> <b>pools</b> collected between January 2009 and June 2011 from two Chinese blood products manufacturers. Plasma derivatives collected between 1993 – 1995 (10 batches of albumin, 155 batches of intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIG) and 2009 – 2011 (50 batches of albumin, 54 batches of IVIG, 35 batches of factor VIII, 7 batches of fibrinogen, and 17 batches of prothrombin complex concentrate, PCC) were also tested for B 19 V contamination. In addition, B 19 V genome prevalence in minipools(including 90 individual donations) of 49680 individual plasma samples collected between August 2011 and March 2012 by a single Chinese manufacturer was investigated. IgM/IgG was also investigated in plasma pools/derivatives and in minipools with B 19 V-DNA titers above 1 x 10 4 and 1 x 10 6 geq/mL using B 19 ELISA IgM/IgG assay(Virion-Serion, Würzburg, Germany), respectively. Results B 19 V-DNA was detected in 54. 2 % of <b>plasma</b> <b>pools</b> from two Chinese blood product manufacturers; among recently produced blood products, B 19 V was detected in 21 / 54 IVIG samples, 19 / 35 factor VIII samples, 6 / 7 fibrinogen samples, and 12 / 17 PCC samples, but not in albumin samples. The levels of B 19 V-DNA in these samples varied from 10 2 - 10 7 geq/mL. In samples with > 10 4 geq/mL genome DNA, B 19 V-specific IgG was also found in all corresponding <b>plasma</b> <b>pools</b> and IVIG, whereas none was detected in the majority of other plasma derivatives. Screening of plasma donations indicated that most minipools were contaminated with B 19 V-DNA (10 2 - 10 8 geq/mL) and one donation had 1. 09 [*]×[*] 10 10 geq/mL B 19 V genomic DNA along with a non-classical IgG/IgM profile. Conclusions Despite the implementation of some inactivation/removal methods designed to prevent viral contamination, B 19 V DNA was detectable in Chinese <b>plasma</b> <b>pools</b> and <b>plasma</b> derivatives. Thus, the introduction of B 19 V screening and discard donation with high viramic concentration for Chinese plasma donors would be desirable. </p...|$|R

40|$|Detection of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) RNA in samples of plasma/serum {{has become an}} essential part of the diagnosis and management of HCV-infected patients. Qualitative HCV-RNA tests are used to identify acute HCV infections as well as chronic HCV carriers. In recent years,a variety of commercial and non commercial test systems have been developed for this purpose. Each of these methods is calibrate with proprietary standards and exhibits its own sensitivity (detection limit) and specificity. Obviously, laboratories performing HCV-RNA test should report accurate and reliable results regardless of the type of assay used. Where commercial kit are used for part of or the complete analytical procedure, documented validation points already covered by the kit manufacturer can substitute for the validation by the user. Nevertheless, the performance of the kit with respect to its intended use has to be demonstrated by the user. One of the best ways to assess the performance of individual laboratories for validation of qualitative HCV-RNA test is determine: 1. Specificity. In order to validate the specificity of the analytical procedure, at least 100 HCV-RNA-negative <b>plasma</b> <b>pools</b> should be tested and shown to be non-reactive. 2. Positive cut-off point (detection limit/sensitivity). The positive cut-off point (as defined in the Ph Eur General Method 2. 6. 21) is the minimum number of the target sequences per volume sample which can be detected in 95 % of test runs. A dilution series of a working reagent or reference material, which has been calibrated against the WHO HCV International Standard (96 / 790), should be tested on different days to examine variation between test runs. At least 3 independent dilution series should be tested with a sufficient number of replicates at each dilution to give a total number of 24 test results for each dilution to enable a statistical analysis of the results; 3. Robustness. To demonstrate robustness, at least 20 HCV-RNA negative <b>plasma</b> <b>pools</b> (selected at random) and spiked with HCV-RNA to a final concentration of 3 times the previously determined 95 % cut-off value should be tested and found positive; 4.

The association between diurnal cycle and iron flux is relevant in the disease of restless legs syndrome (RLS), where individuals display diurnal deficits in motor control, have impaired brain iron metabolism, and perhaps altered iron uptake from the <b>plasma</b> <b>pool.</b> The goal {{of the present study}} was to examine diurnal variations in peripheral and regional brain iron to evaluate iron flux between organs in iron-sufficient and iron-deficient mice. In mice fed control diet, liver iron was elevated 30 – 40 %, and plasma iron was reduced 20 – 30 % in the active dark period compared with the inactive light phase. Dietary iron deficiency eliminated this variation in liver iron in male and female mice and in plasma iron in male mice. Reductions in ventral midbrain and nucleus accumbens iron and ferritin were apparent in iron-deficient mice during both diurnal phases, but only during the light phase was an ∼ 25 % reduction in whole brain iron observed, suggesting different brain iron requirements between phases.

Specific antibacterial antibody concentrations were measured in individual donors before and after immunization. In addition, antibody concentrations were measured in <b>plasma</b> <b>pools</b> prepared from immunized donors and from unimmunized controls and in the immunoglobulin-containing Cohn-Oncley fractions II and III derived from the respective <b>plasma</b> <b>pools.</b> A comparison of Cohn-Oncley fractions II, which contain primarily immunoglobulin G and which are used therapeutically as immune globulin, revealed that antibody to H. influenzae type b was enriched 15. 3 -fold and that antibody to meningococcal serogroups and pneumococcal types was enriched a mean of 4. 4 -fold (range, 1. 2 - to 9. 9 -fold). Enrichment of antibacterial antibody in Cohn fraction III, which contains substantial amounts of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin A in addition to immunoglobulin G, closely paralleled that in fraction II. Only antibodies to pneumococcal types 1 and 7 were increased disproportionately in fraction III. Based on the clinical experience that conventional immune serum globulin at a dose of 100 mg/kg protects agammaglobulinemic patients for ca. 1 month, we estimate that bacterial polysaccharide immune globulin, in similar dosage, will provide protection from systemic H. influenzae type b infection for 4 to 6 months and from pneumococcal and meningococcal infections for 3 to 4 months...|$|R
