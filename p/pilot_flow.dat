40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of air-flow {{shifting}} between the pilot and main stages of a staged lean jet engine burner were investigated. A fluidic element attached {{in front of the}} swirlers was used to alter the air-flow split ratio between them, and the swirler and nozzle exit-section pressure loss behind the fluidic element was measured using an atmospheric isothermal test. The fluidic element did not fully recover the pressure loss in the burner inlet. However, it can also affect the losses, and cause an air shift between the pilot and main stage. Therefore, further combustion tests were conducted under two operating conditions: ground idle at 7 % maximum take-off thrust and scaled cruise condition. Under ground idle conditions, increased <b>pilot</b> air <b>flow</b> improved the combustion efficiency for high fuel <b>flow,</b> and reduced <b>pilot</b> air <b>flow</b> improved it for low fuel flow.

40|$|AbstractVortex/flame {{interaction}} {{is an important}} mechanism for unsteady combustion in a swirl combustion system. Technology of low emission stirred swirl (TeLESS), which is characterized with stratified swirl flow, has been developed in Beihang University to reduce NOX emission. However, large-scale flow structure would be induced in strong swirl flow. Experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation were carried out to investigate the unsteady flow feature and its mechanism in TeLESS combustor. Hotwire was firstly applied to testing the unsteady flow feature and a distinct mode with 2244 Hz oscillation frequency occurred at the pilot swirl outlet. The flow mode amplitude decayed convectively. Large eddy simulation (LES) was then applied to predicting this flow mode and know about its mechanism. The deviation of mode prediction compared with hotwire test was 0. 8 %. The spiral isobaric structure in <b>pilot</b> <b>flow</b> passage indicates that precessing vortex core (PVC) existed. The velocity spectrum and phase lag analysis suggest that the periodic movement at the pilot outlet was dominated by precessing movement.

40|$|The ATLAS {{experiment}} at the CERN LHC {{is one of}} {{the largest}} users of grid computing infrastructure, which is a central part of the experiment’s computing operations. Considerable efforts have been made to use grid technology in the most efficient and effective way, including the use of a pilot job based workload management framework. In this model the experiment submits ’pilot’ jobs to sites without payload. When these jobs begin to run they contact a central service to retrieve a real payload to execute. The first generation of pilot factories were usually specific to a single VO, and were bound to the particular architecture of that VO’s distributed processing. A second generation provides factories which are more flexible, not tied to any particular VO, and provide new or improved features such as monitoring, logging, profiling, etc. In this paper we describe this key part of the ATLAS pilot architecture, a second generation pilot factory, AutoPyFactory. AutoPyFactory has a modular design and is highly configurable. It is able to send different types of pilots to sites and exploit a range of submission mechanisms and queue characteristics. It is tightly integrated with the PanDA job submission framework, coupling <b>pilot</b> <b>flow</b> to the amount of work the site has to run. It gathers information from many sources in order to correctly configure itself for a site, and its decision logic can easily be modified. Integrated into AutoPyFactory is a flexible system for delivering both generic and specific job wrappers which can perform many useful actions before starting to run end-user scientific applications, e. g. validation of the middleware, node profiling and diagnostics, and monitoring.

40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} application of the Probability Density Function (PDF) on Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of turbulent reacting flows {{in a wide range of}} open flame configurations spanning between the premixed and non-premixed regime. The aim is to validate the applicability of the PDF model on a wide range of flames without any special treatment. Additionally, the a-posteriori Chemical Exposive Mode Analysis (CEMA) has been applied to the results in order to examine the flame structure and identify locations of extinction, re-ignition, etc. Four different series of flames are studied, each one of them belonging to a completely different combustion regime. The F 1 -F 3 premixed turbulent flames is the first family of flames where the PDF method is applied. The LES-PDF model is shown to accurately predict the flow field and the scalar field even on a very coarse grid. The simulations were performed on a personal computer, so the computational power was severely restricted. Nevertheless, the PDF model was able to give accurate predictions, so one of the flames was chosen for a further sensitivity analysis. A large number of modelling parameters were studied and the results show little sensitivity to them in contrast to RANS-PDF approaches in premixed flames. Finally, the model is able to capture large scale quenching at qualitatively the correct extinction speed. The Cambridge-Sandia series of swirling stratified flames was also examined. It encompasses a wide range of flames with various combinations of swirl and stratification ratio levels. Four distinct cases were selected and tested. For the most simple flames (SwB 1 and SwB 5), the model gives excellent prediction for both the flow field and the scalar distribution. The introduction of the additional fields improves slightly the results, especially at locations further away from the nozzle exit. For the flames which exhibit more complex flow fields and complex characteristics (SwB 6 and SwB 11), the model gives reasonable results, given the complexity of the flow field. The introduction of differential diffusion and heat losses towards the ceramic cap was studied independently on the SwB 11 flame and was found to have counteracting effects. Therefore, their combination was tested and was found to give a significant improvement. The next series of flames is the Sydney Swirl flames. The SM 1 and SM 2 flames are two complex swirling flames with a difficult flow field to capture. The field is composed of recirculating zones and vortex break-down bubble areas. The SM 2 has not been tested in the literature and this work is the first modelling approach. The flow field simulation results are reasonable, given the complexity of the flame. The biggest discrepancies are observed close to the nozzle exit. The Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis is also performed to give information about the flame structure. The flame is divided into three distinct zones with the second one being a very large quenching region. The CEMA analysis explains why the flame does not quench, but re-ignites further down. Finally, the Delft III premixed flame is studied, a difficult flame to model as it shows quenching with large extinction pockets despite the moderately low Reynolds number. The major flow characteristics were accurately captured by the simulation and the introduction of the additional stochastic fields improves the results close to the nozzle exit. Contrary to most researchers that model the <b>pilot</b> <b>flow</b> as a single heat source close to the nozzle exit, in this work the <b>pilot</b> <b>flow</b> is modelled as a separate flow stream, something that increased the complexity of the simulations due to the extremely thin pilot rim which was comparable to the cell size.

40|$|AbstractCombustion {{instability}} of pilot flame {{has been investigated}} in a model pilot bluff body stabilized combustor by running the pilot flame only. The primary objectives are to investigate the pilot flame dynamics and to provide bases {{for the study of}} the interaction mechanisms between the pilot flame and the main flame. Dynamic pressures are measured by dynamic pressure transducers. A high speed camera with CH∗ bandpass filter is used to capture the pilot flame dynamics. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to further analyze the high speed images. With the increase of the <b>pilot</b> fuel mass <b>flow</b> rate, the <b>pilot</b> flame changes from stable to unstable state gradually.

40|$|Flow {{has been}} {{described}} as a state of cognitive efficiency and intrinsic enjoyment, whereby a person feels at one with the activity. The existence of an autotelic personality’, an inter-individual difference dimension characterised by the propensity with which a person experiences flow, has been proposed, but the construct has proven to be relatively elusive. The overall aim of this PhD dissertation was to advance flow theory, and in particular enhance the knowledge of individual differences in flow experiences by the investigation of a new construct, flow metacognitions. Flow metacognitions were defined as people’s metacognitive knowledge and beliefs on flow as a state of optimal cognitive functioning. Building upon the concepts of adaptive and maladaptive metacognitions (Beer & Moneta, 2010; Wells, 2000) that were found to impact self-regulation efforts during demanding situations, it was postulated that people would also hold metacognitions on flow, a cognitive state of deep absorption usually elicited by a demanding activity. However, to date, flow metacognitions had not been defined, measured, or tested for their relevance in the context of flow experiences (or in other contexts of optimal experience). This dissertation presents four studies that were conducted to identify flow metacognitions, comprising the development and validation of a self-report questionnaire to measure them validly and reliably, as well as the examination of the scientific relevance of the operationalised constructs. Preliminary instances of potential flow metacognitions were identified in qualitative analyses, whereby the qualitative content of Flow Questionnaires (FQ, Csikszentmihalyi & Csikszentmihalyi, 1988) administered to a sample of 371 workers was analysed. In addition, semi-structured interviews with 12 workers were held about their experiences of flow in work (Study 1, Chapter 2). From these analyses, two broad metacognitions emerged: people’s beliefs in the ‘usefulness’ of being in flow, and individual differences in their beliefs and confidence in the self-regulation of flow experiences. Based on the metacognitive constructs identified in the qualitative analyses, a 53 -item <b>pilot</b> <b>Flow</b> Metacognitions Questionnaire (FMQ) was developed and tested on a sample of 204 UK students. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a two-component solution, with item reduction procedures leading to a 12 -item scale. Subsequent principal component analysis on the same sample confirmed that the 12 items loaded onto two main components: Beliefs that Flow Fosters Achievement (FMQ- 1) and Confidence in Ability to Self-Regulate Flow (FMQ- 2).

40|$|A {{significant}} {{issue affecting}} the aquaculture and water industries {{is the presence}} of off-flavour compounds in water, which cause problems by imparting an undesirable earthy/musty flavour and smell to water and fish. Two predominant off-flavour compounds are geosmin (GSM) and 2 -methylisoborneol (MIB). These compounds are produced by several varieties of cyanobacteria and actinomycetes as metabolic products and can be detected by humans at concentrations as low as 0. 015 mg L- 1. Removal of GSM and MIB from potable waters has proven to be inefficient using standard water treatment such as filtration, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and chlorination. Activated carbon and membrane processes can physically remove GSM and MIB, but do not destroy them, and ozone treatment can be expensive. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) photocatalysis has recently been demonstrated to rapidly degrade GSM and MIB. When the semiconductor catalyst is illuminated with ultraviolet light simultaneous oxidation and reduction reactions occur. Pollutants are broken down into mineral acids, carbon dioxide and water. This study was conducted to determine if TiO 2 photocatalysis, using a pelleted form of TiO 2 called Hombikat K 01 /C, was a suitable method for the treatment of potable water. Additionally an analytical method was developed to rapidily analyse the large number of samples generated. Two reactors, a bench scale batch reactor and <b>pilot</b> scale <b>flow</b> reactor, were developed and used to evaluate the efficacy of Hombikat K 01 /C TiO 2 photocatalysis in degrading GSM. The batch reactor, containing Hombikat K 01 /C, was used to investigate the effect of numerous experimental variables on the photocatalysis of GSM, including initial substrate concentration, pH, light intensity, aeration rate, the presence of additional reactants, and catalysis conducted in deuterated water. GSM was rapidly degraded using the TiO 2 batch reactor, with the rate of GSM degradation most affected by light intensity and additional reactants, though pH also had a notable effect. A kinetic isotope effect of 1. 61 was observed for the destruction of GSM using Hombikat K 01 /C TiO 2. The flow reactor was also found to efficiently degrade GSM in raw waters. The rate of GSM destruction was found to be significantly lowered by UV shielding of the catalyst, caused by constituents of raw the water used, and the presence of additional reactants.

40|$|Continuous thermal {{pasteurisation}} {{of various}} bulk liquid media {{is an important}} step in the food and allied industries. The design of a continuous flow pasteuriser is typically predicated on mathematical models developed from experimental data - usually batch, bench - scale, ethods. Of particular interest is the effect of combined pasteuriser temperature (T) and liquid pH on inactivation and survivor of contaminants. However, bench - scale thermal survivor data may not adequately mirror those in a continuous flow pasteuriser. This research presents the development and experimental validation of rigorous models for thermal pasteurisation of bacteria as affected by combined process T - pH in both batch, bench - scale capillary studies (static) and in a <b>pilot</b> continuous <b>flow</b> pasteuriser (dynamic), within a defined liquid and range of exposure time, temperature and pH (t - T - pH). Five integrated stages in synthesis and model analysis were undertaken using stringent criteria for goodness of fit of an adequate model established. First, four published predictive models were assessed against published static data (n [subscript T] = 248) for the thermal inactivation of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) in a Carbopol ® 941 liquid food simulant in batch capillaries over a range of t - T - pH. The models tested were the Classical Arrhenius, Davey Linear - Arrhenius (D - LA), Square - Root (Belehradek) and a third - order Polynomial model (nOP). Analysis showed the D - LA model best satisfied the criteria for model selection and explained 96. 0 % V in the thermal inactivation rate coefficient. Second, the D - LA model was assessed against limited, published dynamic data (n [subscript T] = 109) for the same E. coli strain in identical food simulant. The model explained 60 % V in the thermal inactivation rate coefficient. On average, model predictions of survivor numbers from the dynamic data were less than that predicted from the static data, i. e. for a given (t - T - pH) more bacterial cells were apparently inactivated in the continuous flow pasteuriser than in bench - scale, batch capillary studies. Overall, however it was not clear from extensive analyses of available data whether there is a statistically significant difference in survivor numbers of viable E. coli between batch static and continuous flow dynamic data. Third, although the D - LA model best satisfied the criteria for goodness of fit of a model, it failed to accurately predict the observed tails in the static survivor data. New models (KDT and a modified KDT) were synthesised to predict tails and shoulders in survivor data. The modified KDT (MKDT) form gave improved predictive capability over the KDT model when assessed against published static survivor data for E. coli and L. monocytogenes (n [subscript T] = 355) in the Carbopol food simulant. This model, however, could not be readily integrated with equations describing the performance of a continuous flow pasteuriser. Analyses indicated that a greater density of dynamic survivor data for E. coli was needed. Fourth, a <b>pilot</b> continuous <b>flow</b> pasteuriser was constructed and used to generate a greater density of dynamic survivor data of E. coli (ATCC 25922) in a Carbopol ® 941 carrier liquid for rigorous comparison with predictions from the Lin (1976) isothermal continuous laminar flow process model. Direct steam injection heating was used. Extensive dye and digital - video studies, in a section of glass holding tube confirmed the practical implementation of the assumptions of laminar flow and rapid condensation of steam. Extensive practical experiments highlighted a non - isothermal condition along the holding tube. A highly linear dependence (R ² > 0. 90) of exposure temperature with holding tube length, i. e. exposure time, was demonstrated. This was accounted for using mathematical approaches and quantitatively incorporated into a D - LA model for the rate coefficient in an extended Lin process model. A block experimental design of 4 T (54, 56, 58, 60 ° C) x 4 pH (4. 5, 5. 5, 6. 5, 7. 5) x 3 replicates with a total of (n [subscript T] = 834) exposure times (16 - 198 s) was carried out in the <b>pilot</b> continuous <b>flow</b> pasteuriser. Findings highlighted that greater numbers of E. coli were thermally inactivated in the flow pasteuriser than predicted. From a practical operating view, the predictions from the extended Lin model were therefore conservative - with reduced risk to public health. Highly significant differences in the rates of heat - up of bacteria in the pilot pasteuriser (dynamic) (0. 0104 s) compared with that in the batch (static) capillary tubes (1. 6 s) and, mode of heat transfer, together with partial effects of dispersion with increasing length of pasteuriser holding tube, are postulated to be the controlling process influences for the difference between the experimental survivor data and the extended Lin model predictions. The lack of agreement between the continuous pasteuriser data and predictions from the extended Lin model indicated that this model cannot be practically applied. A direct comparison of the experimentally derived dynamic survivor data from the pilot pasteuriser (as ln N / N [subscript 0]) was also made with both the published static and dynamic data at a number of defined t - T - pH. This comparison revealed that overall, more E. coli were inactivated in the <b>pilot</b> continuous <b>flow</b> pasteuriser than described by published batch static capillary and dynamic data. Importantly, these comparisons showed that batch thermal survivor data for E. coli do not adequately mirror those obtained in continuous flow systems. Fifth, in a search for an improved model for the inactivation data, the newly derived MKDT model was assessed against the experimental pilot pasteuriser data. This model was rejected, however, because it could not account satisfactorily for all tails in survivor curves. A Weibull form model with two coefficients (a scale factor (α) and a shape factor (β)) also did not adequately predict tailing and could not be reliably extrapolated with holding time. However, a modified Weibull form, also with two model coefficients (β [subscript 0], β [subscript 1]), did give an improved fit to available experimental data. This research highlighted statistically significant differences between the dynamic thermal survivor data for E. coli and standard bench - scale static capillary data for a defined liquid and range of t - T - pH. It is likely that findings from this study can be generalised. However, validation should be carried out for a range of common indicator micro - organisms in a range of liquid foods. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|The Stanislaus Complex {{wildfire}} and {{the subsequent}} <b>Pilot</b> Ridge debris <b>flow</b> is representative of a later post-wildfire debris flow occurrence in a forested terrain (DeGraff et al., 2015). On August 29, 1987, thousands of lightning strikes occurred and triggered many fires in the Sierra Nevada and northern mountain ranges of California (DeGraff and Lewis, 1989). Several wildfires on the Stanislaus National Forest south of Sonora, California {{in the vicinity of}} the Tuolumne River eventually formed the Stanislaus Complex wildfire (Fig. 1). Over the following weeks, this wildfire burned nearly 60, 000  ha (Regelbrugge and Conard, 1993). Much of the burned area was a mixed conifer forest dominated by ponderosa pine. Trees were killed in forested drainage basins both by being consumed by fire or by heat injury causing mortality within one to 2 years after a wildfire (Regelbrugge and Conard, 1993). For the first few years after the wildfire, salvage logging was carried out in selected locations.|$|R

However, a lack of demonstration of the reliability of the process has delayed its large scale industrial implementation. As an important step towards a greater trust in the process reliability, a self-consistent CFD model has been developed. This paper contains {{a detailed description of the}} model and a performance prediction of an entrained <b>flow</b> <b>pilot</b> gasifier for a typical operational condition. Emphasis is put on the modelling of input data for the CFD simulation where eight key assumptions form the basis for a consistent model of the black liquor composition. The results for the pilot gasifier performance with typical values for the design variables indicate that the droplet size should be < 200 µm and/or have a residence time of 2 - 3 s for a high level of carbon conversion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith {{the gradual}} {{depletion}} of petroleum and environmental degradation, intensive research activity has been {{addressed to the}} utilization of alternative fuels in internal combustion engines. In the present work, an experimental investigation is carried out to study the effect of eucalyptus biodiesel and natural gas under dual fuel combustion mode on the performance and the exhaust emissions of a single cylinder DI diesel engine. The natural gas (NG) is inducted with the intake air through the inlet manifold. The liquid pilot fuel (eucalyptus biodiesel or diesel fuel) is injected into the combustion chamber to cover approximately 10 % of the maximum power output. Then, keeping constant the <b>pilot</b> fuel <b>flow</b> rate, the power output is further increased using only natural gas. The combustion characteristics (cylinder pressure, ignition delay and heat release rate), performance and exhaust emissions of the dual fuel mode (NG-diesel fuel and NG-biodiesel) are {{compared with those of}} conventional diesel engine mode at various load conditions. The combustion analysis has shown that biodiesel as pilot fuel exhibits similar pressure-time history, with highest peak, as diesel fuel in conventional and dual fuel modes. The performance and pollutant emission results show that, compared to diesel fuel in dual fuel mode, the use of eucalyptus biodiesel as pilot fuel reduces the high emission levels of unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) particularly at high engine loads. However this is accompanied by an increase in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which {{can be explained by the}} lower calorific value and the oxygen presence in the molecule of the eucalyptus biodiesel, respectively.

40|$|International audienceHigh {{performance}} of compact heat exchangers is conditioned by correct fluid distribution. This {{is especially true}} for gas-liquid heat exchangers where a uniform distribution is particularly delicate to obtain and where maldistribution entails significant performance deterioration. Several phenomena can lead to phase distribution problems: the fins may be subject to manufacturing defects or fouling, leading to shortcuts or dead zones. But the first source of maldistribution may be a poor distribution at the outlet of the entrance distributor. This distributor aims at mixing the phases and distributing them across the channels. The present study deals with the simulation and experimental investigation of the two-phase distribution and flow regimes in a distributor located {{at the bottom of the}} cold <b>flow</b> <b>pilot</b> plant of a vertical compact heat exchanger. Air and water are the working fluids, and the range of superficial velocities inside the distributor is 0. 9 - 8. 8 m s(- 1) and 0. 35 - 0. 8 ms(- 1), for air and water respectively.
