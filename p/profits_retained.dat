40|$|The {{deliberations}} {{contained in}} the article concern the methodology of estimating the amount of funds needed to finance of programme of sales increase in a company. A starting point for formulating capital requirements is a sales forecast, indices of capital intensity rates and spontaneous liabilities. The determined internal sources of financing the programme of sales decrease the overall amount of external funds needed by a company to finance the increase of sales. The size of this decrease is dependent upon: net <b>profit,</b> <b>retained</b> <b>profit</b> rate, dividend rate, rate of spontaneous liabilities, and depreciation. It is also affected by inflation.

50|$|In {{the theory}} of capital structure, External {{financing}} is the phrase used to describe funds that firms obtain from outside of the firm. It is contrasted to internal financing which consists mainly of <b>profits</b> <b>retained</b> by the firm for investment. There are many kinds of external financing. The two main ones are equity issues, (IPOs or SEOs), but trade credit is also considered external financing as are accounts payable, and taxes owed to the government. External financing is generally thought to be more expensive than internal financing, because the firm often has to pay a transaction cost to obtain it.|$|E
50|$|Finance Act 1965 {{replaced}} {{the system of}} income tax and profits tax from 1 April 1965 with the Corporation Tax, which re-introduced aspects of the old system. Corporation Tax was charged at a uniform rate on all profits, but additional tax was then payable if profits were distributed as a dividend to shareholders. In effect, dividends suffered double taxation. This method of corporation tax {{is known as the}} classical system and is similar to that used in the United States. The effect of the tax was to revert to the distribution tax in operation from 1949 to 1959: dividend payments were subject to higher tax than <b>profits</b> <b>retained</b> within the company.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to income tax, companies were also {{subject to a}} profits tax, which was deducted from company profits when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on dividends (profits distributed to shareholders) than on <b>profits</b> <b>retained</b> within the company. By penalising the distribution of profits, it was hoped companies would retain profits for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War. The tax {{did not have the}} desired effect, so the distributed profits tax was increased by 20% by the post-war Labour government to encourage companies to retain more of their profits. At the time of Hugh Gaitskell's 1951 budget, the profits tax was 50% for distributed profits and 10% for undistributed profits.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} relationship between earnings and <b>profits</b> and <b>retained</b> earnings and the feasibility of reconciliation of the two accounts by outside corporate investors. Deductive conclusions are based on data derived from publicly available literature, seventeen earnings and profits studies prepared by selected certified public accounting firms, and {{an interview with a}} representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ Ninety-two potential transactional differences between earnings and <b>profits</b> and <b>retained</b> earnings are analyzed and classified as resulting in no differences, timing differences, or permanent differences between the accounts. Corroborative inferences are drawn from the data developed from the seventeen earnings and profits studies and from the interview with the representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ This dissertation concludes that earnings and <b>profits</b> and <b>retained</b> earnings (1) only in extremely rare situations are equal in amount and (2) cannot be reconciled using publicly available information. In addition, the inference is drawn that retained earnings is not a valid surrogate for earnings and profits. The consequences of these conclusions and inference are that outside investors are not receiving useful information about earnings and profits and cannot generate that information. ^ The dissertation recommends that the United States Congress define earnings and profits, that the Internal Revenue Service require calculation of the account by all corporate taxpayers on an annual basis, and that the Financial Accounting Standards Board consider the issue of reconciliation of earnings and <b>profits</b> and <b>retained</b> earnings. In addition, recommendations for future research in this area are offered. ...|$|R

This paper confirms that the <b>profits</b> <b>retained</b> as a reserve fund, if combined with unconstrained bureaucratic discretion, can engender inflationary bias. This result is intriguing because the previous literature emphasizes a similar distortion in monetary policy for the opposite case where those profits are {{turned over to the}} Treasury. We therefore propose that some external changes in central-banking institutions alone may not warrant their desired 'outcome' without reining in excessive discretion. This proposition can provide a beneficial implication for establishing the meaningful independence of central banks. retained profits, central banking, transparency, bureaucratic discretion, inflationary bias...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to solve the problem of {{overestimation}} of industry profits due to the presence of cross-shareholding (CS) links among firms that is inherent to the profit formulations in existing literature. Design/methodology/approach – In proposing a new profits specification, we explicitly distinguish between firms' <b>profits</b> (<b>retained</b> earnings) and their external shareholders' returns. Matrix algebra is used to take into full account both direct and indirect financial interests of firms in each other. Findings – Compared to no the CS case, with CS firms' industry-wide retained earnings increase, while aggregate external shareholders' returns decrease unless dividend ratios are all unity. It is shown that qualitatively there is no difference in the outcomes of all profit specifications, whereas there is a quantitative difference. Research limitations/implications – The pattern of CS is taken as exogenous, which looks at the problem from an antitrust perspective. Endogenizing the structure of CS is left for future research. Practical implications – Firms have incentives to engage in CS links, since they can only benefit from it. In empirical research (e. g. analyzing market performance) dividend payments have to be taken into account if there are extensive CS links present in the industry under study. Originality/value – This paper extends the existing profit formulations by including both income inflows and outflows of firms due to CS links. Furthermore, the significance of considering dividend payments for empirical research is discussed. Dividends, Profit, Shares...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the burgeoning research on inequality and top incomes around the globe by presenting the first available estimates of top income shares and effective income tax rates in contemporary Chile based on analysis of anonymous income tax return microdata. We {{pay special attention to}} business income, which dominates {{at the top of the}} distribution. Our analysis includes not only distributed profits, but also the large proportion of accrued <b>profits</b> <b>retained</b> by firms. Our most conservative estimate of the income share received by the top 1 per cent of Chileans, constructed directly from income reported to the tax agency, is 15 per cent for 2005 and 2009 – the fifth highest share reported in the top incomes literature. When distributed profits are adjusted for widespread under-reporting, we estimate that the top 1 per cent share increases to roughly 22 per cent. When distributed profits are replaced by accrued profits in our definition of income, we obtain 19 per cent as our lowest estimate for the top 1 per cent share. Despite this impressive income concentration, the rich in Chile pay modest effective income tax rates. The top 1 per cent pay an average effective rate of 16 - 17 per cent when distributed profits are not adjusted for under-reporting, and less than 9 per cent when distributed profits are adjusted to national accounts. When we include corporate income tax and accrued profits in our analysis (without adjustments), the effective tax burden for the top 1 per cent is 16 per cent...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{taxation}} of <b>retained</b> <b>profits</b> is particularly distortionary {{in an economy}} with good growth prospects and poorly developed financial markets because it primarily reduces the investment of financially constrained firms, investment that has marginal product greater than the after-tax market real interest rate. Contrarily, taxes on distributed profits or capital gains primarily reduce the investment of financially unconstrained firms. Chile experienced a banking crisis over the period from 1982 to 1986 and in 1984 reduced its tax rate on <b>retained</b> <b>profits</b> from 50 percent to 10 percent. We show that, consistent with our theory, {{there was a large}} increase in aggregate investment after the reform which was entirely funded by an increase in <b>retained</b> <b>profits.</b> Further, we show that investment grew by more in industries that depend more on external financing, according to the Rajan and Zingales (1998) measure. Finally, we present some weak evidence from comparisons of investment rates across firms for several different measures of their likelihood of being financially constrained. ...|$|R

Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the Chilean economy since the mid- 1980 s has been extraordinary: Chile’s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 4. 5 percent {{per year in the}} decade following 1983. While not as impressive as the growth miracles of the Asian developing economies in the postwar period, Chile’s strong economic performance is unique among the developing economies in the Western Hemisphere. An important component of Chile’s impressive growth was a saving and investment boom on the order of 10 percent of GDP. In this paper, we present evidence that a main cause of this investment and growth boom was a corporate tax reform that cut the tax rate on <b>retained</b> <b>profits</b> from nearly 50 percent to 10 percent over the period 1984 – 86. This reform could have large effects. When firms face credit constraints, taxation of <b>retained</b> <b>profits</b> is more distortionary than taxation of dividends or household capital gains. By definition, the return to the marginal investment of a constrained firm is (weakly) greater than the after-tax real interest rate. Taxation of <b>retained</b> <b>profits</b> reduces precisely this potentially highly productive investment, since it draws down internal funds and therefore lowers the invest-Hsieh is with the University of California at Berkeley; Parker is with Northwestern University...|$|R
