40|$|Since {{the second}} half of last century, traffic {{congestion}} on road network has become a predominant phenomenon due to the rapid increases in transport demand and number of vehicles. It starts to become clear until later that century traffic congestion cannot be solved single-handedly by expansions of road network. During peak hours, besides recurrent congestion caused by insatiable demand, non-recurrent congestion caused by incidents, adverse weather conditions and work zones, are becoming more problematic with their temporary disturbances causing traffic breakdowns. Developments and deployments of traffic control strategies come into effect to solve recurrent and non-recurrent congestions with a synthesis combining technologies, traffic theories, mathematics and kinematics. Although ITS control measures are relatively new, they transform into the backbones of a prevailing type of traffic management, Dynamic Traffic Management. When coordination and integration between DTM control measures is introduced as the advanced approach to restore the utilization of road network, great hope is placed on Coordinated Network Management to improve the effectiveness of traffic management. The Field Test Integrated Traffic Management Amsterdam aims at investigating the effect and the control concept of coordinated network wide traffic management for the implementation in 2013. The graduation project is to develop an assessment methodology framework for modelling and ex-ante evaluation of CNM. This methodology is applied to the kidney shaped network of southern Amsterdam region in order to perform ex-ante evaluation on realizing and testing dynamic coordinated network management. Evaluations and validations of the above modelling are presented to show the effect of individual DTM and coordinated DTM, also known as CNM, under recurrent and non-recurrent congestions. A test solution towards advanced deployment strategies and methodologies based on an incident-induced empirical case is contrived later using Matlab. Simulation results are also presented in order to assess this test solution and the effect of CNM under its coordination strategies and methodologies. Finally, findings, conclusions, recommendations and future directions are drawn to bring the thesis project to completion. Hopefully, this thesis work could be referred to for the future implementation of CNM in the <b>PPA</b> <b>project</b> and it could be informative to other CNM related researches.

30|$|In {{line with}} such considerations, the next {{utility-scale}} solar PV tender coming from Dubai {{will be for}} 200  MW of concentrated solar power (CSP) with 12  h of thermal energy storage to be operational by 2021. DEWA has announced an expected <b>PPA</b> for this <b>project</b> of approximately USD $ 0.08  per kWh [91]. While this PPA target is substantially lower than the USD $ 0.119  per kWh to USD $ 0.182  per kWh range seen in 2016 for CSP with storage 3 [90], it {{is much higher than}} the recent utility-scale solar PV PPAs. The reason for DEWA committing to this more expensive technology is that the energy storage provided will be essential to achieving the system level balancing that will be necessary for intermittent solar PV {{to play a major role}} in the Dubai’s plan is to have renewables providing 25 % of its electricity by 2030 and 75 % by 2050 [88]. Prior studies have indicated the economic value of CSP with thermal energy storage in UAE and North African electricity systems when substantial amounts of renewable energy [56, 92, 93]. However, the definition of “substantial” is context dependent as supply and demand strategies can be implemented to support substantial deployment of intermittent renewables, including storage, curtailment, geographic dispersion and load shaping [94]. The key policy message then from the Dubai CSP initiative is that the relevant cost of solar for locations in which renewable energy deployment will be substantial is not individual <b>project</b> <b>PPAs</b> but rather overall system costs. This reinforces the essential need for strategic and operational planning that allows policymakers to truly understand the long-term implications of their policy decisions.|$|R

40|$|With {{the pace}} of economy {{and the level of}} {{urbanization}} speedup, the vehicle possessions and usage has increased. The resulting traffic congestion has become a big problem in modern cities. Instead of new infrastructure supply, attention has been switched to a more efficient use of existing infrastructure. The fact that current road network capacity has not fully explored offers the opportunity for traffic management to play a role. Commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, a pilot project called Praktijkproef Verkeersmanagement Amsterdam (PPA) {{as one of the most}} ambitious traffic management projects has finished its concept proof and ex-ante evaluation phase. In the project, a hieratical multi-level control approach is proposed for the metropolis of Amsterdam with various measures from local upgrades to network integrated traffic management. It is recognized that as more and more DTM measures are deployed, integration is needed to play full effect. Encouraging initial results have enlightened for investigation in other countries. Beijing, the capital of China, witnesses the boost economic and urban development in the past decades. At the same time, it is challenged by unprecedented traffic problems. In this study, the concept inspired by <b>PPA</b> <b>project</b> is extended to Beijing. Given the different background, the objective of the research is to investigate traffic characteristics in Beijing, conceptually design traffic management measures and schemes specific to Beijing situation, predict and evaluate the potential of traffic management in improving the traffic in Beijing. The need for traffic management can be explicated both from theoretical and policy perspective. From traffic theory, either conventional fundamental diagram or macroscopic fundamental diagram reveals the traffic property on link and network level. The underlying mechanisms indicate opportunity for the design of effective traffic management measures. And among the policy instruments, utilization weights out to be the optimal. Literature and past experience in traffic management are reviewed then on. Subsequently, the research objective is achieved by exploring to the Beijing network. Beijing has generally a distinguished grid type network with six urban ring expressways as the skeleton. Due to the recourse limitation in urban area, further road expansion is difficult. While at the same time, the considerable expansion rate of car-owner ship is expected to remain. In this case, it is anticipated that the gap between supply and demand will further grow. Next to that, the study digs into details of the network, figuring out the unique road structure and corresponding traffic flow behaviour. It is found that the urban ring expressway is very different from regular highway in structure, and so is the traffic composition on expressway. Lack of interface between expressway and urban roads as one of distinct points receives attention. The sensitive areas in the proximity of the interface: virtual on-ramp, off-ramp and weaving area is focused. Besides, other general traffic characteristics on main roads and distribution on different grade of roads are studied. Based on the findings, some traffic measures are innovated in the study tailoring to the traffic characteristics in Beijing. On a local level, static measures as simple infrastructure adjustment are recommended in accordance with local situation, and dynamic measures are further proposed in an attempt to be better reactive to the prevailing traffic dynamics. Afterwards, a four-phase integration framework is designed specific for incident situation as the first trail approach of traffic management integration. In the ensuing of this study, a case study is performed on a sub-network area in Beijing to predict and evaluate the potential of the proposed measures. It is done with the approach of simulation and modelling, DYNASMART-P 1. 4 is utilized as the main simulation tool. According to the simulation result, local measures do show effect on local level, but deteriorate the network performance. As far as the author is considered, since the difference is so minor, some influential factors should be reconsidered. Under the two-designed incident case, integration of DTM measures according to the proposed phase scheme shows obvious effect in ameliorating the influence of non-recurrent case. However, the optimal phase of integration differs according to the severance of incident, indicating the decision point of level of integration is of an important issue. With the experience from foreign countries, research investigation, and modelling results, the future of Beijing traffic management is prospected at the end. Requirements of different phases of the traffic management development are looked into for Beijing case, it is concluded that traffic management is of potential and opportunity, thus should be paid special attention to in the future development in associating with other necessary policy instruments.

40|$|The long {{lives of}} {{renewable}} energy assets complicate their economic valuation as long term projections of relevant variables such as operating performance, commodity prices, and policy are highly uncertain. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) remove much of the uncertainty by fixing the energy price and guaranteeing an off-taker for the asset’s power output. However, wind and solar assets can have useful lives and generate electricity and provide financial returns for much longer than the term of the PPA. Despite that, little rigorous thought or analysis {{has been given to}} how to value the post-PPA life of a new project and how significant that value is. Assumptions and valuation methodologies are both firm and individual-specific. The lack of clarity into what the potential post-PPA options are and how valuable they are increases the risk associated with the asset class, and poses challenges for renewable energy development generally as well as for developers, operators and investors. In general, an asset owner will have three options once its PPA expires: 1) renew the PPA; 2) continue operating the asset without a PPA; or 3) decommission the assets for scrap or to be refurbished for future use. Which course of action to take and what its value is are highly dependent on a number of variables that are difficult, if not impossible, to project decades into the future. In response, the market broadly uses four approaches: 1) use a metric like cash-on-cash returns that avoids assumptions about the long-term value of the asset; 2) assume the asset will be resigned to a PPA with similar terms and value; 3) assume it will continue operating without a <b>PPA</b> and <b>project</b> revenues by using a modeled forward price curve and some expected asset deterioration; or 4) assume the asset will be decommissioned after its PPA expires and there is no post-PPA value. This paper investigates current post-PPA valuation methods, what options exist for a PPA-expired renewable energy asset, and uses the case of a hypothetical wind farm to illustrate the use of a method for bounding the uncertainty on the post-PPA value {{at the beginning of the}} asset’s life. It finds that potential post-PPA options can significantly affect project values and internal rates of return and hence, merits further research and consideration by the market. Given the range of values demonstrated, additional research into how exposed different market participants are to this post-PPA value risk is also justified. The paper closes by establishing the similarity between the potential post-PPA options and traditional European-style long call options and suggesting that a traditional options valuation model may provide greater insight into how to value the post-PPA term of a renewable energy asset at the beginning of its useful life...|$|R
40|$|Development {{thinking}} has changed significantly in recent years. Policymakers {{have recognized the}} ability of the poor to make a valuable contribution to the analysis of poverty and are consulting them directly. This new participatory approach has resulted in a broader definition of poverty and better-informed public policies that are more responsive {{to the needs of the}} poor. By the end of the 1990 s, there was growing recognition by governments and civil society of the need to change the way national strategies to reduce poverty were developed and implemented. Previous strategies had met with little success in Latin America and Africa, and poverty was on the rebound in East Asia after the financial crisis of 1997 - 98. It had become clear that, to succeed, poverty reduction programs needed to be developed by the countries themselves—rather than imposed from the outside—and that the input of the poor was critical to the development of effective poverty reduction strategies. In September 1999, the World Bank and the IMF agreed to major changes in their operations to help low-income countries achieve sustainable poverty reduction. Henceforth, programs supported by the two institutions will be based on government-driven poverty reduction strategies (PRSs) developed in consultation with civil society and summarized in poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs). In formulating poverty reduction strategies, policymakers have begun consulting the poor directly through participatory poverty assessments (PPAs), a methodology developed during the 1990 s by governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), academic institutions, and donors. Although many methods have long existed for consulting the poor on the development of <b>projects,</b> <b>PPAs</b> are different in that their findings are intended to be used in national policymaking. To date, more than 50 countries have undertaken PPAs with assistance from the World Bank; an equal number of PPAs have been conducted by other agencies, including the United Nations Development Program, bilaterals, and NGOs.

The desire to demonstrate utility repowering with a two-stage, pressurized, oxygen-blown, entrained-flow, integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) system prompted Destec Energy, Inc., and PSI Energy, Inc., to form a joint venture and submit a proposal for this project. In July 1992, the Wabash River Coal Gasification Repowering Project Joint Venture (WRCGRPJV, the Participant) entered into a cooperative agreement with DOE to conduct this project. The project was sited at PSI Energy's Wabash River Generating Station, located in West Terre Haute, Indiana. The purpose of this CCT project was to demonstrate IGCC repowering using a Destec gasifier and to assess long-term reliability, availability, and maintainability of the system at a fully commercial scale.

The company manufactures concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) products designed for installation in sunny and dry climates. CPV products convert sunlight into electrical energy {{in the same way}} that conventional solar photovoltaic technology does, except that they use optics to focus the solar radiation before the light is absorbed by solar cells. According to a comparative study of energy production of solar technologies, CPV systems require no water for energy production and produce more energy per megawatt (MW) installed than traditional PV systems. Amonix has nearly 70 Megawatts(DC) of CPV solar power systems deployed globally, including Southwestern U.S. [...] and Spain. In May 2012, the Alamosa Solar Generating project, owned and operated by Cogentrix Energy, began commercial operation. This is the largest CPV power plant in the world and is expected to produce enough clean renewable energy per year to power more than 6,500 homes and will avoid the emissions of over 43,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. The Alamosa Solar Generating Project is supported by a power purchase agreement (PPA), which is a long-term agreement to sell the power it will generate. Under the <b>project’s</b> <b>PPA,</b> the Public Service Company of Colorado will buy the power generated by the solar facility for the next 20 years.

40|$|This thesis {{project is}} a part of Dutch <b>project</b> PraktijkProef Amsterdam (<b>PPA),</b> in which the coordinated network traffic {{management}} in the regional area is analyzed. One of control levels in the <b>project</b> <b>PPA</b> is sub-networks, where the concept of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is applied. Unlike a conventional link fundamental diagram, an MFD relates the output and number of vehicles in a large network, and enables road operators make a real-time control more efficiently. This graduation project makes a first attempt to use MFD in the Netherlands. The study area of the <b>project</b> <b>PPA</b> is the metropolitan area of Amsterdam. Because empirical data are not available, especially on the urban roads, the simulation model is used to generate the traffic variables for deriving the MFDs. In this case, the macroscopic model RBV is firstly used. Compared to the theoretical fundamental diagram as well as the MFDs obtained based on empirical data in previous studies, the MFD derived by using the RBV model shows two special patterns. One is that the flow is always lower when congestion is dissolving than that during the onset of congestion. The other characteristic is that flows keep rising with the increasing of density and the congestion branch in a conventional fundamental diagram is missing. The two patterns are observed in all MFDs for different demand levels and sub-networks. After analyzing the principles of the RBV model, the reasons for two strange characteristics are revealed. The drop of flow between the onset and the resolving of congestion results {{from the fact that the}} locations for measuring flow and density are not corresponding in the RBV model. In terms of the missing congestion part, it is due to the assumption of the RBV model that the flow of a link is constant, which is the saturation flow, even during the congestion period. Since the critical density is not visible in the MFDs derived by RBV, they cannot be used for traffic control. Hence, the RBV model is not suited for deriving MFD. Then the microscopic model VISSIM is applied. The congestion branch is observed in the MFDs derived from VISSIM. However, the drop of flow between the onset and the resolving of congestion still exists. The further analysis reveals that the OD matrix used in this project leads to a dramatic decrease of flow when congestion is resolving. The inflow becomes very low when the density is still high on the link. Due to the same problem in RBV with respect to measurement locations, the drop is also observed in the MFDs based on the data from VISSIM. However, this defect does not affect reading the important patterns on MFD such as the critical density and the maximum flow. So the VISSIM is proven a feasible model to derive MFD. Afterwards, two DTM measures, ramp metering and extra lane, are implemented in the VISSIM model. The MFDs in the different networks are derived for each scenario. When ramp metering is applied, the MFD of the whole network almost remains same. But the large decrease of the maximum density is seen in the MFD of the motorways. By contrast, the maximum density on the urban roads increases, implying a worse traffic situation in the urban network after using ramp metering systems. In terms of extra lanes, they are implemented on the different road sections with two speed limits. The simulation results show that only when the A 10 west is expanded, the MFDs of the study area experience significant changes. The maximum density decreases greatly and the congestion part disappears from the MFDs. The scenario with a lower speed limit seems a bit better due to a slight smaller maximum density. In addition, this project also investigates the possibility of using the MFD as an evaluation method. A multi-criteria analysis is made to compare the MFD and the conventional method, in which the traffic situation is revealed by travel time and travel speed. By assessing the MFD and the conventional method against the criteria of accuracy, visualization, feasibility and costs, the MFD performs worse than the conventional method, from the viewpoints of two stakeholders in this case, Rijkswaterstaat and the city of Amsterdam. However, using the MFD to evaluate the effects of DTM measures is still possible on the motorways because the traffic data are easily collected. The combination of the MFD and the conventional method will also improve the reliability of the evaluation results. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|At 5 : 30 am, Moussa Ong´ayo, an {{extension}} worker in Kakamega, is already {{excited by the}} prospect of his first wireless video conference in one of his villages. He activates his personal portable assistant (PPA), and tells it to download his mailbox and display the new messages on the flat screen above his breakfast table. Later, over a cup of tea, he reads his mail and dictates responses, which his PPA records, processes and automatically dispatches by email or text message. Then he calls up today´s weather map and asks his PPA to download and overlay on it satellite images showing the crops currently being grown in the district. He studies the composite image with interest, and makes some mental notes on what to tell the farmers at the meeting planned for today. Suddenly, a locust alert from the national IPM centre pops up on the screen. He dictates a message to a colleague at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute in Limuru, an expert in the field of indigenous practices, to ask for advice on how to protect crops against locusts. He puts on his new multipurpose watch and looks at the time. He should hurry, this will be a busy day. His PPA displays his ´to-do´ list: one meeting with a farmers´ association, several farm visits and tasks from his support unit. When the PPA has calculated his optimal travel route, it sends text messages to inform everyone of his schedule, he collects some printed flyers (after a video show, farmers always ask for flyers to take home) and packs them in his van. He can still marvel over this vehicle - it is equipped with a public address system, a foldable video screen and a computer system with a docking station for his PPA. When he starts the engine, the computer comes to life and automatically connects to two satellite systems, WorldSpace´s Afristar for a broadband Internet connection, and the Galileo satellite navigation system. En route to his first appointment, Moussa passes one of the district´s weather monitoring boxes. His computer automatically makes contact and downloads the data recorded over the last month. A tune informs him that the data transfer was successful, so he can continue without stopping. Just before he arrives at the farm, the Galileo system warns his <b>PPA</b> to <b>project</b> onto the windscreen in front of him the farmer´s name and the purpose of his visit. He has been asked to assist Catherine Adoyo and her neighbour in solving a land dispute. After the usual greetings, he asks Catherine to call her neighbour, and together they walk to the disputed boundary. Moussa uses the Galileo receiver in his watch to determine the exact boundary. He starts up his laptop, which has a wireless connection to the equipment in the van, logs on to the computer of the land registry office in Nairobi, and downloads the cadastral information on the two farms, including a detailed map. Moussa notes that their farms are located in an area under customary law, and submits a request for any oral records relating to the two farms. He is informed there is a video, in which the respected head of the clan who died five years ago explains the rights of the two women to the disputed land. They decide to settle their dispute in accordance with the deceased man´s explanation. Using a webcam, Moussa scans their irises, and inserts these biometric signatures into an electronic form to register their agreement. His next call takes him to Joseph Wambui who has applied for a bank loan to purchase a new tractor. The bank has asked him to assess Joseph´s creditworthiness. Joseph explains his future plans and Moussa taps the details into his PPA. Later, he connects the PPA to the computer in his van and within seconds, the machine produces a business plan and an assessment of the economic feasibility of Joseph´s ambitions. Within a few seconds, the PPA gathers details of the Joseph´s business performance over the past year from the tax office database, and commodity price projections {{for the next five years}} from the Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange. Moussa emails his report and recommendation to the bank manager, and receives confirmation of receipt, and an assurance that a decision will be made within a week. Moussa is eager to be on time for his next appointment - a meeting with the leaders of the local farmers´ association. The local MP has promised to address the meeting over a video link, and will be waiting in his office in Nairobi. While Moussa installs the video conference equipment, his PPA links up with the MP´s office. ´Ladies and gentlemen, the honorable Oscar Chavangi would like to say some words to you from his office in Nairobi´. The MP´s familiar face appears on the screen. ´Fellow citizens, your extension worker Moussa has invited me to be with you today?´. The farmers gasp with surprise. Moussa beams.
