500|$|When it was {{revealed}} that the Earl and the other Noah were living in the Kamelot family as a normal humans, the author made a joke regarding the Earl was not suffering metabolic syndrome based on how much sugar he added to his coffee. Hoshino had already designed the Earl's human form before the manga began serialization. She found his [...] "tired" [...] human form as the series' main antagonist appropriate for the series' readership and one of its themes: grief. He was modelled on the Jump J-books editorial department, and her tastes were reflected in him. Although many readers considered the Earl obese, Hoshino laughingly maintained that he was not; however, his <b>plumpness</b> was important to the future plot.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What does this mean for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting <b>plumpness</b> and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Larker', a six-rowed, semi-smooth-awn malting barley, {{was first}} {{released}} in 1961. It was medium-maturity with moderate straw strength and medium height. 'Larker' was rust-resistant, but susceptible to leaf diseases and loose smut. It {{was superior to}} all other malt varieties for kernel <b>plumpness</b> {{at the time of}} release.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Dickson', a six-row, rough-awned variety, was {{released}} by NDSU in 1965. It had good straw strength and was resistant to stem rust, but susceptible to loose smut. 'Dickson' had more resistance to prevalent leaf spot diseases than 'Trophy', 'Larker', and 'Traill'. It was similar to 'Trophy' in heading date, plant height, and straw strength. It had less <b>plumpness</b> than 'Trophy' and 'Larker', but more than 'Traill' and 'Kindred'.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Conlon', a two-row barley, was {{released}} by NDSU in 1996. Test weight and yield are better than 'Bowman'. [...] Yield is equal to 'Stark'. 'Conlon' heads earlier than 'Bowman' and shows good heat tolerance by kernel <b>plumpness.</b> It is resistant to powdery mildew and net blotch, but is moderately susceptible to spot blotch. It is prone to lodging under high-yield growing conditions. It appears best adapted to western North Dakota and adjacent western states.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Nordic', a six-rowed, colorless-aleurone feed barley, was [...] {{released}} in 1971. It had rough awns and short rachilla hairs. Yield {{was similar to}} 'Dickson', but greater than 'Larker'. Kernel <b>plumpness</b> and test weight was superior to 'Dickson', but less than 'Larker'. Lodging, spot, and net blotch resistance was similar to 'Dickson', [...] but it had higher resistance to Septoria leaf blotch. It showed less leaf rust symptoms compared to other varieties at the time.|$|E
2500|$|She {{replaced}} Perri Lister, an alumna of the British dance troupe Hot Gossip, who had choreographed and/or {{danced in}} many early 1980s videos, including playing the bride in [...] "White Wedding" [...] for her boyfriend at the time, Billy Idol. Lister and Stein had worked together {{before and the}} Jacksons approved her. A few days afterwards Field told her that Jackie wanted his girlfriend, who he said was a dancer herself, {{to be in the}} video. She auditioned and Lister decided she was sufficiently talented to hire, putting her in a group of similarly-built women so her short stature and <b>plumpness</b> would be less noticeable.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} other statues experts {{believe to be}} from the early 6th century exist. [...] One (...) , in the {{collection}} of , is very similar to the Yŏn'ga Buddha in size (18.6cm Vs. 16.3cm in height) and style. [...] Small differences between the two include the roundness of the face and [...] the lack of <b>plumpness</b> of the lotus petals of the base of the Asian Art Museum image along with the more skillfully carved flame patterns and [...] shape of the mandorla. [...] No inscription was carved on the [...] back of the mandorla but the consensus of Japanese experts dates the image to a time in the 6th century earlier than that of the Yŏn'ga [...] Buddha. [...] The lack of inscription and the subtle differences in styles means that the statue has not been attributed to a specific state in the [...] Three Kingdoms period.|$|E
60|$|Mr Gambart was a cheerful, healthy, plump little man, with a plump little wife, {{and three}} plump little daughters. <b>Plumpness</b> {{was not only}} a {{characteristic}} of the Gambarts, but also of their surroundings, for the cottage in which they dwelt had a certain air of <b>plumpness</b> about it, and the spot on which it stood was a round little knob of a hill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] pursued Sir Patrick. [...] "You {{go to the}} marriage-shop, and get a wife. You {{take her}} on the understanding--let us say--that she has lovely yellow hair, that she has an {{exquisite}} complexion, that her figure is the perfection of <b>plumpness,</b> and that she is just tall enough to carry the <b>plumpness</b> off. You bring her home, and you discover that it's the old story of the sugar over again. Your wife is an adulterated article. Her lovely yellow hair is--dye. Her exquisite skin is--pearl powder. Her <b>plumpness</b> is--padding. And three inches of her height are--in the boot-maker's heels. Shut your eyes, and swallow your adulterated wife as you swallow your adulterated sugar--and, I tell you again, {{you are one of}} the few men who can try the marriage experiment with a fair chance of success." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, {{her eyes}} {{sparkling}} amid the <b>plumpness</b> of her face, while {{an expression of}} calm relief passed over the features of Mrs. Lecks.|$|E
60|$|A warm human <b>plumpness</b> {{settled down}} on his brain. His brain yielded. Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{swear to}} that," [...] Captain Ripon said, {{examining}} the portions of fowl, [...] "though the <b>plumpness</b> of the breasts, and the size, {{show that they}} are not ordinary fowls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Maria, I be," [...] {{returned}} her father, with uncommon <b>plumpness,</b> as if here now were {{something he had}} {{made up his mind}} to stand to. [...] "I been thinkin' that Lyddy's a woman grown, as you may say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am able to}} {{see just}} how each one will change, how this pretty <b>plumpness</b> will get fat, how this {{delicate}} slimness will get bony. I see how this beautiful alert face will get beakish. In other words I am troubled about the future, when I should be involved only in the ecstasy of the present. In this latest case I see excessive <b>plumpness</b> and chatter in ten years. I see myself bored to death with her within ten months. She is at her best now; in striving to win me she is like a female bird, her plumage is at its best; she will grow dowdy when the incentive is gone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now make haste,' said Mr. Wardle; for the fat boy {{was hanging}} fondly over a capon, which he seemed wholly unable to part with. The boy sighed deeply, and, bestowing an ardent gaze upon its <b>plumpness,</b> unwillingly {{consigned}} {{it to his}} master.|$|E
60|$|Was he not a goodly round {{sight to}} behold? Round all over; round of eye and of head; {{and like the}} jolly round Earth, roundest and biggest about the Equator. A girdle of red was his Equinoctial Line, giving a {{compactness}} to his <b>plumpness.</b>|$|E
60|$|Poor little Retty, {{though by}} far the lightest weight, was the most {{troublesome}} of Clare's burdens. Marian had been {{like a sack of}} meal, a dead weight of <b>plumpness</b> under which he has literally staggered. Izz had ridden sensibly and calmly. Retty was a bunch of hysterics.|$|E
6000|$|EKE, addition. [...] EMBONPOINT, <b>plumpness.</b> [...] EN CROUPE, riding {{behind one}} another. [...] ET PER CONTRA, {{and on the}} other side. [...] EVITE, avoid. [...] EX COMITATE, out of courtesy. [...] EX MISERICORDIA, out of pity. [...] EXCEPTIO FIRMAT REGULAM, the {{exception}} proves the rule. [...] EXOTIC, of foreign origin.|$|E
60|$|An {{excavation}} {{about five}} feet square, dug down to the bed-rock and lined on the sides with tarred canvas, was revealed, while in it, packed {{with a view to}} economy of space, were a large number of small, black bags full to <b>plumpness</b> of something which bulged here and there like metal.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Himes was of {{moderate}} height, pleasant countenance, and a figure inclined to <b>plumpness.</b> Her dark hair, {{in which there}} was not a line of gray, was brushed down smoothly on each side of her face, and her dress, while plain, was extremely neat. In fact, everything in the house and on the place was extremely neat, except Asaph.|$|E
6000|$|I first {{knew her}} as the Queen of the Pirate Isle. To {{the best of my}} {{recollection}} she had no reasonable right to that title. She was only nine years old, inclined to <b>plumpness</b> and good humor, deprecated violence, and had never been to sea. Need it be added that she did NOT live in an island and that her name was Polly? ...|$|E
60|$|The Countess {{stepped into}} the room in silence, threw herself on a chair, and crossed her legs. In her lace and velvet, with a good display of smooth black {{stocking}} and of snowy petticoat, and with the refined profile of her face and slender <b>plumpness</b> of her body, she showed in singular contrast to the big, black, intellectual satyr by the fire.|$|E
6000|$|Her sweet smile, and {{her then}} majestic figure, [...] Her <b>plumpness,</b> her {{imperial}} condescension, [...] Her preference {{of a boy}} to men much bigger [...] (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension), [...] Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour, [...] With other extras, which we need not mention,-- [...] All these, or any one of these, explain [...] Enough to make a stripling very vain.|$|E
60|$|The woman {{lay back}} upon the water-proofed pillow, and her murderous tumour lay revealed. In itself {{it was a}} pretty thing--ivory white, with a mesh of blue veins, and curving gently from jaw to chest. But the lean, yellow face and the stringy throat were in horrible {{contrast}} with the <b>plumpness</b> and sleekness of this monstrous growth. The surgeon placed a hand on each side of it and pressed it slowly backwards and forwards.|$|E
60|$|There {{was some}} anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her. She knew {{who had been}} frequenting Uppercross. But happily, either Anne was {{improved}} in <b>plumpness</b> and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion, had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin, and of hoping that {{she was to be}} blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty.|$|E
6000|$|This Quality is {{also very}} {{observable}} in Lead, Tin, Silver, Antimony, Pitch, Rosin, Bees-wax, Butter, and the like; all which, if after they be melted you suffer gently to cool, you shall find {{the parts of the}} upper Surface to subside and fall inwards, losing that <b>plumpness</b> and smoothness it had whilst in fusion. The like I have also observed in the cooling of Glass of Antimony, which does very neer approach the nature of Glass, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fat one" [...] was Felix, who {{was very}} {{sensitive}} about his <b>plumpness.</b> He was always taking exercises to make him thin, with the dismal result that he became fatter all the time. He vowed that he didn't care; but he DID care terribly, and he glowered at Mrs. MacLaren in a most undutiful fashion. He had never liked her since the day {{she had told him}} he would soon be as broad as he was long.|$|E
60|$|Miss Calthea Rose was {{a person}} of good height, {{originally}} slender, but gathering an appreciable <b>plumpness</b> {{as the years went}} on, and with good taste in dress when she chose to exert it, which on the present occasion she did. She possessed acute perceptions and a decided method of action. But whether or not the relation of her perceptions to her actions was always influenced by good judgment was a question with her neighbors. It never was, however, a question with herself.|$|E
60|$|The {{first of}} the ladies {{declared}} that she had mentioned arsenic {{as a means of}} improving the complexion in conversation with Mrs. Eustace Macallan. She had never used it herself, but she had read of the practice of eating arsenic among the Styrian peasantry for the purpose of clearing the color, and of producing a general appearance of <b>plumpness</b> and good health. She positively swore that she had related this result of her reading to the deceased lady exactly as she now related it in Court.|$|E
6000|$|That was a grand beginning, {{and they}} had many another dance before anyone would own they were tired. Even Fun See {{distinguished}} himself with Aunt Plenty, whom he greatly admired as the stoutest lady in the company; <b>plumpness</b> being considered a beauty in his country. The merry old soul professed herself immensely flattered by his admiration, and the boys declared she [...] "set her cap at him," [...] else {{he would never have}} dared to catch her under the mistletoe, and, rising on the tips of his own toes, gallantly salute her fat cheek.|$|E
60|$|Arthur Wilkinson was {{received}} {{at home with}} open arms and warm embraces. He was an only son, an only brother, the head and stay of his family; {{and of course he}} was beloved. His mother wept for joy as she saw the renewed <b>plumpness</b> of his cheeks, and declared that Egypt must indeed be a land of fatness; and his sisters surrounded him, smiling and kissing him, and asking questions, as though he were another Livingstone. This was very delightful; but a cloud was soon to come across all this sunshine.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{you don't}} half fill your lungs, {{and so you}} can wear this absurd thing without feeling it. The idea of {{cramping}} a tender little waist in a stiff band of leather and steel just when it ought to be growing," [...] said Dr. Alec, surveying the belt with great disfavour as he put the clasp forward several holes, to Rose's secret dismay, for she was proud of her slender figure, and daily rejoiced that she wasn't as stout as Luly Miller, a former schoolmate, who vainly tried to repress her <b>plumpness.</b>|$|E
60|$|Our heroine was {{conscious}} of a pleasurable palpitation as she walked with her hostess across the little entry {{to the door of}} the drawing-room, where her eyes encountered an inviting and vivacious scene. Some ten or a dozen guests, laughing and talking gayly, filled the spaces between the furniture; an upright piano was embedded in a corner, and the lady who had just executed the waltz had swung around on the stool, and was smiling up at a man who stood beside her with his hand in his pocket. She was a decided brunette, neither tall nor short, with a suggestion of <b>plumpness.</b>|$|E
60|$|The little prince {{was thus}} {{an object of}} great {{attention}} at the very commencement of his days, His mother had his portrait painted, {{and sent it to}} her mother in France. She did not, however, in the letters which accompanied the picture, though his mother, praise the beauty of her child. She said, in fact, that he was so ugly that she was ashamed of him, though his size and <b>plumpness,</b> she added, atoned for the want of beauty. And then he was so comically serious and grave in the expression of his countenance! the queen said she verily believed that he was wiser than herself.|$|E
60|$|I {{did not see}} {{him again}} for nearly a week. Then he fetched me soon after seven one evening and took me out to dinner. He was dressed in the deepest mourning, and on his bowler was a broad black band. He had even a black border to his handkerchief. His garb of woe {{suggested}} {{that he had lost}} in one catastrophe every relation he had in the world, even to cousins by marriage twice removed. His <b>plumpness</b> and his red, fat cheeks made his mourning not a little incongruous. It was cruel that his extreme unhappiness should have in it something of buffoonery.|$|E
