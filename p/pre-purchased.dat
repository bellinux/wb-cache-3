In July 2010, David Cage of Quantic Dream announced that future downloadable content would be put on indefinite hiatus due to Heavy Rain: Move Edition taking up the production time allocated to the Chronicles. Once the Move Edition development was completed, the team planned to either go back to working on the Chronicles or move on. Ultimately, the team decided to cancel the rest of the series so that they could focus on Quantic Dream's next title, Beyond: Two Souls.

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the dimensions important to consumers in the People's Republic of China associated with their <b>pre-purchase</b> evaluation of organic foods. Data was collected in China in two stages, ie two hundred valid on-line survey responses were collected {{for the purpose of}} the pilot study, and subsequently nine hundred and sixty paper-based responses were obtained from four major Chinese cities. The findings of this study revealed that Chinese consumers' purchase of organic food is influenced by the following dimensions: product-related, regulatory, and lifestyle (variety seeking and self-indulgence). Additionally the above mentioned dimensions had a direct or indirect impact on <b>pre-purchase</b> evaluation and behavioural intentions.

40|$|Studies on the <b>pre-purchase</b> {{stage of}} {{consumer}} {{decision making process}} {{have been done in}} isolation by establishing the association between selected external (marketing mix and non marketing), individual factors (demographics) and consumer decision making process. The highly competitive state coupled with numerous challenges faced by private colleges has propelled this decision to ascertain comprehensively the influences of these external and individual factors on the <b>pre-purchase</b> stage of consumer decision making process. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine consumer's perceived influence of the marketing mix strategies, non marketing factors and demographics on their <b>pre-purchase</b> process for private colleges. The importance of marketing mix, non marketing factors and demographics in influencing consumer's <b>pre-purchase</b> stage of decision making has been well supported by literature. Eight marketing mix strategies for private colleges are service product, pricing, placing, promotion, people, process, physical evidence and service performance outcome. Non marketing factors included social class, family and reference group. Four demographic factors included are gender, age, economic situation and ethnicity. <b>Pre-purchase</b> stage of consumer decision making process encompassed problem recognition, perceived risk, information search and evaluation ofchoice alternatives. The theoretical framework ofthis study treated the marketing, non marketing and demographics as independent variables and <b>pre-purchase</b> stage ofconsumer decision making process as dependent variable. The study hypothesized that there were independent relationships between marketing mix, non marketing factors, demographics and <b>pre-purchase</b> stage of consumer decision making process. It was also hypothesized that there were integrated relationships among marketing mix, non marketing factors, demographics and <b>pre-purchase</b> stage of consumer decision making process. This study expanded knowledge on the relationship between marketing mix, non marketing factors and <b>pre-purchase</b> process by relating them to demographics. The five hypotheses advanced were supported. A total of 120 multi-disciplined private colleges listed in Wencom Higher Education Guide were taken as samples for this study.

The organization also restricted post-production {{funds to}} [...] "limit [...] exposure" [...] {{in the event}} the project was not completed. Stoneman contacted a former colleague at the BBC, Nick Fraser, who had declined to help finance the film in 2001. Fraser was commissioning editor for the BBC's Storyville documentaries series. According to Stoneman, Fraser was [...] "still undecided", having been told {{by the head of}} BBC Two that [...] "we've done Chávez". Nevertheless, the BBC <b>pre-purchased</b> the film and in December 2002 received a rough cut. At the BBC's behest, the opening of the television version was made more dramatic. Fraser was unsure about the voice-over; he asked for a more [...] "opinionated" [...] narration that, according to Bartley, would [...] "get the boot in". Although the BBC did not ask outright, Bartley's impression was that the organization wanted the film to be [...] "against Chávez". Fraser later said he had asked for the filmmakers to [...] "include [...] with someone not a Chávez supporter". He also suggested that a more experienced director be employed to help edit the film. The filmmakers [...] "made a few minor concessions", but resisted major edits. ÓBriain's voice-over in the final cut was [...] "polished up but not significantly changed".|$|E

At 2:15pm, the crowds outside the stadium rushed at the barriers and forced their way in. Spectators in the lower tiers had to climb the fences to escape the crush and overflowed onto the pitch itself. Spectator Terry Hickey said later that [...] "To put it mildly, the whole thing was a bloody shambles". The crowd was officially reported as 126,047, but estimates of the actual number of fans in attendance range from 150,000 to over 300,000. [...] The FA refunded 10% of the total gate money to fans who had <b>pre-purchased</b> tickets but were unable to reach their assigned seats. [...] The roads around the stadium were blocked and the Bolton players were forced to abandon their coach a mile from the stadium and make their way through the crowds. The Times stated that at one point it seemed impossible that the match would ever be able to start, but that when King George V arrived, the mood of the crowd changed. After enthusiastically singing [...] "God Save The King", the crowd began to assist the authorities in clearing the playing area.|$|E

40|$|A {{conceptual}} model of product emotion was developed considering the <b>pre-purchase</b> context. The main proposition {{of this model}} is that affect generated in the <b>pre-purchase</b> context {{is a result of}} product evaluation using consumer-generated criteria. The process starts when a consumer becomes interested in the distinctive, integrative and interactive features of a product. A survey was conducted to determine the criteria used by consumers when buying clothes, watches, and electronic products. A total of 34 criteria were identified in the process. These 34 criteria were analyzed using cluster analysis to discover how consumers group them. The criteria were grouped as follows: personality, aesthetics, design/fitting, function, brand, durability, quality, features, material and expected life. Affect in the <b>pre-purchase</b> context was determined by conducting a field survey where consumers were asked about the emotions they experienced before purchasing. <b>Pre-purchase</b> affect is dominated by positive feelings. Only 5 emotions can be classified as negative while the rest indicate cheerfulness, enthusiasm and hopefulness.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the joint choice of <b>pre-purchase</b> and purchase shopping channels for clothing purchases, using {{data collected from}} an internet-based survey of two university towns in Nor-thern California (final Ns= 390 and 452). Descriptive analysis clearly shows dependence across these three choices: in particular, the “sticky ” combinations of {only-store <b>pre-purchase</b> + store purchase} and {only internet <b>pre-purchase</b> + internet purchase} occur substantially more often than independent choices would predict. We develop two trivariate probit (TVP) models, consisting of two binary choice equations for the <b>pre-purchase</b> channel (respectively measuring the use of store or not, {{and the use of}} internet or not) and one binary choice equation for the pur-chase channel (store or internet). One model allows prior channel purchase experience variables to enter while the other model excludes them. The results further confirm the dependency among <b>pre-purchase</b> and purchase channel choices, with all three error term correlations strongly signi-ficant. In addition to breadth and depth of experience variables and channel-specific perceptions (post-purchase satisfaction, cost savings, enjoyment, and convenience), significant explanatory variables include general shopping-related attitudes (pro-exercise, shop enjoyment, and stor...|$|R

Some <b>pre-purchase</b> touchpoints normally used by companies include web sites, word-of-mouth, direct mail, research, sponsorships, public relations and advertising. The design of each of these <b>pre-purchase</b> touchpoint interactions should not only be to mould the perceptions and expectations of the brand but to increase brand awareness and influence its relevance. And at the same time, helping potential consumers understand why this brand is better than competing brands and the value the brand delivers in satisfying their needs and wants.
