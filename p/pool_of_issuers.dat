In a securitization, a company sells a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> assets to a securitization trust, and the securitization trust finances its purchase of the assets by selling securities to the market. For example, a trust may own a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> home mortgages, and be financed by residential mortgage-backed securities.

2500|$|A {{suitably}} large {{portfolio of}} assets is [...] "pooled" [...] {{and transferred to}} a [...] "special purpose vehicle" [...] or [...] "SPV" [...] (the issuer), a tax-exempt company or trust formed for the specific purpose of funding the assets. [...] Once the assets are transferred to the issuer, there is normally no recourse to the originator. The issuer is [...] "bankruptcy remote", meaning that if the originator goes into bankruptcy, the assets <b>of</b> the <b>issuer</b> will not be distributed to the creditors of the originator. In order to achieve this, the governing documents <b>of</b> the <b>issuer</b> restrict its activities to only those necessary to complete the issuance <b>of</b> securities. Many <b>issuers</b> are typically [...] "orphaned". In the case of certain assets, such as credit card debt, where the portfolio {{is made up of}} a constantly changing <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> receivables, a trust in favor of the SPV may be declared in place of traditional transfer by assignment (see the outline of the master trust structure below).|$|R

In this paper, we explore the trade-off between reputation and fees and find that relative to monopoly, rating agencies are more prone to inflate ratings under competition, resulting in lower expected welfare. Our results suggest that more competition by itself is undesirable under the current issuer-pay model and will do little to resolve the conflict of interest problem. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how collateral is used {{to finance}} a going concern, and demonstrates with theory and evidence that there are effective limits to debt capacity {{and the kinds of}} claims that are issued to deploy that debt capacity. The theory shows that firms with (unobservably) better quality collateral optimally pledge an unused portion of that collateral to finance new investment opportunities with unsecured debt, while firms endowed with lower quality collateral use project-specific secured debt. Better quality firms must also commit to maintaining an equity cushion to separate themselves from lesser quality firms, implying lower relative leverage and greater uncommitted cash flow from operations with which to meet debt service requirements. The fundamental empirical prediction derived from our model is that a firm’s financing choice, as it relates to asset quality, reveals information about firm value. To establish this link empirically, we rely on a natural experiment from the listed-property firm industry. Housing property-firms had access to Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac secured debt financing during the peak of the 1998 Russian crisis (but not other financing options), whereas Non-Housing firms were shut out of all financing channels. Empirical evidence indicates that, consistent with our theory, better quality Housing firms migrated from the unsecured debt market into the secured debt market during a time of high equity issuance costs, thus raising the average revealed asset quality of firms in the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> secured debt <b>issuers.</b> We rely on a series of falsification tests to rule out alternative explanations for our empirical findings...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the types <b>of</b> <b>issuer</b> and the governance codes contents in the neo-institutional social theory perspective, using a global sample of over 70 national governance codes. We hypothesize that the code recommendations are influenced by the nature of isomorphic pressure to embrace new social practices, exerted by the different types <b>of</b> <b>issuer.</b> The findings show that codes issued involving multiple stakeholders’ groups and organizations into hybrid committees are more likely to: (1) include recommendations that take into account multiple political and social institutional demands; (2) adapt the mainstream agency-theory-based governance model to the national setting features. Overall, the policy-making negotiations among different stakeholders’ groups in the local institutional setting appear to be determinant in shaping the code recommendations and in improving the promotion of good governance practices among firms. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to systematically investigate {{the relationship between}} the types <b>of</b> <b>issuer</b> and the codes contents. ...|$|R
