40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{studies with}} a {{long-term}} follow-up, <b>peak</b> expiratory <b>flow</b> (PEF) <b>meters</b> {{are often used}} to assess bronchial obstruction. The question arises whether data obtained with these frequently used meters are still reliable {{after several years of}} use, and whether the old meters should be renewed after a certain period. In the present study, we tested the reliability of PEF values measured with mini-Wright PEF meters that had been used frequently for 5 yrs. The values obtained with these meters were compared with values measured with identical but new meters, in 50 patients with obstructive airways disease. Though statistically sig-nificant, there was no clinically significant difference in mean PEF measured with the old and new meters in most patients (mean difference 10. 2 L·min- 1). However, on an individual basis, the differences between old and new meters could be large (upper and lower limits of agreement (mean± 2 SD) being 63. 6 and- 43. 2 L·min- 1, respectively).

40|$|Background: Because {{the mean}} {{lifespan}} is increasing {{and the percentage}} of elderly people among the population as a whole is also increasing, the management of elderly bronchial asthma patients will be an important issue in medicine in the future. In the present study, based on questionnaires given to 3224 asthmatic patients in Niigata Prefecture, the characteristics, management and circumstances of elderly asthmatic patients were investigated. Methods: Questionnaires were completed by asthmatic patients and their physicians in participating institutions within Niigata Prefecture from September to October 1999. Patients more than 65 years of age were defined as elderly asthmatic patients and a comparison was made between these patients and younger asthmatic patients who were less than 64 years of age and were used as a control group. Results: In the classification of bronchial asthma, a greater frequency of infectious and mixed-type bronchial asthma was found in the elderly, whereas the use of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> was lower in this group. Significant differences were found for both self- evaluation of the condition of the asthma and satisfaction with daily life between the two age groups. A lower incidence of ambulance use, emergency room visits and use of inhaled steroids was observed in elderly patients, although the incidence of hospitalization and use of oral steroids was higher. The discrepancy between objective and subjective evaluation of asthma control, the incidence of the use of both inhaled and oral steroids and the low use of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> were problematic in the elderly. Conclusions: Based on sufficient consideration of the problems specifically related to elderly asthmatic patients, adequate education and careful management of asthma in this group are required, and the accumulation of these steps will result in the achievement of the guidelines final goals...|$|R

40|$|Objective This study aims {{to compare}} peak expiratory flow mea- surement by <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and {{electronic}} spirometer in healthy elementary school children. Methods This was a cross-sectional study performed in an el- ementary school near Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital (SDN Pegangsaan 01). The study {{group consisted of}} healthy children aged 6 - 12 year old. Data regarding identity and history of illness was taken in each subject. Routine physical examination was per- formed and recorded. Each subject performed lung function tests by means of electronic spirometer AS- 7 {{as well as by}} Mini-Wright <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> The subject should perform a minimum of three maneuvers for each method where only the best result was re- corded. Method comparison test to assess agreement between two methods was employed in this study. Results There were 10 males and 15 females enrolled in this study. None of the subjects currently have any respiratory symptoms and signs. This study found that the mean peak expiratory flow (PEF) by spirometer was 226. 8 ± 73. 13 L/min while by <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> was 223. 0 ± 45. 05.

A longitudinal comparison was conducted in terms of: changes in morbidity index category, inhaler technique score, knowledge score, use of inhaled steroids, use of salmeterol, method of administration of β 2 -agonist medication and frequent use of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> The number with high morbidity fell from 123 (71 · 1 %) at the initial consultation to 14 (8 · 1 %) at the 12 -month review. Those with full marks on inhaler technique rose from 28 (16 · 2 %) to 142 (82 · 1 %), and with full marks on asthma knowledge rose from 7 (4 · 0 %) to 98 (56 · 6 %). The numbers of patients using inhaled steroids and salmeterol rose from 127 (73 · 4 %) to 171 (98 · 9 %) and from 5 (2 · 9 %) to 35 (20 · 2 %), respectively. The preferred inhaler device for β 2 -bronchodilator medication changed from metered dose aerosol to dry powder.

Asthma has {{debilitating}} effects which {{impact the}} mental, physical and socio-economic {{aspects of the}} population. The Ka’u district has {{the highest number of}} adults who have asthma. The project was guided by the ACE Star Model of Knowledge Transformation complimented by community participatory approach. Literature review and synthesis revealed that community-based asthma education and asthma self-management that includes self-efficacy, an asthma action plan, journal writing, and the use of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are the most effective interventions for asthma control. The objective of the project was to determine whether community-based asthma education and self-management including: self-efficacy, an asthma action plan, journal writing, and use of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> reduces asthma exacerbations. The Ka’u Community Asthma Management Program (KCAMP) is an evidence-based practice project designed to improve the practice of management of asthma. One-on-one and group asthma educational teaching and skills training sessions were provided to participants. The program sessions were held in Naʻālehu, Hawai’i at Hui Mālama Ola Nā ‛Ōiwi, at the Hawai’i County Economic Opportunity Council Center, and in the residences of the participants. Fourteen adult residents with asthma from the Ka’u District, ages from 28 to 75 years old participated in the program. There were 64 % (n= 9) females and 36 % (n= 5) males. The racially diverse group included ten Hawaiians, three Asians, and one Caucasian. Participation in the program resulted in the increase of asthma knowledge 93 % (n= 13); ACT scores increased by 100 % (n= 14); MiniAQLQ scores increased by 93 % (n= 13); <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> measurements increased by 86 % (n= 12); FEV 1 levels increased by 64 % (n= 9); and, 71 % (n= 10) choosing asthma education as the most helpful intervention. This project increased participants’ knowledge in asthma, decreased asthma exacerbations, prevented hospitalization, provided participants confidence to manage their asthma and increased their quality of life. The key implication for practice is to promote KCAMP as a community based asthma self-management program. The barriers and challenges of the project serve as exemplars for others the incentive to create plans to overcome these obstacles.
