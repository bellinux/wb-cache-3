50|$|It is {{possible}} for a mill to influence the finish of produced stock. Carefully maintained and <b>polished</b> <b>rollers</b> can increase the smoothness and lustre of their product, and some rolling mills will follow rolling with an annealling process to give the stock a matte finish.|$|R
40|$|In {{a single}} roller {{burnishing}} process, a hardened and <b>polished</b> <b>roller</b> is penetrated against a revolving cylindrical workpiece. Rotation of tool {{is parallel to}} the axis of rotation of the workpiece. Roller burnishing process is a superior chipless finishing process. It is done on machined or ground surfaces for both external and internal surfaces. Roller burnishing is used to improve the mechanical properties of surfaces as well as their surface finish. In this experiment cylindrical Aluminum alloy (Al- 6061) workpiece has been burnished using different machining parameters [Speed, Feed, and Depth of Penetration and Number of passes. ]. The experiment was carried on lathe machine. It is observed that Depth of Penetration is the significant parameter to control the surface finish (Ra value). The AVOVA results are validated using the AHP method. Here regression model also derived and presented. At the end the confirmation tests conducted to confirm results with the actual Ra values...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{details the}} first {{assessment}} of asphalt mixes used in Ireland using the Wehner Schulze test equipment. The mixes assessed were 10 mm SMA, 14 mm SMA and hot rolled asphalt (HRA) made with PSV 62 greywacke aggregate. The Wehner Schulze was developed about 30 {{years ago in}} Germany and is currently being considered as a European Standard test method. The equipment used was located at IFSTTAR in Nantes, France. Asphalt test specimens (305 mm x 305 mm x 50 mm) were prepared using a Cooper roller compactor. 225 mm diameter cores were then extracted from the slabs for testing on the WS machine. The results found the 10 mm and 14 mm to have higher friction coefficient values compared to the hot rolled asphalt. Analysis of the data suggests that this is probably due to differing types of contact between the asphalt surface and the Wehner Schulze <b>polishing</b> <b>rollers</b> and rubber pads used for friction measurement. The investigation suggests that the tire / asphalt surface interface needs further research to help explain both the laboratory and on-site measurement of friction...|$|R

40|$|Label 7439 / 4 platesAround {{the turn}} of the 20 th century, cigars were advertised and sold mainly by the colourful, {{intricate}} labels that adorned the boxes. Intense competition encouraged manufacturers to see who could create the most beautiful, eye-catching labels. A diffrent stone was required to print each colour. It was not unusual for as many as 20 stones to be used to create a single label. The register for each printing had to be perfect. The process became known as STONE LITHOGRAPHY or CHROMOLITHOGRAPHY. Once this exacting printing process was completed, the labels were then gilded with hand-applied gold leaf. Finally, the labels were embossed using huge 30 -ton presses. According to Joe Davidson, the eminent American art dealer and collector, the "Golden Era" of cigar labels is associated with the introduction of gilding and embossing in the 1890 's up to the late 1920 's when the less attractive full-colour or photo-mechanical labels began to appear. Genuine gold leaf was used primarily by German and Cuban printers and "bronzing" in which bronze powder was mixed with lacquer or sizing, applied like ink, then burnished with brushes or <b>polished</b> <b>rollers</b> to make them gleam like gold. These particular labels were produced by the German factory, Gerhard Meinesz in Bentheim, near the Dutch border, and closed in 1932. The labels were used during the 1920 's. These spectacular lithographs lithographs wound up lying unused and undiscovered for generations. Because they were printed on special long-fibre, acid-free rage paper, these old labels retained their original brilliant colours. Consequently, they are available in very limited quantities.

Two cigar factories, Samuel I. Davis & Co. at 900 N. Howard Avenue and Y Pendas & Alvarez at 2400 N. Albany Street, differ from their counterparts in their more classical detailing. The two factories are nearly identical with pilasters to divide the bays of the upper levels. An offset side octagonal tower which housed the water tank that serviced the sprinkler system and also served as a clock tower, reportedly was never finished. The two are the most architecturally distinguished industrial structures in West Tampa.

40|$|Burnishing is {{a surface}} {{modification}} process, which involves plastic deformation {{of the material}} at {{the surface of the}} component due to the application a highly <b>polished</b> and hard <b>roller,</b> under pressure. This results in the improvement of the surface finish of the component and induces residual compressive stresses {{on the surface of the}} component. The present work deals with the optimization of the burnishing force for the best surface finish, at constant speed and feed, for Aluminium and Mild steel workpieces. A 3 dimensional finite element model is proposed for the simulation of the burnishing process, and the analysis is carried out at the optimum force determined experimentally. The induced compressive stress in the components is determined from the finite element analysis and this value is then compared with the results obtained from X-ray diffraction technique. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|Moire is {{produced}} from two distinctly different methods of finishing. Calendering produces the true moire, known as [...] "moire antique" [...] and [...] "moire Anglaise," [...] {{which is a}} purely physical phenomenon. In calendering, the fabric is folded lengthwise in half with the face side inward, and with the two selvedges running together side by side. To produce moire, ribbed rollers are used, and the ribs produce the watermark effect. The <b>rollers</b> <b>polish</b> the surface and make the fabric smoother and more lustrous. High temperatures and pressure are used as well, and the fabric is often damped before being run through the rollers. The end result is a peculiar luster resulting from the divergent reflection of the light rays on the material, a divergence brought about by compressing and flattening the warp and filling threads in places, thereby forming a surface which reflects light differently. The weft threads also are moved slightly.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to enhance the {{mechanical}} properties and microhardness of the surface of O 1 steel using the roller burnishing process. In manufacturing processes, surfaces and their properties are as important as the bulk properties of the materials. Surface treatment is an important aspect of all manufacturing processes. It has been used to impart certain physical and mechanical properties, such as appearance, corrosion, friction, wear and fatigue resistance. Widely used methods of finishing treatment that create necessary parts with the given roughness usually do not provide optimum quality of the surface. Therefore, methods of Surface Plastic Deformation (SPD) are used. One of the most effective representatives is the roller burnishing. This can simply achieved by pressing a hard and highly <b>polished</b> ball or <b>roller</b> against the surface of metallic work pieces. In this paper the effect of diamond pressing process with a different pressing force (105, 140, 175, 210) N was studied and the results of the experiments are presented. The major findings of this study are; the true stress of material has been increased of about 150 MPa, the surface quality has been enhanced by 12. 5 %, finally the U. T. S. has been increased by 166 MPa...|$|R
2500|$|... (3) In machine {{engraving}} {{the pattern}} is impressed in the roller by a small cylindrical mill on which {{the pattern is}} in relief. It is an indirect process and requires the utmost care at every stage. The pattern or design is first altered in size to repeat evenly round the roller. One repeat of this pattern is then engraved by hand on a small highly <b>polished</b> soft steel <b>roller,</b> usually about 3 in. long and 1/2 in. to 3 in. in diameter; the size varies according {{to the size of}} the repeat with which it must be identical. It is then repolished, painted with a chalky mixture to prevent its surface oxidizing and exposed to a red-heat in a box filled with chalk and charcoal; then it is plunged in cold water to harden it and finally tempered to the proper degree of toughness. In this state it forms the die from which the mill is made. To produce the actual mill with the design in relief a softened steel cylinder is screwed tightly against the hardened die and the two are rotated under constantly increasing pressure until the softened cylinder or mill has received an exact replica in relief of the engraved pattern. The mill in turn is then hardened and tempered, when it is ready for use. In size it may be either exactly like the die or its circumferential measurement may be any multiple of that of the latter according to circumstances.|$|R
