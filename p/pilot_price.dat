50|$|Five of {{the pilot}} {{programs}} allowed individuals to participate in carbon trading while two only allowed enterprises to do so. Transaction formats varied slightly but were all in spot markets with no carbon futures. In all pilots, enterprises needed to pay the cost of trading, which was a two-way charging scheme. In order to ensure stability in the carbon market, each <b>pilot</b> set a <b>price</b> limit based on the closing price of carbon in the previous compliance period, as well as limits on maximum allowance holdings for enterprises. Each pilot implemented varying degrees of fines for faking carbon data or withholding data. Shenzhen was the only pilot to implement a variable fine, setting it as three times the market clearing price times the excess emissions. Other pilot programs charged a flat fee. All pilots deducted the excess emissions from the next period’s allowance for the enterprise in question.|$|R
40|$|NTRODUCTION: Inadequate {{access to}} {{essential}} medicines {{is a common}} issue within developing countries. Policy response is constrained, amongst other factors, by a dearth of in-depth country level evidence. We share here i) gaps related to access to essential medicine in Pakistan; and ii) prioritization of emerging policy and research concerns. METHODS: An exploratory research was carried out using a health systems perspective and applying the WHO Framework for Equitable Access to Essential Medicine. Methods involved key informant interviews with policy makers, providers, industry, NGOs, experts and development partners, review of published and grey literature, and consultative prioritization in stakeholder 2 ̆ 7 s Roundtable. FINDINGS: A synthesis of evidence found major gaps in essential medicine access in Pakistan driven by weaknesses {{in the health care}} system as well as weak pharmaceutical regulation. 7 major policy concerns and 11 emerging research concerns were identified through consultative Roundtable. These related to weaknesses in medicine registration and quality assurance systems, unclear and counterproductive pricing policies, irrational prescribing and sub-optimal drug availability. Available research, both locally and globally, fails to target most of the identified policy concerns, tending to concentrate on irrational prescriptions. It overlooks trans-disciplinary areas of policy effectiveness surveillance, consumer behavior, operational <b>pilots</b> and <b>pricing</b> interventions review. CONCLUSION: Experience from Pakistan shows that policy concerns related to essential medicine access need integrated responses across various components of the health systems, are poorly addressed by existing evidence, and require an expanded health systems research agenda...|$|R

40|$|Value pricing {{projects}} {{implemented in}} the U. S. {{during the past decade}} have demonstrated that pricing can be politically and publicly acceptable – so far, four priced lane projects and four variably priced toll facility projects are operating without any significant public or political controversy. On operating projects, pricing keeps congestion from occurring on priced lanes, reduces congestion on toll facilities, changes travel behavior, and improves utilization of existing highway capacity. Revenues from tolls have been used to provide funding for transportation improvements. Yet, issues remain with regard to public attitudes toward projects involving tolls; equity concerns; and political acceptance. Technical issues have also stalled several projects, including high construction costs that limit self-financing capability; access to and egress from priced lanes within freeways; and difficulties with regard to enforcement of toll exemption restrictions for high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs) on priced lanes. Private sector involvement in investment and operation of priced lanes has also encountered problems.

Davidson near <b>Pilot</b> Knob, where <b>Price</b> lost more than 1000 men and invaluable time engaging a target of little real significance. Unable to continue on toward St. Louis due to heavy Union reinforcement, Price turned west toward Jefferson City. Sharp skirmishes there convinced him that the capital could not be taken either, so Price continued further west toward Kansas City and nearby Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Minor clashes ensued between Price's force and Union elements at Boonville and Glasgow, and between one of Price's brigades and Unionist militia at Sedalia. All resulted in Confederate victories. As {{he made his way}} west, Price acquired an ever-expanding wagon train loaded down with looted and captured property and materiel, as well a large herd of horses and cattle. The presence of this cavalcade increasingly limited Price's tactical options, and it ultimately became what modern U.S. Army Major Dale Davis describes in his study of Price's Raid as [...] "an albatross to his withdrawal" [...] following his defeat at Westport (see below).|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates how critical-peak pricing (CPP) affects {{households}} with different usage and income levels, {{with the goal}} of informing policy makers who are considering the implementation of CPP tariffs in the residential sector. Using a subset of data from the California Statewide <b>Pricing</b> <b>Pilot</b> of 2003 - 2004, average load change during summer events, annual percent bill change, and post-experiment satisfaction ratings are calculated across six customer segments, categorized by historical usage and income levels. Findings show that high-use customers respond significantly more in kW reduction than do low-use customers, while low-use customers save significantly more in percentage reduction of annual electricity bills than do high-use customers results that challenge the strategy of targeting only high-use customers for CPP tariffs. Across income levels, average load and bill changes were statistically indistinguishable, as were satisfaction rates results that are compatible with a strategy of full-scale implementation of CPP rates in the residential sector. Finally, the high-use customers earning less than $ 50, 000 annually were the most likely of the groups to see bill increases about 5 percent saw bill increases of 10 percent or more suggesting that any residential CPP implementation might consider targeting this customer group for increased energy efficiency efforts...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to characterize the manual and automated response of residential customers to high-price "critical" events dispatched under critical peak pricing tariffs tested in the 2003 - 2004 California Statewide <b>Pricing</b> <b>Pilot.</b> The 15 -month experimental tariff gave customers a discounted two-price time-of-use rate on 430 days in exchange for 27 critical days, during which the peak period price (2 p. m. to 7 p. m.) was increased to about three times the normal time-of-use peak price. We calculated response by five-degree temperature bins as the difference between peak usage on normal and critical weekdays. Results indicated that manual response to critical periods reached - 0. 23 kW per home (- 13 percent) in hot weather (95 - 104. 9 oF), - 0. 03 kW per home (- 4 percent) in mild weather (60 - 94. 9 oF), and - 0. 07 kW per home (- 9 percent) during cold weather (50 - 59. 9 oF). Separately, we analyzed response enhanced by programmable communicating thermostats in high-use homes with air-conditioning. Between 90 oF and 94. 9 oF, the response of this group reached - 0. 56 kW per home (- 25 percent) for five-hour critical periods and - 0. 89 kW/home (- 41 percent) for two-hour critical periods...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} work {{to study}} the feasibility of extending MnPASS Express Lanes on I- 35 E between Little Canada Road and County Road 96 in the northeastern part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area. During peak rush hour periods, MnPASS Express Lanes provide a congestion-free option to transit vehicles, carpools and motorcycles, as well as single-occupant vehicles for a fee. The work was funded by a Value <b>Pricing</b> <b>Pilot</b> Program grant from the Federal Highway Administration. This was a pre-implementation planning study designed to develop and evaluate conceptual alternatives for extending MnPASS Express Lanes between Little Canada Road and County Road 96 on I- 35 E and to identify and evaluate methods for improving bus transit and carpool use in the MnPASS lanes on I- 35 E. The study sought to explore and analyze a number of scenarios to provide {{a higher level of}} service for all I- 35 E corridor users: those using the general purpose traffic lanes, those using the MnPASS Express Lanes, and those using transit. The goal for the project was to achieve greater efficiency in the corridor through better use of existing infrastructure and to optimize highway system performance and customer service through supportive land-use planning for transit and bike/pedestrian traffic. The study engaged community stakeholders and corridor users to analyze the design, operations, benefits, costs, and public acceptability of each conceptual alternative. The study also engaged community stakeholders in identifying and evaluating additional transit enhancements that could increase transit and carpool use in the I- 35 E MnPASS Express Lanes.

40|$|In 2007, the Connecticut General Assembly passed Public Act No. 07 - 242, An Act Concerning Electricity and Energy Efficiency, {{requiring}} electric distribution {{companies to}} offer voluntary {{critical peak pricing}} or real-time pricing to all customer classes. In 2008, Connecticut Light & Power implemented Variable Peak Pricing (VPP), a rate option that allows time-of-use rate customers to purchase on-peak electricity at daily-varying prices linked to the clearing of New England’s day-ahead wholesale electricity market. This study uses regression analysis to estimate the hourly price elasticity of demand for electricity of the 24 residential VPP customers. Using average hourly load data from 2008 to 2011, hourly electricity demand is modeled {{as a function of}} price, temperature, relative humidity, and hourly, weekday and household effects. A modified difference in differences estimation technique is also employed to in an attempt to make causal inference about the “treatment effect” of variable on-peak prices using a larger control group of residential time-of-use rate customers. The fully-specified demand models for the VPP subset indicate that consumers increase their hourly demand when prices increase; in contrast, the difference in differences technique produces a small but statistically significant hourly price elasticity of demand of - 0. 1. In other words, a 10 % increase in hourly price results in an approximately 1 % reduction in hourly consumption. This estimate compares favorably with the larger control group, with an estimated price elasticity of demand between -. 05 and - 0. 1. Low observed price elasticities of demand comport with previous research on dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>pilots</b> indicating that large on- and off-peak price differentials are necessary to encourage load shifting. Causal inference is rendered difficult by the non-experimental nature of this study and the small number of VPP customers. To the extent that the estimates are biased, the results are not generalizable to the residential customer class as a whole, given the voluntary nature of the program...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I explore {{two aspects}} of the economics of energy. The first focuses on consumer behavior, while the second focuses on market structure and firm behavior. In the first chapter, I demonstrate evidence of loss aversion {{in the behavior of}} households on two critical peak pricing experimental tariffs while participating in the California Statewide <b>Pricing</b> <b>Pilot.</b> I develop a model of loss aversion over electricity expenditure from which I derive two sets of testable predictions. First, I show that when there is a higher probability that a household is in the loss domain of their value function for the bill period, the more strongly they cut back peak consumption. Second, when prices are such that households are close to the kink in their value function - and would otherwise have expenditure skewed into the loss domain - I show evidence of disproportionate clustering at the kink. In essence this means that the occurrence of critical peak days did not only result in a reduction of peak consumption on that day, but also spilled over to further reduction of peak consumption on regular peak days for several weeks thereafter. This was similarly true when temperatures were high during high priced periods. This form of demand adjustment resulted in households experiencing bill-period expenditures equal to what they would have paid on the standard non-dynamic pricing tariff at a disproportionate rate. This higher number of bill periods with equal expenditure displaced bill periods in which they otherwise would have paid more than if they were on standard pricing. In the second chapter, I explore the effects of two simultaneous changes in minimum energy efficiency and Energy Star standards for clothes washers. Adapting the Mussa and Rosen (1978) and Ronnen (1991) second-degree price discrimination model, I demonstrate that clothes washer prices and menus adjusted to the new standards in patterns consistent with a market in which firms had been price discriminating. In particular, I show evidence of discontinuous price drops at the time the standards were imposed, driven largely by mid low efficiency segments of the market. The price discrimination model predicts this result. On the other hand, under perfect competition, prices should increase for these market segments. Additionally, new models proliferated in the highest efficiency market segment following the standard changes. Finally, I show that firms appeared to use different adaptation strategies at the two instances of the standards changing...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop a mileage-based user fee (MBUF) system that incorporated air quality goals through the use of performance measurement. A framework of performance measures was developed that addresses multiple aspects of transportation which affect air quality. In {{this research}}, performance measures were selected that relate travel to the emission of air pollutants. Better performance would contribute to achievement of objectives, which would in turn contribute to achievement of air quality and energy goals. Performance measures included aspects of driver behavior and characteristics of the vehicle being driven. Average vehicle characteristics were used to determine base emission rates for five pollutant types, which were scaled to reflect characteristics on an individual?s vehicle. Driving behaviors were translated to changes in emissions based on emissions software modeling. Based on these results, base emission rates were adjusted to reflect an individual?s performance in terms of driving behaviors and vehicle type. A performance score was then determined for each pollutant type by comparing the scaled emission rates to anticipated rates across the population. These performance scores were then aggregated into a final score. To determine the actual mileage fee assessed to an individual, the resulting final performance score and system-level average score were used. An example of the performance measurement framework and pricing system was provided through a small case study. Use of transportation elasticity values was demonstrated to relate desired mileage changes to required changes in pricing. A decrease in mileage would have a direct decrease in the amount of pollutants emitted. Air quality concerns are one policy goal that {{has the potential to be}} included as an important part in any road-pricing system. While such goals are not currently given priority in mileage-based <b>pricing</b> <b>pilot</b> studies, the framework developed in this research illustrates how air quality could be included in pricing attempts in the future. With any mileage-based fee system, extensive public outreach and education would be vital to implementation, and use of a pilot program would be recommended. Mileage driven would likely decrease in response to pricing, and over time the vehicle fleet will improve as well. Consideration must be given to equity concerns, as lower-income drivers may have more difficulty changing driving patterns or purchasing better vehicles. Finally, policy-makers would have to determine the extent of data desired. Increased data would help to address air quality goals, but the benefit of improved data would have to be weighed against the cost of obtaining it...|$|R
