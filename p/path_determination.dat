40|$|Multimedia content {{adaptation}} {{allows the}} ever increasing variety of handheld {{devices such as}} Smartphones to access distributed rich media resources available on the Internet today. Path planning and determination is a fundamental problem in enhancing performance of distributed multimedia content adaptation systems. Most of the existing <b>path</b> <b>determination</b> mechanisms use static <b>path</b> <b>determination</b> criteria based solely on associating a path with a single behavior aggregate score. However, some criteria such as availability are best represented using different functionality rather than being accumulated into the aggregate score. Moreover, since selection criteria have different behavior towards the score, this principle need to be considered. In this paper, we propose a dynamic multi-criteria <b>path</b> <b>determination</b> policy that selects an optimal path to the content adaptation services that best meet the user preferences and QoS requirements. The performance of the proposed approach is studied in terms of score’s fairness and reliability under different variations. The {{results indicate that the}} proposed policy performs substantially better than the baseline policy...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems {{in the field of}} robotics is <b>path</b> <b>determination</b> and motion planning. The project described in this paper focuses on <b>path</b> <b>determination</b> in a known environment. The goal is to enable a mobile robot to successfully navigate an environment according to a specified temporal logic formula. On a high level, temporal logic formulas can effectively provide the robot with directions on where and when to go. As part of this project, a program will be developed to formulate a continuous path plan that will fulfill the temporal logic formula supplied for the robot to follow. In this project, the ActivMedia Pioneer 3 -DX robot will be used. This robot model was chosen because it is preconfigured for basic navigation. Preprogrammed with algorithms for shortest <b>path</b> <b>determination,</b> obstacle avoidance, and localization, the Pioneer 3 -DX is also capable of new navigation techniques that can be programmed in C and C++. Maps of known environments can be generated by the Pioneer 3 -DX. A graphical user interface program will utilize these maps in conjunction with user supplied directions as expressed by a temporal logic formula to construct a path plan. The path determined by the progra...|$|E

30|$|Routing {{consists}} of moving information across an internetwork {{from a source}} to a destination using a multi-hop process where at least one intermediate node is used as transit {{along the way to}} the destination. The topic of routing has been covered in computer science literature for more than two decades, but for WSN, routing is just emerging as a main concern because of the need for the deployment of relatively large-scale wireless sensor networks. There are two basic activities involved in the routing process: optimal routing <b>paths</b> <b>determination</b> using routing algorithms and packets transportation using the optimal routing paths found through the <b>paths</b> <b>determination</b> process. Routing protocols are used to implement these two processes by having the <b>paths</b> <b>determination</b> using routing algorithms and packets transportation implemented using a packet forwarding algorithm. In both fixed and wireless networks, the <b>paths</b> <b>determination</b> lead to the creation of routing tables and the packet forwarding to the creation of forwarding tables, both used to determine the next hop that packets coming from a given source to a destination will follow. While [21] proposed only an algorithmic solution to the paths selection process, our work takes the QoS problem some steps ahead by both looking at the algorithmic path finding solution and proposing an implementation model revealing how to build the sensor nodes forwarding tables.|$|R

40|$|Devices, {{standards}} and software develop rapidly, but still often independently of each other. This creates problems {{in terms of}} content suitability on various devices. Also, in mobile environment, user and system-level applications must execute subject {{to a variety of}} resource constraints. In order to deal with these constraints, content adaptation is required. In this chapter, we justify the need of distributed cross media content adaptation and the potential of utilizing Web Services as the adaptation providers. We introduce request-driven context to complement constraint-driven and utility-driven approaches. We describe the request context mapping and propose a novel <b>path’s</b> <b>determination</b> scheme for determining the optimal service proxies to facilitate the adaptation tasks. To better illustrate the disjoint portions in content passing between service proxies, two communication models were associated.

40|$|Purpose Image-guided {{radiofrequency}} ablation (RFA) is {{a broadly}} used {{minimally invasive method}} for the thermal destruction of focal liver malignancies using needle-shaped instruments. The established planning workflow is based on examination of 2 D slices and manual definition of the access path.

40|$|We study {{dephasing}} {{of electrons}} induced by a which path detector and thus verify Bohr’s complementarity principle for fermions. We utilize a double path interferometer with two slits, with one slit {{being replaced by}} a coherent quantum dot (QD).

The proposed Alive-in-Range (AR-MAC) medium access control protocol monitors delay sensitive, critical and real time data. The idea evolves as a reduction in duty cycle, precise time scheduling of active/sleep cycles of the sensors, monitoring the mobility of the sink node along-with the selection of appropriate queues and schedulers can reduce the end to end delay enhancing other performance metrics too. The algorithms effective <b>path</b> <b>determination</b> and optimum throughput <b>path</b> <b>determination</b> are proposed.
