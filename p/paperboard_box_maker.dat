Compressional modeling of <b>paperboard</b> <b>box</b> {{was done in}} ABAQUS and conditions were applied to test the feasibility of model. Box was modeled by applying crease pattern {{at the edges of}} box, stresses and elastic limits were observed and compared with the normal (without creasing) <b>paperboard</b> <b>box.</b> Then, eigenvalue analysis was performed on single panel and <b>paperboard</b> <b>box</b> to determine the critical stresses and critical forces. The simulations results were then compared with the theoretical calculations and it was perceived that the results were close enough to calculated values...|$|R

50|$|The Scottish-born Robert Gair {{invented the}} pre-cut {{cardboard}} or <b>paperboard</b> <b>box</b> in 1890 - flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came {{about as a}} result of an accident: he was a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, and one day, while he was printing an order of seed bags, a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated <b>paperboard</b> <b>boxes.</b> Applying this idea to corrugated boxboard was a straightforward development when the material became available around the turn of the twentieth century.|$|R

5000|$|The {{common storage}} box for tools, instruments, glassware, artworks, etc. is a sturdy box {{made to be}} longer-lasting and better-finished than a {{shipping}} box or crate. For instance, a box might be a rigid <b>paperboard</b> <b>box</b> instead of a corrugated box. Or {{it could be a}} wooden box with a sanded surface and mitered corners instead of a crude crate construction. A storage box {{may or may not have}} dunnage or cushions that protect the contents if the box is upended or shaken, and usually does not have hinges, latches or locks, but simply a cover. Boxwood gets its name from its superior properties for manufacturing this type of box, although those properties are equally useful when making a decorative box.|$|R

Abstract For the purpose to explore more ecologically sound alternatives as cushioning materials to protect fruits against injury during transport, {{the objective of the}} research was to evaluate the performance of coconut fiber and wood straw during the simulated transport of papayas and mangoes. Tests were carried out to simulate the transport of fruits in corrugated <b>paperboard</b> <b>boxes</b> in three different packaging systems: (1) with no cushioning, (2) with coconut fiber and (3) with wood straw. Physical and physiological behaviors of papaya and mango throughout transport and storage period were studied, and the rate of injuries, weight loss, skin color and respiration rate were quantified. The results showed that the coconut fiber was more efficient than wood straw in the prevention of pulp injuries, but not in prevention of abrasions on papaya surface. In mangoes, {{no significant differences were found}} between the two cushioning materials...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results obtained from the life cycle assessment of a <b>paperboard</b> <b>box</b> produced from virgin pulp and old corrugated box in Thailand. All materials and resources use, energy use, and emissions to environment of each processes in the life cycle were identified and analysed. In impact assessment, contributions to five environmental impact potentials were analysed i. e. global warming, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical ozone formation (smog formation), and solid waste generation. The result showed {{that the most important}} process with respect to environmental impacts was landfilling of the corrugated box after use. For energy use, drying processes in paperboard factory were the major contribution. For solid waste generation, board and box production was the major sources. A number of modifications in the product’s life cycle were analysed in order to identify more environmentally friendly solutions. Emissions from landfill could be reduced significantly by increasing recycling and implementing efficient landfill gas collection and treatment system in landfills in Thailand. Reduction of electricity consumption in factories, re-design of the container for lower weight and increased reuse reduced impacts significantly throughout the life cycle...|$|R
