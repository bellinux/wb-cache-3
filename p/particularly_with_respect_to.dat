5|$|Examples of biologically {{important}} {{fatty acids}} include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid {{is also important}} in biological systems, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E
5|$|In Basse Casamance, {{the rice}} cycle {{structures}} {{the lives of}} the population and plays a central economic and religious role. The Jola, who constitute 80 to 90% of the population of Basse Casamance, practice a unique form of rice cultivation. Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century, recorded by the first Portuguese explorers, show them to be similar to those still in use, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> flooding and transplanting. Only the varieties of rice have changed, from African rice to Asian rice, a separate species.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, forty {{prefabricated}} {{houses were}} built on adjacent {{land on a}} former holiday camp to rehouse residents {{of some of the}} most dilapidated properties. Despite winning several architectural awards and being praised by the local council, only five of the older properties were demolished. The original development along Brooklands has faced demolition, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> dilapidated properties, and vacant sites nearby have been purchased to provide new homes. New permanent residences in Brooklands are prohibited by council regulations. Tendring District Council hope that by 2026, the area will change sufficiently to be attractive for development, and to provide a self-sufficient service based economy for tourism.|$|E

25|$|In {{the study}} of perception, Gestalt psychologists {{stipulate}} that perceptions are the products of complex interactions among various stimuli.

This movement questioned existing orthodoxies, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> women, marriage, the dowry system, the caste system, and religion. One of the earliest social movements that emerged during this time was the Young Bengal movement, which espoused rationalism and atheism as the common denominators of civil conduct among upper caste educated Hindus.

25|$|Taberner House {{was built}} between 1964 and 1967, {{designed}} by architect H. Thornley, with Allan Holt and Hugh Lea as borough engineers. Although the council had needed extra space since the 1920s, {{it was only}} with the imminent creation of the London Borough of Croydon that action was taken. The building, being demolished in 2014, was in classic 1960s style, praised at the time but subsequently much derided. It has its elegant upper slab block narrowing towards both ends, a formal device which {{has been compared to}} the famous Pirelli Tower in Milan. It was named after Ernest Taberner OBE, Town Clerk from 1937 to 1963. Until September 2013, Taberner House housed most of the council's central employees and was the main location for the public to access information and services, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> housing.|$|E

500|$|Filmed in January 1967, the {{completed}} {{version of the}} episode differs from a pilot script that the Andersons submitted in August 1966, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> Captain Scarlet's biology as a replicated Mysteron intermediary. During pre-production, Patrick McGoohan was contacted as a possible guest-star, but a combination of actor availability and budget limitations precluded his casting {{as the voice of}} the President. Enthusiastically received by members of the voice cast in 1967, [...] "The Mysterons" [...] was also praised by critics such as British journalists James Rampton and Allison Pearson when it was repeated on BBC Two in 1993.

500|$|American Canadian {{linguist}} William J. Samarin noted Armstrong conflated {{tone and}} intonation {{for the most}} part; he claimed this led to [...] "exaggerated complexities" [...] in her description, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the final intonational fall in interrogatives. When Armstrong wrote her manuscript, analysis of tone was a nascent field and the complex relationship between phonemic tonemes and phonetic pitch led phoneticians to analyze languages as having large numbers of tones. In 1952, SOAS linguist Lyndon Harries {{was able to take}} Armstrong's data and analyze Kikuyu tone as only having two underlying tone levels. American linguist Mary Louise Pratt also re-analyzed Armstrong's Kikuyu data as only having two levels. Pratt also noted Armstrong did not distinguish allophonically long vowels from vowels which are phonemically long. University of Nairobi linguist Kevin C. Ford wrote that if Armstrong had not died before completing this book [...] "there is no doubt she could have expanded her range of data and probably presented some rigorous analysis, which is sadly lacking in the published work". The American phonologist Nick Clements described Armstrong's book in a 1984 paper as [...] "an extremely valuable source of information due to the comprehensiveness of its coverage and accuracy of the author's phonetic observations".|$|E
