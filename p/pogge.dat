The author begins by assessing <b>Pogge’s</b> argument so as to elucidate the leap. Subsequently, the author examines two proposals which could complete his argument; nonetheless, the author argues that both proposals are unsatisfactory. The first suggestion - the participation argument - contains two conceptual inadequacies; moreover, {{if we were to}} accept this argument, we would also be committed to accepting an unsavory implication. Taking cue from Thomas Nagel’s „rule in our name“ argument, the author develops <b>Pogge’s</b> second suggestion - the political representation argument - that promises to bridge the gap in <b>Pogge’s</b> thinking.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims to {{show that}} Thomas <b>Pogge’s</b> central contention – that citizens and governments of the affluent countries have unduly harmed the global poor through their collaboration in the imposition upon the latter an unjust global institutional scheme – remains sound despite the various criticisms his theory has provoked. In the first chapter, I will focus on elaborating and clarifying various important aspects of <b>Pogge’s</b> framework of institutional analysis: that an adequate institutional analysis must be comprehensive {{with regard to the}} objects being assessed, and it must be performed in a holistic manner. I will also critically examine and rebut the view that, {{in the absence of a}} world government, the project of global justice makes little, if any, sense. In chapter two I will focus on three main criticisms that have been made against the moral substance of <b>Pogge’s</b> conception of global justice – his human-rights-based principle of global justice and his institutional construal of negative duty. The first criticism argues that <b>Pogge’s</b> notion of negative duty is unduly inflated and blurs the distinction between institutional harm-doing and –allowing. The second argues that <b>Pogge’s</b> theory is incomplete in relation to the goal of poverty eradication and should be supplemented with the notion of positive duty. The third argues that <b>Pogge’s</b> principle is over-demanding with regard to the affluent. I will contend that each of these three criticisms is flawed: the first criticism is flawed for it fails to properly interpret <b>Pogge’s</b> principle in light of the ecumenical argumentative strategy adopted by Pogge; the second is problematic for it tends to rely upon an underestimation of the extent to which the existing global order has unjustly contributed to world poverty; and the third criticism can be defused by our adopting a temporally extended construal of <b>Pogge’s</b> notion of a “pattern-preference”. published_or_final_versionPhilosophyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Who has {{the duty}} to {{guarantee}} that basic human rights are fulfilled globally? This {{is one of the}} central questions in the current global justice debate. The answer to this question must be based on some principle of justice that distributes rights and duties in the global sphere. This paper analyses Thomas <b>Pogge’s</b> answer to this question, which does not rest on notions of charity, benevolence, or supererogatory duties, but on the negative duty not to harm the global poor. His central claim is that "we, the citizens and governments of the affluent societies, in collusion with the ruling elites of many poor countries, are harming the global poor by imposing an unjust institutional order upon them. " Although I am sympathetic to <b>Pogge’s</b> project, my discussion of it is mainly critical of his negative duty argument. Section 48. 2 discusses <b>Pogge’s</b> explanatory globalism arguing that global poverty is caused by a global institutional order, and that affluent societies, by setting up this global institutional order in an unjust way, are responsible for global poverty. Section 48. 3 describes and discusses <b>Pogge’s</b> argument that we, the citizens and governments of affluent societies, have a negative duty not to cause global poverty.

I critique <b>Pogge's</b> argument on two fronts: (1) I demonstrate that his view is problematic on his own terms, even if we accept the cost-effectiveness framework he employs. (2) I take issue with his overall approach because it generates results which can undermine the integrity of INGOs. Further, his approach mis-characterizes the nature of INGOs, and this mistake {{is at the root}} of his problematic view of INGO priority-setting. Ultimately, I argue for a conception of INGOs in which they are understood as ?organizations of principle?, in the sense that they are independent moral agents and so should be permitted a fairly wide sphere of autonomy within reasonable moral constraints...|$|R

2500|$|On January 11, 1994, General Romeo Dallaire, {{commander}} of UNAMIR, sent his [...] "Genocide Fax" [...] to UN Headquarters.

The informant, a local politician, had been ordered to register all Tutsis in Kigali with an example that they could kill up to 1,000 Tutsis in 20 minutes, leading to the extermination of the Tutsis. Dallaire requested permission {{for the protection of the}} informant and his family. Kofi Annan repeatedly forbade the operation until guidance was received from headquarters. He did so even as the genocide had started, despite having the authority for approval. His reason for not doing so was Article 2(4) of the Charter, although the intervention would have been by the UN itself, not a member state. The UNAMIR force was established by Resolution 872 on October 5, 1993 with the consent of both parties to the civil war. Thomas <b>Pogge</b> argues that UNAMIR could not have been charged with intervening because both sides requested and consented to it and it was authorized by the UN Security Council.|$|E

40|$|International {{development}} {{theorists and}} practitioners agree that human empowerment {{is a necessary}} part of good development. This agreement is encouraging because attention and resources are being directed towards the important goal of empowering the oppressed. It is problematic because the agreement is relatively superficial and masks some deep and important disagreements about the goals and means of development theory, policy, and practice. Chapters One and Two compare the dominant economic growth approach to development with the capability approach, a relatively new alternative. I determine that the capability approach offers a more complete and therefore, superior concept of empowerment. Chapter Three considers Thomas <b>Pogge’s</b> argument for the conclusion that the praise and attention the capability approach receives cannot be justified. I explain that <b>Pogge’s</b> argument is based on a misunderstanding of crucial aspects of the capability approach, including the important role of empowerment. Chapters Four and Five provide detailed consideration of the role of empowerment within both Amartya Sen’s and Martha Nussbaum’s versions of the capability approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Theories {{of global}} justice are often criticised for being {{ineffective}} or unrealisable. The {{aim of this}} interdisciplinary thesis is to examine whether this motivational criticism holds regarding Singer’s Principle and <b>Pogge’s</b> theory of global egalitarian justice. First, I will show that the effectiveness argument is unconvincing: the underlying effectiveness criterion is either incoherent or not defined, and existing effectiveness predictions are empirically unsatisfactory. Second, I will analyse whether Singer’s interactional Principle satisfies the ‘ought implies can’ (OIC) criterion, which holds that obligations must be within the capacities of individuals. Having discussed the rationale and standard of the OIC criterion, I will show that the philosophical literature does not offer a convincing empirical justification of possibility evaluations. Drawing on psychological explanations of moral heroism, I will conclude that compliance with Singer’s Principle is possible for ordinary persons, i. e. that ‘every person is a hero in waiting’. Third, turning to the feasibility of <b>Pogge’s</b> theory of global egalitarian justice, I will discuss how the standard, time-frame, weight and rationale of the feasibility criterion should be defined. Based on psychological and sociological explanations about moral behaviour, social norms and identity, I will evaluate the empirical arguments advanced in the philosophical literature. In addition, I will consider how the long-term trends of globalisation are likely to influence the role of nationality, identity and global institutions. I will conclude that <b>Pogge’s</b> theory of egalitarian global justice is conditionally feasible, i. e. {{if we assume that}} domestic egalitarian justice is feasible. This implies that nationalism will not necessarily play a dominant role during the centuries to come. Overall, possibility and feasibility evaluations remain uncertain and partly subjective. I will thus argue that a burden of proof should be established to limit the negative effects of false evaluations. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of whether there are global duties of distributive justice find an affirmative answer from those political philosophers who may be called “global egalitarians. ” One striking feature of global egalitarians is {{that they tend to}} refuse the moral significance of boundaries and lay stress on the arbitrariness of the distribution of natural resources on the earth. The idea of arbitrary distribution of natural resources also constitutes the basis for Thomas <b>Pogge’s</b> proposal of a global resource tax for redistribution of wealth and resources. He maintains that each nation should pay a proportional tax on the natural resources such as oil, coal, etc. it extracts from the earth—he also holds that the same tax might cover reuseable resources like agricultural land, water and so on, that is, basic needs of the global poor can be met by funds obtained through global resources tax for him. But <b>Pogge’s</b> proposal faces serious difficulties as it is biased against natural resource-wise rich countries while exempting some rich countries from the tax burden just because they do not have significant natural resources.
