40|$|The research-and-development project aims at gathering, systemising and {{assessing}} the entirety {{as well as}} selected points concerning the promotion of participation to EMAS {{by the use of}} incentives and awards regulations as practised in the member states of the European Union. It intends, furthermore, to make proposals for measures and regulations to improve the situation. This research centres on the impact of environment-policy or environmental-law instruments as regulating incentives and awards. The survey involves three different, interlocking methodical approaches: the jurisprudential analysis and interpretation method, secondary analysis and empirical components in the form of polls. The concepts of 'incentive' and 'reward' are used as synonyms. Binding commitments, explicitly promising advantages to organisations applying EMAS are considered to be 'incentives and awards regulations'. Incentives and rewards regulations have - in part - already {{become an integral part of}} the EMAS Regulation in domestic Federal law, mainly in the shape of the EMAS-Privilege Regulation (EMAS-PrivilegV). The interpretation of the incentive and rewards regulations in the member states reveals striking similarities: there, one concentrates mainly on environmental information, reduction of fees as well as promotional programmes as instrument categories. Compared to this, the categories of environmental obligations and official handling still experienced a clear, though weaker, preference. Planning instruments, official handling, environmental agreements and most of economic instruments are either not used, marginally used, or little used. As it turns out, the exemplary registration of the public sector, in particular, strongly needs to be upgraded. The instrument of 'official handling' still contains valuable potential for the <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>EMAS.</b> There is still plenty of room for improvement in the use of the EMAS logo, in spite of the very restrictive requirements concerning product labelling. From the results of the research-and-development project conclusions are drawn as theses. (orig.)

40|$|ABSTRACT: The cure {{kinetics}} of the blends of Low density polyethylene (LDPE) and Polydimethyl siloxane rubber (PDMS) (50 : 50 w/w) {{with different}} proportion of ethylene methyl acrylate (EMA) copolymer as an in situ compatibilizer, is studied by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and rheometry, using dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as the curing agent. EMA reacts with PDMS to form EMA grafted PDMS (EMA-g-PDMS) which acts as the compatibilizer for the blend systems. The grafting <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> is confirmed from FT-IR studies. The different kinetic parameters such as reaction enthalpy (H), activation energy (E), frequency factor (Z), and order (n) of the curing reaction are evaluated from the DSC trace. The reaction enthalpy decreases with increasing proportion <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> in the blends whereas, the activation energy for the curing reaction shows the reverse trend. The order of the curing reaction {{is found to be}} of first order. The mechanical properties (e. g., tensile strength, modulus, energy to rupture, etc.) are found to increase with increasing proportion <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> in the blends and becomes the maximum at 6 wt % <b>of</b> <b>EMA,</b> which is taken as the optimum level <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> for the blend systems. The improvement of mechanical properties of the blend vulcanizates with the EMA content in the blend is due to better dispersion of the blend constituents in presence of the compatibilizer as confirmed from scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Research on the {{dissemination}} <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> from the developing country context undertaken previously focussed on {{the roles of}} government and accountants contributing to the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>EMA.</b> By focussing on consultancy literature to identify the diverse roles undertaken by external consultants, this research aims to explore the consultants’ roles in disseminating EMA in Philippines. With the focus on sustainable development and regulators in developing countries encouraging {{the private sector to}} undertake proactive environmental practices, the benefits <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> tools and techniques in facilitating Clean Production practices is unparalleled. Given the state <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> adoption in Philippines still at an early stage, the consultant’s roles as the Knowledge Transferer informing and educating clients on the benefits <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> is crucial to its dissemination. Although there are significant measures adopted by government to encourage proactive environmental management practices within the private sector, the uptake <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> has been limited largely due to ineffective enforcement of environmental regulations and managerial over reliance on traditional accounting approaches. As will be evident from the study, consultants have been encouraged to focus on their content focussed roles informing clients about limitations of the conventional accounting approaches and put emphasis on the benefits <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> in facilitating sustainable environmental practices. The objective is to make clients appreciate EMA as an integral decision-making tool not to be treated in isolation for solely complying with regulations but {{to use it as a}} ‘tool-kit’ for sustainable decision-making. A new type of role referred to as “The Collaborator” has been identified in the context of the study. The role entails the consultant taking a proactive stance and working in partnership with local governments ‘acting as a bridge or a link’ between the government and the private sector with the objective of imparting knowledge about the ambitious goals of the regulators as well as educating the private sector about EMA tools and techniques through training programmes, presentations and provision of hard facts. Although, the use of reactive rhetorical strategies prevails, nonetheless, consultants are encouraged to use proactive rhetoric as the basis for providing justifications to convince clients to apply their recommendations...|$|R

The aim of this study was to study the potential utility of ProExC as a new marker for cervical adenocarcinoma, and to evaluate a panel of monoclonal antibodies composed of p 16, ER, PR, and vimentin, and assess their diagnostic value in distinguishing between ECA and EMA. MethodsImmunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to ProExC, p 16, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and vimentin, was performed to examine 30 cases, including 10 ECAs and 20 <b>EMAs.</b> ResultsEight out <b>of</b> 10 cases (80 %) of ECA were positive for ProExC, whereas only 2 cases <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> (10 %) were positive. The difference of ProExC expression in the two groups of malignancy was statistically significant (p= 0. 003). P 16 was positive in 8 cases (80 %) of ECAs and in 4 cases (20 %) <b>of</b> <b>EMAs.</b> Estrogen receptor was negative in all cases of ECA, while it was positive in 95 % <b>of</b> <b>EMA.</b> Progesterone receptor was positive in 2 cases (20 %) of ECA and in 16 cases (80 %) <b>of</b> <b>EMA.</b> Vimentin was positive in only one case (10 %) of ECA, and in 16 cases (80 %) <b>of</b> <b>EMA.</b> ConclusionProExC is a novel immunohistochemical marker for differentiating ECA from EMA and its inclusion in a panel of immunohistochemical markers including p 16, ER, PR, and vimentin is recommended when there is morphological and clinical doubt as to the primary site of endocervical or endometrial origin...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{focused on}} Environmental Management Accounting (EMA), {{which is a}} very important source of information, particularly for organization management decision-making, for environmental management systems (EMS) or for environmental reporting. In practice there are many obstacles for full-value implementation process <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> into practice <b>of</b> organization and its full functionality. For this reason, were identified barriers that are causing these obstacles. The result of the dissertation thesis is Model of implementation and use <b>of</b> <b>EMA,</b> which allows the identification of barriers to implementation and operation <b>of</b> the <b>EMA,</b> is helping to eliminate the barriers, streamlines the implementation <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> into the practices of the organization and ultimately creates functional EMA. Functional EMA generates, monitors and evaluates environmental indicators needed in many areas of business. Implementation model and use <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> contains following elements - barriers, pillars, functional <b>EMA</b> and benefits <b>of</b> <b>EMA.</b> These four elements of the model are connected by three processes - the process of interaction, the process of removing barriers, the process of generating, tracking and evaluating the quality environmental information. To fulfill the objectives of the dissertation thesis was carried out a study containing questionnaire survey taking place in three stages - in the chemical industry organization declaring support for the initiative Responsibility Care; in selected organizations with environmental management system certified in accordance with ISO 14001; and organizations that had environmental management system validated according to EMAS. From this study, primary data were obtained and were subject to non-hierarchical cluster analysis using K-averages. Validation of cluster analysis was performed using Meansim method (MSA). On the basis of cluster analysis were generated clusters of barriers - the external environment, process effects, human resources, administration and management.

The {{objective of}} this study was to define the pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, and efficacy in rats of small molecule antagonists of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT 2 R) for the relief of neuropathic pain. Design and Methods. Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received single intravenous (110 mg/kg) or oral (510 mg/kg) bolus doses <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> 200, EMA 300, EMA 400 or <b>EMA</b> 401 (S-enantiomer <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> 400). Blood samples were collected immediately pre-dose and at specified times over a 12 - to 24 -hour post-dosing period. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure plasma drug concentrations. Efficacy was assessed in adult male SD rats with a unilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Results. After intravenous administration in rats, mean (+/- standard error of the mean) plasma clearance for EMA 200, EMA 300, EMA 400, and EMA 401 was 9. 3, 6. 1, 0. 7, and 1. 1 L/hour/kg, respectively. After oral dosing, the dose-normalized systemic exposures <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> 400 and EMA 401 were 20 - to 30 -fold and 50 - to 60 -fold higher than that for EMA 300 and EMA 200, respectively. The oral bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> 400 and EMA 401 was similar at approximate to 30 %, whereas it was only 5. 9 % and 7. 1 % for EMA 200 and EMA 300, respectively. In CCI rats, single intraperitoneal bolus doses <b>of</b> <b>EMA</b> 200, EMA 300, and EMA 400 evoked dose-dependent pain relief. The pain relief potency rank order in CCI rats was EMA 400 >EMA 300 >EMA 200 in agreement with the dose-normalized systemic exposure rank order in SD rats. Conclusion.

5000|$|When {{trying to}} {{classify}} a language as endangered, linguists {{have to take}} into account other aspects of the language’s uses in the area it is spoken. The use of the language in the daily life <b>of</b> the <b>Emae</b> people is an important piece of information in determining Emae's level of endangerment. According to Lewis, Emae is used in most domains (2014), yet this is a very vague statement because it does not specify the domains it refers to. This information can cause skeptics to have a different point of view. One domain in which a language might be used is at a religious gathering. While use in religious ceremony can be a way to preserve a language, there is no documentation <b>of</b> the <b>Emae</b> people using their language in this type of domain. For example in one of the villages, [...] "Makata" [...] or [...] "Natanga", the title of the hymnals was in Tongoan (Capell, 1962). Tongoan is small language no longer spoken on Emae located on the island of Tongoa. The second source came from a YouTube video of a VHS recording of a small congregation <b>of</b> <b>Emae</b> people singing a gospel song. Instead <b>of</b> using <b>Emae</b> the people were singing in Bislama, one of the official languages of Vanuatu. This presents another issue with the lack <b>of</b> documentation <b>of</b> <b>Emae,</b> as there are no audio recordings of the language. There is a small elementary school located in Emae called [...] "Nofo" [...] School, but it is unlikely that the language is taught there, as it is more popular to learn one of three official languages, which are spoken in the college on Efate. The use of official languages over indigenous languages and the lack <b>of</b> documentation <b>of</b> <b>Emae</b> are contributing factors to the endangered state of the language. There isn’t any sign that Emae people have kept up with modern technology, or even radios, which would be a perfect domain to help the language spread and survive.Inter-generational transfer, or the transferring of a language to a younger generation, is also a predictor of a language's vitality. According to Lewis, the language is used by 50% of the children (2014),which is a positive sign for the language, as the children will help keep the language alive. In Capell’s book Reverend Herwell says that “The population figures for and Natanga are together now 157 (1962).” With about 400-500 speakers recorded in 2001 the total number <b>of</b> <b>Emae</b> speakers more than doubled in over forty years, which supports that children <b>of</b> <b>Emae</b> have and still are learning the language, keeping Emae alive.|$|R
