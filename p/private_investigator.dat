5|$|Quatermass and Briscoe {{determine}} {{from the}} evidence at hand that something living in outer space has entered the ship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, which {{is now in the}} process of being changed by this unknown entity.

40|$|Effectively {{regulating}} {{the conduct of}} <b>private</b> <b>investigators</b> is a difficult task. The broad scope of their activities exposes them {{to a number of}} areas of common law and various statutes. Unfortunately, the State and Territory legislation relating to the licensing of investigation and commercial agents does not come close to a comprehensive code of conduct and there is little consistency across the different jurisdictions. The licensing schemes have contributed little to the effective regulation of <b>private</b> <b>investigators,</b> largely {{due to the lack of}} effective mechanisms to enforce accountability. The piecemeal regulation also leaves <b>private</b> <b>investigators</b> uncertain as to their rights and obligations under the law and members of the public unsure as to what to do when they are aggrieved by a <b>private</b> <b>investigator's</b> conduct. This article reviews the laws relating to <b>private</b> <b>investigators,</b> including the various licensing schemes. It also considers the relationship between <b>private</b> <b>investigators,</b> their clients and the public.
