40|$|Abstract—Synchronization of {{switching}} <b>phenomena</b> can {{be observed}} in a few coupled chaotic systems. Synchronization of self-switching <b>phenomena</b> have reported by Sekiya et al. Synchronization of self-switching <b>phenomena</b> is generated when chaotic elements are asynchronized. In our past study, we have observed similar <b>phenomena</b> on coupled chaotic circuits with Nishio circuit. Although coupling topology and coupled elements are different each other, synchronization of switching <b>phenomena</b> have observed in each system. In this study, we have investigate the <b>phenomena</b> on coupled chaotic maps. This study shows that the <b>phenomena</b> {{can be observed}} in discrete and continuous system. Synchronization of self-switching <b>phenomena</b> have generality and may be observed in many natural system. I...|$|R

5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a <b>phenomenon</b> {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. This <b>phenomenon</b> is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the <b>phenomenon</b> due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E

40|$|In physics »the subject« is {{considered}} as one who is observing and experiencing a given physical <b>phenomena</b> and also observing a mind model which describes this <b>phenomena.</b> The subject has an inherent ability {{to be aware of}} material and psychological <b>phenomena</b> (scientific models created by the mind, thoughts, memories, emotions) and also to be aware of “spaces” in which these <b>phenomena</b> are taking place.

In 1954, and again in 1959, Maurice Allais reported observations of strange and unexplained movement during solar eclipses.

Similarly, in 1970, Saxl and Allen observed the sudden change in motion of a torsion pendulum; this <b>phenomenon</b> is called the Saxl effect.|$|E

5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this <b>phenomenon</b> in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the <b>phenomenon.</b> Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E

By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the <b>phenomenon</b> of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E
