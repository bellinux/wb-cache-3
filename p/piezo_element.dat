5000|$|The charge {{generated}} by the piezoelectric element in the switch is typically used to turn on an integrated semiconductor device such as a field effect transistor (FET), causing the switch assembly's output to be active, or [...] "on".

5000|$|Thus piezo {{switches}} {{produce a}} single, brief [...] "on" [...] pulse. This pulse can {{vary with the}} amount of pressure which is applied, since higher pressures generate higher voltages which take longer to dissipate. A capacitor may be used to store the charge in order to lengthen the time constant of the gate circuit and therefore the width of the pulse. With additional circuitry this pulse can be extended further or used to change the state of an output from steady [...] "Off" [...] to steady [...] "On" [...] by toggling a flip-flop.Piezo switches have some interesting advantages over their conventional mechanical counterparts. One is that there are no moving parts, just the small deformation on the front plate and the <b>piezo</b> <b>element</b> (typically a few micrometers). This means the lifetime of such a switch can be ensured to be tens of millions of operations, since there is no wear involved. Another advantage is that they may easily be completely sealed from the environment and thus made weatherproof. They are often constructed with stainless steel housings such that they are resistant to damage by vandals or heavy use.|$|E
50|$|In tapping mode, the {{cantilever}} {{is driven}} to oscillate {{up and down}} at or near its resonance frequency. This oscillation is commonly achieved with a small <b>piezo</b> <b>element</b> in the cantilever holder, but other possibilities include an AC magnetic field (with magnetic cantilevers), piezoelectric cantilevers, or periodic heating with a modulated laser beam. The amplitude of this oscillation usually varies from several nm to 200 nm. In tapping mode, the frequency and amplitude of the driving signal are kept constant, leading to a constant amplitude of the cantilever oscillation {{as long as there}} is no drift or interaction with the surface. The interaction of forces acting on the cantilever when the tip comes close to the surface, Van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, electrostatic forces, etc. cause the amplitude of the cantilever's oscillation to change (usually decrease) as the tip gets closer to the sample. This amplitude is used as the parameter that goes into the electronic servo that controls the height of the cantilever above the sample. The servo adjusts the height to maintain a set cantilever oscillation amplitude as the cantilever is scanned over the sample. A tapping AFM image is therefore produced by imaging the force of the intermittent contacts of the tip with the sample surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecules}} of some crystals and ceramics are permanently polarised: {{some parts of}} the molecule are positively charged, while other parts are negatively charged. These materials produce an electric charge when the material changes dimension {{as a result of an}} imposed external force. The charge produced is referred to as piezoelectricity. Many crystalline materials such as the natural crystals of quartz and rochelle salted together with manufactured polycrystalline ceramics such as lead titanate zirconate and barium titanate exhibit piezoelectric effects. Piezoelectric materials are used as buzzers inside pagers, ultrasonic cleaners and mobile phones, and in gas igniters. In addition, these piezoelectric sensors are able to convert pressure, force, vibration or shock into electrical energy. Being capable only of measuring active events, they are also used in flow meters, accelerometers and level detectors, as well as motor vehicles to sense changes in the transmission, fuel injection and coolant pressure. When a voltage or an applied electric field stresses a <b>piezo</b> <b>element</b> electrically, its dimensions change. This phenomenon is known as electrostriction, or the reverse piezoelectric effect. This effect enables the element to act as a translating device called an actuator. Piezoelectric materials are used in power actuators, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, and in acoustic transducers, converting electric fields into sound waves.|$|E

Also, five-string and six-string models (not generally available in acoustic cellos) allow for an extended range.

Lastly, electric cellos without a resonant body have less of a tendency for feedback than amplified acoustic cellos.|$|R

The functionality of these devices is shown using finite-element simulations, combined with measurements of their resonance frequency and actuation range. Tip deposition was done using EBID (Electron-Beam Induced Deposition) which allowed the first tunneling experiments with these high-speed STM scanners. Next, a dedicated STM design is presented that allows incorporation of a counter <b>piezo</b> <b>element,</b> which allows both force and torque compensation during STM measurements. The mechanical behaviour of the scanner as a function of scanning- and counter-piezo actuation is discussed.

40|$|Abstract The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{the design of a}} system which can drive piezo-panels. This system is called the piezo driver. The piezo-panels are used for an Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) system which is being {{developed}} to be used inside the cabin of airplanes. The piezo driver fills the gap between the calculating system, which provides the anti-noise signal, and the piezo-panel. The total ANC system is designed as one complete system. The piezo driver has to be placed on the panel and therefore the piezo driver is integrated on chip. Further the undesired electric behaviour of the piezo-panel is not allowed to affect the output signal. The piezo driver is designed to drive piezo elements in the specified range of 50 nF to 500 nF. Piezoelectric material shows hysteresis between the applied voltage and the displacement of the material. Besides this, the material also shows resonance behaviour. For low frequencies the piezoelectric material behaves like a capacitor. The material requires high driving volt-ages. Studies show that the hysteresis can be solved by applying charge control. The resonance be-haviour can be predicted {{with the use of a}} model. This model uses the mechanical and electric properties of the piezo-panel to do so. The electric impedance of the <b>piezo</b> <b>element</b> can also be simulated with the help of the model. The main function of the piezo driver is to amplify the input signal. Because of the high driv-ing voltages, dissipation is an issue. Research of several amplifier stages shows that a class-D topology will give the lowest dissipation. The class-D design is adjusted to the electric behaviour of the piezo-panel. The modulator, output filter and feedback of the amplifier design are adjusted for this purpose. The piezo driver has an analog input and output signal and therefore a PWM modulator is chosen. The reference signal for the PWM modulator is a triangle waveform because this type of waveform will give the best results concerning EMI. Research of the <b>piezo</b> <b>element</b> shows that for high frequencies the resonance behaviour is very small and can be neglected. The frequency of the triangle waveform is therefore chosen at 1 MHz to have little influence of the piezoelectric resonance. The output filter used in a class-D design is a LC low pass filter. The capacitive behaviour of the <b>piezo</b> <b>element</b> makes it possible to incorporate the piezo-panel into the filter. The choice of the inductor introduces a problem. The size of the coil is limited because of the maximum thickness of the panel. The maximum available inductor which fits on the panel is used in the filter. The bandwidth is increased by this but does not give any real problems. Feedback is applied in the piezo driver to improve the quality of the output signal, it reduces noise and distortion. A charge control circuit is implemented into the feedback to control the charge inside the piezo-patch. This reduces the hysteresis effect of the <b>piezo</b> <b>element.</b> The gain in the feedback loop is increased by a loop amplifier. Higher loop gain decreases the ef-fect of noise and distortion on the output signal. 3 The total functional design is tested and shows good results. The hysteresis and resonance behaviour of the <b>piezo</b> <b>element</b> has little influence on the functionality and output signal of the piezo driver. The piezo driver design is translated to a circuit design which can be integrated on chip. All the main functions are designed. These are; input buffer, subtractor, PWM modulator and gate driver. The sub-functions are simulated and show good results. The final piezo driver design is simulated and tested to check the design. Because of the dura-tion of the simulations not all tests have been done with the complete piezo driver design. Simulation of the piezo driver with a non-linear piezo circuit model shows that the charge control works correctly. The requirements are almost all satisfied. The minimum value in the <b>piezo</b> <b>element</b> range forms a problem for the stability of the piezo driver. To ensure stability for this situation some alterations have to be made. A total circuit design of the piezo driver has been made and simulated. The tests indicate that except for one point all requirements have been satisfied...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{stability}} of dental implants (DIs) in in vivo tests {{can be determined}} using noninvasive resonance frequency analysis technique. A low-cost piezo-based sensor has been developed for this purpose which uses a readily available two-terminal <b>piezo</b> <b>element,</b> to which a metal substrate is adhesively glued for attaching the implant. Aim: The attainment of implant stability in dynamic tests using this sensor must be standardized {{in terms of the}} major antiresonance (AR) in the impedance phase responses using sensor-DI assembly. This will be used to predetermine the dimensions of the glued metal substrate in the sensor design. Materials and Methods: Multiple sensors with varying sensor dimensions were developed. Static and dynamic impedance studies were performed on these and corresponding sensor-implant assemblies. Static tests as well as in vitro tests with the sensor-implant assembly dipped in a standardized dental plaster mixture were performed in controlled laboratory conditions. Results: The probability of acceptance of the hypothesis has been checked using binomial distribution with a significance level of 5 %. Statistically observed that for 95 % of the cases where the DI becomes stable in dental plaster, both AR phase and AR frequency (ARF) return to their corresponding static values. Furthermore, for a <b>piezo</b> <b>element,</b> whose ARF is within 6 – 6. 6 kHz, the sensor yields maximal phase when the length of the metallic strip is 2 cm.
