Using both Bank of Italy SHIW data and {{a unique set of}} surveys made on the occasion of Public Offerings (POs) of state owned companies during 1995 - 99, we test whether <b>privatizations</b> attracted new households to share investment by increasing potential investors’ knowledge of stock risk/return characteristics via accompanying advertising campaigns.

5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the <b>privatization</b> of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more <b>privatization.</b> A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E

40|$|Um {{argument}}o comum contra as privatizações de bancos oficiais é que elas elevam o spread bancário, por reduzirem a pressão competitiva sobre bancos privados. Este artigo demonstra, porém, que bancos oficiais podem inibir a competição entre bancos privados, tornando ambíguo o impacto das privatizações sobre o spread. Para avaliar esta ambigüidade, determinamos o impacto das 20 privatizações e liquidações de bancos oficiais, ocorridas entre 1996 e 2001, sobre preços de ações negociadas na BOVESPA. Identificamos que não houve perda de valor para as empresas mais endividadas e que, apesar das privatizações terem aumentado o valor de mercado de um dos maiores bancos privados brasileiro (Banco Real), os preços de outros bancos privados caíram. Esta evidência favorece à hipótese de que os bancos oficiais inibiam a competição entre os bancos privados. A common {{argument against}} <b>privatizations</b> of state-owned banks {{is that it}} leads to larger interest rates, through the riddance of competitive pressure over private banks. This paper demonstrates that state- owned banks also can prevent a high competition between private-owned banks. The impact of <b>privatizations</b> over oligopolistic credit markets is, therefore, an empirical question. In order to answer this question, we studied the 20 Brazilian banks <b>privatizations</b> {{during the second half}} of 90 `s using stock returns. We could not identify negative changes in value for the most leveraged public firms. Furthermore, while only one large Brazilian private bank (Banco Real) benefited from the <b>privatizations,</b> other private banks lost market value. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>privatizations</b> lower spreads by fostering competition in the credit markets...|$|R

25|$|Peru was reintegrated {{into the}} global {{economic}} system, and began to attract foreign investment. The sell-off of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephony, mobile telephony and Internet.

A couple of years after <b>privatization,</b> the wait was reduced to just a few days. Peru's Physical land based telephone network had a dramatic increase in telephone penetration from 2.9% in 1993 to 5.9% in 1996 and 6.2% in 2000, and a dramatic decrease in the wait for a telephone line. Average wait went from 70 months in 1993 (before <b>privatization)</b> to two months in 1996 (after <b>privatization).</b> <b>Privatization</b> also generated foreign investment in export-oriented activities such as mining and energy extraction, notably the Camisea gas project and the copper and zinc extraction projects at Antamina.|$|E
