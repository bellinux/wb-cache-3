30|$|To {{classify}} {{samples of}} the reservoir rock, drainage water–oil capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>curves</b> are usually used. Since {{the form of the}} capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>curves</b> may serve as an indication of basic parameters of a rock, such as rock permeability, homogeneity, pore radius, and rock wettability, this form can describe rock drainage under the governing mechanism. It can be generally assumed that rocks of similar capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>curves</b> exhibit the same behavior in terms of fluid flow. Therefore, to determine different types of reservoir rocks, one can draw all of the water–oil capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>curves</b> on the same plot and classify similar curves under the same class.

Note that at higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is less than that at sea level, so boiling points of liquids are reduced. At the top of Mount Everest, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.333 atm, so by using the graph, the boiling point of Diethyl ether would be approximately 7.5°C versus 34.6°C at sea level (1 atm).|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the feasibility of Doppler generation of accurate, complete right ventricular and pulmonary artery <b>pressure</b> <b>curves</b> in patients with Dopplermeasurable tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation. Background. Doppler-derived flow velocities have been used to assess right ventricular systolic pressure; pulmonary artery systolic, diastolic and mean pressures, and left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures. Instantaneous gradient across any area of discrete narrowing is accurately derived using the simplified Bernoulli equation (4 V 2). Invasive catheterization is currently the only means of generating intracardiac <b>pressure</b> <b>curves.</b> Noninvasively derived <b>pressure</b> <b>curves</b> using Doppler echocardiography would be a considerable advance in the assessment of normal and pathologic cardiac hemodynamics. Methods. Right ventricular and pulmonary artery <b>pressure</b> <b>curves</b> were generated in 18 of 22 patients with measurable tricuspid and pulmonary valve regurgitation using superimposition of Doppler-measured tricuspid and pulmonary valve blood flow velocities on an assumed right atrial pressure. Dopplermeasured right ventricular and pulmonary artery <b>pressure</b> <b>curves</b> were compared with simultaneous catheterization-measured curves. Results. Doppler-derived pulmonary artery systolic pressure (Doppler PAP) correlated with simultaneous catheter-measured pulmonary artery pressure (Cath PAP) by the equation Doppler PAP = 0. 92 (Cath PAP) + 4. 5, r = 0. 98. Other Doppler-derived pressure measurements that correlated at near identity with the catheterization-measured corresponding measurement include Doppler-derived pulmonary artery mean pressure (Doppler mean PAP) [Doppler mean PAP = 0. 85 (Cath mean PAP) + 2. 6, r = 0. 97], and Doppler-derived right ventricular pressure (Doppler RVP) [Doppler RVP = 0. 84 (Cath measured RVP) + 7. 9, r = 0. 98]. Doppler-derived pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (Doppler PAP diast) did not correspond as well in this study [Doppler PAP diast = 0. 45 (Cath PAP diast) + 6. 6, r = 0. 83]. Conclusions. Clinically usable right ventricular and pulmonary artery <b>pressure</b> <b>curves</b> can be derived by superimposing Dopplermeasured tricuspid and pulmonary valve blood flow velocities in patients with tricuspid and pulmonary valve regurgitation...|$|R
