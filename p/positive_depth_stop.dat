40|$|We {{prove that}} the conjectural depth zero local Langlands {{correspondence}} of DeBacker/Reeder agrees with the depth zero local Langlands correspondence as described by Moy, for the group GL(ℓ,F), where ℓ is prime and F is a local non-archimedean field of characteristic 0. We also prove that if one assumes a certain compatibility condition between Adler's and Howe's construction of supercuspidal representations, then the conjectural <b>positive</b> <b>depth</b> local Langlands correspondence of Reeder also agrees with the <b>positive</b> <b>depth</b> local Langlands correspondence as described by Moy, for GL(ℓ,F). Specifically, we first work out in detail the construction of DeBacker/Reeder for GL(ℓ,F), we then restate the constructions {{in the language of}} Moy, and finally {{prove that the}} correspondences agree.

The advantage of this approach is that the associated graded ring G˜ of A with respect to the Ratliff–Rush filtration has <b>positive</b> <b>depth,</b> but unfortunately G˜ is not necessarily a standard graded algebra. In this paper, we study some numerical invariants of G˜ when I is an m-primary ideal of a local Cohen–Macaulay ring and, as consequence, we prove an upper bound on the first coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of G which extends the already known bounds...|$|R

It shows a superior wear resistance within the temperature range of 22 - 120 degrees C, but the corresponding physical mechanisms are different at low and high temperatures. We introduced the concept of phase transformational shakedown to interpret the wear-resistant behavior. At room temperature, a scratch groove {{may be caused by}} repeated scratching, but its <b>depth</b> <b>stops</b> increasing after a certain number of scratching cycles once the phase transformational shakedown state has been achieved. The groove will be self-healed upon heating {{as a result of the}} shape memory effect. At 60 and 120 degrees C, however, no evident scratch groove is observed under the same load due to the pseudoelastic effect and the increase in the phase transition stress with temperature.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} the representation theory of reductive p-adic groups G, based on the Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) of Moy-Prasad quotients. Stable functionals on these quotients are used to give a new construction of supercuspidal representations of G having small <b>positive</b> <b>depth,</b> called epipelagic. With some restrictions on p, we classify the stable and semistable functionals on Moy-Prasad quotients. The latter classification determines the nondegenerate K-types for G as well as the depths of irreducible representations of G. The main step is an equivalence between Moy-Prasad theory and the theory of graded Lie algebras, whose GIT was analyzed by Vinberg and Levy. Our classification shows that stable functionals arise from Z-regular elliptic automorphisms of the absolute root system of G. These automorphisms also appear in the Langlands parameters of epipelagic representations, in accordance with the conjectural local Langlands correspondence. ...|$|R

An option on both models was the patent Allis-Chalmers PAVT rear wheels (Power Adjusted Variable Track),a system adopted by other manufacturers after patents expired.

30|$|Algorithmically, using a {{hierarchical}} depth estimation has two different effects. On the <b>positive</b> side, <b>depth</b> estimation gets more robust against spatial high-frequency noise and remaining vertical offsets due to imperfect rectification.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} Gauss-Newton-on-manifold {{approach}} for estimating the relative pose (position and orientation) between a 3 D object and its projection on a 2 D image plane from {{a set of}} point correspondences. The pose estimation problem is formulated as an optimization over three rotation parameters on {{the intersection of the}} manifold of the rotation matrices and a cone constraint on these matrices to ensure <b>positive</b> <b>depth</b> parameters. The optimization is based on Newton-type iterations and is locally quadratically convergent. A key feature of the proposed approach, not used in earlier studies, is an analytic geodesic search, alternating between gradient, Gauss-Newton and a random direction, which ensures the escape from local minima and convergence to a global minimum without the need to reinitialize the algorithm. Indeed, for a prescribed number of iterations, the proposed algorithm achieves significantly lower pose estimation errors than earlier methods and it converges to a global minimum in typically 5 – 10 iterations...|$|R
40|$|By definition, an -primary ideal I in a 2 -dimensional regular local ring (R,) is {{contracted}} if I=R ∩ IR[/x] {{for some}} x ∈∖^ 2. Contracted ideals {{have been introduced}} by Zariski and used for proving the unique factorization theorem for complete (i. e. integrally closed) ideals. Any complete ideal is contracted but {{not the other way}} round. While the associated graded rings to complete ideals are always Cohen-Macaulay, {{this is not the case}} for contracted ideals. Our goal is to study depth, Hilbert function and defining equations of the graded rings of homogeneous contracted ideals. We show, by using quadratic transform, that the depth of the associated graded ring to a contracted ideal I is determined by depth of the associated graded rings to a certain family of monomial ideals (indeed lex-segments) which are naturally attached to I. For certain classes of contracted ideals we show that the associated graded ring is Cohen-Macaulay or at least has <b>positive</b> <b>depth.</b> Comment: A few misprints have been correcte...|$|R
40|$|In the {{literature}} we find {{two classes of}} algorithms which, {{on the basis of}} two views of a scene, recover the rigid transformation between the views and subsequently the structure of the scene. The first class contains techniques which require knowledge of the correspondence or the motion field between the images and are based on the epipolar constraint. The second class contains so-called direct algorithms which require knowledge about the value of the flow in one direction only and are based on the <b>positive</b> <b>depth</b> constraint. Algorithms in the first class achieve the solution by minimizing a function representing deviation from the epipolar constraint while direct algorithms find the 3 D motion that, when used to estimate depth, produces a minimum number of negative depth values. This paper presents a stability analysis of both classes of algorithms. The formulation is such that it allows comparison of the robustness of algorithms in the two classes as well as within each class. Specifi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The image {{points in}} two images satisfy epipolar constraint.

Apart from giving the insight to epipolar geometry, among the applications are reducing the search space and ruling out impossible matches in stereo, and ruling out impossible solutions for a fundamental matrix computed from seven points. 1.
