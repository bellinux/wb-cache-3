40|$|In this paper, the {{relevance}} of political stakeholders and <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> in German multinational corporations (MNCs) is examined. The focus is on three main questions: First, which political stakeholders influence the behavior of MNCs? Second, which <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> do MNCs develop to cope with stakeholder interests? Third, how are political stakeholders and <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> influenced by situational conditions? A seemingly unrelated regression (SUREG) analysis of data collected from the largest 19 German MNCs in their home country and in their subsidiaries in China, France, India, Russia, and the US demonstrates that the influence of political stakeholders increases {{with the size of}} the MNC. Both {{the relevance}} of political stakeholders and the intensity of <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> depend on several country- and firm-specific conditions. Moreover, a strong influence due to the impact of political stakeholders on the intensity of <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> can be observed.

In 1921, President Harding appointed Taft as chief justice, an office {{he had long}} sought.

After his death the next month, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
50|$|Public {{servants}} {{can engage}} in <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> such as supporting a candidate in an election or taking leave without pay to run in an election, {{but they have to}} maintain their political impartiality as public servants.

The type and degree of <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> that a public servant {{can engage in}} depends on several factors, such as the visibility of the <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> that the public servant wants to engage in and the visibility of the public servant in their job in the public service.|$|R

5|$|Although Shishman's realm was {{nominally}} a Serbian client {{state for}} an unknown time, he retained his prior semi-independence {{and he was}} completely in charge of his lands. He maintained good relations with Bulgaria and, according to Andreev, his <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> was mainly concentrated in dealing with Bulgaria. He also retained his close ties with Nogai and his descendants. In 1301â€“1302, Shishman provided political refuge to several of Nogai's relatives, including his grandson Qara-Kesek, who fled to Vidin along with a 3,000-strong cavalry and remained there until after 1325. These Tatar nobles were fleeing from the persecution of the new khan, Toqta, who had defeated and murdered Nogai in 1299â€“1300. Contrary to Andreev's opinion, Fine believes that the death of Nogai increased Serbia's influence over Vidin.|$|E
5|$|At the 1860 convention, Payne {{denounced the}} right of secession, and during the Civil War that began the next year, he was a staunch {{supporter}} of the Union. Although {{he was not an}} abolitionist, he opposed the further extension of slavery. During the war, Payne used some of his wealth to help equip Ohio regiments. He was 50 years old when the war began, too old to volunteer himself, but two of his sons served in the Union Army with his blessing. After the war, Payne continued his <b>political</b> <b>activity,</b> leading the Ohio delegation to the 1872 Democratic National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Horace Greeley. He campaigned on Greeley's behalf, raising his own political profile in the process. In 1874, Payne ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from Ohio's 20th district, and was elected with a 2500-vote majority over the incumbent Republican, Richard C. Parsons.|$|E
5|$|Heliade began {{a career}} as a civil servant after the Postelnicie {{commissioned}} him to print the Official Bulletin, and later climbed through the official hierarchy, eventually serving as Clucer. This rise coincided with the establishment of the Regulamentul Organic regime, inaugurated, upon the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828â€“1829, by an Imperial Russian administration under Pavel Kiselyov. When Kiselyov placed an order with Heliade for the printing of official documents, including the Regulament, the writer and his family were made prosperous by the sales. Nevertheless, Heliade maintained contacts with the faction of reformist boyars: in 1833, together with Ion CÃ¢mpineanu, Iancu VÄƒcÄƒrescu, Ioan Voinescu II, Constantin Aristia, Åžtefan and Nicolae Golescu, as well as others, he founded the short-lived SoÅ£ietatea FilarmonicÄƒ (the Philharmonic Society), which advanced a cultural agenda (and was especially active in raising funds for the National Theater of Wallachia).
