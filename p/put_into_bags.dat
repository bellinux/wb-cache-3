50|$|By {{then the}} victim would usually be dead, {{at which point}} the corpse would be dragged into a bathtub and hung over it {{for a short period of}} time. This was done so that the corpse would bleed out and the {{remaining}} blood would congeal, making the following step, the dismemberment of the victim, as clean as possible. The body parts would be <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>bags,</b> boxed and then sent off to Brooklyn's Fountain Avenue Dump among other places.|$|E

During the initial stages of an early 1980s Federal/State task force targeting the DeMeo crew, a plan by authorities to excavate sections of the dump to locate remains of victims was aborted when it was deemed too costly and unlikely to locate any meaningful evidence. The landfill, opposite the Starrett City Apartment Complex on Pennsylvania avenue, across the Belt Parkway, was shut down in 1985, and capped over since, all signs (and odors) that a landfill had existed gone, replaced by a parkland.|$|E

50|$|Each man {{typically}} took a rifle or shotgun (double barrel recommended) {{and occasional}} pistol {{along with the}} necessary balls, gunpowder and primers for hunting game and protection against snakes and Indians. Many took their fishing gear along—at least lines and hooks as a usable pole could usually be cut from a willow or other bush. Belt knives or folding knives were carried by nearly all men and boys and considered essential. Farm tools such as a plow, pick, shovel, scythe, rake, hoe; plus carpentry tools—saw, hammer, nails, broad axe, mallet, plane were often carried along. Farmers typically took seeds for corn, wheat and other crops. Some even included fruit trees and vines in their loads. Awls, scissors, pins, needles, thread and leather laces to repair clothes, shoes, harnesses, equipment and occasionally people were constantly in use. Spare leather used for repairs was often needed and used. Goggles to keep dust out of eyes were used by some. Storage boxes for food and supplies were often the same height {{so they could be}} arranged to give a flat surface inside the wagon for sleeping during bad weather. If the cargo weighed too much, and it often did initially, these boxes were typically discarded and nearly everything <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of evidence dominates contemporary television crime shows. Inanimate objects and disparate facts {{are made to}} speak; technology and expert opinion wring out their stories. In examining these dead pieces of evidence, the investigators search for patterns, discovering living perpetrators and fugitives. Psychology comes in where the evidence is interpreted; the investigators try to think through perpetrators' minds and presumably perverse rationales. Objects are examined. Banal things become precious, <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>bags,</b> marked, date- and time-stamped, and stepped around carefully. After a crime, the objects involved are different. After a crime show, our gaze is different; everything is potentially incriminating, perverse. Bags without people don't make sense. Under this gaze, objects acquire a psychology. When we look at a crime scene, the evidence violates us. The work of Melbourne artist Cate Consandine is about objects and how they occupy the space that they occupy. In her practice as a sculptor and throughout her studies at the Victorian College of the Arts, the Sydney College of the Arts, and now Monash, her work has cultivated violent ambiguity. Consandine's work extends {{across a range of}} different media, particularly vidoe, objects and spaces. Like a crime show, it activates a particular type of inquisition from the viewer...|$|E
40|$|Fresh cassava roots {{deteriorate}} fast after harvesting. This {{puts them}} at a disadvantage {{when compared to other}} fresh foods that are not so perishable. This short shelf-life, lust two to three days, is the main reason why consumers have been turning away from fresh cassava. But this trend is being reversed in Colombia where farmers have found a simple method of extending its shelf-life. Several years ago scientists at the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), in Colombia, found that cassava roots did not deteriorate so quickly if they were kept in air tight bags. But this was counteracted by the rapid growth of fungi and bacteria which proliferated in the higher temperatures inside the bag. It was the roots with the fungicide thiabendazole, before they were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>bags,</b> cassava roots can be kept fresh for two weeks or more. If this technique is to be effective, the cassava roots must be treated within a few hours of harvesting. Because this is too short a time in which to transport the cassava to a central processing site, the farmers themselves, or their cooperatives, have to undertake the treatment process. They are therefore better placed to deal directly with retailers. Cutting out the wholesaler means better prices to the farmers {{despite the fact that the}} treated cassava is selling at a lower price than untreated fresh cassava. In fact many shops had refused to stock fresh cassava because it deteriorated so quickly. The new technique has changed the attitude of the shopkeepers.
