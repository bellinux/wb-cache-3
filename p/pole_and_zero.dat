50|$|The {{responses}} of linear filters are mathematically {{described in terms}} of their transfer function or, in layman's terms, frequency response. A transfer function can be decomposed as a combination of first order responses and second order responses (implemented as so-called biquad sections). These can be described according to their so-called <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>zero</b> frequencies, which are complex numbers in the case of second-order responses.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{locations}} of the poles and zeros depend on both the desired characteristics of the closed loop response and {{the characteristics of the}} system being controlled. However, the <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>zero</b> of the lag compensator should be close together so as not to cause the poles to shift right, which could cause instability or slow convergence.Since their purpose is to affect the low frequency behaviour, they should be near the origin.|$|E
50|$|Prime forms {{can be used}} to {{construct}} meromorphic functions on X with given <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros.</b> If Σniai is a divisor linearly equivalent to 0, then ΠE(x,ai)ni is a meromorphic function with given <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} identifying transfer functions from Bode plots is made. From this approach, a parameter estimation algorithm is developed. The major and novel contributions of this algorithm are: Using transfer function <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> as parameters allowing to immediately obtain the factorized form; Automatic <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> detection; <b>Poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> estimation only requiring the magnitude curve. Transport delays, if any, can be easily estimated by means of a simple least squares that uses the additional information supplied by the phase curve. The <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> estimator minimizes a quadratic criterion of the amplitude diagram error. The minimization is performed by a modified Newton Raphson method that explores the hessian structure to drive the estimates through a descendant direction. The algorithm is designed to estimate transfer functions with real or complex <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros.</b> It was developed through a long process from which resulted two other parameter estimation algorithms: one to all real <b>pole</b> plants <b>and</b> the other to models with real <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros.</b> Both are described in this dissertation [...] .

50|$|Simple {{rational}} approximation (SRA) is {{a subset}} of interpolating methods using rational functions. Especially, SRA interpolates a given function with a specific rational function whose <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> are simple, which {{means that there is}} no multiplicity in <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>zeros.</b> Sometimes, it only implies simple poles.|$|R
50|$|If {{a simple}} {{yes or no}} on the {{stability}} issue {{is all that is}} needed, the amplifier is stable if f0 dB < f180. This criterion is sufficient to predict stability only for amplifiers satisfying some restrictions on their <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>zero</b> positions (minimum phase systems). Although these restrictions usually are met, if they are not another method must be used, such as the Nyquist plot.Optimal gain and phase margins may be computed using Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theory.|$|E
50|$|Figure 4 and Figure 5 {{show how}} {{superposition}} (simple addition) of a <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>zero</b> plot is done. The Bode straight line plots again are {{compared with the}} exact plots. The zero has been moved to higher frequency than the pole to make a more interesting example. Notice in Figure 4 that the 20 dB/decade drop of the pole is arrested by the 20 dB/decade rise of the zero resulting in a horizontal magnitude plot for frequencies above the zero location. Notice in Figure 5 in the phase plot that the straight-line approximation is pretty approximate in the region where both <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>zero</b> affect the phase. Notice also in Figure 5 that the range of frequencies where the phase changes in the straight line plot is limited to frequencies a factor of ten {{above and below the}} pole (zero) location. Where the phase of the pole and the zero both are present, the straight-line phase plot is horizontal because the 45°/decade drop of the pole is arrested by the overlapping 45°/decade rise of the zero in the limited range of frequencies where both are active contributors to the phase.|$|E
