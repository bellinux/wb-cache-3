40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of <b>polycarboxylates</b> on both Cr(VI) {{reduction}} and S(IV) consumption in Cr(VI) /S(IV) system was investigated in acidic solution. Under aerobic condition, the productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS), i. e., SO 4 •− and OH•, have been confirmed in S(IV) reducing Cr(VI) process by using electron spin resonance and fluorescence spectrum techniques, leading to the excess consumption of S(IV). However, when <b>polycarboxylates</b> (oxalic, citric, malic and tartaric acid) were present in Cr(VI) /S(IV) system,the affinity of <b>polycarboxylates</b> to CrSO 6 2 − cangreatly promote the reductionof Cr(VI) via expanding the coordination of Cr(VI) species from tetrahedron to hexahedron. Besides, as alternatives to S(IV), these <b>polycarboxylates</b> can also act as electron donors for Cr(VI) reduction via intramolecular electron transfer reaction, which {{is dependent on the}} energies ofthe highest occupied molecular orbital of thesepolycarboxylates. Notably,the variant electrondonating capacity ofthesepolycarboxylates resulted in different yield of ROS and therefore the oxidation efficiencies of other pollutants, e. g., rhodamine B and As(III).

5000|$|It is {{considered}} that if [...] {{more than the}} sum of [...] and ,it is positively cooperative. If [...] is less, then it is negatively cooperative.Host-guest chemistry is not limited to receptor-lingand interactions. It is also demonstrated in ion-pairing systems. In recent years, such interactions are studied in an aqueous media utilizing synthetic organometallic hosts and organic guest molecules. For example, a poly-cationic receptor containing copper (the host) is coordinated with molecules such as tetracarboxylates, tricarballate, aspartate, and acetate (the guests). This study illustrates that entropy rather than enthalpy determines the binding energy of the system leading to negative cooperativity. The large change in entropy originates from the displacement of solvent molecules surrounding the ligand and the receptor. When multiple acetates bind to the receptor, it releases more water molecules to the environment than a tetracarboxylate. This led to a decrease in free energy implying that the system is cooperating negatively. [...] In a similar study, utilizing guanidinium and Cu(II) and <b>polycarboxylate</b> guests, it is demonstrated that positive cooperatively is largely determined by enthalpy. In addition to thermodynamic studies, host-guest chemistry also has biological applications.|$|E
