5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a <b>pinhole</b> camera).|$|E

5000|$|In many fields, however, <b>pinholes</b> are a harmful and {{unwanted}} side-effect of manufacturing processes. For example, {{in the assembly}} of microcircuits, <b>pinholes</b> in the dielectric insulator layer coating the circuit can cause the circuit to fail. Therefore, [...] "to avoid <b>pinholes</b> that might protrude through the entire thickness of the dielectric layer, {{it is a common}} practice to screen several layers of dielectric with drying and firing after each screening", thereby preventing the <b>pinholes</b> from becoming continuous.|$|R

5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a <b>pinhole</b> camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, <b>pinhole,</b> etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
5|$|Later on October1, the JTWC issued {{their first}} {{advisory}} on the storm, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 03A. Tracking towards the northeast, Onil intensified as convection consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation. Roughly 24hours after being named, the system attained its peak intensity as a severe cyclonic storm with winds of 100km/h (65mph) and a barometric pressure of 990mbar (hPa; 29.23inHg) according to the IMD with. Upon reaching this strength, the system featured a <b>pinhole</b> eye surrounded by deep convection. Additionally, Dvorak technique intensity estimates reached 3.5, indicating a high-end tropical storm. However, the JTWC stated maximum winds to be 65km/h (40mph), a low-end tropical storm. As the storm neared the Indian coastline, dry air quickly entered the circulation, causing most of the convection associated with Onil to dissipate. Located within 100km (65mi) of land, the JTWC downgraded the system to a tropical depression and the IMD downgraded Onil to a deep depression.|$|E

30|$|As the {{thickness}} increases to 1, 030 nm, rectangular-shaped outgrowths {{appear on the}} film surface. This implies a-axis grains of the GdBCO film. At the same time, both the size and number of <b>pinholes</b> become smaller (Figure  3 b). The <b>pinholes</b> disappear for samples F 1450 and F 2100 (Figure  3 c,d). The disappearance of <b>pinholes</b> for thicker GdBCO films {{can be attributed to}} a temperature decrease effect of top layers for thicker GdBCO films. Because the GdBCO film is a bad thermal conductor, the top layer will not be heated sufficiently. Hence, it is indicated that the disappearance of <b>pinholes</b> for thicker films probably results from a decrease of deposition temperature for the top layer. This explanation accords very well with our above discussion for the appearance of the <b>pinholes</b> in thinner films. The mechanism of the <b>pinholes</b> is still not clear. They will also damage the superconducting performance of the (RE) BCO films because they will decrease the effective supercurrent-carrying cross-sectional area.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The study {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} <b>pinholes</b> in castings formed by reaction between a green foundry mould and lamellargraphite cast iron. Great numbers of works have been aimed at clarifying the causes of <b>pinholes</b> formation in iron castings. In spite of thisthere exists no united opinion on the <b>pinholes</b> formation (genesis) and {{the authors of this}} contribution having studied this phenomenon incompacted graphite and spheroidal graphite iron castings were also aimed at lamellar graphite cast iron and they applied for it theirknowledge gained in study of reoxidation processes during casting of ferrous alloys. Methodology: Experiments were done on castings of stepped bars moulded in green bentonite mixtures with s graduated moisture and withuse of two types of carbonaceous matters. Metal was melted in a 100 kg induction furnace from the same charge. Inoculation was done ina ladle after pouring out from the furnace. Aluminium was dosed in the ladle in some cases and the inoculator kind was changed too. Results: <b>Pinholes</b> were present on castings as small flat pits; on horizontal surfaces sooner singly, on casting edges in clusters. Theformation of <b>pinholes</b> wasn’t caused by high moisture of moulds but the defect was sensitive to aluminium content in metal. In castingswith high aluminium content > 0. 01 % the <b>pinholes</b> were present in great numbers, and namely both under low, and also high moi stures ofmoulding mixtures. In melts with low content of Al < 0. 01 % the <b>pinholes</b> occurred less extensively only.

5|$|Based on {{increased}} {{organization and}} the formation of banding features, it was estimated that the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Howard at 0000UTC on August31. A mid-level anticyclone located over southern California was steering the storm towards the northwest. Early on September1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that Howard had an 80percent chance of undergoing rapid intensification based on further development of the storm and a highly favorable environment around the cyclone. Based on the formation of an eye feature, the NHC upgraded Howard to a hurricane early on September1 while the storm was located about 420mi (675km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. Later that day, the eye of Howard became apparent on satellite imagery, which organized into a <b>pinhole</b> eye surrounded by a ring of symmetric, deep convection. At 0600UTC on September2, Howard was upgraded to a major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higher. Shortly after, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, with winds of 140mph (220km/h) while located about 410mi (660km) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Hondo {{continued}} to quickly strengthen, becoming a tropical cyclone, {{the equivalent of}} a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, that same day. After maintaining its through the early hours of February6, a <b>pinhole</b> eye began to develop, signifying that Hondo was beginning to undergo rapid intensification. During this intensification phase, the storm became nearly stationary again due to a weakness in the ridge which was previously steering the cyclone towards the east. Later that day, Hondo was upgraded to an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds). After becoming an intense tropical cyclone, wind shear began to increase, causing the eye to become slightly disorganized, temporarily slowed the intensification. Later in the day, the eye became better defined, allowing Hondo to intensify further. Operationally, Hondo was upgraded to a very intense tropical cyclone with winds of 220km/h (140mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 906hPa (mbar). However, after reanalysis, it was found that Hondo never intensified beyond intense tropical cyclone status and winds peaked at 215km/h (130mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 915hPa (mbar).|$|E

5|$|On July19, {{the eye of}} Daniel became {{apparent}} on satellite imagery, which organized into a <b>pinhole</b> eye. It underwent an eyewall replacement cycle as it turned to the west-northwest, temporarily halting its intensification trend, before quickly strengthening and attaining major hurricane status on July20. Later that day, Hurricane Daniel organized into a very symmetric cyclone with a distinct eye about 30miles (50km) in diameter. Upon attaining Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the cyclone resembled the appearance of an annular hurricane; an annular hurricane is one with a large and symmetric eye, surrounded by a thick ring of intense convection, and usually is able to maintain its intensity and structure for several days. On July 21 the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle. After completing the cycle, Daniel attained its peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) early on July 22. It maintained peak winds for about 18 hours, and Daniel began a weakening trend as it crossed into an area of progressively cooler water temperatures. The eye became more distinct on July 23, before the cloud tops again warmed as the winds decreased.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} <b>pinholes</b> in castings by reaction between cast iron with compacted graphite and green sand mould. Methodology: Experiments were done on bar castings moulded in green bentonite mixtures without carbonaceous matters. Moulding sand moisture and aluminium content in the melt were purposely changed. Metal was melted in a 100 kg furnace by remelting the uniform charge of return material. Metal was inoculated all at once in a ladle and modified in a reaction chamber in a mould or as sandwich method in a pouring ladle. Findings: The formation of <b>pinholes</b> was not caused by high moisture of the mould but this defect was sensible to aluminium content in metal. In castings with high aluminium content > 0. 2 % the <b>pinholes</b> occurred in high numbers, and namely under low and also high moistures (> 4 %). In previous melts with aluminium contents < 0. 02 % defects occurred in small range. Practical implications: Thus the conclusions known from literature {{about the influence of}} Al on <b>pinholes</b> occurrence in cast irons were confirmed. Oxygen activity in metal during its flowing and cooling in the mould was also measured but this quantity was not changed too in dependence on <b>pinholes</b> content. Morphological analyses near the defect have indicated that it is a physical type of <b>pinholes</b> caused by hydrogen. Originality: A number of works were aimed at explanation of causes of <b>pinholes</b> formation in lamellar graphite iron castings and spheroidal graphite ones.
