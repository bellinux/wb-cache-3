40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> {{fibrillation}} (AF) may {{be triggered}} by intermittent <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> and ultimately lead to persistent AF. However, the mechanisms by which intermittent <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> promotes sustained AF are not well understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight sheep were chronically implanted with 2 pacemakers for the recording of broadband right atrial unipolar electrograms, and for the delivery of electrophysiological stimulation protocols and intermittent right <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> Right <b>atrial</b> kinetics of activation recovery interval (ARI) as a surrogate for action potential duration, of conduction time and velocity, and of repolarization alternans were analyzed at incremental pacing rates during the remodeling process induced by weeks of intermittent <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> until the development of sustained AF. Intermittent <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> decreased ARI and blunted its rate adaptation, facilitated atrial capture, and slowed conduction at high rates, and increased susceptibility to pacing-induced AF. In spite of blunted ARI rate adaptation, right atrial repolarization alternans was maintained during remodeling, and further increased in magnitude just before rapid pacing-induced AF. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that weeks of intermittent right <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> result in a gradual electrical remodeling favorable for wavebreaks and reentry that may facilitate fibrillation...|$|R

In this Series paper, we discuss the underlying mechanisms and the current role of catheter ablation for the three most common atrial arrhythmias encountered in clinical practice: focal <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> <b>atrial</b> flutter, and atrial fibrillation. The mechanisms of focal <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> and <b>atrial</b> flutter are well understood, and these arrhythmias are amenable to curative catheter ablation with high success rates. In most cases, <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> fibrillation is initiated by triggers located within pulmonary vein musculature. Circumferential ablation to isolate this musculature is associated with high success rates for elimination of <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> fibrillation in selected populations. Because of the problem of recurrent pulmonary vein connection, more than one procedure will be needed in about 30 % of patients, and new technologies are being developed to reduce this occurrence. The mechanisms that sustain persistent atrial fibrillation are not well understood and are the subject of continuing investigation.

40|$|Recently the mechanism, {{diagnosis}} and treatment of arrhythmias have advanced rapidly. Especially advances in the treatment of tachyarrhythmias are becoming predominant. In the United States, 80 ～ 90 % of sudden cardiac death, of which there is are about 35, 000 events annually, is thought to be due to VT/VF. Therefore, it is very important from the view of medicine and society to prevent sudden death due to VT/VF. In Japan, amiodarone, which is the most effective agent in preventing VT/VF, was approved in 1992. Further, catheter ablation, which is a radical therapy for WPW syndrome, <b>paroxysmal</b> supraventricular <b>tachycardia,</b> <b>atrial</b> flutter, <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> and VT using radiofrequency energy applied through electrode catheters, was approved in 1995, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, which automatically terminate VT/VF, have just received medical insurance reinbursement in 1996. In other words, the therapy for tachyarrhythmias made a new turning point in the 1990 s, about 10 years behind the United States. Therefore the establishment of new strategies for the treatment of tachyarrhythmias is required.

To test this hypothesis, 60 patients with paroxysmal arrhythmias resistant to quinidine and 17 with chronic atrial fibrillation were given propranolol alone or in combination with quinidine (or procainamide) and followed up 1 to 17 months. Patients with severe aortic valve disease, severe mitral insufficiency, acute myocardial infarction or obstructive airway diseases were excluded from this study. The condition of 13 of 19 patients with <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> or nodal <b>tachycardia</b> was improved.

40|$|BACKGROUND-: Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} between intrinsic cardiac nerve activity (ICNA) and spontaneous arrhythmias in ambulatory animals. METHODS AND RESULTS-: We implanted radiotransmitters to record extrinsic cardiac nerve activity (ECNA; including stellate ganglion nerve activity and vagal nerve activity) and ICNA (including superior left ganglionated plexi nerve activity and ligament of Marshall nerve activity) in 6 ambulatory dogs. Intermittent rapid left atrial pacing was performed to induce paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia. The vast majority (94 %) of ligament of Marshall nerve activity were preceded by or coactivated with ECNA (stellate ganglion nerve activity or vagal nerve activity), whereas 6 % of episodes were activated alone without concomitant stellate ganglion nerve activity or vagal nerve activity. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia were invariably (100 %) preceded (< 5 seconds) by ICNA. Most <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> events (89 %) were preceded by ICNA and sympathovagal coactivation, whereas 11 % were preceded by ICNA and stellate ganglion nerve activity-only activation. Most paroxysmal atrial fibrillation events were preceded only by ICNA (72 %); the remaining 28 % were preceded by ECNA and ICNA together. Complex fractionated atrial electrograms were observed during ICNA discharges that preceded the onset of <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> and atrial fibrillation.

No conduction block across any ablation lesions was confirmed intraoperatively in the first 128 patients (group C). Isolation of each pulmonary vein was verified by intraoperative pulmonary vein pacing in the following 72 patients (group PV). In the recent 18 consecutive patients, conduction block in the coronary sinus, in addition to pulmonary vein isolation, was confirmed by intraoperative coronary sinus pacing (group PV/CS). Postoperative <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> was characterized by electroanatomic mapping.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} late after surgical {{repair of}} {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD), areas with abnormal electrophysiologic properties may serve as slow conducting pathways within a macroreentrant circuit or may {{be the source of}} focal <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the role of abnormal areas during focal <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> prior to ablation. METHODS: Electroanatomic activation mapping of 62 <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardias</b> was performed in 43 consecutive patients (37 +/- 12 years) after surgical repair of CHD. The mechanism of <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> was scar related intra-atrial reentry (n = 27), cavotricuspid-related atrial flutter (n = 21), atrial fibrillation (n = 2), or focal <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> (n = 10). During intra-atrial reentry, channels of slow conduction could be identified in all patients. Subsequent ablation was directed toward connecting two nonconductive borders. The site of origin during focal <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> showed fractionated potentials and/or continuous electrical activity. RESULTS: Ablation directed at isolating the source area resulted in termination of focal <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> in all cases. In two patients, ablation of an area showing continuous electrical activity giving rise to fibrillatory conduction resulted in termination of atrial fibrillation.

40|$|Background. Atrial {{fibrillation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common arrhythmias. There is a traditional division by time course into acute and chronic forms. The classification of acute forms is unsatisfactory. <b>Paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> fibrillation {{is one of the}} acute forms. There is a great variation in the frequency, duration and clinical pictures of its episodes. These can be asymptomatic or may cause significant hemodynamic disturbances, more or less unpleasant for the patients. There is growing evidence that <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> fibrillation could confer a hypercoagulable state, which is well known for the chronic atrial fibrillation. The possibility of thromboembolic incidents increases with the duration of an episode of <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and is dependent on risk factors for thromboembolisms. Conclusions. The early cardioversion of <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> fibrillation into sinus rhythm is indicated when significant hemodynamic disturbances are present. Pharmacological or electrical cardioversion could be used. The early cardioversion is also recommended, as the possibility of thromboembolic incidents in the first few hours is very low. There are no firm guidelines for profilactic anticoagulation during an attack of <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> fibrillation. The decision for permanent antithrombotic therapy of patients with <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>atrial</b> fibrillation is based on duration and frequency of episodes, on patient’s age, and risk factors for thromboembolisms in atrial fibrillation. </p...|$|R

Postnatal electrocardiograms were {{compatible with the}} diagnosis of multifocal <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> or chaotic <b>atrial</b> rhythm. Both patients were treated with digoxin and the rhythm gradually reverted to sinus. This may represent the first description of multifocal <b>atrial</b> <b>tachycardia</b> in the newborn...|$|R
