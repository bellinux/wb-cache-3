40|$|AbstractThere is a {{transition}} of metal from the lateral and end faces of a continuously cast slab {{to the broad}} surface of the <b>plate</b> during the <b>rolling</b> process. The process of metal transition to the wide sides of the plate {{is the process of}} defect formation, because surface cracks and defects from the side and end faces transfer to the front surfaces of the <b>plate.</b> When <b>rolling</b> is over the cracks are located on the edges of the plate while the width corresponds to the width of the transition strips. Longitudinal edge cracking during <b>plate</b> hot <b>rolling</b> can occur as a consequence the following three factors combination: 1) transition of metal from the lateral and end faces to the broad surfaces of the strip; 2) the occurrence of tensile stresses during the metal transition; 3) reduced plasticity of the slab edges due to the lower temperature (≈ 900 - 950 °C). Significant shift of cracks from the edges takes place due to the transition of metal from the lateral and end faces to the broad surfaces because of the uneven range across the thickness. There is a significant temperature gradient even at 15 - 20 °C...|$|R

50|$|Improvements in <b>plate</b> <b>rolling</b> {{allowed a}} change {{in the shape of the}} girder. Rather than merely a slightly-curved top plate with {{triangular}} gussets, it was now possible to roll a semi-circular plate. This allowed the fully developed 'balloon' shape to be used, as in the second cross-section illustrated. The top web of the girder was semi-circular and riveted to the centre plate by an L-strip. The side gussets, also curved, were riveted parallel to the edges of this top plate, rather than through another L-strip, as used originally. Brunel (probably correctly) considered the smooth balloon profile to be a more efficient design, influenced by his geometric approaches to design rather than Eaton's mathematical analysis. More practically, the parallel lap joint halved the amount of riveting needed, compared to the L-strip.|$|E
