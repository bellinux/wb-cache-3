5|$|Engine failure causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.|$|E
2500|$|The Type 192 shared some of {{its design}} {{features}} with the cancelled naval variants, which made it less than ideal for transporting troops. The front undercarriage was unusually tall, originally designed to give adequate clearance for loading torpedoes underneath the fuselage in the anti-submarine warfare role. This left the main passenger and cargo door [...] above the ground. The engines were placed {{at either end of}} the cabin. (By comparison the purpose-designed troop transport contemporary Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight had its engines above the aft cabin to permit a rear loading ramp). To provide access to the cabin from the cockpit there was a small entry <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that resulted in a bulge on the left side of the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|As engine fires {{occurred}} with the B-36's radial engines, some crews humorously changed the aircraft's slogan from [...] "six turning, four burning" [...] into [...] "two turning, two burning, two smoking, two choking, {{and two more}} unaccounted for." [...] This problem was exacerbated by the propellers' pusher configuration, which increased carburetor icing. The design of the R-4360 engine tacitly assumed {{that it would be}} mounted in the conventional tractor configuration—propeller/air intake/28 cylinders/carburetor—with air flowing in that order. In this configuration, the carburetor is bathed in warmed air flowing <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> and so is unlikely to ice up. However, the R-4360 engines in the B-36 were mounted backwards, in the pusher configuration—air intake/carburetor/28 cylinders/propeller. The carburetor was now in front of the engine and so could not benefit from engine heat, and also made more traditional short term carburetor heat systems unsuitable. Hence, when intake air was cold and humid, ice gradually obstructed the carburetor air intake, which in turn gradually increased the richness of the air/fuel mixture until the unburned fuel in the exhaust caught fire. Three engine fires of this nature led to the first loss of an American nuclear weapon.|$|E

They see me and run for me, but I crawl on hands and knees across the rail on the opposite side and gain my feet. Then away I go for the head of the train. I run <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and hide in the sheltering darkness. It is the same old situation. I am ahead of the train, and the train must go past me.|$|E

5000|$|The {{smooth running}} {{characteristics}} of the straight-eight made it popular in luxury and racing cars of <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> length demanded <b>the</b> use of a long <b>engine</b> compartment, making <b>the</b> basic design unacceptable in modern vehicles. Also, due {{to the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> torsional vibration in both crankshaft and camshaft can adversely affect reliability and performance at high speeds. In particular, a phenomenon referred to as [...] "crankshaft whip," [...] caused by the effects of centrifugal force on the crank throws at high engine rpm, can cause physical contact between the connecting rods and crankcase walls, leading to <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> destruction. As a result, the design has been displaced almost completely by <b>the</b> shorter V8 <b>engine</b> configuration.|$|R

50|$|This is a {{specially}} tuned {{variant of the}} 5.0L unique to the GT-F, similar to the Cobra before it, the 351 is {{a reference to the}} Cleveland engines offered in the Falcon in the <b>past.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> is capable of up to 15 per cent more power and torque, equivalent to over 400kW and 650Nm, when the conditions allow.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{break-in}} {{period was}} very important to the overall life and durability of the engine. The break-in period required has changed over the years with improved piston ring materials and designs. In reference to small engines, the break-in period now (5-10 hours) is short in comparison with that of engines of the past. Aluminum cylinder bore engine piston rings break-in faster than those used on cast iron cylinder bores.|$|E
5000|$|The JT15D is rare among modern turbofans {{in that it}} uses a {{centrifugal}} compressor as its main high-pressure system. This was a common feature of early jet engines, but was quickly replaced by axial compressors in most roles due to its large frontal size. In the turbofan role most of the jet thrust is generated by the cold air blown <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> and the internal [...] "jet" [...] portion is quite small. In this role the high single-stage compression of the centrifugal design has advantages, and the main reason most small turbofans don't use them {{is that they are}} often developments of previous turbojet designs.|$|E
5000|$|There is some {{confusion}} in terminology between aftercooler, intercooler, and charge-air cooler. In <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> aircraft <b>engines</b> would run turbochargers in stages, {{where the first}} stage compressor would feed the inlet of the second stage compressor that would further compress the air before it enters <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Due to <b>the</b> extremely high pressures that would develop, an air cooler was positioned {{between the first and}} second stage compressors.

50|$|It was a four engine, {{cantilever}} {{low wing}} monoplane. In plan the wing was triangular apart from elliptical tips, with sweep {{only on the}} leading edge. It had three parts, a centre section that extended just <b>past</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>engines</b> and carried split flaps which continued under the fuselage, and two outer sections with trailing edges largely occupied by balanced ailerons. The wing had two longerons on each side, the forward ones parallel to the leading edge and the rear {{at right angles to}} the fuselage. These were bound together in the centre section by a trellis of box-girders. The wing skin was stressed Vedal sheet, flush riveted together.|$|R

50|$|The {{main concern}} was {{providing}} cooling air over the cylinder heads, which generally required {{a very large}} opening {{at the front of}} the aircraft. Tank's solution for the BMW 139 was to use an engine-driven fan behind an oversized, flow-through hollow prop-spinner open at the extreme front, blowing air <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> cylinders, with some of it being drawn through S-shaped ducts over a radiator for oil cooling. However this system proved almost impossible to operate properly with the BMW 139; early prototypes of the Fw 190 demonstrated terrible cooling problems. Although the problems appeared to be fixable, since the engine was already fairly dated in terms of design, in 1938 BMW proposed an entirely new engine designed specifically for fan-cooling that could be brought to production quickly.|$|E

50|$|The FC.20 was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} reconnaissance bomber but was developed instead as a ground attack aircraft. The first prototype first flew in 1941, piloted by Moroni. Four variants were structurally and aerodynamically similar apart from the front fuselage detail and engine installations.The FC.20 was a cantilever low wing monoplane with a straight tapered wing of aspect ratio about 6.4. The leading edge was almost unswept and the tips rounded. The wing had positive dihedral outboard of <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> <b>The</b> trailing edges carried short span, tabbed ailerons and split flaps which reached <b>past</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>engine</b> fairings to <b>the</b> wing roots. <b>The</b> twin <b>engines</b> were mounted forward of the leading edge with the propeller shaft in the wing plane; the mainwheels of the conventional undercarriage retracted backwards into <b>the</b> extended underwing <b>engine</b> fairings. <b>The</b> FC.20 had a twin tail, with elliptically shaped endplate vertical surfaces almost equally divided vertically between fin and rudder. These were mounted on a tapered tailplane with significant dihedral, carrying tabbed, tapered elevators. The rear fuselage extended beyond the empennage, providing a housing for the retractable talwheel.|$|R
50|$|Engines {{with more}} {{cylinders}} {{for the same}} displacement feel smoother to ride. Engines with fewer cylinders are cheaper, lighter, and easier to maintain. Liquid-cooled motorcycles have a radiator which is the primary way their heat is dispersed. Coolant or oil is constantly circulated between this radiator and the cylinder when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is running. Air-cooled motorcycles rely on air blowing <b>past</b> fins on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> case to disperse heat. Liquid-cooled motorcycles {{have the potential for}} greater power at a given displacement, tighter tolerances, and longer operating life, whereas air-cooled motorcycles are potentially cheaper to purchase, less mechanically complex and lighter weight.|$|R

50|$|Turbojet engines {{have a high}} fuel consumption, and {{afterburning}} {{even more}} so. One way to make an engine more efficient {{is to make it}} pass a larger mass of air at slower speed. This {{led to the development of}} the bypass turbofan, in which a larger-diameter fan at the front passes some air into the compressor and the rest around a bypass, where it flows <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at slower speed than the jet exhaust. The fan and compressor need to spin at different speeds, leading to the two-spool turbofan, in which two sets of turbines are mounted on concentric shafts spinning at different speeds to drive the fan and the high-pressure compressor respectively. Taking the principle a step further, the high-bypass turbofan is even more efficient, having typically three spools each spinning at a different speed.|$|E
50|$|The fourth {{generation}} of F-body {{was released in}} 1993. It was an extensive revision to the third generation car, instead of a clean-sheet design. It was produced until the platform was canceled {{at the end of}} the 2002 model year. Unlike most of the years <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> choices were simplified considerably; each year, on both the Camaro and the Firebird, there was only one V6 and one V8 available. For 1993 to 1995, the V6 was the 3.4 L (208 cu in) 60°; 1996-2002 cars received the 3.8L (231 cu in) 3800 Series II V6. 1993-1997 V8 cars shipped with the 5.7L (350 cu in) LT1, while 1998-2002 cars received the 5.7L (346 cu in) LS1. Both engines were available with the 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. V6 engines with a manual transmission had a five-speed unit; the manual for V8 cars was the T-56 six-speed, manufactured by either Borg-Warner or Tremec. An optional Hurst-supplied shifter was also available on V8 models.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the cars}} are fitted with K-1 and K-2 triple valves with {{retainers}}, the retainers are always set for the full release position. Brake pipe pressure is set to 70 lbs. fully charged and controlling speed with needed reductions as the grade and load require. The light weight of the cars is accentuated when the train is full vs. empty, making {{a big difference in}} how the engineer will handle the train on the return. While riding the train, you will likely hear the hiss of air being released from the brake cylinders as the train goes into the long horseshoe curve, where the grade is flat enough to maintain speed and recharge the brake pipe at the same time. As the engine nears the end of the curve, another set is generally made progressively and will be maintained until the Thunderhead Gap bridge, where the process is repeated and the final application is made for the descent into the lower loop. Once on the lower loop, the train drifts <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> house and pulls the light grade back into the station.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> V14 <b>engines</b> {{have also}} been offered by other manufacturers.

They were used for example on RFA Bayleaf, a Leaf-class support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.|$|R
25|$|Depending on the {{location}} of the camshaft, the cam operates the valves either directly or through a linkage of pushrods and rockers. Direct operation involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires the camshaft to be positioned {{at the top of the}} cylinders.

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{demanding}} action sequences in the film featured the character of Kruger forced to flee from a jet speeding through the skies at 250 miles per hour. Speaking about this scene, director Russell says: [...] "These things are jigsaw puzzle pieces not only within shooting sequence but within each shot. You had elements that were live action, elements that were miniature, sometimes computer-generated, and they're all married together in the final processing." [...] Some of the physical stunts were performed by Schwarzenegger himself. For the [...] "aerial" [...] stunt Arnold was required to fall 65 feet in vertical descent and perform a back flip in mid-flight. The shot took seven takes to get right.

5000|$|Weeping Angels {{prefer to}} take their energy from live victims, but if required, they can drain other forms such as that from {{electric}} lights (as seen in [...] "Blink") or other electronics. In [...] "Blink," [...] the Angels attempted to steal the Doctor's TARDIS after trapping him in the <b>past.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> of the vehicle contained enough time energy to feed them forever, but The Doctor stated that the possible damage they could cause [...] "could switch off the sun". Without power, an Angel will start to decay and revert to a stone state even when not being watched. While still initially capable of movement, its speed will also be extremely hindered when close to a starvation point (as seen in [...] "The Time of Angels"), with its range lessened from meters to a partial step. The effects of starvation can be undone by providing the Angel with energy, but it is implied that Angels can no longer acquire energy themselves in this state. A starving Angel becomes less and less active, and if dormant for too long will erode as a stone statue does, or even lose its physical existence altogether (although it can still exist in an image-based or conceptual state).|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{other systems}} produce {{results in the}} form of mutable, time-annotated datasets.
