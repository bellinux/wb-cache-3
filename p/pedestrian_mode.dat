40|$|AbstractThe <b>pedestrian</b> <b>mode</b> is an {{important}} component of urban networks, and greatly affects the performance of the sidewalks and crosswalks, as well as the entire network traffic operations by interacting with other traffic modes (automobile, bicycle, transit). There have been many studies concerning different aspects of pedestrian behaviors, such as pedestrian walking speed, pedestrian delay, gap acceptance, signal compliance, route choice, etc. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) included the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>mode</b> in the HCM 1994 (update to the HCM 1985) and the HCM, 2010 provided several basic technical methodologies for evaluating the pedestrian level of service (LOS) of different urban street facilities. However, it does not fully cover the pedestrian operation in a great detail and it is missing some important findings in recent studies. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide an overview of pedestrian operations in urban networks, to identify the important aspects of pedestrian operation analysis and to provide recommendations for pedestrian facilities in the HCM on the basis of a summary of available U. S. and international literature. The following topics will be discussed: pedestrian movement models, pedestrian delay estimation, pedestrian-vehicle interactions, and pedestrian travel time estimation. The major features of pedestrian movement along urban segments are the walking speed and available space, which were well examined in past studies. Pedestrian delay is one important measure of pedestrian operation, and its estimation models at signalized/unsignalized intersections are presented with respect to different scenarios. Modifications to the delay model in the HCM, 2010 are highlighted. Pedestrian-vehicle interactions highly affect traffic operations. Both driver and pedestrian behaviors in such an interaction were observed in the field and were examined quantitatively. Pedestrian jaywalking behavior was also observed and its impact on traffic is discussed. Pedestrian route choice at the strategic level and crossing location selection at the operational level jointly determine the pedestrian moving path and further affect the travel time at path-level. A model for estimating pedestrian travel time in an urban network is developed and presented. Such a model can be used to evaluate the facility performance as well as serve for pedestrian route selection. This paper identifies the important aspects of pedestrian operation analysis in an urban network and provides several recommendations to the HCM...|$|E

40|$|Agent-based {{modelling}} (ABM) is {{fast becoming}} the dominant paradigm in social simulation due primarily to a worldview that suggests that complex systems emerge from the bottom-up, are highly decentralised, and are composed of a multitude of heterogeneous objects called agents.

40|$|Objectives: This {{research}} {{aimed to}} assess the level of support for active transportation among state departments of transportation (DOTs) in the U. S. Methods: We conducted an inventory plans adopted by 51 state DOTs and a survey of state DOT pedestrian and bicycle coordinators in the U. S. in 2010 (n= 39, 72 % response rate). Results: Overall, the plans were not very encouraging of planning and design elements that would encourage walking and bicycling. Only two items (Establish pedestrian and bicycle facilities requirements and standards and Safer intersections for pedestrians and bicyclists) were encouraged or required by {{at least half of}} the states. States were more supportive of including bicycle and pedestrian facilities (e. g. trails, sidewalks, and bike lanes) and less supportive of policies related to land use and urban design and reallocating road space (e. g. road diets or narrower streets). The overall levels of support were positively correlated to levels of urbanization. According to the state coordinators, support for bicycle and pedestrian projects and policies increased over time, but support is stronger among top management than highway engineering staff. Funding was identified as the major implementation barrier, particularly in more rural states. Conclusions: Change within state DOTs to incorporate bicycle and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>modes</b> is a slow process, influenced by both management and engineering staff. Education at several levels and through different mechanisms could play an important role in changing DOT culture, though funding for projects is also a major barrier.

These new models also provide the ability to describe the motions of many pedestrians and situations such as phasing, spatial orientation, and crowding. The new pedestrian loading models were applied to different types of structural finite element models and multiple computer simulations were run with variations of loading patterns. Responses from both the previous models and the new models were compared to those from the measured data. Additionally, the responses from different loading patterns with varied spatial, phasing, and crowding situations were analyzed.

Transportation systems and their related outcomes are responsible for ensuring safe travel options, including walking people of all ages and different abilities. This study will provide an opportunity to quantify the environmental impact in terms of noise level for future development and planning of pedestrian infrastructure in India. It will also help in modal shifting towards walking, improvements in energy efficiency, and the impact of specific contaminants on health. Exposure of high noise level can cause annoyance and severe stress on auditory and nervous system of pedestrians. Most of the Indian cities have noise level above than acceptable limits because of rapid urbanization with increasing number of vehicular traffic. The objective of this study is to study response of pedestrians towards noise pollution in Roorkee at different locations based on different land use. Roorkee is a medium size city with a population of 2. 73 lakhs (Roorkee Metropolitan areas, 2011 census), situated in Uttarakhand, India.

40|$|The paper takes {{way from}} {{the outline of the}} state of the art on {{mobility}} issues and possibilities of reorganization from the point of view of quality of life improvement and environmental sustainability. The experiences already made in many other countries, both European and extra European, take to say that such reorganization has to be based on some main basic choices: to improve public transport and intermodality offer, to boost its use for the longer routes, and to promote non motorized transport modes for the short displacements, to discourage private individual traffic. To this aim it is necessary to affect the structure of the mobility system: components and speed, weights and hierarchies. The essay gives then an overview of various possible actions that can be taken to increase the share of the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>mode</b> in town and to regain space for hosting all the activities of displacement and stasis, with the aim to create a continuous pedestrian network, interlaced with a calmed vehicular mobility. The focus is on an Italian tool that could allow to do this, but that is not very much used yet: the Environmental Island, inserted in the indications given by the law on Urban Traffic Plans. Such instrument is up to date in respect with other European tools, as the English Home Zones, the French or German Zone 30 etc. Its potentialities are in particular analysed for the upgrading of residential districts, above all for meeting the main pedestrians’ requirements: safety and security, accessibility, comfort, use and aspect of the urban spaces. The essay suggests also a methodology, already applied in pilot projects elaborated for case studies in Rome, for integrating the two main aspects of the design: reorganization of the mobility and improvement of the urban quality on its whole. Finally it deals with three main issues: the behaviour and speed appropriate to the urban environment and the auto explicatory street as a measure of traffic calming; the design of a coexistence space; the environmental design of the intermediate spaces...|$|E
40|$|There is much {{potential}} to decrease energy {{consumption in the}} U. S. by encouraging compact, centralized development. Although many {{studies have examined the}} extent to which built environment and demographic factors are related to household energy use, few have considered both building and transportation energy together. We hypothesized that residents living further from city centers, or urban cores, consume more energy for both purposes than their inner city counterparts, resulting in a direct relationship between building and transportation energy usage. This hypothesis was tested with two case studies. The first focused on New York City. Annual building energy per unit of parcels, or tax lots, containing large multi-family structures was compared to the daily transportation energy use per household of traffic analysis zones (TAZs) (estimated with a regional travel demand model). Transportation energy showed a strong spatial pattern, with distance to urban core explaining 63 % of variation in consumption. Building energy use was randomly distributed, resulting in a weak negative correlation with transportation energy. However, both correlation with distance to urban core and transportation energy became significant and positive when portion of detached single-family units for TAZs was used as a proxy for building energy. Structural equation models (SEMs) revealed a direct relationship between log lot depth and both uses of energy, and inverse relationship between portion of attached housing units and transportation energy. This supports the notion that sprawling development increases both the building and transportation energy consumption of households. For the second analysis, annual building and automobile energy use per household were estimated for block groups across the 50 most populous U. S. metropolitan regions with Esri Consumer Expenditure Data. Both forms of energy consumption per household were lowest in inner cities and increased at greater distances from urban cores. Although there may be some error in estimates from modeled expenditure data, characteristics associated with lower energy use, such as portion of attached housing units and commuters that utilize transit or <b>pedestrian</b> <b>modes,</b> were negatively correlated with distance to urban core. Overall, this work suggests there are spatial patterns to household energy consumption, with households further from urban cores using more building and transportation energy.

40|$|This study evaluates {{a random}} sample of ten {{suburban}} bicycle and pedestrian facilities, eight of which were funded by the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program in the Chicago metro area. Users of these facilities were surveyed in intercept mode during the summer of 2009, leading to 297 responses. The study of these non-motorized facilities showed relatively low usage levels but that motorized mode substitution (from personal car to bicycle and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>modes)</b> has resulted due to the facilities, potentially leading to improved air quality outcomes. There is also evidence of latent mode substitution, i. e., the current non-motorized trip could have been made by many respondents using motorized modes, but they chose not to. The majority of users cited recreation and exercise as the primary reason for using the facilities. Site-level factors {{play an important role in}} the propensity to switch from cars to bicycle and pedestrian use, controlling for individual factors. The propensity to switch from personal cars is lower for pedestrian facility users than for bicycle facility users in the sample. Since the facilities were selected randomly out of the universe of projects that were recently completed, it would appear that such considerations may need to be entered in factoring up emissions estimates from the sample to the total universe of CMAQ-funded bicycle and pedestrian facilities in similar suburbs. It would also be important to evaluate recently completed non-motorized projects in more densely populated areas with a greater degree of neighborhood design and street connectivity characteristics that support biking and walking, in order to fully generalize the results of the study to the entire population of CMAQ-funded bicycle and pedestrian projects in the Chicago metropolitan area. But the research design and data collection strategy utilized in this study are likely to provide a valid method for ex post evaluation of such projects. At the time of completing Phase 1 of the project, data were also collected from 10 signal interconnect and intersection improvement projects funded by CMAQ for the before period of a before-after study. These projects were at the letting stage at that time and we anticipate collecting the after data in Phase 2.

40|$|In the {{two decades}} since the United States Congress passed the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, {{there has been a}} surge of {{interest}} in making urban transportation systems more sustainable. Many agencies, representing all levels of government, have searched for strategies to reduce private automobile use, including policies to shift local driving to pedestrian and bicycle modes. Progress has been made in a number of communities, but the automobile remains the dominant mode of transportation in all metropolitan regions. Sustainable transportation advocates are especially interested in routine travel, such as shopping and other errands, because it tends to be done frequently and for distances that could be covered realistically by walking or bicycling. According to the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, Americans made more trips for shopping than for any other purpose, including commuting to and from work. One-third of these shopping trips were shorter than two miles (3. 2 km). However, 76 % of these short shopping trips were made by automobile, while only 21 % were made by walking and 1 % by bicycling. In order to identify effective strategies to change travel behavior, practitioners need a greater understanding of why people choose certain modes for routine travel. Choosing to walk or bicycle rather than travel by automobile may help individuals get exercise, save money, interact with neighbors, and reduce tailpipe emissions. Yet, in some communities, non-motorized modes may also require more time and physical effort to run a series of errands, be less convenient for carrying packages and traveling in bad weather, and be perceived as having a higher risk of traffic crashes or street crime than driving. A mixed-methods approach was used to develop a more complete understanding of factors that are associated with walking or bicycling rather than driving for routine travel. An intercept survey was implemented to gather travel data from 1, 003 customers at retail pharmacy stores in 20 San Francisco Bay Area neighborhoods in fall 2009. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 26 survey participants in spring and summer 2010 to gain a deeper understanding of factors that influenced their transportation decisions. The methodological approach makes several contributions to the body of research on sustainable transportation. For example, the study: Explored multiple categories of factors that may be associated with walking and bicycling, including travel, socioeconomic, attitude, perception, and shopping district characteristics. Few studies of pedestrian or bicycle mode choices have included all of these categories of factors. Statistical models showed that variables in all categories had significant associations with mode choice. Documented and analyzed short pedestrian movements, such as from a parking space to a store entrance or from a bus stop to home. These detailed data provided a greater understanding of pedestrian activity than traditional travel survey analyses. Walking was used as the primary mode for 65 % of respondent trips between stops within shopping districts, and 52 % of all respondents walked along a street or between stops at some time between leaving and returning home. Maps of respondent pedestrian path density revealed distinct pedestrian activity patterns in different types of shopping districts. Used four different approaches to capture participant travel mode information. Respondents reported the primary mode of transportation they were using {{on the day of the}} survey, the mode they typically used, and all modes that they would consider using to travel to the survey store. They also mapped all stops on their tour and said what modes they used between each stop. These four approaches revealed nuanced travel habits and made it possible to correct inaccuracies in self-reported primary travel mode data. Measured and tested fine-grained local environment variables in shopping districts rather than around respondents' homes. These variables characterized the shopping district area (e. g., sidewalks, bicycle facilities, metered parking, and tree canopy coverage), the main commercial roadway (e. g., posted speed limit, number of automobile lanes, and pedestrian crossing distance), and the survey store site (e. g., number of automobile and bicycle parking spaces and distance from the public sidewalk to the store entrance). This dissertation adds to the small number of studies that have explored how the characteristics of activity destinations are related to travel behavior. The study results contribute to the body of knowledge about factors that may encourage people to shift routine travel from automobile to pedestrian or bicycle modes. After controlling for travel factors such as time and cost, socioeconomic characteristics, and individual attitudes, mixed logit models showed that automobile use was negatively associated with higher employment density, smaller parking lots, and metered on-street parking in the shopping district. Walking was positively associated with higher population density, more street tree canopy coverage, lower speed limits, and fewer commercial driveway crossings. The exploratory analysis of a small number of bicycle tours found that bicycling was associated with more extensive bicycle facility networks and more bicycle parking. However, people were more likely to drive when they perceived a high risk of crime. Results also suggest the magnitude of mode shifts that could occur if short- and long-term land use and transportation system changes were made to each study shopping district. The mode choice model representing travel only to and from the study shopping districts (N = 388) was used to estimate respondent mode shares under the following three scenarios: 1) double population and employment densities in each study shopping district, 2) double street tree canopy coverage in each study shopping district, and 3) eliminate half of the automobile parking 3 spaces at the survey store. Based on the model, the combination of these three changes could increase <b>pedestrian</b> <b>mode</b> share among the 388 sample respondents from 43 % to 61 % and decrease automobile mode share from 50 % to 31 %. This shift could eliminate 129 (13 %) of the 983 respondent vehicle miles traveled (208 of the 1, 580 respondent vehicle kilometers traveled), and 110 (36 %) of the 308 times respondents parked their automobiles in the shopping district. The mode choice model of walking versus driving within survey shopping districts (N = 286) was used to test the combination of the following scenarios: 1) cluster separated stores around shared parking lots, 2) consolidate commercial driveways so that there are half as many driveway crossings along the main commercial roadway, 3) reduce all main commercial roadway speed limits to 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour), and 4) install metered parking in all shopping districts. These changes could increase the percentage of the 286 sample respondents walking between shopping district activities from 32 % to 54 %. This shift could eliminate 29 (38 %) of the 76 respondent vehicle miles traveled (47 of the 122 respondent vehicle kilometers traveled), and 105 (22 %) of the 469 times respondents parked their automobiles in the shopping district. Note that these forecasted mode shifts are illustrative examples based on cross-sectional data and do not account for the process of modifying travel behavior habits. Qualitative interviews provided a foundation for a proposed Theory of Routine Mode Choice Decisions. This five-step theory also drew from survey results and other mode choice theories in the transportation and psychology fields. The first step, 1) awareness and availability, determines which modes are viewed as possible choices for routine travel. The next three steps, 2) basic safety and security, 3) convenience and cost, and 4) enjoyment, assess situational tradeoffs between modes in the choice set and are supported by many of the statisticallysignificant factors in the mode choice models. The final step, 5) habit, reinforces previous choices and closes the decision process loop. Socioeconomic characteristics explain differences in how individuals view each step in the process. Understanding each step in the mode choice decision process can help planners, designers, engineers, and other policy-makers implement a comprehensive set of strategies that may be able to shift routine automobile travel to pedestrian and bicycle modes.

To serve pedestrians well, a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route, which the orthogonal grid geometry provides.

Two thirds of the reconstruction costs of approximately €9 million was met by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the remaining costs were divided between the city of Essen and the transport operators.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Pedestrianization {{is a new}} on traffic {{management}} practice in Vigan City, a world heritage site. This was established {{as an alternative to}} motorized transportation among Bigueños. This paper focuses on the characterization of the traffic condition of the city and it reveals findings of the explorative study conducted relative to the linkages and trips of pedestrians (origin-destination). A user perception survey was administered to street users to determine their personal and travel characteristics. The level of acceptance of safety rules in crossing a street or intersection was found to be Very High; the impression of the residents of Vigan City towards pedestrianization is High. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} walking practices in a city declared as a world heritage site are meaningful in the context of preserving the culture and values of Bigueños. The city government of Vigan should encourage the use of non-motorized vehicles and eliminate conflict among pedestrians and drivers; adopt an environmentally sustainable transport system; and promote a city that provides public safety and is pedestrian-friendly. It is worth recommending that the City government of Vigan should also enact an ordinance for the implementation of a “Give way to pedestrians ” policy in all the streets in the heart of Vigan City.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{automatic}} face detection and tracking in uncontrolled scenarios using a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) network camera, which could prove most helpful in forensic applications. The detected faces are associated with the corresponding people and trajectories. The dynamic nature of real-world scenarios and real-time restrictions complicate our task. Different from previous work which use a mixture of wide angle cameras and PTZ cameras, we explore the limits to what can be expected from a single PTZ camera. The system first detects and tracks <b>pedestrians</b> in zoomed-out <b>mode,</b> then selects, using a scheduler, a person to zoom in to. After zoom in, we come back to wide area mode, and solve the person-to-person, face-to-person and face-to-face data association problems. Extensive experiments in challenging indoor and outdoor uncontrolled conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study evaluates {{a random}} sample of {{eighteen}} bicycle and pedestrian facilities, sixteen of which were funded by the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program in the Chicago metro area. Users of these facilities were surveyed in intercept mode during specific intervals of time starting in the summer of 2009 and ending in the spring of 2011, leading to 376 responses. Usage levels were also enumerated in all sites. The study showed varying levels of use at the different facilities and that motorized mode substitution (change from personal car use to bicycle and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>modes)</b> resulted after the facilities became available to users, potentially leading to improved air quality outcomes. There is also evidence of latent mode substitution, i. e., respondents self-reported that the current non-motorized trip could have been made by using motorized modes, but that they chose not to. The majority of users cited recreation and exercise to be the primary reason for using the facilities. Site-level factors {{play an important role in}} the propensity to switch from being exclusively Single Occupant Vehicle (SOV) users to bicycle and pedestrian users, controlling for individual sociodemographic factors. Users of bicycle paths were less likely than pedestrians to have been SOV users for their trip purpose prior to starting use of the non-motorized facility. Bicyclists are more likely to self-report using public transportation or bicycles on alternative facilities prior to using the CMAQ-funded facility. Respondents surveyed in high density areas were also more likely to have been non-car users for the current trip prior to using the facility. Respondents surveyed in areas farther away from the center of the City of Chicago are more likely to have switched from SOV modes. Finally, respondents surveyed in areas with lower levels of car ownership are less likely to have used SOV modes for the current trip prior to using the facility. The propensity to switch from being exclusively SOV users is positively correlated with the higher levels of Average Daily Traffic in highway links in surrounding census tracts and with the percent of population who speak limited or no English in surrounding areas. Finally, the ability to connect directly to a transit station is positively correlated while the recreational usage is negatively correlated with the propensity to switch from being previously exclusively SOV users for the trip purpose. Our analysis also found that depending on the location and overall sociodemographic, transportation and other characteristics of the surrounding areas, there are likely to be at least four groupings of CMAQ-funded projects that exhibit various combinations propensity to switch and overall use levels. Although data on 4 randomly selected intersection improvement and 4 randomly selected signal interconnect projects (“roadway projects”) were collected for the “before” period of a before-andafter evaluation of traffic outcomes, only two projects, both signal interconnect projects, were completed within the timeline of the project. The field observations reveal that there is a 7. 15...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We propose here {{to acquire}} high {{resolution}} sequences of a person’s face using a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) network camera. This capability should prove helpful in forensic analysis of video sequences as frames containing faces are tagged, {{and within a}} frame, windows containing faces can be retrieved. The system starts in <b>pedestrian</b> detector <b>mode,</b> where the lens angle is set widest, and detects people using a pedestrian detector module. The camera then changes to the region of interest (ROI) focusing mode where the parameters are automatically tuned to put the upper body of the detected person, where the face should appear, {{in the field of}} view (FOV). Then, in the face detection mode, the face is detected using a face detector module, and the system switches to an active tracking mode consisting a control loop to actively follow the detected face with two different modules: a tracker to track the face in the image, and a camera control module to adjust the camera parameters. During this loop, our tracker learns online the face appearance in multiple views under all condition changes. It runs robustly at 15 fps and is able to reacquire the face of interest after total occlusion or leaving FOV. We compare our tracker with various state-of-the-art tracking methods in terms of precision and running time performance. Extensive experiments in challenging indoor and outdoor conditions are also demonstrated to validate the complete system...|$|R
5000|$|Players {{can change}} the visual {{appearance}} of the game before starting a race, such as the weather and time of day. Additionally, the frequency of how many cops spawn around the city can be modified, along {{with the amount of}} traffic and <b>pedestrians.</b> In Cruise <b>Mode,</b> this can change where the player starts off. Every race or cruise begins with a commentator introducing the course. These commentators would also be heard {{at the end of a}} race saying something that depends on the player's position upon finishing. The commentators would be different for each race, and they are different for each of the two cities. The commentators can be turned off. One of the game's most entertaining aspects is its humor; for example, the new age retro hippie in San Francisco singing out-off-tune variation of John Lennon song Give Peace a Chance. In most races and Cruise mode, people in cars and pedestrians can yell comments at players in different languages.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is an {{application}} need for seamless multimodal advanced traveler information systems. Currently, no comprehensive network modeling approach exists {{to deal with}} routing queries for different private and public transport modes taking into account multiple attributes, dynamic travel times and time tables in large-scale transport networks.

First, we model multimodal transport networks from an abstract point of view and categorize networks into private and public modes. Then we use a generic method to construct a multimodal transport network representation by using transfer links which is inspired by the so-called supernetwork technique. Among all <b>modes,</b> <b>pedestrian</b> networks play an important role in modeling transfer connections. We test our model and algorithm based on a case study in the Eindhoven region. The results indicate that our model and algorithms provide a suitable basis for ATIS applications. One current limitation is that much time is required for data reading and compiling.

40|$|An {{extensive}} survey {{has been}} designed to provide detailed information on carbon monoxide (CO) concentration in the main transport modes and along heavy traffic routes in the Athens urban area. Specifically the study identifies the main factors affecting CO exposure during commuting. Several portable, electrochemical CO monitors (Solomat's MPM 4100), were used to record the in-vehicle CO concentrations every 15 s. Measurements were performed during rush hour periods. Field monitoring was conducted in summer 1998 and winter 1998 - 1999. Exposure estimates were compared to WHO guidelines. The findings showed that the mean CO level over trips of 30 min was 21. 4 ppm for private car against 10. 4, 9. 6, 4 and 11. 5 ppm for bus, trolley, electric train and <b>pedestrians,</b> respectively. Transport <b>mode,</b> route, monitoring period and season had a significant influence on the measured CO concentrations. The study points out the importance of microenvironmental monitoring, instead of using fixed-site data in assessing commuter's CO exposure. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Across the nation, {{there are}} {{opportunities}} to improve coordination among transportation modal agencies, including aviation, transit, ports, highway, rail, <b>pedestrian,</b> and bicycle <b>modes.</b> Virginia’s statewide multimodal transportation planning effort VTrans 2025 addresses multimodal coordination of transportation {{investments in the}} state. Virginia’s Secretary of Transportation submitted a final report of the VTrans 2025 effort to the Virginia General Assembly in November 2004. The {{purpose of this study}} was to demonstrate an analytical methodology that could aid efforts such as this to coordinate and prioritize multimodal investments. The methodology developed can help decision makers to identify and prioritize proposed multimodal investment networks (MINs). These are large-scale coordinated investments in transportation projects across modes. The body of this report describes relevant literature and provides an overview of the developed methodology: (1) prioritization of the MINs, and (2) statistical comparison of modal plans. The analytical methodology developed will be of interest to multimodal transportation planning efforts across the nation, particularly where there is a need for systematic evidence-based approaches to coordinating the efforts of modal transportation agencies. Most data in the report are presented solely for purposes of demonstrating the methodology...|$|R
