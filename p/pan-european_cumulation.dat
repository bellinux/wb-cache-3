The lessons from Europe, however, cannot be applied directly as the degree of the European Union's supranationality is unthinkable elsewhere. This paper discusses how Europe overcame the specific problem of overlapping free trade agreements (FTAs) with the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Cumulation</b> System which instituted common rules of origin, regional cumulation of value, and completed the full matrix of bilateral FTAs. After this, Europe had what {{can be thought of}} as a "customs union" for rules of origin...|$|E
40|$|We analyse {{the impact}} of {{relaxing}} rules of origin (ROOs) in a simple setting with heterogeneous firms that buy intermediate inputs from domestic and foreign sources. In particular, we consider {{the impact of}} switching from bilateral to diagonal cumulation when using preferences (instead of paying the MFN tariff) involving the respect of rules of origin. We find that relaxing the restrictiveness of the ROOs leads the least productive exporters to stop exporting. The empirical part confirms these results. We use the most recent techniques developed by Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2007) on highly disaggregated data (HS 6 digit) to analyse {{the effects of the}} introduction of the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Cumulation</b> System (PECS). We find that PECS reverses the negative impact of strict ROOs on intermediate trade which turns positive as a consequence of introducing diagonal ROCs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we first explain why {{rules of origin}} are a {{necessary}} feature of preferential trading arrangements, but why they also serve to distort trade and can therefore be used for protectionist purposes, and why they have a powerful natural impetus towards strengthening the spaghetti bowl effect in international trade. Secondly, we then {{examine the impact of}} the relaxation of the potential constraining impact of rules of origin in the European context which was achieved through the introduction of the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Cumulation</b> system (PECS). We provide empirical evidence at both the aggregate and sectoral level which reveals the positive impact of the relaxation of rules of origin via the introduction of “diagonal cumulation” arrangements between the EU and its’ trading partners. Thirdly, the discussion turns to a consideration of appropriate policy options designed both to minimise the spaghetti bowl effect, and to maximise the benefits from regionalism for developing countries.

40|$|Within any {{preferential}} trade agreement (PTA) origin rules exist {{in order to prevent}} third countries from taking advantage of the PTA concessions. The rules thus are there to preserve the existing external protection of countries within the PTA. However, depending on their formulation, they can also increase that level of external protection, resulting in trade suppression and trade diversion. This paper provides the first serious empirical examination of the possible impact of rules of origin on patterns of trade in the European context. The methodology employed is that of an augmented gravity model where we focus on the impact within the <b>Pan-european</b> system of <b>cumulation.</b> The results suggest that rules of origin do indeed restrict trade, that the cumulation of such rules could increase trade in the order of 50 %, and that the impact is greater on intermediate than manufacturing trade. international trade, rules of origin, gravity model...|$|R

40|$|Preparations for {{granting}} EU {{membership to}} {{the countries of}} Central and Eastern Europe associated with the EU (CEEC) continued. The Commissioner for Agriculture presented a strategic paper on agriculture to the European Council in Madrid in December 1995. This paper estimates {{the costs of the}} Common Agricultural Policy for all 10 CEEC countries at ECU 9 billion in the year 2000, at ECU 12. 2 billion in 2010. The exclusion of compensation payments reduces the costs to ECU 3 billion. According to the Commission's estimates, the Eastern enlargement will not be a financial burden to the structural funds. One reform of the structural funds being considered is the introduction of ceilings for payments, measured in terms of GDP of the receiving country. Some deliberations on how to include the CEEC into the exchange rate mechanism of the EU (EMS II) have been set out. The European Council has charged the Commission in Madrid in December 1995 to work out a position (avis) regarding the membership applications from the Central and Eastern European countries and to present the following documents: a basic paper on Eastern enlargement, a detailed analysis of methods appropriate for the EU budget after the year 1999, and an analysis of possible transition rules. Negotiations with the CEEC are to start {{at the same time as}} those with Cyprus and Malta (i. e., six months after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference). On April 17, 1996, the European Parliament approved the "Oostlander" report, which supports EU membership of the candidates in Central and Eastern Europe. On June 25, 1996, the EU Council of Ministers proposed the introduction of a <b>pan-European</b> <b>cumulation,</b> an important step towards overcoming technical barriers in Europe. On July 10, 1996, the Europe agreement with Slovenia was signed, an agreement that has long been blocked by Italy. The interim agreement will come into effect at the beginning of 1997. On the same day, Slovenia applied for membership in the EU. Thus, the EU has signed Europe agreements with 10 Central and Eastern European countries, all of which have also applied for membership in the EU. Many studies have maintained that the first phase of Eastern enlargement (for about four countries) could be realized in the year 2003 or at the beginning of 2004. A working party instituted by Austria's government evaluated Austria's interests as follows: "In sum, the advantages which can be expected for Austria (from the Eastern enlargement), especially from our neighbors' accession to the EU, will clearly dominate the disadvantages.
