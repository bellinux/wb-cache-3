5|$|The <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> {{exists in}} both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the {{industrial}} revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths {{a better chance of}} surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> evolution.|$|E
5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which is of no special interest to the observer. Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of this period, the vast {{majority}} of <b>peppered</b> <b>moths</b> had light coloured wing patterns which effectively camouflaged them against the light-coloured trees and lichens upon which they rested. However, due to widespread pollution during the Industrial Revolution in England, many of the lichens died out, and the trees which <b>peppered</b> <b>moths</b> rested on became blackened by soot, causing most of the light-coloured moths, or typica, to die off due to predation. At the same time, the dark-coloured, or melanic, moths, carbonaria, flourished because they could hide on the darkened trees.|$|R
25|$|Similar {{results were}} found in America. Melanic forms have not been found in Japan. It is {{believed}} that this is because <b>peppered</b> <b>moths</b> in Japan do not inhabit industrialised regions.|$|R
5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|Some animals' colours and {{patterns}} resemble a particular natural background. This {{is an important}} component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling parakeets are mainly green; woodcocks of the forest floor are brown and speckled; reedbed bitterns are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animal's coloration matches the hues of its habitat. Similarly, desert animals are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the gerbil or fennec fox, birds such as the desert lark or sandgrouse, or reptiles like the skink or horned viper.Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example khaki uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.Many moths show industrial melanism, including the <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> which has coloration that blends in with tree bark. The coloration of these insects evolved between 1860 and 1940 to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas. This is taken by zoologists as evidence that camouflage is influenced by natural selection, as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.|$|E
25|$|The <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> (Biston betularia) is a {{temperate}} {{species of}} night-flying moth. <b>Peppered</b> <b>moth</b> evolution {{is an example}} of population genetics and natural selection.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>peppered</b> <b>moths,</b> a {{transposon}} in a gene called cortex {{caused the}} moths' wings to turn completely black. This change in coloration helped moths {{to blend in}} with ash and soot-covered areas during the Industrial Revolution.|$|R
25|$|P.A. Riley {{proposed}} an additional selective factor, where heavy metal chelation by melanin may protect <b>peppered</b> <b>moths</b> against the toxic effects of heavy metals associated with industrialisation.

25|$|One of {{the best}} known modern {{examples}} of the role that evolution has played in insect defenses is the link between melanism and the <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> (Biston betularia). <b>Peppered</b> <b>moth</b> evolution over the past two centuries in England has taken place, with darker morphs becoming more prevalent over lighter morphs so as {{to reduce the risk of}} predation. However, its underlying mechanism is still debated.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of the <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> {{over the last two}} hundred years has been studied in detail.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{because of}} cleaner air {{standards}} in Europe and North America, the dark-bodied moth is becoming less frequent, again demonstrating the adaptive {{shifts in the}} <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> population.|$|E
25|$|During an {{experiment}} in Cambridge over the seven years 2001–2007 Majerus noted the natural resting positions of <b>peppered</b> <b>moths,</b> and of the 135 moths examined over half were on tree branches, mostly on {{the lower half of}} the branch, 37% were on tree trunks, mostly on the north side, and only 12.6% were resting on or under twigs.|$|R

25|$|In 1924, J.B.S. Haldane calculated, using {{a simple}} general {{selection}} model, the selective advantage {{necessary for the}} recorded natural evolution of <b>peppered</b> <b>moths,</b> {{based on the assumption}} that in 1848 the frequency of dark-coloured moths was 2%, and by 1895 it was 95%. The dark-coloured, or melanic, form would have had to be 50% more fit than the typical, light-coloured form. Even taking into consideration possible errors in the model, this reasonably excluded the stochastic process of genetic drift, because the changes were too fast. Haldane's statistical analysis of selection for the melanic variant in <b>peppered</b> <b>moths</b> became a well known part of his effort to demonstrate that mathematical models that combined natural selection with Mendelian genetics could explain evolution — an effort that played a key role in the foundation of the discipline of population genetics, and the beginnings of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory with genetics.|$|R
25|$|Current {{interpretation}} of the available evidence is that the <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> {{is in fact a}} valid example of natural selection and adaptation. It illustrates a polymorphic species maintaining adaptation to a varied and sometimes changing environment.|$|E
25|$|Steward {{compiled}} {{data for}} the first recordings of the <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> by locality, and deduced that the carbonaria morph {{was the result of}} a single mutation that subsequently spread. By 1895, it had reached a reported frequency of 98% in Manchester.|$|E
25|$|Melanism has {{appeared}} in the European and North American <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> populations. Information about the rise in frequency is scarce. Much more is known about the subsequent fall in phenotype frequency, as it has been measured by lepidopterists using moth traps.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to this review, Majerus had {{stressed}} that the basic findings from that work were correct, and that differential bird predation of polluted environment [...] "is the primary influence {{of the evolution of}} melanism in the peppered moth".

Majerus found that the review did not reflect the factual content of the book or his own views, and cited an assessment by the entomologist Donald Frack that there was essentially no resemblance between the book and Coyne's review, which appeared to be a summary of the Sargent et al. paper rather than Majerus's book.|$|R

25|$|The <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> Biston betularia {{is also a}} {{model of}} {{parallel}} evolution {{in the incidence of}} melanism in the British form (f. carbonaria) and the American form (f. swettaria) as they are indistinguishable in appearance. Genetic analysis indicates that both phenotypes are inherited as autosomal dominants. Cross hybridizations indicate the phenotypes are produced by isoalleles at a single locus.|$|E
25|$|In Great Britain and Ireland, the <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> is {{univoltine}} (i.e., it has {{one generation}} per year), whilst in south-eastern North America it is bivoltine (two generations per year). The lepidopteran life cycle consists of four stages: ova (eggs), several larval instars (caterpillars), pupae, which overwinter live in the soil, and imagines (adults). During the day, the moths typically rest on trees, where they are preyed on by birds.|$|E
25|$|Bernard Kettlewell was {{the first}} to {{investigate}} the evolutionary mechanism behind <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> adaptation, between 1953 and 1956. He found that a light-coloured body was an effective camouflage in a clean environment, such as in Dorset, while the dark colour was beneficial in a polluted environment like in Birmingham. This selective survival was due to birds which easily caught dark moths on clean trees, and white moths on trees darkened with soot. The story, supported by Kettlewell's experiment, became the canonical example of Darwinian evolution and evidence for natural selection used in standard textbooks.|$|E
25|$|From their {{original}} data, Howlett and Majerus (1987) concluded that <b>peppered</b> <b>moths</b> generally rest in unexposed positions, using three main types of site. Firstly, {{a few inches}} below a branch-trunk joint on a tree trunk where the moth is in shadow; secondly, {{on the underside of}} branches and thirdly on foliate twigs. The above data would appear to support this.|$|R
25|$|In <b>peppered</b> <b>moths,</b> the allele for dark-bodied moths is dominant, {{while the}} allele for light-bodied moths is recessive, {{meaning that the}} typica moths have a {{phenotype}} (visible or detectable characteristic) that is only seen in a homozygous genotype (an organism that has two copies of the same allele), and never in a heterozygous one. This helps explain how dramatically quickly the population changed when being selected for dark colouration.|$|R
50|$|The ʻOlaʻa <b>Peppered</b> Looper <b>Moth</b> (Tritocleis microphylla) was a moth {{species of}} the family Geometridae. Its genus Tritocleis is monotypic.|$|R
25|$|The dark-coloured or melanic {{form of the}} <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> (var. carbonaria) was {{not known}} before 1811. After field {{collection}} in 1848 from Manchester, an industrial city in England, {{the frequency of the}} variety was found to have increased drastically. By the end of the 19th century it almost completely outnumbered the original light-coloured type (var. typica), with a record of 98% in 1895. The evolutionary importance of the moth was only speculated upon during Darwin's lifetime. It was 14 years after Darwin's death, in 1896, that J.W. Tutt presented it as a case of natural selection. Due to this, the idea widely spread, and more people believed in Darwin's theory.|$|E
25|$|The first {{important}} {{experiments on}} the <b>peppered</b> <b>moth</b> {{were carried out}} by Bernard Kettlewell at Oxford University, {{under the supervision of}} E. B. Ford, who helped him gain a grant from the Nuffield Foundation to perform the experiments. In 1953, Kettlewell started a preliminary experiment in which moths were released into a large (18 x 6m) aviary, where they were fed on by great tits (Parus major). His main experiment, at Cadbury Nature Reserve in Birmingham, England, involved marking, releasing and recapturing marked moths. He found that in this polluted woodland typica moths were preferentially preyed upon. He thus showed that the melanic phenotype was important to the survival of peppered moths in such a habitat. Kettlewell repeated the experiment in 1955 in unpolluted woodlands in Dorset and again in the polluted woods in Birmingham. He was accompanied by Nico Tinbergen, and they made a film together. In 1956 he repeated the experiments and found similar results; in Birmingham birds ate most of the white moths (75%), whereas in Dorset most of the dark moths (86%) were eaten.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{evolution}} hearings, in December 2000 after the Pratt County, Kansas, school board revised its tenth-grade biology curriculum {{at the urging of}} intelligent design proponents to include material that encourages students to question the theory of evolution, The Pratt Tribune published a letter from [...] Jerry Coyne challenging Wells's characterization in an article of his work on <b>peppered</b> <b>moths,</b> saying that his article appended to the Pratt standards was misused and being mischaracterized: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{experiment}} {{found that}} birds selectively prey on <b>peppered</b> <b>moths</b> {{depending on their}} body colour {{in relation to their}} environmental background. Thus, the evolution of a dark-coloured body provided a survival advantage in a polluted locality. The study concluded that [...] "industrial melanism in moths is the most striking evolutionary phenomenon ever actually witnessed in any organism, animal or plant." [...] It is now regarded as the classic demonstration of Charles Darwin's natural selection in action {{and one of the most}} beautiful experiments in evolutionary biology.|$|R
25|$|During the 1920s, {{a series}} of papers by J. B. S. Haldane applied {{mathematical}} analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in <b>peppered</b> <b>moths.</b> Haldane established that natural selection could work even faster than Fisher had assumed. Both workers, and others such as Dobzhansky and Wright, explicitly intended to bring biology up to the philosophical standard of the physical sciences, making it firmly based in mathematical modelling, its predictions confirmed by experiment. Natural selection, once considered hopelessly unverifiable speculation about history, was becoming predictable, measurable, and testable.|$|R
