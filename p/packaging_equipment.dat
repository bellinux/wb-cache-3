Combustion products include nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), CO2, and sulfur oxides (SOX). Potential emission sources include the sugar granulators, sugar conveying and <b>packaging</b> <b>equipment,</b> bulk loadout operations, boilers, granular carbon and char regeneration kilns, regenerated adsorbent transport systems, kilns and handling equipment (at some facilities), carbonation tanks, multi-effect evaporator stations, and vacuum boiling pans.

These items are put together at a predetermined facility to form a production line to manufacture critical war material.

In the residential sector, the major motor load is for refrigerators and freezers while <b>packaged</b> <b>equipment</b> dominate the motor load in the commercial market. However, this paper concentrates on the industrial market since 76 % of this market's load is motors. The poly phase integral horsepower motor is the "workhorse" of industry. The efficiency of the standard induction motor can be improved. The new "high efficiency" motor is described and the operating cost is compared to the standard motor. Payback for high efficiency motors {{is found to be}} about one year for continuous duty applications. Specific instructions are presented for use in industry...|$|R

40|$|The multi-year {{research}} study was initiated {{to find solutions}} to improve <b>packaged</b> <b>equipment</b> operating efficiency in the field. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), with funding from the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Building Technologies Office (BTO) and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) conducted this research, development and demonstration (RD&D) study. <b>Packaged</b> <b>equipment</b> with constant speed supply fans {{is designed to provide}} ventilation at the design rate at all times when the fan is operating as required by building code. Although {{there are a number of}} hours during the day when a building may not be fully occupied or the need for ventilation is lower than designed, the ventilation rate cannot be adjusted easily with a constant speed fan. Therefore, modulating the supply fan in conjunction with demand controlled ventilation (DCV) will not only reduce the coil energy but also reduce the fan energy. The objective of this multi-year research, development and demonstration project was to determine the magnitude of energy savings achievable by retrofitting existing packaged rooftop air conditioners with advanced control strategies not ordinarily used for packaged units. First, through detailed simulation analysis, it was shown that significant energy (between 24 % and 35 %) and cost savings (38 %) from fan, cooling and heating energy consumption could be realized when packaged air conditioning units with gas furnaces are retrofitted with advanced control packages (combining multi-speed fan control, integrated economizer controls and DCV). The simulation analysis also showed significant savings for heat pumps (between 20 % and 60 %). The simulation analysis was followed by an extensive field test of a retrofittable advanced rooftop unit (RTU) controller...|$|R
