5|$|Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, {{discovering}} that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One. Stark saves some surviving {{passengers and crew}} but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a <b>puppet</b> <b>leader,</b> following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the president and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian. After the battle, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit {{as a sign of}} his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing he will always be Iron Man.|$|E
25|$|Shogun Yoshimasa was {{succeeded by}} shogun Yoshihisa (Yoshimasa's natural son), then by Shogun Yoshitane (Yoshimasa's first adopted son), {{and then by}} shogun Yoshizumi (Yoshimasa's second adopted son). Yoshizumi's progeny would {{directly}} succeed him {{as head of the}} shogunate. In the future, power struggles from outside the clan would also lead to a brief period in which the great-grandson of Yoshitane would be installed as a <b>puppet</b> <b>leader</b> of the Ashikaga shogunate.|$|E
25|$|In July 1487, Grand Duke Ivan III of Moscow {{occupied}} Kazan {{and seated}} a <b>puppet</b> <b>leader,</b> Möxämmädämin, on the Kazan throne. After that, the Kazan Khanate became a protectorate of Moscow, and Russian merchants {{were allowed to}} trade freely throughout its territory. Supporters of a union between the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate tried to exploit the population's grievances to provoke revolts (in 1496, 1500, and 1505), but with negligible results.|$|E

40|$|European {{commissioner}} and previous Belgian minister of Foreign Affairs has argued about the difficult choice for international law which requires {{the use of}} military force. But are the present wars by US and NATO about peoples rights and law, or are they stages in the implementation of the Project for a New American Century, written by neocons before 9 / 11 ? The results are already visible: souvereign states are destroyed and replaced by chaotic jungles that benefit to corporations but not to the population, except a few <b>puppet</b> <b>leaders.</b> See Yougoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, Syria; Congo, Ivory Coast. A plea for international law is untrustworthy as long as Guantanamo, secret prisons, and crimes against humanity in Gaza, East-Jeruzalem, West-Bank and other occupied countries are not tackled...|$|R
40|$|Many {{assert that}} {{affluent}} countries have contributed {{in the past}} to poverty in developing countries through wars of aggression and conquest, colonialism and its legacies, the imposition of <b>puppet</b> <b>leaders,</b> and support for brutal dictators and venal elites. Thomas Pogge has recently argued that there is an additional and, arguably, even more consequential way in which the affluent continue to contribute to poverty in the developing world. He argues that when people cooperate in instituting and upholding institutional arrangements that foreseeably result in more severe or more widespread poverty or human rights deficits than would foreseeably result under feasible alternative arrangements, they are contributors to these harms. Because of this, he argues, they have stringent, contribution-based (or negative) duties to address this poverty. We will call this the ‘Feasible Alternatives Thesis' (FAT), and our aim in this article is to examine it criticall...|$|R
25|$|In late 865, the Vikings {{landed in}} East Anglia {{and used it}} as a {{starting}} point for an invasion. The East Anglians made peace with the invaders by providing them with horses. The Vikings stayed in East Anglia for the winter before setting out for Northumbria towards the end of 866, establishing themselves at York. In 867, the Northumbrians paid them off, and the Viking Army established a <b>puppet</b> <b>leader</b> in Northumbria before setting off for the Kingdom of Mercia, where in 867 they captured Nottingham. The king of Mercia requested help from the king of Wessex to help fight the Vikings. A combined army from Wessex and Mercia besieged the city of Nottingham with no clear result, so the Mercians settled on paying the Vikings off. The Vikings returned to Northumbria in autumn 868 and overwintered in York, staying there for most of 869. They returned to East Anglia and spent the winter of 869–70 at Thetford. There was no peace agreement between the East Anglians and the Vikings this time. When the local king Edmund fought against the invaders, he was captured and killed.|$|E

5000|$|How the Federation came {{to power}} was never clearly stated in the series, though in the episode [...] "Countdown" [...] it was {{mentioned}} that it was formed some 200 years before the main rebel attack on [...] "Control" [...] (see below). The Federation primarily expanded its territory though conquest, enslaving weaker worlds and exploiting their resources to fuel the military. In other cases, the Federation would infiltrate more distant worlds where they would help a local tyrant achieve power or install a malleable ruler (episodes [...] "Bounty" [...] and [...] "Horizon"). These <b>puppet</b> <b>leaders</b> would rule over their own planets, but under the constant shadow of the main Federation and their planets would eventually {{become part of the}} Federation. How far the Federation's power spread was never clearly indicated either, as mentioned in the series there were many [...] "neutral worlds" [...] in existence.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to O'Conor's actions, the chiefs of the lesser clans {{of the area}} such as those at Moylurg and Muintir Eolais, traditionally vassals of the O'Conors and the O'Rourkes, were removed and replaced with <b>puppet</b> <b>leaders</b> by Cúchonnacht. He effectively ruled by decree and garnered {{a reputation as a}} tyrant. One such instance that provoked outrage across the province was an unscrupulous deal in 1242 in which Cúchonnacht supported the claim of Tadhg O'Conor, a rival claimant to Felim, on the condition that he, as king of Connacht, renounce all claims to Breifne. By the Autumn of 1242, when it had become apparent that Tadhg had garnered little support for his claim and was no longer of any use to Cúchonnacht, he was seized and imprisoned. In the spring of 1243, Cúchonnacht ordered the young prince to be blinded and castrated. This drove Felim to throw more support behind the O'Rourkes and their claim to Breifne.|$|R
50|$|Griffin was {{leader of}} his city during its peak, and {{proved to be}} a capable ruler. However his term of office {{proved to be a}} short one. Early in the Apocalypse War of 2104 he was {{captured}} by the enemy and brainwashed, {{to be used as a}} <b>puppet</b> quisling <b>leader</b> for propaganda purposes, to encourage the surrender of the war-weary population. Since a rescue operation would have been impossible, Dredd found it necessary to assassinate him instead. Griffin actually managed to fight back through the brainwashing to confess his guilt live on air just before this event.|$|R

50|$|Paleckis {{was born}} in Telšiai in 1899. In 1926-1927, he was a {{director}} of the Lithuanian official news agency, ELTA. He later voiced opposition to the ruling elite in Lithuania; in this way, he became a suitable candidate for the Lithuanian communists (manipulated by Soviet envoy Vladimir Dekanozov) to become the <b>puppet</b> <b>leader</b> of Lithuania in the Soviets' planned takeover of the country in 1940.|$|E

In Versus mode, though {{he has a very}} simple moveset, his high agility and attack priority allow him to be played aggressively.|$|R
50|$|Mansur's oppressive {{taxation}} policies {{sparked a}} revolt in Sistan {{within a year}} of his appointment. The garrison at Zaranj was destroyed, and Abu Salih Mansur was captured. Amr ibn Ya'qub, a Saffarid, was installed, first as a <b>puppet</b> for the <b>leader</b> of the rebellion, then as amir in his own right. A Samanid army, however, under the control of Husain ibn 'Ali Marvarrudhi restored Samanid control to the region. 'Amr was sent to Samarkand; the other rebel leaders were killed.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{eleven years}} of Indira's {{position}} {{as prime minister}} saw her evolving from the perception of being <b>puppet</b> of party <b>leaders</b> to the one with iron resolve to split the party for her policy positions or {{to go to war}} with Pakistan to liberate Bangladesh. At the end of this term in 1977 she was such a dominating figure in Indian politics that a Congress party president had coined the phrase [...] "India is Indira and Indira is India." ...|$|R

500|$|Viewing {{the history}} of the world as {{the history of}} warfare between secret societies, {{conspiracy}} theorists go further than Rothkopf, and other scholars who have studied the global power elite, by claiming that established upper-class families with [...] "old money" [...] who founded and finance the Bilderberg Group, Bohemian Club, Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, Rhodes Trust, Skull and Bones, Trilateral Commission, and similar think tanks and private clubs, are illuminated conspirators plotting to impose a totalitarian New World Order—the implementation of an authoritarian world government controlled by the United Nations and a global central bank, which maintains political power through the financialization of the economy, regulation and restriction of speech through the concentration of media ownership, mass surveillance, widespread use of state terrorism, and an all-encompassing propaganda that creates a cult of personality around a <b>puppet</b> world <b>leader</b> and ideologizes world government as the culmination of history's progress.|$|R
50|$|After the Vietnamese {{government}} arrested Montagnards {{a demonstration}} {{was started in}} Chu Prong county by the Montagnards in the Central Highlands consisting of around 500 people in February 2001. Vietnam accused them of plotting for autonomy and accused them of trying to stir up ethnic animosity, and launched an anti-Highlander military operation. The traditional lands of the Central Highland had been taken by the Vietnamese and the Central Highland demonstrators had asked for it back. The Vietnamese government refused to return the lands and instead attacked the demonstrators, arresting hundreds and assaulting and pummeling the demonstrators. The Vietnamese military {{took charge of the}} Central Highlands, severing telephone lines and keeping heavy watch over travel within the area. The Bahnar, Rhade, and Raglai participated in the mass demonstrations against the Vietnamese. They carried no weapons while they started their mass protests. The natives regard the <b>puppet</b> <b>leaders</b> placed in their communities by the Vietnamese Communist government as collaborators who help persecute the natives for the Vietnamese. The tribal customs of the highlanders are ignored by the Vietnamese government which shows no regard for the traditional leaders of the Highlanders. The natives of the Central Highlands are mired in poverty and the Vietnamese are richer than them and are subjected to starvation. The Vietnamese government seized the land of the natives in the Central Highlands for Vietnamese settlers and coffee companies. They severely limited the amount of land farmed by the Highlanders and drove them away. Vietnamese colonizers also directly seize land from the natives in addition to the coffee companies. The policies of the Vietnamese government impede the natives while helping the Vietnamese colonizers. The lumber and coffee companies are assisted by the Vietnamese government. Vietnamese government workers embezzle and steal aid meant for the Central Highlanders. After these provocations, when Buon xer village was seized by Vietnamese colonizers, they were attacked by the Rhade when the straw finally broke the camel's back on August 8, 2000. The massive amount of Vietnamese colonizers and land theft was the impetus for the mass 2001 demonstrations against the Vietnamese. Rahlan Djan and Rahlan Pon were the two Montagnards who were abused and arrested by the Vietnamese and ex-FULRO member Ksor Kok helped bring attention to their plight.|$|R

50|$|Bruno Diaz is the {{governor}} of the U.S.N. state, Venezuela. As a <b>puppet</b> <b>leader</b> following the orders of the U.S.N. Central Government, Bruno had extensive connections to the mafia and foreign sources. He used these sources to oppress the Venezuelan people and made himself wealthy by robbing them of their money. Diaz, however, desired to break away from the U.S.N. and accepted military support from an unknown foreign source to make it happen. Bruno is also referenced in Front Mission 5: Scars of the War.|$|E
50|$|Obregón {{had been}} more lenient to Catholics during his time in office, but the Cristeros and almost {{everyone}} else believed that Calles was his <b>puppet</b> <b>leader.</b> In 1927, two of León Toral's friends Humberto and Miguel Pro were executed after having been wrongly convicted of plotting to assassinate Obregón. Thus, having been incited by a Catholic nun, Concepción Acevedo de la Llata (also known as Madre Conchita), he decided to assassinate Obregón, whom he blamed for the Mexican government's atrocities against the Catholic Church, if Obregón was reelected.|$|E
50|$|Personal rivalries (especially between {{erstwhile}} allies Goukouni and Habré) {{limited the}} government's effectiveness {{and contributed to}} the perception of Goukouni as an indecisive <b>puppet</b> of Libyan <b>leader</b> Muammar Gaddafi. There was even a Libyan proposal to annex Chad, which drew opposition from all ideological camps. In a last-ditch attempt to salvage his beleaguered government, Goukouni appointed Djidingar Dono Ngardoum as prime minister on 19 May 1982. The GUNT was, however, overthrown by Habré loyalists on 7 June 1982. Goukouni fled from N'Djamena across the Chari River into Cameroon; he subsequently went into exile in Tripoli, Libya. Acyl died in an unrelated accident, and Kamougué lost much of his base as Habré consolidated his power into a centralized military dictatorship.|$|R

60|$|Dane fancied {{that he was}} {{the only}} one in the party who had guessed the girl's secret; and he might not have done so but that sympathy quickened his perceptions, for he also had loved Carsluith Maxwell. He felt that it might be well for Bonita Castro if she heard everything, and he roused himself to do his fallen comrade justice. Thus the dead man moved an heroic figure through all the kaleidoscopic happenings. The rest, black and brown, were lay figures, himself a <b>puppet</b> obeying the <b>leader's</b> will; and, when the {{narrative}} concluded, Dane felt that if others now knew his comrade as he had known him he was satisfied. Remembering what he had seen he could, he fancied, read by the light of it what was passing in Bonita Castro's mind. At times she listened with quivering lips, then a moisture gathered in her eyes, which nevertheless glittered with a curious pride, and he thought her superb when at last, with a glance only, she thanked the bringer of the news.|$|R
50|$|The {{revolt against}} the French served to {{strengthen}} the bond between the pro-French Hmong leaders and their colonial rulers for another generation. Kiatong LoBliaYao (Lauj Npliaj Yob), a French loyalist and <b>puppet</b> <b>leader,</b> extorted many silver bars from {{those who had been}} loyal to Pa Chay Vue in exchange for their lives, an action that many Hmong still remember even today, and which also ultimately caused his power to be given to Touby Lyfoung, his nephew.

Pépé {{considers}} Marshal Philippe Pétain, the <b>puppet</b> <b>leader</b> ruling France under Germany’s thumb, a hero. Pépé attempts to pass his anti-Semitic convictions on to the boy. The boy plays along with the old man, teasing him about his prejudices but never revealing the truth about himself.|$|E

Norwegian Nazi <b>puppet</b> <b>leader</b> Vidkun Quisling ordered all Norwegian ships to sail to German, Italian or neutral ports. He was ignored. All Norwegian ships decided to serve at the disposal of the Allies.

50|$|Elections {{were held}} in Jersey on 30 August 1940. The island was {{occupied}} by the Germans from 1 July 1940 until the surrender of the German forces on 9 May 1945. During this time, there was one election, held soon after the occupation began. The result installed <b>puppet</b> <b>leader</b> Edward Campbell as a front for the German administration, which was centered around the department of Manche. Also standing was Thomas Jenkins. The election was unique in that only two candidates stood to represent the entire island. The post voted for was short lived, and the Nazis removed it in 1942 to little reaction from the islanders, and Campbell returned to his suffering business. He later went broke and died {{before the end of}} the war.|$|E

However, the initial casus belli was claimed to be support for a Kuwaiti rebellion. An Iraqi-backed <b>puppet</b> <b>leader</b> named Alaa Hussein Ali was installed {{as head of the}} [...] "Provisional Government of Free Kuwait." [...] Iraq annexed Kuwait on 8 August. The war was traumatic to the Kuwaiti population. The underground resistance was punished by summary executions and torture. Almost all Kuwaitis at the time lost some family member.
