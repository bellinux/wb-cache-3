While the proposal had its proponents, it was controversial as in a ground-attack capacity Iraq might have employed the Hawk against neighbouring Iran and to oppress Iraq's own Kurdish population; there was also concern that the Hawk could be potentially armed with chemical weapons. After considerable deliberation the sale was blocked. In 2010, Iraq entered talks with BAE for an order of up to 21 Hawks.|$|E

50|$|To {{deal with}} this and other <b>prospective</b> <b>sales</b> of gold reserves, a {{consortium}} of central banks - including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England - were pushed to sign the Washington Agreement on Gold in September 1999, limiting gold sales to 400 tonnes per year for 5 years. This triggered a sharp rise {{in the price of}} gold, from around US$260 per ounce to around $330 per ounce in two weeks, before the price fell away again into 2000 and early 2001.

5000|$|It {{is during}} the <b>prospective</b> <b>sale</b> of these bonds (in February 1990) that Armacon Securities' cash {{holdings}} increased from $4,600 to $412,000; Armacon's assets skyrocketed from $10,100 to $665,577 and their net capital increased {{in similar fashion}} from $8,100 to $395,710. [...] Armacon Securities prospered greatly while performing extremely little underwriting during this period. In 1991, the following year, Armacon took in $727,800 in underwriting fees, while its total operating expenses were less than $50,000. The firm operated without any staff to sell the bonds, no clients to buy the bonds and very little capital with which to finance an inventory.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the French Air Force and Navy were seeking to replace and {{consolidate}} their current fleets of aircraft. In {{order to reduce}} development costs and boost <b>prospective</b> <b>sales,</b> France entered into an arrangement with UK, Germany, Italy and Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose fighter, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing requirements led to France's pursuit of its own development program. Dassault built a technology demonstrator which first flew in July 1986 {{as part of an}} eight-year flight-test programme, paving the way for the go-ahead of the project. The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its era in that it is almost entirely built by one country, involving most of France's major defence contractors, such as Dassault, Thales and Safran.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{compliance}} and regulation has been number one threat; {{not only for}} the area of financial services, but also across a spectrum of sectors, ranging from oil and gas, through life sciences and technology to automotive. The main reason for the tougher stand against corrupt business practices is the increased enforcement actions against companies. When companies go global and extend their network in different countries, they will surely get into business relationships with third parties, especially sales intermediaries. Therefore, all companies have to pay special attention to the selection process of their ethical business partners. A systematic detailed check of the <b>prospective</b> <b>sales</b> intermediaries questioning their economical, legal and ethical aspects, aiming to reveal any issue which could cast doubt on the integrity is called due diligence. This costly examination usually carried forth by external professionals has become a business standard of almost all multi-national companies. In this study, a practical decision support tool using pattern recognition of artificial neural networks is developed to assist companies in their selection of sales intermediaries by way of minimizing any future risk of a {{compliance and}} regulation violation, which could result in severe sanctions and punishments against such companies...|$|R
5000|$|The Hawkins {{sections}} {{were written by}} Twain; these include several humorous sketches. Examples are the steamboat race {{that leads to a}} wreck (Chapter IV) and Laura’s toying with a clerk in a Washington bookstore (Chapter XXXVI). Notable too is the comic presence throughout the book of the eternally optimistic and eternally broke Micawber-like character, Colonel Beriah Sellers. The character was named Escol Sellers in the first edition and changed to Beriah when an actual George Escol Sellers of Philadelphia objected. A real Beriah Sellers then also turned up, causing Twain to use the name Mulberry Sellers in The American Claimant. The Sellers character was modeled after Twain's maternal cousin, James Lampton, and the land-purchase plot parallels Twain's father's purchase of a Tennessee parcel whose <b>prospective</b> <b>sale,</b> Twain wrote in his autobiography, [...] "kept us hoping and hoping, during 40 years, and forsook us at last".|$|E

40|$|Packaging {{is often}} called as the fifth P of the {{marketing}} mix. Chocolate is a product which is loved to be consumed irrespective of any age group. Consumers were asked to imagine that a new chocolate bar has been launched {{in the market and}} were yet to sense (sight or taste) it or a chocolate bar which was already launched in the market and were yet to sense (sight or taste) it. The present study explored different chocolate packaging cues that could possibly influence the purchase decision of young consumers in such a scenario. Descriptive research with convenient sampling elicited 240 responses across the age group lying between 11 to 27 years. Results showed that an attractive package design was of paramount significance in first purchase of chocolate bars. The important factors which affected the buying decision were ‘Information’ and ‘Visual aesthetics’. However it was found that chocolate packaging had less influence on subsequent purchase of chocolate bars. It was also inferred that an attractive package along with a strong advertising campaign could bring <b>prospective</b> <b>sales</b> for a newly launched chocolate bar. The study also discussed the influence of chocolate packaging for national and international brands across various demographic variables...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{intends to}} find the {{specific}} factors about the supplier/manufacturer’s that are of concern to the customer in the wider supply chain network. It will also study how these factors affect the sales of CED products. This paper portrays the beliefs of customer about the upstream supplier/ manufacturer and its influence {{on the sale of}} white goods and consumer electronics in Oman by using a questionnaire containing questions about the supplier/ manufacturer. Discriminant analysis has been used for predicting a function that throws light on the likely sales. The model was successful in finding a discriminating function that throws light on the effect of supplier/ manufacturer’s profile on the sales of CED products in Oman region. It was able to predict the effect of the specific factors about the supplier/manufacturer’s on the <b>prospective</b> <b>sales</b> of CED products. The sample survey had been administered to 120 customers chosen randomly, 60 from Hyper Markets and 60 from specialized stores in Oman dealing with CED products. Many researchers have dealt with the supply chain problems pertaining to transportation and inventory for the upstream activities. Procurementproblems are also taken up but from the perspective of manufacturer. This paper is an attempt to deal with procurement issues {{from the perspective of the}} customer...|$|R
5|$|Since 1990, Burger King has {{continued}} using Coca-Cola as its beverage supplier, renewing its contract in several times. The Coca-Cola contract {{is not without}} its problems; the 1999 contract called for the Coca-Cola branded Icee products to be made a permanent menu item in all American locations. After the rollout, it was discovered that Coca-Cola employees had faked product test information to bolster <b>prospective</b> <b>sales</b> numbers in an effort to entice franchisees to enroll in a summertime advertising push. Several Coke employees were terminated, and Coca-Cola changed the in-store promotional materials to emphasize the Icee name. The 2003 contract officially extended {{the relationship between the two}} companies so that Coca-Cola was the exclusive supplier of soft drinks for the company. Before this, individual international franchises would negotiate their own contracts with their company of choice. The 2003 contract gave Coca-Cola new access to the 3,000 operating or planned restaurants on the Asia-Pacific rim, in Europe, and in South and Central America. The purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital lead to a change in the beverage contract for the Caribbean and Latin America markets. 3G, which owns AmBev and is the producer and distributor of PepsiCo products in the region, started cross-licensing between its two companies in April 2011 and switched to Pepsi in these markets.|$|R
