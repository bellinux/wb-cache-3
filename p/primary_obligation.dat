Though Kepler took {{a dim view of}} the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.|$|E

2500|$|Alfred the Alien (the only {{politician}} {{to admit he}} came from outer space) ran in 1988 in Coast Capilano {{on a platform of}} [...] "Safe sex, prescription drugs, and easy listening" [...] – an update to the original party tag line of [...] "sex, drugs, and rock'n roll". He also coined the slogan: [...] "The <b>primary</b> <b>obligation</b> of a political party is to have one". While campaigning, he always wore a tuxedo, but with baggy grey sweat pants and a cummerbund festooned with 'rhinostones', as well as a grey headdress with an outsized horn adorned with a condom. He supported global warming as part of the savannafication process to create better Rhino habitat on the prairies. He also supported free trade – to trade Baffin Island for Maui, or Brian Mulroney for some peace and quiet. Another plan was to advocate for Canadian citizenship for Jose Cuervo – Rhinos drank so much tequila that it seemed reasonable to recognize Jose as truly Canadian.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} paper the authors analyze the {{relationship}} between international immunities and funamental human rights from a particular methodological angle. They maintain that the difficulty in dealing with that issue mainly lies in the asymmetry {{in the development of}} the international law of human rights, which has created individual substantive rights without creating a corresponding set of remedies. At the level of primary norms, international law has developed, and continues to develop, substantive rules granting rights and duties to individuals; however, the secondary level, concerning the consequences of the breach of such <b>primary</b> <b>obligations</b> and the mechanisms of enforcement, is still largely inspired by the classical inter-State philosophy. This shortcoming can explain the troubled relationship between sovereign immunity and fundamental human rights, with resct to both State immunity and State organs’ immunity...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent report}} issued from the Institute of Medicine {{contains}} an extensive analysis of financial {{conflicts of interest}} (FCOIs) in biomedical science. In brief, an FCOI exists when a profit-seeking motive either unduly influences or appears to influence an academic scientist’s <b>primary</b> <b>obligations.</b> The cornerstone of current policy to address FCOIs at academic medical centers (AMCs) is disclosure; however, disclosure {{does not appear to}} appropriately regulate, manage, or eliminate FCOIs. Although the relationships between intramural scientists and industry and extramural scientists and industry may be structurally different, they both can lead to FCOIs that threaten scientific integrity. Overall, the NIH policies governing FCOIs for intramural scientists are much stricter than those applied in AMCs. This Essay proposes that the NIH policies for intramural scientists {{can be used as a}} template to create default rules in AMCs that govern the extramural scientist-private company relationship...|$|R
