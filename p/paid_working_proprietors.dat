40|$|<b>Paid</b> <b>working</b> {{patterns}} are currently regulated by governments {{around the world}} for a range of social and economic reasons: to increase labour supply and skills; to provide a strong tax base to support an ageing population; to help people reconcile work and family life over increasingly diversified life courses; and to be in line with the general principle of the activating, employment led welfare state. Environmental considerations rarely feature in the design or evaluation of working time policy. Nevertheless, various authors working on policies for sustainable development argue that reductions in average <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> time could lead to environmental benefits: as people work less, they in turn earn less, and so consume less, resulting in lower environmental impacts from lower levels of production of products. This thesis takes this argument as its starting point, and synthesises these distinct perspectives on working time and its regulation to address two key questions: what level of environmental benefits could arise from such reductions in <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> time?; and what are the implications for the design of working time policy? The research addresses these questions, taking the case of greenhouse gas emissions, and the UK and the Netherlands in the early 2000 s as case studies. Using household expenditure survey data and data on product emissions intensities, the relationship between <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> time and emissions is analysed at both the household and national levels. At the household level, statistically and substantively significant correlations are found between higher levels of paid work and higher levels of consumption and so greenhouse gas emissions. The effects on emissions of hypothetical changes in the working patterns of the national populations are then modelled. The research estimates that meeting current national objectives to increase labour market participation rates would increase national greenhouse gas emissions by 0. 6 - 0. 7...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} causes and {{consequences}} of <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> hours and housework hours among {{women and men in}} Sweden and Europe. It consists of four studies. Study I investigates changes in the division of housework in Swedish couples when they become parents. The study shows that women adjust their housework hours to the number and age of children in the household, whereas men do not. Longer parental leave periods among fathers have the potential to counteract this change towards a more traditional division of housework. Study II explores the associations between psychological distress and <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> hours, housework hours and total role time in Sweden. The results suggest that women’s psychological distress decreases with increasing <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> hours and housework hours, but that a long total role time is associated with high levels of distress. The gender difference in time spent on housework accounts for 40 per cent of the gender difference in psychological distress. Study III asks whether hours spent on paid work and housework account for the European gender difference in well-being, and whether the associations between well-being and hours of paid work and housework is influenced by gender attitudes and social comparison. The results indicate that gender differences in time spent on paid work and housework account for a third of the gender difference in well-being. Gender attitudes and social comparison do not to any great extent influence the associations between well-being and paid work and housework, respectively. Study IV examines possible differences between European family policy models in the associations between well-being and hours of paid work and housework. Some model differences are found, and they are accounted for by experiences of work-family conflict among men, but not among women. For both women and men, work-family conflict appears to suppress positive aspects of <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> hours...|$|R

While industries {{play a key role}} in the field of input-output analysis, the structure of employees remains more or less unconsidered. The present study aims to combine particular information regarding employees' working time with traditional instruments of input-output analysis. In so doing, employees (and the corresponding <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> hours) are separated by industries, educational achievements and gender. This, in turn, allows for the identification of women's and men's contributions to satisfying different categories of final demand. In total, men's <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> hours significantly exceed women's labour input. However, societies rely likewise on paid and unpaid work. Therefore, the study finally accounts for the field of unpaid work, which - in Germany - is still dominated by women. Input-output analysis, Gross Domestic Product, time use, gender,...|$|R

In the context of local authority commissioning and constrained budgets the combination of EM and ZHC’s may excise so-called ‘unproductive’ but available labour from homecare. In particular the minute-by-minute commissioning of care that EM facilitates means the cost of homecare is anchored in the time that worker’s spend in client’s houses, squeezing out paid travel, time between visits, training and supervision. <b>Paid</b> <b>working</b> time is minimised whilst maximising {{the use of}} unpaid time between visits with resulting intensification of care labour...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Since the April 1994 {{elections}} {{the issue}} of economic empowerment and growth have had a high priority {{on the agenda of}} the Government of National Unity of South Africa. Small and medium enterprises (SME's) represent an important vehicle to address the challenges of job creation, economic growth and equity in our country. Throughout the world one finds that SME's are playing a critical role in absorbing labour, penetrating new markets and generally expanding economies in creative and innovative ways. Research indicates that there are more than 800 000 small and medium enterprises in South Africa, absorbing {{about a quarter of the}} approximately 15 million people which comprises the formal labour force. According to the White Paper on National Strategy for the Development and Promotion of Small Business in South Africa (1995 : 10), this does not include about 3, 5 million people who are involved in some or other type of survivalist enterprise activity force. While the importance of large industrial, mining and other enterprises for the growth of the economy cannot be denied, there is ample evidence that the labour absorptive capacity of the small business sector is high, with the average capital cost per job created in this sector, usually being lower than in big businesses. In addition the small business sector's role in technical and other innovations is vital for the many challenges facing the South African economy. Notwithstanding the importance of small enterprises in the South African economy, they are still faced with a wide range of constraints and problems that are common to small enterprises. There can be no doubt that compared to big businesses in South Africa and small businesses in other countries, these problems have not been sufficiently addressed. The constraints relate, amongst others, to the legal and regulatory environment confronting SME's, the access to markets, finance, the acquisition of skills and management expertise and in some cases, the tax burden. This study will be aimed at addressing the problems that small enterprises experience with the South African Tax System. The dissertation is based on various Acts as effective during April 1997. Various factors were identified in the Interim Report of the Commission of Inquiry into certain aspects of the Tax Structure of South Africa, (Katz, November 1994 : 150) under the chairmanship of Prof. M. M. Katz. These factors include, amongst others, the following: Small and medium-sized enterprises have a greater dependence on the <b>working</b> <b>proprietor</b> as a source of funds, since they do not have access to public securities markets for {{the issue of}} equity or long term loan capital. The taxation of the income of the <b>working</b> <b>proprietor</b> therefore directly depletes their principal source of equity capital, requiring the entrepreneur to make greater use of short term debt finance. This in turn increases their risk exposure; Whereas savings which flow via financial institutions (for example, through pension and life insurance contributions) to the corporate sector enjoys tax relief, no equivalent relief is available to <b>working</b> <b>proprietors</b> who invest in their own businesses; There is considerable evidence that the compliance burden of taxation falls disproportionately on smaller enterprises, who do not have expertise in the completion of tax returns or in other aspects of tax compliance, and either make use of expensive professional assistance or rely on the proprietor's own efforts. The compliance burden is aggravated by frequent changes in the tax system, complicated structures and rules, and the lack of taxpayer education opportunities. The problem of the compliance burden on smaller enterprises has probably become more severe in recent years as a consequence of the introduction of Value Added Tax and the fact Jiat the present Standard Income Tax on Employees personal income tax requires more detailed personnel records than the former Final Deduction System which it replaced; The general bias in tax systems towards favouring capital investment and penalising employment through investment relief and social security contributions tends to favour large firms, which have easier access to sources of capital, and discriminates against smaller firms which tend to be more labour intensive...|$|R

30|$|From the {{regression}} {{on the number}} of hours spent in paid market activities, one can see that the bigger determinants of weekly <b>paid</b> <b>working</b> hours are wage and living in urban areas.

The impact is more evident in Bolivia, where men’s coefficient is multiplied by 2 compared to Ecuador and Guatemala. The significant negative impact of the person’s ethnic origin in Guatemala, reflects the restricted access of the indigenous population to labor markets. The effect is stronger for female indigenous workers who in average work 10 hours less in paid marked activities than the rest of the population.|$|R
