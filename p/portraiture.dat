5|$|While devotional {{paintings}} – especially altarpieces – remained {{dominant in}} Early Netherlandish art, secular <b>portraiture</b> became increasingly common in both {{northern and southern}} Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that <b>portraiture</b> should be restricted to saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of humanism.|$|E
5|$|In {{many of the}} images, {{figures are}} shadowed, blurred, or {{otherwise}} nearly invisible, a form of <b>portraiture</b> that for Andrade {{became a kind of}} modernist sublime.|$|E
5|$|Parthian art, {{with its}} {{distinct}} use of frontality in <b>portraiture,</b> was lost and abandoned with the profound {{cultural and political}} changes brought by the Sassanid Empire. However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in <b>portraiture</b> continued to flourish there. This is exemplified by the early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the Dura-Europos synagogue, a temple {{in the same city}} dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local Mithraeum.|$|E

5|$|By all accounts, {{infidelity}} {{was responsible}} for the breakup of van Meegeren’s marriage to Anna de Voogt; they were divorced on 19 July 1923. Anna left with the children and moved to Paris where van Meegeren visited his children from time to time. He now dedicated himself to <b>portraiture</b> and began producing forgeries to increase his income.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster House, an opulent government-owned period {{house in}} London, was rented (at £20,000 per day) for {{interior}} scenes of Buckingham Palace. The 1936 Accession Council at St. James's Palace, where George VI swore an oath, was filmed in the Livery Hall of Drapers' Hall. The room, ornate and vast, met the occasion: the daunting {{nature of the}} new King's responsibilities was shown by surrounding him with rich detail, flags and royal <b>portraiture.</b>|$|E

50|$|Miniature {{painting}} flourished during Mughal rule. Emperor Jahangir and Shahjahan {{were great}} patrons of art. In their courts, the painters adopted themes ranging from <b>portraitures</b> to landses, durbar scenes and processions for their works. The Deccani style was {{a fusion of}} Islaamic idiom with indigenous art styles and of local classical traditions with elements of Persian and European Renaissance.|$|R
5|$|<b>Portraiture</b> was an {{important}} component of Rodin's oeuvre, helping him to win acceptance and financial independence. His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he produced at least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917. Early subjects included fellow sculptor Jules Dalou (1883) and companion Camille Claudel (1884).|$|E
5|$|Wright is {{currently}} rated {{as one of}} the leading indigenous British painters of his generation, largely for the distinctive realism in his <b>portraiture.</b> Perhaps due to the unusually cosmopolitan nature of his experience, he was favoured by patrons at the highest level of society in an age in which foreign artists were usually preferred. Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are included amongst the collections of many leading galleries today.|$|E
5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued. The art of mummy <b>portraiture</b> flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not {{to the extent that}} the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{none was}} intended. But you may observe that artists in all ages have sought for higher types of models in {{painting}} {{women who have}} been violent or criminal, than have sufficed for them in their <b>portraitures</b> of gentleness and virtue. Look at all the Judiths, and the Lucretias, and the Charlotte Cordays; how much finer the women are than the Madonnas and the Saint Cecilias." ...|$|R
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for <b>portraiture</b> had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. Adam de Colone, perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and {{probably}} trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 he painted his portrait of George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons and another of Seaton's wife Anne Hay with her two daughters.|$|E
5|$|John Graham-Gilbert (1794–1866) {{was born}} in Glasgow {{and worked in the}} city from 1834, playing an {{important}} part in the professionalisation of painting there. Other figures to pursue their careers largely in <b>portraiture</b> and based in Glasgow included Daniel Macnee (1806–82). He moved to Edinburgh after his election of President of the Academy in 1876. Other major figures who worked in <b>portraiture</b> included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803–69), William Quiller Orchardson (1832–1910) and John Pettie (1839–93). John Zephaniah Bell (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists of the later nineteenth century. Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) produced some landscapes, but also portraits before he finally moved to London in 1831. David Wilkie (1785–1841) worked mainly in London, and produced the flattering painting of the King George IV in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. He succeeded Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823 and would emerge {{of one of the most}} influential British artists of the century.|$|E
5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples of secular <b>portraiture</b> in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E

A warning at its start advises viewers of the film's content and explains the necessity of displaying the images to allow both an understanding of the graphic nature of the handful of provocative pictures that prompted Barrie's arrest and an appreciation for the overall beauty of the photographer's <b>portraitures</b> and depictions of nature.|$|R

5|$|Van der Weyden {{developed}} {{the conventions of}} northern <b>portraiture</b> and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter.|$|E
5|$|Women of the emperor's {{family were}} often {{depicted}} dressed as goddesses or divine personifications such as Pax ("Peace"). <b>Portraiture</b> in painting is represented {{primarily by the}} Fayum mummy portraits, which evoke Egyptian and Roman traditions of commemorating the dead with the realistic painting techniques of the Empire. Marble portrait sculpture would have been painted, and while traces of paint have only rarely survived the centuries, the Fayum portraits indicate why ancient literary sources marvelled at how lifelike artistic representations could be.|$|E
5|$|An {{inventory}} {{drawn up}} at the Hôtel de la Reine after Catherine's death shows her {{to have been a}} keen collector. Listed works of art included tapestries, hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, ebony furniture inlaid with ivory, sets of china, and Limoges pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by Jean Clouet (1480–1541) and his son François Clouet (1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court. After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French <b>portraiture</b> set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.|$|E
50|$|By the mid-1970s, Kostin {{had lost}} most {{interest}} in the construction industry, and was frustrated with the low fixed salary. He professed that he enjoys photography, specifically <b>portraitures,</b> and {{won a gold medal}} for a portrait of his wife in Kiev′s annual photographic exhibition. He had subsequently entered into at least 80 such exhibitions and photographic road-shows throughout the world. Kostin’s career as an amateur photographer earned him more than twice the amount of salary than his career as Chief of Construction in the Construction Bureau of Kiev.|$|R
5000|$|Ma Jir Bo or Ma Jiabao ( [...] ; 26 August 1927 - 8 December 1985) was a Chinese realism {{artist and}} oil painter. Ma is praised for his great <b>portraitures,</b> highly {{realistic}} texture-feeling still lifes and memory-rekindling landscapes of Hong Kong all {{that made him}} a leading oil painter of his era. Ma is regarded as 'the legacy of Classic Western Masters in the East'. During his career, he created roughly 300 oil paintings, some 50 watercolours, as well as some traditional Chinese ink paintings and Chinese calligraphies.|$|R
60|$|Behind the church, and sloping up {{a gentle}} acclivity, was its capacious burying-ground, in which slept the {{earliest}} fathers of this rural neighborhood. Here were tombstones of the rudest sculpture; on which were inscribed, in Dutch, {{the names and}} virtues {{of many of the}} first settlers, with their <b>portraitures</b> curiously carved in similitude of cherubs. Long rows of grave-stones, side by side, of similar names, but various dates, showed that generation after generation of the same families had followed each other and been garnered together in this last gathering-place of kindred.|$|R
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the portraits on the Makkotai coins are {{that they do not}} have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying <b>portraiture</b> on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E
5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on <b>portraiture.</b> By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright {{was influenced by the}} work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated {{that he did not}} have the technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of <b>portraiture.</b> History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E
