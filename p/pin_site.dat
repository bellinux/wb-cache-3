Deep tissue infections and osteomyelitis may occur in up to 4  % of cases [19, 36], which are serious complications. Pin loosening, increased pain, use of pain medications, and delayed mobilization may follow [55]. Pin removal may be required in severe cases that fail to respond to antibiotic treatment [14, 36]. Due to {{a high incidence of}} <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> infections in patients undergoing external fixation and the morbidity and costs associated with the sequelae, clinicians need to educate patients to recognize the signs and symptoms of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> infections in order to initiate treatment promptly.

40|$|Introduction: We {{investigated}} {{whether there}} were any differences in the frequency and severity of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> infections by performing <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> care daily or once a week. We studied patients operated on for gonarthrosis by the hemicallotasis technique, using hydroxyapatite-coated pins in the metaphyseal bone and standard pins in the diaphyseal bone. Patients and methods: 50 patients were prospectively randomized to daily (nÊ= 27) or weekly (nÊ= 23) <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> care. We evaluated pin sites, the occurrence of pain (VAS), the use of antibiotics and analgesics and complications every week. Bacterial cultures were taken from each <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> at 1, 6 and 10 weeks and from the pins on removal. Results: We found no differences between daily or weekly <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> care as regards the frequency and severity of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> infections, pain, {{or the use of}} antibiotics and analgesics. Grade I infections (Checketts-Otterburns classification) occurred around 11 % of the pins and grade II infections around 4 %. 70 % of the bacterial cultures were negative. The most frequent bacteria were coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium. Antibiotics were given an average of 47 days. More problems occurred around the proximal pins. 5 / 200 (all proximal) pins were clinically loose on removal. Interpretation: <b>Pin</b> <b>site</b> care once a week seems appropriate...|$|E

30|$|Lethaby et al. [25] {{published}} a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis that pooled {{the data of}} the three negative studies by Egol [15], Henry [20], and Patterson [37]. The meta-analysis considered the outcome of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> infection rate and was based upon two study groups: 1) patients receiving any type of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> cleansing solution versus 2) patients receiving no cleansing regimen [25]. These two broad groups were chosen for the meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity between the three studies chosen for the analysis used different control <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> care protocols and tested different dressing types. There was insufficient {{evidence to suggest that}} the use of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> cleansing solutions reduces <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> infection rates (relative risk (RR) 2.30, 95  % confidence interval 0.63 – 8.33) [25]. Although the authors employed specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, they maintained this conclusion may be difficult to interpret given that the meta-analysis was based upon small, non-blinded, heterogeneous studies at a high risk of bias. Five years after publication of this meta-analysis, an additional Cochrane review drew similar conclusions that there was insufficient evidence to promote any specific strategy of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> infection prophylaxis [59].|$|E
30|$|The {{appropriate}} {{time to start}} <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> care varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 24  h to 10  days after surgery [14, 17, 18, 38, 39, 40, 66, 70, 71]. Most of the time, the first fresh dressing is applied within 2  days of surgery, since gauzes are usually blood-soaked and occlusive crusts can appear around the pins. The frequency of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> cleaning also differs, with authors suggesting cleaning twice daily [14, 72], once daily [39, 73], weekly [74] and, more rationally, “when required” [70]. In fact, the frequency of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> cleaning should be correlated with the local status around the pin–tract site. If swelling, crusts or signs of an exudate are observed, then the frequency of <b>pin</b> <b>site</b> cleaning should be more regular (once every day or second day).
