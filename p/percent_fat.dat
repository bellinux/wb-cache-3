A slight {{variation of}} the BAI from the FELS longitudinal study (BAIFELS) has more recently proposed to estimate <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> better than the BAI. Purpose: Assess criterion validity of the BAI and BAIFELS with air displacement plethysmography (ADP). Methods: <b>Percent</b> body <b>fat</b> was estimated for 1636 volunteer healthy adults (881 M; 755 F, age: 36. 9 ± 10. 5 yrs; BMI: 25. 4 ± 4. 6 kg/m 2) using ADP and BAI and BAIFELS. Differences in <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> between ADP, BAI, and BAIFELS were tested using an repeated measure ANOVA with post hoc analyses. Agreement between methods was tested using Bland-Altman plots. Results: Differences in <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> between each method were statistically significant (p<. 05). <b>Percent</b> body <b>fat</b> assessed by ADP correlated moderately with BAI (r= 0. 534, p< 0. 001), BAIFELS (r= 0. 526, p< 0. 001),and BMI (r= 0. 476, p< 0. 001). BAI and BAIFELS underestimated <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> compared to ADP on average 2. 1 % and 1. 1 % respectively. BAI equations overestimated <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> for lean persons and overestimated <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> for overweight or obese persons. Agreement between BAI, BAIFELS was poor with wide limits of agreement. Conclusion: BAI and BAIFELS are easier and less expensive alternatives to estimate <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> in humans compared to ADP. However, health risk due to body fat will be better estimated using either ADP or waist circumference and waist-to-hip ration {{in addition to an}} BAI.

40|$|ABSTRACT Data from 100 {{male and}} 100 female broiler {{chickens}} that were {{raised on the}} floor under two lighting regimes (12 and 24 hr light) were combined. Birds were weighed when 58 days old (male data presented first) (2372 g, 1913 g) and then slaughtered at 59 days. Abdominal fat was weighed (2. 18 %, 2. 82 %) and fat extracted from ground carcass (12. 0 %, 13. 7 % wet basis), intestines (47. 6 %, 56. 2 % dry basis), and from a triangular section of backskin (86. 1 %, 88. 0 % dry basis). <b>Percent</b> total <b>fat</b> was 10. 4 and 12. 2 (wet basis). Abdominal fat regressed on live body weight produced negative intercepts, indicating that regressed rather than percent values should be used. Fat from the four locations mentioned above had correlation coefficients of +. 45 to +. 76 for males and +. 47 to +. 74 for females. <b>Percent</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> had low nonsignificant correlations with fat free live body weight (r = +. 23 male,-. 07 female). Abdominal fat weight was a better (higher r 2) predictor of total fat, total fat minus abdominal <b>fat,</b> <b>percent</b> carcass <b>fat,</b> and <b>percent</b> intestinal <b>fat,</b> than <b>percent</b> backskin <b>fat.</b> Thirty-three <b>percent</b> (male) and 22 % (female) of the variation of <b>percent</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> was accounted for by <b>percent</b> backskin <b>fat.</b> Abdominal fat should be obtained directly and used for predicting fat in the bird rather than backskin fat. Abdominal fat was + 20. 7 % (male) and + 22. 8 % (female) of total fat. Prediction equations for estimating total fat and fat free live weight, given abdominal fat, and live body weight were developed.

5000|$|On X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), the increased fat component will decrease {{the density of}} the liver tissue, making the image less bright. Typically {{the density of the}} spleen and liver are roughly equivalent. In steatosis, {{there is a difference between}} the density and brightness of the two organs, with the liver appearing darker.On ultrasound, fat is more echogenic (capable of reflecting sound waves). The combination of liver steatosis being dark on CT and bright on ultrasound is sometimes known as the flip flop sign.On Magnetic Resonance Imaging, multiecho gradient echo images can be used to determine the <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> fraction of the liver. The different resonance frequencies between water and fat make this technique very sensitive and accurate.

Orlopp 91 tom turkeys were fed diets containing 2 percent added fat (control), 4 percent added fat (energy/protein ratio constant with the control), 6 percent added fat (energy/protein ratio constant with the control), and a diet containing 6 percent added fat with a higher energy/protein ratio than the control. Data collected in the study showed that the <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> in the dry matter of the turkey carcass increased more as a result of increasing the nutrient density of the diet than by increasing the diet energy level alone. This finding is contrary to current feeding assumptions which state that carcass composition should not be affected by energy level if a constant energy/protein ratio is maintained. The most significant effects of added dietary fat on turkey carcass composition occurred in the viscera and the skin. Increased dietary fat level with an increase in dietary protein level to maintain the same energy/protein ratio resulted in a statistically significant increase in the <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> in the dry matter of the skin and the viscera. <b>Percent</b> <b>fat</b> in the dry matter of the light meat and dark meat showed sim. ilar trends due to increases in dietary fat levels.

Statistically significant positive correlations were found between the <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> in the dry matter of the skin and the <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> in the dry matter of the viscera. Lower, but still statistically significant positive correlations were also noted between the <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> in the dry matter of the light meat and dark meat, viscera and light meat and the skin and light meat. There was also a significant correlation between the <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> in the dry matter of the skin and the percent skin in the dressed turkey...|$|E
40|$|Bioelectrical {{impedance}} equations {{are frequently}} used by {{food and nutrition}} professionals to estimate <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> mass in overweight and obese children. However, {{it is not known}} whether they are accurate for such children, as they have been primarily developed for children of varying body weights. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the predictive validity of four previously published prediction equations developed for the pediatric population, among a sample of overweight and obese children. Thirty overweight or obese children (mean age= 7. 57 +/- 1. 28 years) underwent measurement of fat mass, <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> mass, and fat-free mass using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Impedance values from the BIA were entered into the four prediction equations and Pearson correlations used to determine the significance of associations between each of the BIA prediction equations and DEXA for <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> mass, fat mass, and fat-free mass. For <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> mass, paired t tests were used to assess differences between the methods and the technique of Bland and Altman was used to determine bias and error. Results showed that the mean <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> mass as determined by DEXA for this age group was 40. 79 %. In comparison with other BIA prediction equations, the Schaefer equation had the closest mean value of 41. 98 %, and was the only equation not to significantly differ from the DEXA (P= 0. 121). This study suggests that the Schaefer equation is the only accurate BIA prediction equation for assessing <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> mass in this sample of overweight and obese children from primarily white backgrounds...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five female Ss age 18 - 65 {{years who}} {{had participated in}} a {{community}} weight loss class volunteered to have their body composition determined via hydrostatic weighing (HW) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), All subjects were greater than 30 % body fat. It was discovered that bioelectrical impedance analysis using the BES 200 Z analyzer significantly (p<. 05) underpredicted <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> in all 25 subjects, compared to HW. <b>Percent</b> <b>fat</b> predicted using the BES 2002 analyzer was poorly correlated (r -. 59) to <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> using HW. Mean <b>percent</b> <b>fat</b> determined by BIA was 33. 9 +/- 6. 39 compared to 42. 8 +/- 6. 30 using HW. Mean fat free mass (FFM) was significantly overestimated (p<. 05) using BIA (54. 8 + 6. 89) compared to HW (44. 1 + 6. 80). New prediction equations were developed for the impedance analyzer. The highest correlation for a developed prediction equation was r -. 97. This equation predicted FFM using the variables height squared (ht 2), weight, age, impedance (R), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Further investigation {{needs to be done to}} validate the accuracy of this equation for the BES 200 Z analyzer...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{the effects}} of body {{composition}} on injury occurrence and healing times in dancers have received limited scientific attention. The aim {{of the current study}} was to determine possible associations between somatotype, <b>percent</b> body <b>fat,</b> and self-reported injury characteristics in dance students. Forty-two full-time ballet students (11 male, 31 female) from two vocational dance schools volunteered for the study. The Heath-Carter protocol and Siri equation were adopted to calculate somatotype and <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> (...|$|R

This study evaluated the correlation between injury occurrence, step test estimated maximal aerobic capacity [], and body composition in a high frequency manual materials handling task. The study used 212 highly trained male manual material handlers working for a major materials handling company. Three locations across the United States were chosen based on similarity of size and function (West, Midwest, and Southeastern United States). An estimated maximal aerobic capacity was obtained for each participant using a submaximal bench step protocol. Also, a <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> estimation was randomly obtained for approximately 25 % of the participants. The correlations between injury occurrences, absolute []relative [] and <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> were analyzed. Also, the relationship between both []estimations and <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> was analyzed. Finally, the correlations between location, [] and <b>percent</b> body <b>fat</b> were studied. Results indicated no significant difference between absolute [] injury, or <b>percent</b> body <b>fat.</b> Relative []suggested a significant relationship with injury occurrences and body composition. Body composition also indicated a significant correlation with injury occurrences. Finally, location played a significant factor in injury occurrence, step test estimated [] and estimated body composition. This study demonstrated significant evidence to the predictability of employee injury occurrence and the fitness estimation methods used. In a high frequency manual materials handling task, high occurrences of injury were significantly correlated with low estimated relative maximal aerobic capacity and high estimated <b>percent</b> body <b>fat...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{looked at}} the chance of error that a wrestling and weightlifting workout had on the {{proximity}} of body <b>fat</b> <b>percent</b> measurements of wrestlers. The study compared a pretest measurement to the following posttest measurements: immediate, 30, 60, and a 90 minute posttest. A {{second part of the}} study compared the effects on body <b>fat</b> <b>percent</b> between a wrestling and weightlifting workout. The body <b>fat</b> <b>percent</b> was determined by using the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association (WIAA) standards by using skinfold measurements. There were three sites used (triceps, subscapular, and umbilical) to determine the wrestler's body <b>fat</b> <b>percent.</b> Subjects were 19 college wrestlers ranging from 18 to 24 years of age. A paired t-test was performed to compare the effects of pretest to posttest measurements on body <b>fat</b> <b>percent.</b> A paired t-test was also used to compare the effects on body <b>fat</b> <b>percent</b> between a wrestling workout and a weightlifting workout. The body <b>fat</b> <b>percent</b> for the wrestling workout and the weightlifting workout was significantly different (p <. 05) from the pretest measurements during the following posttest times: 30, 60, and 90 minutes after each workout. The body <b>fat</b> <b>percent</b> was significantly different (p <. 05) when the wrestling workout was compared to the weightlifting workout during the following measurements: pretest, immediate, 30, 60, and 90 minute posttests. These data suggest that each workout had an effect on skinfold measurements taken following the workout. The body <b>fat</b> <b>percent</b> decreased with each time period following both workouts. However, the immediate posttest for both workouts was not significantly different. This is contrary to what the WIAA suggests, which is not to take skinfold measurements immediately after a workout. Despite what has been found, {{it would be best to}} take skinfold measurements before a workout or on a separate day of a workout...|$|R
