2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without <b>post-curing.</b> Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

The load increased linearly up to the maximum pull-out load, when the load reached the critical load, beyond which the load reduced rapidly under all <b>post-cure</b> conditions. Shear debonding occurred in the fiber/matrix interface at the maximum pull-out load. The maximum load increased with a longer embedded length under all <b>post-cure</b> conditions.

40|$|Analytical, numerical, and {{experimental}} modeling methods are presented to predict deformation after the cure process of thin unsymmetric laminates for piezoelectric actuation. During fabrication, laminates deform to several <b>post-cure</b> room temperature shapes. Thin cross-ply laminates deform to a circular cylindrical <b>post-cure</b> shape while thicker laminates deform to a saddle shape. <b>Post-cure</b> shapes {{are dependent on}} ply orientation, thickness, and material properties. Because, CLT alone does not always predict the correct <b>post-cure</b> room temperature shape of the thin composite laminates, an extension of CLT with the Rayleigh-Ritz technique and potential energies are used to better predict these shapes. Finite element models are used to predict the <b>post-cure</b> room temperature shapes. Thin composite laminates are modeled coupling heat transfer and structural mechanics, which are necessary for modeling the cure process. Modeling the fabrication process captured important data such as residual stresses from the cure process, room temperature shapes, and bi-stability of the composite laminates.

40|$|Abstract Physical {{property}} enhancement in light-cured resin composites from <b>post-cure</b> heating {{is attributed}} to free radicals created during initial photocuring, the number of which decreases following initial light-curing.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the microhardness test, three different groups were prepared in accordance with the <b>post-cure</b> treatments: control group (only light cure for 40 s), autoclave group (light cure for 40 s + autoclave for 15 min at 130 ºC); and microwave group (light cure for 40 s + microwave for 3 min at 450 W). To assess the marginal adaptation, the composite resin was inserted incrementally into a mesial-occlusal-distal cavity brass mold and each increment light-cured for 40 s. A previous reading in micrometers was taken at the cervical wall, using a stereomicroscope magnifying glass equipped with a digital video camera and image-analysis software. Subsequently, the specimens were subjected to the <b>post-cure</b> treatments (autoclave and microwave) and a reading was taken again at the cervical wall.

A universal testing machine measured flexural strength and modulus of all specimens. Results: Post composition and <b>post-curing</b> treatments had no significant effects on flexural properties of specimens while post diameter had significant effects (p< 0. 05). The highest flexural strength and modulus (MPa) (1331 ± 95. 8 and 21532 ± 1550, respectively) were obtained with Ov/GF/ 1. 1, while lowest values (890 ± 79. 4 and 10675 ± 952, respectively) were for Ac/GF/ 1. 5. Conclusions: 1. 1 mm diameter posts had better mechanical properties than 1. 5 mm thick posts. Neither post composition nor <b>post-curing</b> procedures affected the mechanical properties of relined posts...|$|E
40|$|A hybrid type of {{composite}} resins {{is used as}} dental restorative {{materials in}} a wide cavity directly or indirectly. The mechanical properties of the composite resin would increase <b>post-curing.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the differences between the compressive strength of hybrid type composite resin <b>post-curing</b> using LED light box and dry heating. This type of research was a quasi-experimental in vitro with the sample size of 30 samples which were divided into two groups. Each sample was tested using a Universal Testing Machine (Lloyd) at a speed of 1 mm/minute to test the compressive strength. Compressive strength values were recorded when the sample broke. The average value of compressive strength of the two treatment groups was statistically calculated using t-test. The results, of this study, showed that a hybrid composite resin with post curing using a light box with LED was at 194. 138 Mpa which was lower than using the dry heat of 227. 339 Mpa. It showed the statistically significant difference. The conclusion of this study was that the compressive strength of post-cured hybrid composites using a light box with LED was significantly lower than the <b>post-curing</b> using dry heat...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} the variation of conversion degree (DC) in the 12 hours following initial photoactivation of a low-shrinkage composite resin (Venus Diamond). Material and Methods: The conversion degree was monitored for 12 hours using Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) F-TIR Spectroscopy. The composite {{was placed in}} 1 or 2 mm rings and cured for 10 or 20 seconds with a LED lamp. ATR spectra were acquired from the bottom surface of each sample immediately after the initial photoactivation (P= 0), 30 minutes (P= 0. 5) and 12 hours after photoactivation (P= 12) {{in order to obtain}} the DC progression during the <b>post-curing</b> period. Interactions between thickness (T), irradiation time (I) and <b>post-curing</b> (P) on the DC were calculated through ANOVA testing. Results: All the first order interactions were statistically significant, {{with the exception of the}} T-P interaction. Furthermore, the shift from P= 0 to P= 0. 5 had a statistically higher influence than the shift from P= 0. 5 to P= 12. The <b>post-curing</b> period played a fundamental role in reaching higher DC values with the low-shrinkage composite resin tested in this study. Moreover, both the irradiation time and the composite thickness strongly influenced the DC. Conclusions: Increased irradiation time may be useful in obtaining a high conversion degree (DC) with a low-shrinkage nano-hybrid composite resin, particularly with 2 mm composite layer...|$|E
50|$|In its uncured state, {{silicone}} rubber is a highly-adhesive gel or liquid. In order {{to convert to}} a solid, it must be cured, vulcanized, or catalyzed. This is normally carried out in a two-stage process {{at the point of}} manufacture into the desired shape, and then in a prolonged <b>post-cure</b> process. It can also be injection molded.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Infrared {{studies of}} the initial cure and <b>post-cure</b> of RP- 46 resin, a nadic {{end-capped}} polyimide and a model bisnadimide compound N,N-(oxydi- 3, 4 phenylene) di- 5, 6 -norbornene- 2, 3 -dicarboximide (Bis-nadic- 3, 4 -ODA) were conducted at 316, 325 and 350 C for various time periods. Infrared studies of another model compound, N-phenylnadimide, were conducted at lower temperatures, from 100 to 270 C. N-Phenylnadimide cures at much lower temperatures than Bis-nadic- 3, 4 -ODA and RP- 46. The cross-linking reaction was followed by monitoring the absorption peaks at 841 and 785 cm 1, the endo and exo bands in the 2, 3 positions of the nadic end caps and cyclo-aliphatic and cyclo-olefinic peaks on the region 1000 to 600 cm 1 associated with the nadic end-cap curing reaction. Weight losses {{and changes in the}} glass transition temperature of the RP- 46 resin due to cure and <b>post-cure,</b> were also examined. The infrared changes suggest that complete cross-linking requires a temperature of 325 C or above, and that several new infrared bands are generated in the process. The simple thermally induced reverse Diels–Alder cy-clopentadiene N-substituted maleimide recombination reaction or norbornene to norbornene, norbornene to cyclopentadiene or norbornene to substituted maleimide addition reactions may adequately define the cross-linked products derived from the initial cross-linking reaction at 316 C for 1 to 2 h. However, <b>post-cure</b> of RP- 46 resin or the nadic- 3, 4 -ODA model compound at 325 or 350 C for several hours generate...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Knoop hardness after 15 min and 24 h of different shades of a dual-cured resin-based cement after indirect photoactivation (ceramic restoration) with 2 light-curing units (LCUs). The resin cement Variolink II (Ivoclar Vivadent) shade XL, A 2, A 3 and opaque were mixed with the catalyst paste and inserted into a black Teflon mold (5 mm diameter x 1 mm high). A transparent strip was placed over the mold and a ceramic disc (Duceram Plus, shade A 3) was positioned over the resin cement. Light-activation was performed through the ceramic for 40 s using quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) (XL 2500; 3 M ESPE) or light-emitting diode (LED) (Ultrablue Is, DMC) LCUs with power density of 615 and 610 mW/cm 2, respectively. The Koop hardness was measured using a microhardness tester HMV 2 (Shimadzu) after 15 min or 24 h. Four indentations were made in each specimen. Data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey???s test (a= 0. 05). The QTH LCU provided significantly higher (p< 0. 05) KHN values than the LED LCU. When the <b>post-cure</b> times were compared for the same shade, QTH and LED at 24 h provided significantly higher(p< 0. 05) KHN values than at 15 min. It may be concluded that the Knoop hardness was generally dependent on the LCU and <b>post-cure</b> time. The opaque shade of the resin cement showed lower Knoop hardness than the other shades for both LCUs and <b>post-cure</b> times...|$|R
