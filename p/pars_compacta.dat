5|$|The main {{pathological}} {{characteristics of}} PD are cell {{death in the}} brain's basal ganglia (affecting up to 70% of the dopamine secreting neurons in the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> {{by the end of}} life) and the presence of Lewy bodies (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells) and {{a significant increase in the}} number of microglia (another type of glial cell) in the substantia nigra.|$|E

25|$|Regional {{distribution}} of DAT {{has been found}} in areas of the brain with established dopaminergic circuitry including: nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical pathways. The nuclei that make up these pathways have distinct patterns of expression. Gene expression patterns in the adult mouse show high expression in the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta.</b>|$|E
25|$|Male sexual {{behaviors}} {{can be divided}} into two phases: the appetitive phase, which contains highly variable sequence of behaviors such as attracting and courting, and the consummatory phase, during which highly stereotyped copulatory behaviors occur. The medial preoptic area of the brain is considered to control the expression of both male copulation and male appetitive sexual behavior. It is found that large lesions of SDN-POA severely disrupt copulatory behavior in rats. Also, cell-body lesions of SDA <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> (a homologue of SDN-POA) in gerbils produce severe disruptions of male copulatory behavior. Moreover, a study on medial preoptic nucleus (POM) (homologue of medial preoptic nucleus in rats) in quails showed that the activation of male copulatory behavior requires the aromaticity of androgen (testosterone) into an estrogen (17β-estradiol). Like in SDN-POA, aromatase-expression neurons are a specific marker of the nuclear boundary of POM in quails. The intensity of male copulatory behavior is found to positively correlate with the number of the aromatase-expression neurons in the caudal part of POM.|$|E
500|$|The {{substantia nigra}} {{is a small}} {{midbrain}} area that forms {{a component of the}} basal ganglia. This has two parts—an input area called the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> and an output area the pars reticulata. The dopaminergic neurons are found mainly in the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> (cell group A8) and nearby (group A9). [...] In humans, the projection of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> to the dorsal striatum, termed the nigrostriatal pathway, plays {{a significant role in the}} control of motor function and in learning new motor skills.

2500|$|The {{substantia nigra}} is a {{midbrain}} gray matter {{portion of the}} basal ganglia that has two parts – the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> (SNc) and the pars reticulata (SNr). [...] SNr often works in unison with GPi, and the SNr-GPi complex inhibits the thalamus. Substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> (SNc) however, produces the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is very significant in maintaining balance in the striatal pathway. The circuit portion below explains the role and circuit connections {{of each of the}} components of the basal ganglia.|$|E
2500|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} linked with Lewy body {{dementia}} for their similar hallucinatory symptoms. The symptoms strike {{during the evening}} {{in any part of}} the visual field, and are rarely [...] The segue into hallucination may begin with illusions where sensory perception is greatly distorted, but no novel sensory information is present. These typically last for several minutes, during which time the subject may be either conscious and normal or drowsy/inaccessible. Insight into these hallucinations is usually preserved and REM sleep is usually reduced. Parkinson's disease is usually associated with a degraded substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta,</b> but recent evidence suggests that PD affects a number of sites in the brain. Some places of noted degradation include the median raphe nuclei, the noradrenergic parts of the locus coeruleus, and the cholinergic neurons in the parabrachial area and pedunculopontine nuclei of the tegmentum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} of these subcortical nuclei for normal brain function and behavior is emphasized by the numerous and diverse neurological conditions associated with basal ganglia dysfunction, which include: disorders of behavior control such as Tourette syndrome, hemiballismus, and obsessive–compulsive disorder; dystonia; addiction; and movement disorders, the most notable of which are Parkinson's disease, which involves degeneration of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta,</b> and Huntington's disease, which primarily involves damage to the striatum. The basal ganglia have a limbic sector whose components are assigned distinct names: [...] the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area (VTA). There is considerable evidence that this limbic part plays {{a central role in}} reward learning, particularly a pathway (mesolimbic pathway) from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens that uses the neurotransmitter dopamine. [...] A number of highly addictive drugs, including cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine, are thought to work by increasing the efficacy of this dopamine signal. [...] There is also evidence implicating overactivity of the VTA dopaminergic projection in schizophrenia.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{models of}} basal ganglia {{circuits}} and function have been proposed, however {{there have been}} questions raised about the strict divisions of the direct and indirect pathways, their possible overlap and regulation. [...] The circuitry models has evolved since the first proposed model in the 1990s by DeLong in the parallel processing model, in which the cortex and substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> project into the dorsal striatum giving rise to an inhibitory indirect and excitatory direct pathway. [...] The inhibitory indirect pathway involved the inhibition of the globus pallidus externus, allowing for the disinhibition of the globus pallidus internus allowing it to inhibit the thalamus. [...] The direct or excitatory pathway involved the disinhibition of the thalamus through the inhibition of the GPe/SNr. [...] However {{the speed of the}} direct pathway would not be concordant with the indirect pathway in this model leading to problems with it. [...] To get over this, a hyperdirect pathway where the cortex sends glutamatergic projections through the subthalamic nucleus exciting the inhibitory GPe under the center surround model, as well as a shorter indirect pathway have been proposed. [...] Generally, the basal ganglia circuitry is divided into a limbic, two associative(prefrontal), an oculomotor and one motor pathway. [...] The motor and oculomotor are sometimes grouped into one motor pathway. [...] The 5 general pathways go as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{striatum}} {{is composed}} mostly of medium spiny neurons. [...] These GABAergic projection neurons project {{to the external}} (lateral) globus pallidus and internal (medial) globus pallidus {{as well as the}} substantia nigra pars reticulata. [...] The projections into the globus pallidus and substantia nigra are primarily dopaminergic, although enkephalin, dynorphin and substance P are expressed. [...] The striatum also contains interneurons that are classified into nitrergic neurons (due to use of nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter), tonically active [...] cholinergic interneurons, parvalbumin-expressing neurons and calretinin-expressing neurons. [...] The dorsal striatum receives significant glutamatergic inputs from the cortex, as well as dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta.</b> [...] The dorsal striatum is generally considered to be involved in sensorimotor activities. [...] The ventral striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from the limbic areas as well as dopaminergic inputs from the VTA, via the mesolimbic pathway. The ventral striatum is believed {{to play a role in}} reward and other limbic functions. [...] The dorsal striatum is divided into the caudate and putamen by the internal capsule while the ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. The caudate has three primary regions of connectivity, with the head of the caudate demonstrating connectivity to the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and amygdala. [...] The body and tail show differentiation between the dorsolateral rim and ventral caudate, projecting to the sensorimotor and limbic regions of the striatum respectively.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> {{also plays}} a role in {{temporal}} processing and is activated during time reproduction. Lesions in the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> leads to temporal deficits. As of late, the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> has been suspected of regulating the sleep-wake cycle, which is consistent with symptoms such as insomnia and REM sleep disturbances that are reported by patients with Parkinson's disease. Even so, partial dopamine deficits that do not affect motor control can lead to disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle, especially REM-like patterns of neural activity while awake, especially in the hippocampus.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} death of dopaminergic neurons in the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> is unknown. However, some {{contributions}} to the unique susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons in the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> have been identified. For one, dopaminergic neurons show abnormalities in mitochondrial complex 1, causing aggregation of alpha-synuclein; this can result in abnormal protein handling and neuron death. Secondly, dopaminergic neurons in the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> contain less calbindin than other dopaminergic neurons. Calbindin is a protein involved in calcium ion transport within cells, and excess calcium in cells is toxic. The calbindin theory would explain the high cytotoxicity of Parkinson's in the substantia nigra compared to the ventral tegmental area. Regardless of the cause of neuronal death, the plasticity of the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> is very robust; Parkinsonian symptoms do not appear until up to 50-80% of <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> dopaminergic neurons have died. Most of this plasticity occurs at the neurochemical level; dopamine transport systems are slowed, allowing dopamine to linger {{for longer periods of}} time in the chemical synapses in the striatum.|$|E

50|$|Significant {{projections}} {{occur to}} the thalamus (ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei), superior colliculus, and other caudal nuclei from the pars reticulata (the nigrothalamic pathway), which use GABA as their neurotransmitter.

50|$|The {{substantia nigra}} {{is located in}} the midbrain. It has two {{distinct}} parts, the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> and the pars reticulata. The <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> is part of the nigrostriatal pathway and relays information to the basal ganglia by supplying dopamine to the striatum. The pars reticulata in conjunction with the globus pallidus in the basal ganglia allows for inhibition of the thalamus.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{function of the}} <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> is motor control, though the substantia nigra's role in motor control is indirect; electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra does not result in movement, due to mediation of the striatum in the nigral influence of movement. The <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> sends excitatory input to the striatum via D1 pathway that excites and activates the striatum, resulting in the release of GABA onto the globus pallidus to inhibit its inhibitory effects on the thalamic nucleus. This causes the thalamocortical pathways to become excited and transmits motor neuron signals to the cerebral cortex to allow the initiation of movement, which is absent in Parkinson's disease. However, lack of <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> neurons has a large influence on movement, {{as evidenced by the}} symptoms of Parkinson's. The motor role of the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> may involve fine motor control, as has been confirmed in animal models with lesions in that region.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in learned responses to stimuli. In primates, dopaminergic neuron activity increases in the nigrostriatal pathway when a new stimulus is presented. Dopaminergic activity decreases with repeated stimulus presentation. However, behaviorally significant stimulus presentation (i.e. rewards) continues to activate dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta.</b> Dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (bottom part of the [...] "midbrain" [...] or mesencephalon) to the prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and to the nucleus accumbens (mesolimbic pathway - [...] "meso" [...] referring to [...] "from the mesencephalon"... specifically the ventral tegmental area) are implicated in reward, pleasure, and addictive behavior. The <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> is also important in spatial learning, the observations about one's environment and location in space. Lesions in the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> lead to learning deficits in repeating identical movements, and some studies point to its involvement in a dorsal striatal-dependent, response-based memory system that functions relatively independent of the hippocampus, which is traditionally believed to subserve spatial or episodic-like memory functions.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, {{the nerve}} cell {{bodies of the}} <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> are {{coloured}} black by the pigment neuromelanin. The degree of pigmentation increases with age. This pigmentation is visible as a distinctive black stripe in brain sections and is {{the origin of the}} name given to this volume of the brain. The neurons have particularly long and thick dendrites (François et al.). The ventral dendrites, particularly, go down deeply in the pars reticulata. Other similar neurons are more sparsely distributed in the midbrain and constitute [...] "groups" [...] with no well-defined borders, although continuous to the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta,</b> in a prerubral position. These have been given, in early works in rats (with not much respect for the anatomical subdivisions), the name of [...] "area A8" [...] and [...] "A10". The <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> itself ("A9") is usually subdivided into a ventral and a dorsal tier, the last being calbindin positive. The ventral tier is considered as A9v. The dorsal tier A9d is linked to an ensemble comprising also A8 and A10, A8, A9d and A10 representing 28% of dopaminergic neurons. The neurons of the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> receive inhibiting signals from the collateral axons from the neurons of the pars reticulata.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{substantia nigra}} {{appears as a}} {{continuous}} band in brain sections, anatomical {{studies have found that}} it actually consists of two parts with very different connections and functions: the <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> and the pars reticulata. This classification was first proposed by Sano in 1910. The <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> serves mainly as an input to the basal ganglia circuit, supplying the striatum with dopamine. The pars reticulata, though, serves mainly as an output, conveying signals from the basal ganglia to numerous other brain structures.|$|E

50|$|The {{function}} of the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>compacta</b> (SNc) is complex.
