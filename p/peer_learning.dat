40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{discover}} the effects of using <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> in acquiring skills in music composition. The ten criteria used for assessing the effects of <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> comprised six concerning social qualities and four relating to cognitive aspects of what might be learned from working and learning together. The research used both qualitative and quantitative methods, encompassing interviews with the teacher, questionnaires for the students and observation. The latter included a quantitative element. The research took place in the natural settings of timetabled music lessons in Year Seven at an English comprehensive secondary school. This <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> research is believed to be the only such project conducted entirely in the unadulterated classroom settings. The lessons followed the teacher’s choice of lesson material and the length of time normally allowed for lessons in that school. No changes in classroom organisation, timing, or for any other reason were requested by, or made for, the researcher. Each class was divided into groups whose size, ability and gender were determined by the teacher. From these groups, the teacher selected the three which were the focus of this research. All three of the sample groups showed some evidence of the beneficial effects of <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> socially and cognitively although this varied according to the children’s different ability levels. <b>Peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> was found to be most successful where children were able to work together cohesively and communicate well, either verbally or musically.

40|$|Abstract]: Evidence {{suggests}} that peer-assisted learning schemes on campus help students establish social networks which {{can have a}} positive influence on their learning achievements. At the University of Southern Queensland (USQ), the majority of students are off campus, which raises the urgent question: how to harness the advantages of Meet-Up (formerly PALS: <b>Peer</b> Assisted <b>Learning</b> Strategy) in an online environment? Given that the potential problem of social isolation is even more acute in distance education, how do we develop a <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> program online which creates a sense of community for its participants? Since 2006, MSN Messenger has been used on a relatively small scale to facilitate this at USQ, with largely positive initial results. Based on evaluations of this initiative, this paper explores the potential of Wimba software, within an institution-wide Moodle learning management system, to extend <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> programs in a Web 2. 0 context...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a collaborative action research {{study in which}} <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> was deployed simultaneously {{across a range of}} disciplines in two institutes of technology in Ireland. The aim of the research was to determine if <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> enhances the learning experience of first year participants. An action research approach was selected and involved three phases between 2009 and 2011. The implementation of each phase was informed by a review of the previous phase. The third phase also incorporated the rollout and evaluation of a new <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> student leadership module (an elective 5 ECTs European Credit and Accumulation Transfer System) in both institutes. This paper focuses on both quantitative and qualitative data from the first year experience student survey, which was designed and deployed in phase one and repeated in phase two. The survey is supplemented by data from focus groups with student leaders and session reviews. Qualitative data was analysed using both the constant comparison method and text analysis. Our findings illustrate the challenges associated with implementing and embedding a long-term <b>peer</b> assisted <b>learning</b> program as part of the first year student experience. In addition, we found wide ranging benefits for the two institutes of technology that collaborated on the development, rollout, and evaluation of the program.
