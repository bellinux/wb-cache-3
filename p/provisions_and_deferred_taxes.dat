40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{document}} the changes to income <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> due {{to the implementation of}} New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS), particularly New Zealand International Accounting Standard 12 : Income Taxes (NZ IAS 12). Motivation: Stent, Bradbury and Hooks (2010) investigate the effect of the implementation of NZ IFRS on assets and liabilities generally. The results indicate that tax assets and tax liabilities increase but an in-depth analysis of income <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> changes <b>and</b> the reason for these changes is not provided. Research Question: What was the impact of changing from Standard Statement of Accounting Practice 12 : Accounting for Income Tax (SSAP 12) under NZ FRS to NZ IAS 12 : Income Taxes under NZ IFRS on income <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> as recorded in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements? Design/Methodology: Using a sample of entities listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX), I analyse the dollar effect, percentage change and direction of change to income <b>tax,</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> net tax assets (liabilities) due to the mandatory change to NZ IAS 12 for the period 2005 to 2008. I analyse the variables that influence the change in income <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> due to the implementation of NZ IFRS including users of the partial and comprehensive basis, asset revaluation reserves, unrecognised <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets, early <b>and</b> late adopters and small and large entities. Findings: The results indicate that partial basis <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> users <b>and</b> those with asset revaluation reserves have larger decreases (increases) in net tax assets (liabilities). Late adopters and smaller companies are also less affected by the implementation of NZ IAS 12 than their counterparts. Research Limitations: Small sample Practical Implications: I provide an extensive comparison between SSAP 12 pre NZ IFRS and NZ IAS 12 post NZ IFRS and highlight the differences between the partial basis and comprehensive basis. My results also provide information to the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) who are currently working towards convergence of United States Generally Accepted Accounting Policies (US GAAP) and IFRS...|$|R
