The experiments feature a new Yttrium–Aluminum–Garnet (YAG) P-to-S conversion shear buffer rod (BR), {{capable of producing}} pure ultrasonic shear waves with known polarization {{in the region of}} 0. 5 – 2. 0 GHz. To our knowledge they are the first such single-crystal ultrasonic measurements on a high-pressure phase recovered from the multi-anvil press. The cubic single-crystal elastic constants of hydrous Fo 89 ringwoodite at ambient conditions are (in GPa) : c 11 = 298 ± 13, c 44 = 112 ± 6, and c 12 = 115 ± 6.

Water, or trace H incorporated in mineral defects, could be {{a key player in}} the evolution of continental lithosphere because it influences melting and rheology of the mantle. Mantle xenoliths from the Lac de Gras kimberlite in the Slave craton were analyzed by FTIR. The cratonic mantle beneath Lac de Gras is stratified with shallow (< 145 km) oxidized ultradepleted peridotites and pyroxenites with evidence for carbonatitic metasomatism, underlain by reduced and less depleted peridotites metasomatized by kimberlite melts. Peridotites analyzed so far have H O contents in <b>ppm</b> <b>weight</b> of 7 - 100 in their olivines, 58 to 255 in their orthopyroxenes (opx), 11 to 84 in their garnet, and 139 in one clinopyroxene.

Olivine and garnet from the deep peridotites have a range of water contents extending to higher values than those from the shallow ones. The FTIR spectra of olivines from the shallow samples have more prominent Group II OH bands compared to the olivines from the deep samples, consistent with a more oxidized mantle environment. The range of olivine water content is similar to that observed in Kaapvaal craton peridotites at the same depths (129 - 184 km) but does not extend to as high values as those from Udachnaya (Siberian craton).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Weight gain accompanies smoking cessation, but dieting during quitting is {{controversial}} as hunger may increase urges to smoke. This is a feasibility {{trial for the}} investigation of a very low calorie diet (VLCD), individual modest energy restriction, and usual advice on hunger, ketosis, urges to smoke, abstinence and weight gain in overweight smokers trying to quit. METHODS: This is a 3 armed, unblinded, randomized controlled trial in overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m 2), daily smokers (CO > 10 ppm); with at least 30 participants in each group. Each group receives identical behavioural support and NRT patches (25 mg(8 weeks), 15 mg(2 weeks), 10 mg(2 weeks)). The VLCD group receive a 429 - 559 kcal/day liquid formula beginning 1 week before quitting and continuing for 4 weeks afterwards. The modest energy restricted group (termed individual dietary and activity planning(IDAP)) engage in goal-setting and receive an energy prescription based on individual basal metabolic rate(BMR) aiming for daily reduction of 600 kcal. The control group receive usual dietary advice that accompanies smoking cessation i. e. avoiding feeling hungry but eating healthy snacks. After this, the VLCD participants receive IDAP to provide support for changing eating habits in the longer term; the IDAP group continues receiving this support. The control group receive IDAP 8 weeks after quitting. This allows us to compare IDAP following a successful quit attempt with dieting concurrently during quitting. It also aims to prevent attrition in the unblinded, control group by meeting their need for weight management. Follow-up occurs at 6 and 12 months. Outcome measures include participant acceptability, measured qualitatively by semi-structured interviewing and quantitatively by recruitment and attrition rates. Feasibility of running the trial within primary care is measured by interview and questionnaire of the treatment providers.

Disease manifests as diar- rhoea, increased feed consumption, reduced growth rates and occasional mortality in broilers and these signs are shown in layers also associated with a delayed onset of lay, reduced egg weights, faecal staining of eggshells and non-productive ovaries. Treatment with Denagard® Tiamulin {{has been used to}} protect against B. pilosicoli colonisation, persistence and clinical presentation of AIS in commercial layers, but to date there has been no de- finitive study validating efficacy. Here, we used a poultry model of B. pilosicoli infection of layers to compare the impact of three doses of Denagard® Tiamulin. Four groups of thirty 17 week old commercial pre-lay birds were all challenged with B. pilosicoli strain B 2904 with three oral doses two days apart. All birds were colonised within 2 days after the final oral challenge and mild onset of clinical signs were observed thereafter. A fifth group that was unchallenged and untreated was also included for comparison as healthy birds. Five days after the final oral Brachypira challenge three groups were given Denagard® Tiamulin in drinking water made up following the manufacturer's recommendations with doses verified as 58. 7 ppm, 113 ppm and 225 <b>ppm.</b> <b>Weight</b> gain body condition and the level of diarrhoea of birds infected with B. pilosicoli were improved and shedding of the organism reduced significantly (p = 0. 001) following treatment with Denagard® Tiamulin irrespective of dose given.

Confirming previous findings we showed that the ileum, caeca, colon, and both liver and spleen were colonised and here we demonstrated that treatment with Denagard® Tiamulin resulted in significant reduction in the numbers of Brachyspira found in each of these sites and dramatic reduction in faecal shedding (p b 0. 001) to ap- proaching zero as assessed by culture of cloacal swabs. Although the number of eggs produced per bird and the level of eggshell staining appeared unaffected, egg weights of treated birds were greater than those of untreated birds for a period of approximately two weeks following treatment.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Approximately 100 million Mexican free-tailed bats spend the summer in Texas, many roosting in highway bridges located near intensive agriculture. Bats may acquire insecticide residues indirectly through the food chain or directly by exposure to sprays. Many insecticides are lethal to non-target wildlife and sublethal exposures may disrupt thermoregulation, food consumption, and reproduction. To determine exposure, specimens and guano were collected from 24 bridge colonies throughout Texas. Samples were analyzed for organophosphate (OP), carbonate (CB), organochlorine (OC), and pyrethroid residues. Brain cholinesterase (ChE) levels were also measured to determine potential OP and CB exposure. Developing embryos were removed from pre-partum females, cleared and stained, then examined for gross physical deformities that might be linked to chemical exposure. Organochlorine residues were found in all guano samples with dichlorodiphenylethylene (DDE) exceeding 3 ppm (dry weight), a level previously associated with migratory mortality in newly-volant free-tails from Carlsbad Cavern, NM, at five sites. Dieldrin and endrin residues were found in guano from three colonies. Analyses of carcasses (n= 17) and milk (n= 3) from six colonies revealed dieldrin levels up to 1. 39 ppm (wet weight) in adult carcasses and 8. 71 (wet weight) ppm in milk. DDE was found in all carcass and milk samples with levels up to 48. 3 <b>ppm</b> (<b>weight</b> wet) in carcasses and 3. 45 ppm (wet weight) in milk. Pyrethroid residues ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 10 ppm in guano samples from seven colonies; however, no residues were detected in milk or carcasses. Cholinesterase levels of four individuals from three counties appeared to be depressed, but gastrointestinal tracts from fifteen individuals revealed no OP or CB residues. Mean colony ChE level decreased significantly with both increased crop-acreage and acreage treated with insecticides by county. No embryos were found with deformities. Although no longer used, OC compounds are present at levels that may affect Mexican free-tail populations in Texas, specifically migrating young of the year.

Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20 ppm and 100 <b>ppm</b> (fresh <b>weight),</b> with cabbage having the largest amount. With as much as to 700 ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.|$|R
50|$|Yttrium {{is found}} in most rare-earth minerals, it {{is found in}} some uranium ores, but is never found in the Earth's crust as a free element. About 31 ppm of the Earth's crust is yttrium, making it the 28th most {{abundant}} element, 400 times more common than silver. Yttrium is found in soil in concentrations between 10 and 150 <b>ppm</b> (dry <b>weight</b> average of 23 ppm) and in sea water at 9 ppt. Lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project have a relatively high content of yttrium.|$|R
40|$|Pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) were {{collected}} from pesticide-treated orchards in New York (USA) and fed to three captive American kestrels (Falco sparverius) for 60 days to evaluate potential hazards from soil-borne persistent insecticides. Three control kestrels were fed uncontaminated laboratory mice (Mus musculus). The pine voles contained an average of 38 ppm lead, 48 ppm DDE and 1. 2 <b>ppm</b> dieldrin (wet <b>weight).</b> The kestrels accumulated sublethal amounts of lead (1 <b>ppm</b> lead wet <b>weight)</b> in their livers. In contrast, DDE and dieldrin accumulated in the tissues and brains of kestrels to toxicologically significant concentrations. Control kestrels remained healthy and accumulated insignificant concentrations of the contaminants. The results indicated raptors may not be significantly at risk from lead residues in soil and biota following field applications of lead arsenate. However, sublethal effects may be expected from the level of contamination by organochlorine pesticides...|$|R
5|$|Estimates for the Earth's crustal content {{range from}} 20 to 70 <b>ppm</b> by <b>weight.</b> In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, {{with the largest}} {{concentrations}} in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources. Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite. A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States. At 20mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust, lithium is the 25th most abundant element.|$|R
40|$|Precision {{ultrasonic}} attenuation {{and velocity}} measurements {{have been conducted}} on high purity Nb crystals containing 0, 200, and 300 <b>ppm</b> by <b>weight</b> H. Variables in this study have been the number of thermal cycles in the temperature range 77 to 340 °K and various homogeneous tensile bias stress values up to ≈ 21 MPa. The hydrogen solvus temperature observed upon the first thermal cycle is lower than that observed upon subsequent thermal cycles. No measurable effect of bias stress upon the saturated solvus temperature after several thermal cycles has been noted. All results seem to be explainable from elementary thermodynamic and dislocation principles...|$|R
