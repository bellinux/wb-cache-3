This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation, bribery, or <b>physical</b> <b>assault</b> to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for <b>physical</b> <b>assault</b> or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E
5|$|Students in the {{residential}} school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and <b>physical</b> <b>assault.</b> They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline {{that would not have}} been tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundWork-related <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> or {{violence}} has severely impacted {{on the safety}} of the work environment and employees’ mental health. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the prevalence of <b>physical</b> <b>assaults,</b> the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on it and depression associated with it in employees working at large companies. MethodsA total of 22, 770 Japanese employees responded to a self-administered questionnaire including SES (educational status and occupational status), violence victimization, worksite social support and depression (response rate, 85 %). The 12 -month prevalence of <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> and depression was examined using a single question and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, respectively. ResultsThe prevalence of <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> was 1. 8 % both in males and females. Although the risk of exposure to <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> was 2 – 3 times higher in the blue-collar group than in the manager group, the association of exposure to <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> with depression was stronger in the manager and white-collar worker group (Prevalence ratio [PR]= 2. 1 in males; 1. 8 in females) than in the blue-collar worker group (PR= 1. 7 in males; 1. 5 in females) after adjusting demographic and occupational covariates. A similar pattern was observed for education in males; the association was stronger than in the lower education group (PR= 2. 1 and 1. 8). ConclusionsLow SES is a risk factor of exposure to <b>physical</b> <b>assaults,</b> however, the association of <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> with depression was significantly greater among company employees of higher SES than those of lower SES...|$|R

40|$|Sexual assaults {{are less}} likely to be {{reported}} to the police than <b>physical</b> <b>assaults,</b> while sexual assaults by a current partner are the least likely of all to be reported, even compared to other types of sexual assaults. Despite indications of a high prevalence rate of spousal sexual violence, there seems to be more reluctance on the part of victim/survivors to report or discuss spousal sexual violence compared to other types of sexual assaults. There is also reluctance to disclose sexual violence even when physical violence may be identified. This means that sexual assault may remain a hidden aspect of abuse in relationships, even where <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> are disclosed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics personal safety data also indicated that sexual assaults {{are less likely}} to be reported to the police than <b>physical</b> <b>assaults,</b> while sexual assaults by a current partner are the least likely of all to be reported, even compared to other types of sexual assaults...|$|R

25|$|Psychologically {{traumatic}} experiences often involve physical {{trauma that}} threatens one's survival {{and sense of}} security. Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include harassment, embarrassment, abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, <b>physical</b> <b>assault,</b> sexual abuse, partner battery, employment discrimination, police brutality, judicial corruption and misconduct, bullying, paternalism, domestic violence, indoctrination, being the victim of an alcoholic parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in childhood), life-threatening medical conditions, and medication-induced trauma. Catastrophic natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, large scale transportation accidents, house or domestic fire, motor vehicle accident, mass interpersonal violence like war, terrorist attacks or other mass tortures like sex trafficking, being taken as a hostage or kidnapped can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme poverty or milder forms of abuse, such as verbal abuse, exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.|$|E
25|$|ACODI {{documented}} 612 {{cases of}} racial discrimination in a single year, emphasising {{that many of these}} did not lead to official complaints because victims fear police retaliation or believe their complaints will be ignored. This belief is not unfounded; in 2005 Beauty Solomon, an African American immigrant working as a prostitute, filed two criminal complaints against Spanish policemen for repeated harassment and <b>physical</b> <b>assault.</b> In spite of eyewitness testimony and medical reports confirming her injuries the Spanish Courts dismissed her claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Solomon then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, who unanimously ruled in her favour that Spain had violated Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the European Convention of Human Rights. They also condemned Spain for failing to investigate both Solomon's assault and other racist and sexist acts of violence by police officers.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1992, Human Rights Watch (HRW) {{issued a}} {{detailed}} report, alleging RUC and paramilitary violations against children's rights during the Troubles.

In an accompanying statement, HRW cited allegations that:Police officers and soldiers harass young people on the street hitting, kicking and insulting them. Police officers in interrogation centres insult, trick and threaten youngsters and sometimes physically assault them. Children are locked up in adult detention centres and prisons in shameful conditions. Helsinki Watch heard dozens of stories from children, their parents, lawyers, youth workers and political leaders of children being stopped on the street and hit, kicked and abused again and again by police and soldiers. And seventeen-year-olds told Human Rights Watch Helsinki of severe beatings in detention during interrogations by police.|$|E
40|$|Tammy AndersonNightclubs provide {{entertainment}} for many young adults including DJ???s, club promoters, dancers, and music enthusiasts. Hip Hop and Electronic Dance Music {{have emerged as}} popular scenes within the nightclub industry to cater to many diverse people. However, there are risks involving <b>physical</b> and verbal <b>assault,</b> some of which {{having to do with}} cultural diversity and race. Existing research from Contact Theory claims that to ensure positive inter-racial experiences, contacts or interactions should not be competitive, should be sustained rather than episodic, and the setting in which they occur should confer equal status to all. Our analysis reveals support for this claim. We examined the role of race in <b>physical</b> and verbal <b>assaults</b> using interviews with 51 participants who frequently attend nightclubs in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Our analysis shows that violence, both inter-racial and intra-racial, is complicated by racial makeup, gender relations and masculinity, and the particular atmosphere of a nightclub. Almost all verbal and <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> included male victims and offenders. The results also show that <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> were most common within the same race (intra-racial), particularly at ???Asian Only??? events. Inter-racial <b>physical</b> <b>assaults</b> between two or more different races most often occurred at clubs where the majority of the attendees were from a particular race and the victim was an ???outsider. ??? Verbal assaults were most commonly an inter-racial offense and generally included racial slurs and ???you don???t belong here??? attitudes. The results show that nightclub events with a dominating racial group create major risks of <b>physical</b> and verbal <b>assaults</b> to club-goers. Additionally, the contact that takes place between races at a nightclub event is short and competitive and increases the occurrence of inter-racial assaults. Criminal Justic...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States, the Arbeelys, a Greek Orthodox family of Damascene origins, had begun {{printing}} Kawkab America (American Star), the first Arabic-language newspaper in North America; Mokarzel set out to open his own newspaper Al-ʿAsr (The Epoch) with capital from his wealthy merchant friend, Najeeb Maalouf. Mokarzel and Nageeb Arbeely engaged in a journalistic feud, personally attacking each other resulting in series of lawsuits and counter-suits between the two newspapers. The enterprise floundered and was discontinued {{less than a year after}} its commencement. Mokarzel attended medical school for two years before dropping out. Meanwhile, Mokarzel was gaining notoriety for his controversial demeanor; he engaged in brawls and verbal disputes with other Arabic-speaking immigrants and was arrested on several occasions for libel and <b>physical</b> <b>assault</b> against members of the community affiliated with the Arbeely family. The brawls that started as a result of professional competition and personal antipathy evolved into sectarian battles between Mokarzel's Maronite entourage and the Orthodox families of the community. Despite his multiple arrests, Mokarzel was never jailed but the incidents were to continue. In 1895, Tannous Shishim, a Lebanese immigrant, petitioned for divorce from his wife Sophie on the ground of adultery and Mokarzel was named co-respondent in the court proceedings. The Arbeelys were quick to publish the culpable news in their newspaper along with a bilingual transcript of the judge's decision, further tarnishing the reputation of Mokarzel. The accused couple got married and eloped to Philadelphia to flea the community's public denunciation.|$|E
