40|$|Rapid <b>permanent</b> <b>setting</b> of wool fabrics by {{conductive}} heat transfer Keith R Millington High levels (50 – 70 %) of <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> were obtained when wet pure wool fabric was heated rapidly to 110 – 130 C {{for up to}} 1 minute under conditions that limit the evaporation of water. If the final regain of the fabric after treatment was less than 34 %, lower levels of <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> were generally observed. If the initial regain was less than 34 %, <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> levels were invariably < 20 % and the specimens were usually damaged by scorching due to the low heat capacity and poor thermal conductivity of wool compared with water. This result precludes {{the use of a}} rapid chemical-free per-manent setting process based on {{conductive heat}} transfer at the dry finishing stage. Under more severe conditions (higher temperatures or longer pressing times) significant shrinkage, yellowing and fabric damage due to supercontrac-tion were observed. The high level of <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> obtained in this study suggests that the performance of continuous crabbing machines could be improved by optimizing the treatment conditions without the need for chemical setting agents...|$|R

40|$|High {{pressure}} vulcanization (HPV) {{is defined}} in this thesisas crosslinking of rubber materialsat elevated pressure andtemperature, {{without the use of}} any vulcanization agents. Thisis atotally new vulcanization technique, not used in theindustry today. The HPV technique,however, has an interestingpotential since no hazardous chemicals need to be handled,thematerial does not contain any additives. The phenomenon thatcertain rubber materials can be crosslinked in this way wasobserved already in the 1960 s, but there has been a lack ofknowledge of the underlying reaction mechanisms, kinetics, theresulting network structure and also the correlation betweenthe molecular structure and the physical properties ofthesematerials. The purpose of this thesis is to increase theknowledge of high pressurevulcanization, with respect toreaction kinetics and mechanisms, network structure andphysical properties. A low cis-polybutadiene was used as a model material forcrosslinking at high pressure (10 - 290 MPa) and temperature(240 - 250 °C), and comparisons were made withperoxidevulcanizates. Both unfilled and carbon black filledsamples were studied. Nitrile- and styrene-butadienerubber werealso crosslinked successfully. Crosslink density is a centralconcept inthis thesis and was evaluated by swellingmeasurements. The microstructural changesoccurring duringvulcanization were studied by Fourier Transform InfraredSpectroscopy(FTIR) and 13 C solid state nuclear magneticresonance (NMR). The mechanical propertieswere investigated bydynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), tensile testing,and <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> and <b>stress</b> relaxation measurements. Theprogress of the reaction proved to be well controlled by thetreatment time, temperature and pressure, resulting inmaterials with widely different properties within onesinglecompound due to the possibility of controlling thecrosslink density during the vulcanizationprocess. The reactionmechanism was shown to be of a radical type, and vinylunsaturations inthe polybutadiene are consumed concurrentlywith the crosslink formation. The effect ofpressure on thereaction is a decrease in molecular mobility, which results inhighercrosslinking reaction rate due to a decrease intermination reactions. When a carbon black filleris introduced,the number of polymer-filler interactions is increased due tothe ability of thepolymer to penetrate the carbon blackstructure under pressure. The mechanical properties areas goodas those of peroxide vulcanizates, and especially theresistance to deformation inservice-use at elevatedtemperatures suggests that the resulting material may be usedin gasketand seal applications. In spite of the difficulties ofmould sealing that arise at elevatedpressures, it was possibleto obtain vulcanized samples by common injection mouldingwithproperties comparable to those obtained by traditionalvulcanization.

40|$|This work uses {{three-dimensional}} Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{to investigate}} the effect of geometric arrangement of particulate reinforcement in highly filled polymer composites (such as polymer concrete) on the <b>setting</b> <b>stresses</b> that develop in these materials during cure due to resin shrinkage during polymerization. These composites were initially modeled by systems reinforced with spherical particles packed in simple cubic (SC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangements within the polymer matrix. A pronounced decrease in <b>setting</b> <b>stresses</b> was observed in the FCC system, which has a greater aggregate to resin ratio and more of resin domains per unit cell. A hexagonal-close-packed arrangement of hexagonal, prism-shaped aggregate was also analyzed and found to develop higher stresses, indicating that aggregate shape {{has an effect on}} <b>setting</b> <b>stresses.</b> A second <b>set</b> of models investigated the effect of size gradation and geometric arrangement of spherical reinforcing particles on <b>setting</b> <b>stresses.</b> The maximum stresses occur at the particle-resin interface, underlining the importance of resin/aggregate adhesion. Reduction of <b>setting</b> <b>stresses</b> by a factor of two was observed in systems with efficient packing, achieved with proper size gradation and close-packed geometry. A microstructural model for a polymer composite system based on a fairly random arrangement (FRA) of aggregate particles was also developed. This model gives a realistic representation of actual particle reinforced polymer composites. FEA results were used to develop an empirical equation for maximum <b>setting</b> <b>stresses</b> for Particle reinforced polymer composites. A probabilistic model for the distribution of voids in polymer composites was developed by solving a non-linear constrained optimization problem. The probability distributions of voids was used with a specially developed algorithm to generate the voids distributions in specific composites. The effect of voids on <b>setting</b> <b>stresses</b> in FRA models was discussed. In polymer composites voids tend to act as stress relief. This effect is more pronounced in poorly packed systems. This study provides an understanding of <b>setting</b> <b>stress</b> distribution in polymer composites. This work provides guidelines for optimizing the amount, shape and particle size distribution of the reinforcing aggregate in polymer composites so as to minimize <b>setting</b> <b>stresses,</b> thus leading to composites with significantly enhanced strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} average layered {{silicate}} particle size on the mechanical properties of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanocomposites has been investigated. At fixed addition levels (3 wt% organosilicate), {{an increase in}} average particle size resulted {{in an increase in}} stiffness. Negligible stiffening was observed for the smallest particles (30 nm) due to reduced long-range intercalation and molecular confinement, as well as ineffective stress transfer from matrix to filler. At low strain (<= 100 %), an increase in filler particle size was associated with an increase in the rate of stress relaxation, tensile hysteresis, and <b>permanent</b> <b>set.</b> At high strain (1200 %), two coexisting relaxation processes were observed. The rate of the slower (long-term) relaxation process, which is believed to primarily involve the hard segment rich structures, decreased on addition of particles with an average diameter of 200 nm or less. At high strain the tensile hysteresis was less sensitive to particle size, however the addition of particles with an average size of 200 nm or more caused a significant increase in <b>permanent</b> <b>set.</b> This was attributed to slippage of temporary bonds at the polymer-filler interface, and to the formation of voids at the sites of unaligned tactoids. Relative to the host TPU, the addition of particles with an average size of 30 nm caused a reduction in <b>permanent</b> <b>set.</b> This is a significant result because the addition of fillers to elastomers has long been associated with an increase in hysteresis and <b>permanent</b> <b>set.</b> At high strain, well dispersed and aligned layered silicates with relatively small interparticle distances and favourable surface interactions are capable of imparting a resistance to molecular slippage throughout the TPU matrix. © 2007, Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A {{test program}} was {{undertaken}} {{to demonstrate the}} ability of elastic-plastic finite element methods to predict dynamic inelastic response for simple structural members. Cantilever and fixed-beam specimens were tested to levels that produced plastic straining {{in the range of}} 2. 0 % and to 3. 0 % and <b>permanent</b> <b>sets.</b> Acceleration, strain, and displacement data were recorded for use in analytical correlation. Correlation analyses were performed using the ABAQUS finite element code. Results of the correlation show that current elastic-plastic analysis techniques accurately capture dynamic inelastic response (displacement, acceleration) due to rapidly applied dynamic loading. Peak elastic and inelastic surface strains are accurately predicted. To accurately capture inelastic straining near connections, a solid model, including fillet welds, is necessary. The hardening models currently available in the ABAQUS code (isotropic, kinematic) do not accurately capture inelastic strain reversals caused by specimen rebound. Analyses performed consistently underpredicted the peak strain level of the first inelastic reversal and the rebound deflection and overpredicted the <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> of structures experiencing inelastic rebound. Based on these findings, an improved hardening model is being implemented in the ABAQUS code by the developers. The intent of this model upgrade is to improve the ability of the program to capture inelastic strain reversals and to predict <b>permanent</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

Previous acceptance criteria for structures designed for rapidly applied transient dynamic loading limited stresses to those determined from elastic analysis. Different stress limits were established for different grades of structure {{depending upon the}} amount of <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> considered acceptable. Structure allowed to sustain very limited <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> is designed to stress limits not significantly greater than yield <b>stress.</b> Greater <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> in structure under rapidly applied transient dynamic loading conditions is permitted by establishing stress limits that are significantly greater than yield stress but still provide adequate safety margin (with respect to failure).

The strain limits established are based on a fraction of the strain at ultimate stress obtained from an engineering stress/strain curve of the material. Strains limits are categorized by type as membrane or surface and by region as general, local, or concentrated. The application of the elastic-plastic criterion provides a more accurate, less conservative design/analysis basis for structures than that used in elastic stress-based analysis criteria, while still providing adequate safety margins...|$|R
