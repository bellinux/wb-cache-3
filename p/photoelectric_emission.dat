40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{presence of}} {{dust in the}} lunar environment with its high adhesive characteristics has been recognized {{to be a major}} safety issue that must be addressed in view of its hazardous effects on robotic and human exploration of the Moon. The reported observations of a horizon glow and streamers at the lunar terminator during the Apollo missions are attributed to the sunlight scattered by the levitated lunar dust. The lunar surface and the dust grains are predominantly charged positively by the incident UV solar radiation on the dayside and negatively by the solar wind electrons on the night-side. The charged dust grains are levitated and transported over long distances by the established electric fields. A quantitative understanding of the lunar dust phenomena requires development of global dust distribution models, based on an accurate knowledge of lunar dust charging properties. Currently available data of lunar dust charging is based on bulk materials, although it is well recognized that measurements on individual dust grains are expected to be substantially different from the bulk measurements. In this paper we present laboratory measurements of charging properties of Apollo 11 & 17 dust grains by UV <b>photoelectric</b> <b>emissions</b> and by electron impact. These measurements indicate substantial differences of both qualitative and quantitative nature between dust charging properties of individual micron/submicron sized dust grains and of bulk materials. In addition, there are no viable theoretical models available as yet for calculation of dust charging properties of individual dust grains for both <b>photoelectric</b> <b>emissions</b> and electron impact. It is thus of paramount importance to conduct comprehensive measurements for charging properties of individual dust grains in order to develop realistic models of dust processes in the lunar atmosphere, and address the hazardous issues of dust on lunar robotic and human missions...|$|R

40|$|Dust grains {{in various}} astrophysical environments are {{generally}} charged electrostatically by <b>photoelectric</b> <b>emissions</b> with UV/X-ray radiation, {{as well as}} by electron/ion impact. Knowledge of physical and optical properties of individual dust grains is required for understanding of the physical and dynamical processes in space environments and the role of dust in formation of stellar and planetary systems. In this paper we focus on charging of individual micron/submicron dust grains by processes that include: (a) UV <b>photoelectric</b> <b>emissions</b> involving incident photon energies higher than the work function of the material and b) electron impact, where low energy electrons are scattered or stick to the dust grains, thereby charging the dust grains negatively, and at sufficiently high energies the incident electrons penetrate the grain leading to excitation and emission of electrons referred to as secondary electron emission (SEE). It is well accepted that the charging properties of individual micron/submicron size dust grains are expected to be substantially different from the bulk materials. However, no viable models for calculation of the charging properties of individual micron size dust grains are available at the present time. Therefore, the photoelectric yields, and secondary electron emission yields of micron-size dust grains have to be obtained by experimental methods. Currently, very limited experimental data are available for charging of individual micron-size dust grains. Our experimental results, obtained on individual, micron-size dust grains levitated in an electrodynamic balance facility (at NASA-MSFC), show that: (1) The measured photoelectric yields are substantially higher than the bulk values given in the literature and indicate a particle size dependence with larger particles having order-of-magnitude higher values than for submicron-size grains; (2) dust charging by low energy electron impact is a complex process. Also, our measurements indicate that the electron impact may lead to charging or discharging of dust grains depending upon the grain size, surface potential, electron energy, electron flux, grain composition, and configuration (e. g. Abbas et al, 2010). Laboratory measurements on charging of analogs of the interstellar dust as well as Apollo 11 dust grains conducted at the NASA-MSFC Dusty Plasma Lab. are presented her...|$|R

However, experimental results based on extensive laboratory measurements on the charging of individual 0. 2 - 13 micron size lunar dust grains by the secondary electron emissions (SEE) have been presented in a recent publication. The SEE process of charging of micron-size dust grains, however, is found to be very complex phenomena with strong particle size dependence.

40|$|It is {{well known}} since the Apollo {{missions}} that the lunar surface {{is covered with a}} thick layer of micron size dust grains with unusually high adhesive characteristics. The dust grains observed to be levitated and transported on the lunar surface are believed to have a hazardous impact on the robotic and human missions to the Moon. The observed dust phenomena are attributed to the lunar dust being charged positively during the day by UV <b>photoelectric</b> <b>emissions,</b> and negatively during the night by the solar wind electrons. The current dust charging and the levitation models, however, do not fully explain the observed phenomena, with the uncertainty of dust charging processes and the equilibrium potentials of the individual dust grains.

Knowledge of the electrostatic charging properties of dust grains in the lunar environment is required for addressing their hazardous effect on the humans and mechanical systems. It is well recognized that the charging properties of individual small micron size dust grains are substantially different from the measurements on bulk materials.

During the Apollo missions, the astronauts found the lunar dust to be extraordinarily high in its adhesive characteristics, sticking to the suits and the mechanical equipment. Electrostatically charged lunar dust is believed to be transported over long distances by the induced electric fields, as indicated by the observed dust streamers and the horizon glow [e. g., 1 - 3].

40|$|In the {{simplest}} case, a dust grain {{immersed in a}} plasma is negatively charged due to particle collection, owing {{to the fact that}} electrons are typically more mobile than ions and that electron emission from the grain is not taken into account. In this scenario, known as primary charging, the shielding potential is monotonic and well approximated by the Debye-Huckel potential when the grain radius is small compared to the linearized Debye length. However, the scenario described above changes significantly when other processes are taken into account, such as for instance electron emission from the grain, due to thermionic, <b>photoelectric</b> or secondary <b>emission.</b> In this case, Delzanno et al. showed that the shielding potential is no longer monotonic but can present an attractive potential well (reminiscent of the Lennard-Jones potential for the attraction among atoms). The presence of a potential well in the shielding potential has important consequences as it can lead to attractive forces on other grains even if they have the same sign of charge. Moreover, this mechanism can be particularly important for dust aggregation in astrophysical systems. In the astrophysical context, {{the simplest}} theory of aggregation of masses in space is the Jeans instability, where a uniform distribution of masses can collapse {{as a result of a}} perturbation with wavelength greater than the Jeans wavelength. In this study, we will present the kinetic theory of the modified Jeans instability, where particles interact through the gravitational and electrostatic forces. The latter, however, is not modeled with the Coulomb or Debye-Huckel potential but with the potential well discovered by G. L. Delzanno et al. (2004 and 2005).
