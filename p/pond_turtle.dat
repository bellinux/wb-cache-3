5|$|There are 24 {{species of}} reptiles, 11 {{of which have}} a {{population}} of global significance. They include red whip snake, Aesculapian snake, European blind snake, sheltopusik (Europe's largest lizard), Kotschy's gecko, European <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> Balkan <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> spur-thighed tortoise, Hermann's tortoise, etc. The sand lizard, which is typical for western Bulgaria but very uncommon to the east, is also present in the park. Ten amphibian species have been recorded, such as European tree frog, eastern spadefoot and southern crested newt. The absence of common reptiles and amphibians, such as fire salamander, common spadefoot and common European viper, is noteworthy.|$|E
5|$|Over 152 {{species of}} birds are known or {{suspected}} {{to live in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, including the northern goshawk and the northern spotted owl, a vulnerable species. Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as the vulnerable Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the wolverine, the western <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> the sandhill crane, and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle, several smaller turtle species {{are found in the}} Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys.

25|$|Box turtles are North American turtles of {{the genus}} Terrapene. Although box turtles are superficially similar to {{tortoises}} in terrestrial habits and overall appearance, they are actually members of the American <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> family (Emydidae). The twelve taxa which are distinguished in the genus are distributed over four species. They are largely characterized by having a domed shell, which is hinged at the bottom, allowing the animal to close its shell tightly to escape predators. Box turtles have become popular pets, although their needs in captivity are complex. The females usually have yellowish, brown eyes and the males usually have red or orange eyes, but the most reliable manner to distinguish males from females {{is to examine the}} plastron: on males there is a concave area centered beneath the hinge.|$|E

40|$|Background: Salmonella spp. are {{widespread}} zoonotic pathogens {{with economic}} importance for both humans and animals. They are categorized {{as the natural}} flora of the gastrointestinal tract of many reptiles. Human salmonellosis acquired from contact with reptiles is a well-recognized medical problem. Objective: The frequency of Salmonella contamination in Caspian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> was surveyed to evaluate the danger of exposure or disease risk for humans as these species are abundant around the villages in Golestan and Mazandaran provinces. Materials and Methods: One hundred fifty fecal samples from Caspian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> were tested by standard bacteriological methods and positive samples were serotyped. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests on isolated Salmonella strains were also performed. Results: Out of 150 samples, 54 turtles were detected to be contaminated with Salmonella. Of the 54 Salmonella isolates, 38. 8 % (21 / 54) were serotyped as S. typhimurium; 35. 1 % (19 / 54) as S. enterica subsp. enterica; 9. 2 % (5 / 54) as S. enterica subsp. salamae; 9. 2 % (5 / 54) as S. enterica subsp. arizona; and 7. 4 % (4 / 54) as S. enterica subsp. houtenae. Female (28 / 80, 35 %) and male (26 / 74, 35. 1 %) turtles showed equal incidence of Salmonella spp. contamination. Resistance was mostly observed against ampicillin (37 %) followed by tetracycline (33. 3 %), nalidixic acid (7. 4 %), ciprofloxacin (5. 5 %), and cotrimoxazole (3. 7 %). The highest susceptibility was observed against gentamicin (100 %) and trimethoprim (98. 1 %). Conclusion: Our findings confirmed {{that people who are}} in close exposure to Caspian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> and their feces are at the risk of Salmonella contamination. Accordingly, fundamental principles of hygiene should be applied in human contact with Caspian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles.</b> Furthermore, people should be educated about the Salmonella contamination which may occur through Caspian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles...</b>|$|R
