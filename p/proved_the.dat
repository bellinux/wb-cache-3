5|$|This {{recursive}} {{formulation of}} addition {{was developed by}} Dedekind as early as 1854, and he would expand upon it in the following decades. He <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> associative and commutative properties, among others, through mathematical induction.|$|E

5|$|Against long-circulating speculations {{that his}} family has French roots, genealogists <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> German origin of Rockefeller and traced {{them back to the}} early 17th century. Thereupon Johann Peter Rockenfeller (baptized 27 September 1682 in the Protestant church of Rengsdorf) immigrated in 1723 from Altwied (today a {{district}} of Neuwied, Rhineland-Palatinate) with three children to North America and settled down in Germantown, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{continued}} to conspire against Emeric, although Pope Innocent III continued urging Andrew {{to launch a}} crusade. On 10 March 1199, Emeric forced Boleslaus, Bishop of Vác, who was a supporter of Andrew, to give him documents that <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> conspiracy against him. In the summer of that year, Emeric defeated Andrew's army near Lake Balaton, which made Andrew flee to Austria. A papal legate named Gregory arrived in Hungary to mediate a reconciliation between the two brothers. According to the brothers' treaty, Emeric once again granted Croatia and Dalmatia to Andrew {{in the summer of}} 1200.|$|E
5|$|As runners-up to League champions Manchester United in the 1996 FA Cup Final, Liverpool {{were able}} {{to compete in the}} 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. This <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> club's most {{successful}} campaign since their return to European competition, as they reached the semi-finals, where they were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate by Paris Saint–Germain. In the next two seasons, Liverpool played in the UEFA Cup but were eliminated at an early stage of the competition, by Strasbourg and Celta de Vigo, respectively. A seventh-place finish in the 1998–99 FA Premier League meant the club did not qualify for Europe in 1999–2000.|$|E
30|$|In this section, we <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> {{first part}} of Theorem  1.1 by two steps.

5|$|At the Battle of Breitenfeld, in 1631, Adolphus <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> {{effectiveness}} of the changes made to his army, by defeating Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes were able to fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery, and their infantry's linear formations helped ensure they didn't lose any ground. Battered by cannon fire, and low on morale, Tilly's men broke ranks and fled.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the delay}} of the 707 programme, the {{contribution}} of the 707B and 707A towards the basic design of the 698 was not considered significant, though it did highlight a need to increase the length of the nosewheel to give a ground incidence of 3.5 degrees, the optimum take-off attitude. The 707B and 707A <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> design's validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.|$|E

5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{focused on}} the foundations of general relativity {{as well as on}} the theory's applications to astrophysics. He formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern cosmology. He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated within the framework of general relativity and those of Newtonian gravity. In addition, Ehlers had a keen interest in both the history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent populariser of science.|$|E
5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E
5|$|For his campaign, Romney {{assembled}} a veteran group of Republican staffers, consultants, and pollsters. He was little-known nationally, though, and stayed around the 10percent support range in Republican preference polls {{for the first}} half of 2007. He <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> most effective fundraiser of any of the Republican candidates and also partly financed his campaign with his own personal fortune. These resources, combined with the mid-year near-collapse of nominal front-runner John McCain's campaign, made Romney a threat to win the nomination and the focus of the other candidates' attacks. Romney's staff suffered from internal strife; the candidate himself was at times indecisive, often asking for more data before making a decision.|$|E

Following the game, members of the Canadian team accused the Americans of stomping on a Canadian flag in their dressing room, although an investigation later <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> rumour false. The Swedish team won the bronze medal over Finland, the nation's first in women's ice hockey.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> {{importance of}} the telescope {{as a tool for}} astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth {{was at the center of}} the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science <b>proved</b> <b>the</b> {{unity of}} all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., {{all members of}} a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught the unity of man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

5|$|In 1095, Byzantine emperor Alexius I {{appealed to}} Pope Urban II for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the Byzantine–Seljuk Wars, which caused Urban {{to launch the}} First Crusade aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and {{returning}} the Holy Land to Christian control. In the 11th century, strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the Latin Church separated them in the East–West Schism, partially due to conflicts over papal authority.
