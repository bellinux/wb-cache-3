25|$|The United Nations Model Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods and {{national}} transportation authorities, such as United States Department of Transportation, have classified gunpowder (black powder) as a Group A: <b>Primary</b> <b>explosive</b> substance for shipment because it ignites so easily. Complete manufactured devices containing black powder are usually classified as Group D: Secondary detonating substance, or black powder, or article containing secondary detonating substance, such as firework, class D model rocket engine, etc., for shipment {{because they are}} harder to ignite than loose powder. As explosives, they all fall {{into the category of}} Class 1.|$|E
50|$|Solid pack {{electric}} {{blasting caps}} use a thin bridgewire in direct contact (hence solid pack) with a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive,</b> which is heated by electric current and causes the detonation of the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> That <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> then detonates a larger charge of secondary explosive.|$|E

50|$|EBWs {{have found}} uses outside nuclear weapons, {{such as the}} Titan IV, safety {{conscious}} applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries. EBW detonators are much safer than regular electric detonators because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have <b>primary</b> <b>explosives.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> such as lead azide {{are very sensitive to}} static electricity, radio frequency, shock etc.|$|R
50|$|A: <b>Primary</b> <b>explosive</b> {{substance}} (1.1A).|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{blasting}} caps use electricity to heat a bridge wire rather than vaporize it, and that heating then causes the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> to detonate. Imprecise {{contact between the}} bridgewire and the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> changes how quickly the explosive is heated up, and minor electrical variations in the wire or leads will change how quickly it heats up as well. The heating process typically takes milliseconds to tens of milliseconds to complete and initiate detonation in the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> This is roughly 1,000 to 10,000 times longer and less precise than the EBW electrical vaporization.|$|E
50|$|The {{substance}} exhibits blasting properties, {{therefore it}} is sometimes use as a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Priming {{compositions}} are <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> {{mixed with}} other compositions to control (lessen) {{the sensitivity of}} the mixture to the desired property.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are {{extremely}} sensitive to mechanical shock, friction, and heat, {{to which they}} will respond by burning rapidly or detonating.|$|R
50|$|For example, <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are so {{sensitive}} {{that they need}} to be stored and shipped in a wet state to prevent accidental initiation.|$|R
50|$|A {{secondary}} explosive is less sensitive than a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> and requires substantially more energy to be initiated. Because {{they are less}} sensitive, they are usable in {{a wider variety of}} applications and are safer to handle and store. Secondary explosives are used in larger quantities in an explosive train and are usually initiated by a smaller quantity of a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Match type {{blasting}} caps use an electric match (insulating sheet with electrodes on both sides, a thin bridgewire soldered across the sides, all dipped in ignition and output mixes) {{to initiate the}} <b>primary</b> <b>explosive,</b> rather than direct contact between the bridgewire and the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> The match can be manufactured separately {{from the rest of}} the cap and only assembled at the end of the process.|$|E
50|$|Platinum {{fulminate}} is a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> {{which is}} a fulminate salt of platinum discovered by Edmund Davy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> {{are often}} used in {{detonators}} or to trigger larger charges of less sensitive secondary <b>explosives.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are commonly used in blasting caps and percussion caps to translate a physical shock signal. In other situations, different signals such as electrical/physical shock, or, {{in the case of}} laser detonation systems, light, are used to initiate an action, i.e., an explosion. A small quantity, usually milligrams, is sufficient to initiate a larger charge of explosive that is usually safer to handle.|$|R

50|$|High-explosives trains can {{be either}} two-step (e.g., {{detonator}} and dynamite) or three-step (e.g., detonator, booster of <b>primary</b> <b>explosive,</b> and main charge of secondary explosive).|$|E
5000|$|Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) is a [...] high {{explosive}} organic compound. The theorized structure lent itself well to acting as an initiating, or <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> While still quite sensitive to shock and friction, it was relatively stable {{compared to other}} initiating explosives of the time, such as mercury fulminate, and proved to be relatively inexpensive and easy to synthesise. As such, it was quickly taken up as a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> in mining applications. However, it has since been superseded by even more stable compounds such as tetryl.|$|E

50|$|Amatol {{should not}} be stored in {{containers}} made from copper or brass, as it can form unstable compounds sensitive to vibration. Pressed, it is relatively insensitive but may be detonated by severe impact, whereas when cast, it is extremely insensitive. <b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> such as mercury fulminate were often used as a detonator, in combination with an explosive booster charge such as tetryl.|$|R

50|$|Potassium picrate, or {{potassium}} 2,4,6-trinitrophenolate, is {{an organic}} chemical, a picrate of potassium. It is a reddish yellow or green crystalline material. It is a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> Anhydrous potassium picrate forms orthorhombic crystals.|$|E
5000|$|AgN3, {{like most}} heavy metal azides, is a {{dangerous}} <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> Decomposition can be triggered by exposure to ultraviolet light or by impact. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidising agent to destroy [...] in spills.|$|E
50|$|A fuze {{may contain}} only the {{electronic}} or mechanical elements necessary to signal or actuate the detonator, but some fuzes contain {{a small amount}} of <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> to initiate the detonation. Fuzes for large explosive charges may include an explosive booster.|$|E
50|$|If {{detonators}} with <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are used, {{the shock}} {{wave of the}} initiating blast may set off the detonator and the attached charge. However even relatively insensitive explosives can be set off if their shock sensitivity is sufficient. Depending on the location, the shock wave can be transported by air, ground, or water. The process is probabilistic, a radius with 50% probability of sympathetic detonation often being used for quantifying the distances involved.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use of PETN is as an {{explosive}} with high brisance. It {{is more difficult}} to detonate than <b>primary</b> <b>explosives,</b> so dropping or igniting it will typically not cause an explosion (at atmospheric pressure it is difficult to ignite and burns relatively slowly), but is more sensitive to shock and friction than other secondary explosives such as TNT or tetryl. Under certain conditions a deflagration to detonation transition can occur.|$|R
50|$|Many picrates are explosives, {{for example}} {{ammonium}} picrate (known as Dunnite). Some {{are used as}} <b>primary</b> <b>explosives,</b> namely lead picrate or potassium picrate which find their use as primers for cartridge ammunition. Picrates of some metals tend to be significantly more sensitive to impact, friction and shock than picric acid itself. As a result, storage of picric acid (or mixtures containing it) in metal containers is strongly discouraged due to the high risk of accidental explosion.|$|R
