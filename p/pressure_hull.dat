5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's <b>pressure</b> <b>hull,</b> {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} earlier optical {{periscopes}} {{required them to}} penetrate the <b>pressure</b> <b>hull,</b> reducing the structural integrity of the <b>pressure</b> <b>hull</b> as well as increasing the risk of flooding, and also required the submarine's control room to be located directly below the sail/fin. Implementation of photonics masts (which do not penetrate the <b>pressure</b> <b>hull)</b> enabled the submarine control room to be relocated to a position inside the <b>pressure</b> <b>hull</b> which is not necessarily directly below the sail.|$|E

40|$|Thin spherical <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls</b> {{are used}} as a human {{occupancy}} in deep water applications. DNV and other standards specify the imperfection allowed for <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls.</b> Numerical analyses are carried out to find the buckling pressure for both perfect and imperfect thin spherical <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls,</b> considering the geometric and material non-linearities. It is observed {{that there is a}} huge variation in the elastic and inelastic buckling pressure in perfect spherical <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls.</b> Moreover, if the manufacturing imperfections are considered in the inelastic numerical analysis, still there is a reduction in the buckling pressure. Design criteria, for deep water <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls,</b> is that both buckling pressure and yield pressure must be greater than the design pressure. In the elastic analysis, if t/D >  0. 006 buckling pressure is always greater than the yield pressure whereas in the inelastic analysis, the buckling pressure is falling below the yield pressure for all t/D ratios. Hence, inelastic numerical analysis with manufacturing imperfection has to considered in the design of deep water spherical <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls</b> of manned submersibles...|$|R

25|$|The TDC {{needed to}} be {{positioned}} near other fire control equipment to minimize the amount of electromechanical interconnect. Because submarine space within the <b>pressure</b> <b>hull</b> was limited, the TDC {{needed to be}} as small as possible. On World War II submarines, the TDC and other fire control equipment was mounted in the conning tower, which was a very small space.|$|E
25|$|The SOUP refits {{comprised}} a new US {{fire control}} system, a digital Singer Librascope Mark I, and new Sperry passive ranging sonar with the Type 719 short range sonar removed.

The submarines were fitted with new torpedo tubes for Mark 48 torpedoes, however the torpedoes themselves were considered a separate procurement program, which was only finalized in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The Virginia {{class is}} the first to utilize {{photonic}} sensors instead of a traditional periscope: the class is equipped with high-resolution cameras, along with light-intensification and infrared sensors, an infrared laser rangefinder, and an integrated Electronic Support Measures (ESM) array. Two redundant sets of these sensors are mounted on two AN/BVS-1 photonics masts located outside the <b>pressure</b> <b>hull.</b> Signals from the masts' sensors are transmitted through optical fiber data lines through signal processors to the control center.

25|$|Full-scale {{models of}} her <b>pressure</b> <b>hull</b> were constructed, and used during mid-1942 for {{underwater}} tests of experimental shaped charge anti-submarine bombs. In a highly secret British project, Graph {{was also used}} {{as a model for}} the construction of three, full-sized, mock-ups of the control compartment, wardroom and radio room of a Type VII U-boat. These were used to train specialist groups of sailors, who would form boarding parties whenever a damaged U-boat was blown to the surface. They were trained to operate a U-boat's ballast-tank valves, to reverse any scuttling attempts by the crew, and to search quickly for cryptographic equipment and documents.|$|E
25|$|Deep Diver was 22 {{feet long}} and 8.5 feet tall. It weighed 8.25 tons dry. It allowed one pilot and three {{observers}} to dive {{for a total of}} 32 man-hours to a depth limit of 1350 feet. The <b>pressure</b> <b>hull</b> was made of steel, 54 inches thick for the pilots' and divers' compartments. Deep Divers main hatch was 23 inches in diameter. The submersible featured no manipulators. It had twenty-one acrylic plastic viewports. The ballast and trim tanks provided 845 pounds and 676 pounds of positive buoyancy, respectively, when emptied. A large battery pod containing four battery banks could be jettisoned in an emergency, providing an additional 1500 pounds of buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|Early that evening, Tunny {{surfaced}} {{and headed}} {{away from the}} heavily traveled lanes she had been patrolling {{in order to assess}} her damages and effect repairs. Inspection disclosed considerable damage to the bow, ripped-up plating aft of the torpedo room, and sheared-off rivets and bolts. The torpedo room <b>pressure</b> <b>hull</b> was badly dished in between frames; and this damage in turn immobilized the bow plane tilting gears. The explosions had jammed the gyro spindles in the stern torpedo tubes, impaired the usefulness of sound and radar gear, and caused other damage visible throughout the ship. Sailors inspecting topside found fragments of the destructive depth charges scattered over the deck.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} {{composite}} material <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls</b> is considered for deep submergence research vehicle applications. A thick laminate must be incorporated {{because of the}} high external hydrostatic pressure design requirements. The result is a thick-walled cylinder which by definition has a radius-to-thickness ratio less than ten. Sub-scale cylinders made of graphite/epoxy have been tested and found to fail prematurely. A failure analysis is performed to investigate the failure mechanisms. Thin laminate testing results in an ultimate compressive strength significantly higher than that obtained by sub-scale cylinder testing. Hence, a discrepancy exists between thin (2 -D) and thick (3 -D) lam-inate testing. Through the thickness and thick laminate compression tests show that a large Poisson’s ratio causes significant tensile strains through the thickness resulting from hoop and axial compressive loading. Because there is no fiber reinforcement in the through the thickness direction, these tensile strains may contribute to the cylinder failure.

50|$|The Dolfijn {{class was}} a special Dutch design and had three {{separate}} <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls</b> arranged in a triangle and enclosed in external steel casing. The upper hull for the living/working part of the crew and the lower two hulls were for the engines, batteries and storage rooms. This allowed the submarine to dive much deeper than other submarines from the late 1950s, with a test depth of 200 m. The designer was Max F Gunning.|$|R
40|$|Exploitation of {{the ocean}} floor for {{commercial}} or military use requires not only Remotely Oper-ated Vehicles (ROVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), submersibles, and diving systems; it also requires 1 -atmosphere enclosures permanently-or semipermanently-affixed to the ocean floor. These 1 -atmosphere enclosures would serve as habitats for the crews, covers for mine shafts, and pressure-existent buildings for ore or food-processing plants. Bottom-mounted pressure-resistant enclosures must be negatively buoyant, instead of positively buoyant (as they are with <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls</b> for submersibles). This allows them to be constructed from inexpensive materials with low specific compressive strength. The primary choice for such applications is Portland cement concrete, since it is inexpensive, can be cast in situ, does not deteriorate under long-term immersion, and has a fair specific compressive strength. In fact, its specific compressive strength is high enough to qualify the material as a viable candidate for use in constructing large submarine oil tankers that require <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls</b> with only mar-ginal positive buoyancy. Since concrete has not previously been used for constructing pressure-resistant shells for ocean engineering structures, there was a total absence of engineering data {{on which to base}} the design o...|$|R
25|$|Inspection {{disclosed}} that the bombs had dished in the hull plating {{in the vicinity}} of the after torpedo room and the maneuvering room, causing a leak in a vent riser. Less than ten minutes after the Japanese plane had been sighted, the commanding officer decided to discontinue the patrol. Throughout the ship, sheared off valves and bolts, damaged meters, clocks, and gauges attested to the force of the bomb's explosion. In addition, all three radio antennas were down, a leak in her <b>pressure</b> <b>hull</b> had been aggravated, and Tunnys rudder action indicated possible damage. She set her course for Balintang Channel and surfaced late in the day on 2 September. Tunny continued to sight Japanese airplanes as she made her way to Hawaii. She completed this patrol on 17 September at Pearl Harbor.|$|E
25|$|Early on, the Germans {{experimented with}} the idea of the Schnorchel (snorkel) from {{captured}} Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The Schnorchel was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth, allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire <b>pressure</b> <b>hull</b> as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today. Speed was limited to , lest the device snap from stress. The Schnorchel also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the Schnorchel mast could be detected beyond visual range.|$|E
25|$|The {{submarine}} made appearances {{across the}} Sea of Marmara {{over the following}} five days {{to give the impression}} of multiple boats, and several attacks against Turkish ships were made, although all failed because of increasing mechanical problems. News of the submarine's successes was spread to the soldiers ashore to improve morale. On 29 April, AE2 met , one of several submarines that had entered the Dardanelles following the Australian boat's successful attempt. The submarines arranged a rendezvous for the next morning. When AE2 reached the rendezvous point on 30 April, smoke from the torpedo boat Sultanhisar was sighted, so the submarine dove and moved to investigate. At 10:30, about a mile from the torpedo boat, AE2 inexplicably rose and broke the surface. While diving to evade, the boat passed below her safe diving depth; frantic attempts to correct this caused the submarine's stern to break the surface. Sultanhisar immediately fired on the submarine, puncturing the <b>pressure</b> <b>hull</b> in three places near the engine spaces. Stoker ordered the boat's company to evacuate, and scuttled AE2 at 10:45'. All personnel survived the attack and were captured by Sultanhisar, although four died from illness while in captivity. AE2s achievements showed others that the task was possible, and within months Turkish shipping and lines of communication were badly disrupted, with supplies and reinforcements for the Turkish defence of Gallipoli forced to take underdeveloped overland routes. AE2 was the only RAN vessel to be lost as a result of enemy action during World War I, and along with sister boat AE1, the total of the RAN's operational losses in the war.|$|E

50|$|The Type 206 is a {{class of}} {{diesel-electric}} submarines (Uboats) developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW). Its design {{is based on the}} preceding Type 205 submarine class. These small and agile submarines were built during the Cold War to operate in the shallow Baltic Sea and attack Warsaw Pact shipping in the event of military confrontation. The <b>pressure</b> <b>hulls</b> were built out of non-magnetic steel to counter the threat of magnetic naval mines and make detection with MAD sensors more difficult. The low emission profile allowed the submarines in exercises to intrude even into well-protected opposing forces such as carrier formations with their screen.|$|R
5000|$|The Topeka and [...] form {{a unique}} sub-class among Los Angeles class submarines.

This was done to test construction methods using this steel, which would later be employed in the assembly of the new s.

50|$|Human {{occupants}} of a submarine would suffer physiological problems {{if the air}} pressure inside were simply allowed to be equal to the water <b>pressure</b> outside the <b>hull</b> (for example, oxygen becomes toxic at high pressures). So, when the inside air is kept at normal atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> the <b>hull</b> {{must be able to}} withstand the forces created by the outside water pressure being greater than the inside air pressure. The outside water pressure increases with depth and so the stresses on the hull also increase with depth.
