25|$|Another {{theory is}} that the psychoactive agent in kykeon is DMT, which occurs in many wild plants of the Mediterranean, {{including}} Phalaris and/or Acacia.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{was done to}} evaluate the induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cell line by <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala’s</b> extract, in which {{a significant amount of}} ß-carbolines is included. The apoptosis incidence was assessed through Annexin-V-Flous kit. The expressions of genes through which intrinsic apoptosis pathway are involved, Bax, Bcl- 2, Bid, and Puma, over the genes the expressions of which are linked to extrinsic apoptosis pathway, TRAIL, Caspase 8, p 21, and p 53, were examined by RT-PCR and Real-time PCR. The results demonstrate that the extract decreases the growth rate of the cancer cell line through inducing apoptosis mechanism. As long as the expression of anti-apoptosis Bcl- 2 gen reduced dramatically, an over-expression in Bax and Puma genes was monitored indicating activation of intrinsic apoptosis pathway. A notable over-expression observed with TRAIL and Caspase 8 genes as well as Bid gene. The latter is an intermediate for both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis...|$|R

2500|$|They {{concluded}} that it was [...] "therefore neither likely that Ephedra was a substitute for *sauma nor that it was *sauma itself" [...] and that the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine alkaloids extracted from Ephedra had to be mixed with the extract from some other plant to achieve the described effects. Flattery proposed the second plant was <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala</b> (harmal, harmel, Syrian rue, see also harmaline), known in Iranian languages as esfand, sepand or other similar terms related to Avestan word spenta ('sacred', 'holy'). Flattery considered harmel {{to be the real}} haoma, with ephedra only being the secondary ingredient in the parahaoma mixture. Other reasons for preferring <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala</b> as the identity of soma-haoma include its use as an entheogen in some South American cultures, mirroring its role in Indo-Iranian religion, and its being the only incense plant with hallucinogenic properties in Iran.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{claim that}} the word means [...] "undrinkable" [...] in Greek, but it may instead {{be linked to the}} Persian root spand or aspand, or the variant esfand, which meant <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala,</b> also called Syrian Rue—although it is not {{actually}} a variety of rue, another famously bitter herb. That Artemisia absinthium was commonly burned as a protective offering may suggest that its origins lie in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root *spend, meaning [...] "to perform a ritual" [...] or [...] "make an offering". Whether the word was a borrowing from Persian into Greek, or from a common ancestor of both, is unclear. Alternatively, the Greek word may originate in a pre-Greek substrate Pelasgian word, marked by the non-Indo-European consonant complex νθ (-nth).|$|E
2500|$|In the 16th century, Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal first {{encountered}} indigenous South Americans using ayahuasca; their earliest reports {{described it as}} [...] "the work of the devil". [...] In the 20th century, the active chemical constituent of B. caapi was named telepathine, but it {{was found to be}} identical to a chemical already isolated from <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala</b> and was given the name harmaline. [...] Beat writer William Burroughs read a paper by Richard Evans Schultes on the subject and while traveling through South America in the early 1950s sought out yagé in the hopes that it could relieve or cure opiate addiction (see The Yage Letters). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in True Hallucinations. [...] Dennis McKenna later studied pharmacology, botany, and chemistry of ayahuasca and oo-koo-he, which became the subject of his master's thesis.|$|E

5000|$|The harmala {{alkaloids}} {{occur in}} <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala</b> in concentrations of roughly 3%, though tests have documented anywhere from 2-7% or even higher, as natural sources tend to vary widely in chemical makeup. Harmala alkaloids {{are also found}} in the Banisteriopsis caapi vine, the key plant ingredient in the sacramental beverage Ayahuasca, in concentrations that range between 0.31-8.43% for harmine, 0.03-0.83% for harmaline and 0.05-2.94% for tetrahydroharmine. [...] Although other psychoactive plants are occasionally added to Ayahuasca to achieve visionary states of consciousness, the recipes vary greatly and no single combination is common. <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala,</b> normally consumed as a tea or used as an incense, is mentioned in classical Persian literature both as a sacred sacrament and as a medicine. The harmala alkaloids are not especially psychedelic, even at higher dosages, when hypnagogic visions, alongside vomiting and diarrhea, become the main effect.|$|E
50|$|Harmine {{is found}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{different}} organisms, most of which are plants. Alexander Shulginlists about thirty different species known to contain harmine, including seven species of butterfly in the Nymphalidae family. The harmine-containing plants listed include tobacco, <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala,</b> two species of passion flower/passion fruit, and numerous others. Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) contains harmine.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} much {{speculation}} concerning what {{is most likely to}} have been the identity of the original plant. However, traditional accounts with unbroken continuity in Southern India, from Ayurveda and Siddha medicine practitioners and Somayajna ritualists undoubtably use [...] "Somalata" [...] (Sarcostemma acidum). Non Indian researchers proposed candidates include Amanita muscaria, Psilocybe cubensis, <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala</b> and Ephedra sinica.|$|E
50|$|Isolated {{from the}} plant <b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala,</b> harmine is an indole {{alkaloid}} with the pyrido3,4-bindole ring structure that is characteristic of the β-carboline alkaloids. The β-carboline alkaloids include harmine, harmaline, harman and harmalol. These molecules are heterocyclic amines, biosynthesized through the combination of five- and six-membered ring structures that are derived from an amino acid (either L-tryptophan or tryptamine), which facilitates {{the formation of an}} indole ring system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala</b> {{contains}} Harmaline, {{which is}} a strong MAO-inhibitor, and it is therefore often used as a first component in Ayahuasca ceremonies in order to inhibit the metabolisation of an orally administered DMT molecule (2nd component).

50|$|The {{plants that}} are rich in non-isoprenoid indole {{alkaloids}} include harmal (<b>Peganum</b> <b>harmala),</b> which contains harmane, harmine and harmaline, and Calabar bean (Physostigma venenosum) containing physostigmine. Some {{members of the family}} Convolvulaceae, in particular Ipomoea violacea and Turbina corymbosa, contain ergolines and lysergamides. Despite the considerable structural diversity, most of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is localized in three families of dicotyledon plants: Apocynaceae (genera Alstonia, Aspidosperma, Rauwolfia and Catharanthus), Rubiaceae (Corynanthe) and Loganiaceae (Strychnos).|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, David Flattery, with {{linguistic}} {{support from}} Martin Schwarz, concentrated again on Iranian haoma. The two again paid {{particular attention to}} the hallucinogenic properties that may be interpreted from the texts, and discounted Ephedra because they could not observe Zoroastrian priests becoming intoxicated.They concluded that it was [...] "therefore neither likely that Ephedra was a substitute for *sauma nor that it was *sauma itself" [...] and that the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine alkaloids extracted from Ephedra had to be mixed with the extract from some other plant to achieve the described effects.
