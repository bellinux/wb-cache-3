2500|$|The surgery {{involves}} {{exposure of}} {{the front of the}} knee, with detachment of part of the quadriceps muscle (vastus medialis) from the patella. [...] The patella is displaced {{to one side of the}} joint, allowing {{exposure of the}} distal end of the femur and the proximal end of the tibia. The ends of these bones are then accurately cut to shape using cutting guides oriented to the long axis of the bones. The cartilages and the anterior cruciate ligament are removed; the posterior cruciate ligament may also be removed [...] but the tibial and fibular collateral ligaments are preserved. Metal components are then impacted onto the bone or fixed using <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> (<b>PMMA)</b> cement. Alternative techniques exist that affix the implant without cement. [...] These cement-less techniques may involve osseointegration, including porous metal prostheses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{replacement}} joint, {{which was}} known as the Low Friction Arthroplasty, was lubricated with synovial fluid. The small femoral head (...) was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or UHMWPE acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> (<b>PMMA)</b> bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants.|$|E

British ophthalmologist Sir Harold Ridley observed that Royal Air Force pilots who sustained eye injuries during World War II involving PMMA windshield material did not show any rejection or foreign body reaction.

50|$|Dendronized {{polymers}}. (or dendronised polymers) are linear polymers {{to every}} repeat unit of which dendrons are attached.

50|$|Many high {{strength}} or electrically conductive polymers contain imide subunits, i.e., the polyimides.

40|$|Abstract. We innovated a new {{technique}} and hydroxyapatite material “HA Block ” in order to decrease complications such as pulmonary embolization and correct kyphosis due to osteoporosis.

By using thoracolumber spines derived from elderly human cadavers, two kinds of vertebral fracture models: Flat and Wedge were made on MTS 858 Mini.

50|$|The {{extent of}} {{photochemical}} reactions involving oxygen {{differ in the}} inner and outer layers of both aromatic and aliphatic polymers due to their dependence on the diffusion of oxygen through the polymer. Photooxidation is significantly reduced at depths beyond which oxygen penetrates. Studies of the degradation profiles of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> (<b>PMMA)</b> and polyvinylchloride (PVC) show that photooxidation was higher at the front and back surfaces than in the interior bulk of the material. Because ultraviolet radiation is not strongly absorbed by these materials, a considerable amount of the radiation incident on the front surface is transmitted to the back surface where it initiates photooxidation.|$|E

It also made spinal implants, dental implants, and general operating instruments.Its subsidiary, Biomet Microfixation, manufactured mainly craniomaxillofacial and neurosurgical products. These included LactoSorb, a fixation system made of completely resorbable material for guided bone regeneration, titanium plates and screws for craniomaxillofacial fixation, instruments for craniomaxillofacial and orthopedic procedures and hard tissue replacements {{made out of}} biocompatible polymers, as used in cranial defects. Biomet began using <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> (<b>PMMA)</b> beads, which are fused together with polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (PHEMA) for cranial plates, in 1993.

50|$|PIOL {{insertion}} is an intraocular procedure. With all surgeries {{there are}} associated risks. In addition, each PIOL style {{has its own}} set of associated risks. In thecase of PIOLs made of <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> (<b>PMMA),</b> surgical insertion requires a larger incision, which may result in postoperative astigmatism. By comparison, PIOLS made of collamer (a foldable gel-like substance) requires a very small incision due the flexibility of the material and thus significantly reduces astigmatism risk. In the cases where refractive outcomes are not optimal, LASIK can be used for fine-tuning. If a patient eventually develops a visually significant cataract, the PIOL will have to be explanted at the time of cataract surgery, possibly through a larger-than-usual incision.|$|E

In a few cases, surgery was required to remove the Artecoll.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{incorporate}} the QDs on functional solar cells, they must be dispersed in a matrix. For this purpose, polymers are attractive materials for dispersing the nanoparticles for several reasons including affordability, mechanical flexibility and ease of processing into thin films. Furthermore, most polymers are highly transparent at wavelengths longer than 400  nm; thus, nanocomposites based on nanoparticle dispersion in polymers are a promising option for integrated optical devices. In this effort we selected <b>Polymethylmethacrylate</b> (495 <b>PMMA</b> A 2 from Microchem) as the matrix in which to disperse the Carbon and CdTe QDs {{on the basis of}} its high transparency (93  %), low fragility, high weather and UV resistance and excellent thermal insulation.

50|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{common to}} nearly all self-assembled systems is their thermodynamic stability. For SA {{to take place}} without intervention of external forces, the process must lead to a lower Gibbs free energy, thus self-assembled structures are thermodynamically more stable than the single, unassembled components. A direct consequence is the general tendency of self-assembled structures to be relatively free of defects. An example is the formation of two-dimensional superlattices composed of an orderly arrangement of micrometre-sized <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> (<b>PMMA)</b> spheres, starting from a solution containing the microspheres, in which the solvent is allowed to evaporate slowly in suitable conditions. In this case, the driving force is capillary interaction, which originates from the deformation of {{the surface of a}} liquid caused by the presence of floating or submerged particles.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} bases used in plastic scintillators are the {{aromatic}} plastics, polymers with aromatic rings as pendant groups along the polymer backbone, amongst which polyvinyltoluene (PVT) and polystyrene (PS) {{are the most}} prominent. While the base does fluoresce {{in the presence of}} ionizing radiation, its low yield and negligible transparency to its own emission make the use of fluors necessary in the construction of a practical scintillator. Aside from the aromatic plastics, the most common base is <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> (<b>PMMA),</b> which carries two advantages over many other bases: high ultraviolet and visible light transparency and mechanical properties and higher durability with respect to brittleness. The lack of fluorescence associated with PMMA is often compensated through the addition of an aromatic co-solvent, usually naphthalene. A plastic scintillator based on PMMA in this way boasts transparency to its own radiation, helping to ensure uniform collection of light.|$|E
