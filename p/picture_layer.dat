40|$|One of the {{techniques}} for making photographic negatives most used {{in the history of}} photography were gelatin glass plates. This technique was used not only in the artistic field but also and mainly in the scientific field. The main period when glass plate negatives were used in astronomy was between 1890 – 1980. There are over 7 million of these negatives all over the word and they carry valuable historical scientific data. However, during the long-term storage of this material, deterioration of the emulsion (<b>picture)</b> <b>layer</b> and/or the support (glass) layer has occurred. In this paper we report on our preliminary results from an analysis of the yellowing of the emulsion layer and of gold micro-spots.

40|$|The {{rate control}} {{problem has been}} {{extensively}} studied in parallel {{to the development of}} the different video coding standards. The bit allocation via Cauchy-density-based rate-distortion (R-D) modeling of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients has proved to be one of the most accurate solution at picture level. Nevertheless, in some specific applications operating in real-time low-delay environments, a basic unit (BU) layer is recommended in order to provide a good trade-off between picture quality and delay control. In this paper, a novel BU bit allocation for H. 264 /AVC is proposed based on a simplified Cauchy probability density function (PDF) source modeling. The experimental results are twofold: 1) the proposed rate control algorithm (RCA) achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0. 28 dB respect to a well known BU layer RCA, while maintaining a similar buffer occupancy evolution; and 2) It achieves to notably reduce the buffer occupancy fluctuations respect to a well known <b>picture</b> <b>layer</b> RCA, while maintaining similar quality levels.

30|$|The {{next-generation}} High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard {{reduces the}} bit rate by 44 % on average {{compared to the}} previous-generation H. 264 standard, resulting in higher encoding complexity. To achieve normal video coding in power-constrained devices and minimize the rate distortion degradation, this paper proposes a hierarchical complexity control algorithm for HEVC {{on the basis of}} the coding unit depth decision. First, according to the target complexity and the constantly updated reference time, the coding complexity of the group of <b>pictures</b> <b>layer</b> and the frame layer is allocated and controlled. Second, the maximal depth is adaptively assigned to the coding tree unit (CTU) {{on the basis of the}} correlation between the residual information and the optimal depth by establishing the complexity-depth model. Then, the coding unit smoothness decision and adaptive low bit threshold decision are proposed to constrain the unnecessary traversal process within the maximal depth assigned by the CTU. Finally, adaptive upper bit threshold decision is used to continue the necessary traversal process at a larger depth than the maximal depth of allocation to guarantee the quality of important coding units. Experimental results show that our algorithm can reduce the encoding time by up to 50 %, with notable control precision and limited performance degradation. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm can achieve higher control accuracy.|$|R

2500|$|The Metacomet Ridge was {{the product}} of several massive lava flows {{hundreds}} of feet deep that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia and Africa.

The resulting [...] "layer cake" [...] of basalt and sedimentary sheets eventually faulted and tilted upward.
