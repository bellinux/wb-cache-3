The game also puts focus on allowing the player to freely explore its detailed 3D environments, most notably a miniature representation of the United States.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We propose an {{approximation}} algorithm {{based on}} the Lagrangian or price-directive decomposition method to compute an¯-approximate solution of the mixed fractional <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> covering problem: findÜ�such that�Ü � ¯�,�Ü �  ¯�where�Ü��Üare vectors withÅnonnegative convex and concave functions,�and�areÅ- dimensional nonnegative vectors and�is a convex set that can be queried by an optimization or feasibility oracle. We propose an algorithm that needs onlyÇÅ ¯  ÐÒÅ ¯  iterations or calls to the oracle. The main contribution is that the algorithm solves the general mixed fractional <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> covering problem (in contrast to pure fractional <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> covering problems and to the special mixed <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> covering problem with��ÁÊÆ) and runs in time independent of the so-called width of the problem...|$|R

Stunt pilot Cliff Secord's Gee Bee racer is totaled during the accident; he and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a biplane cockpit. Movie star Neville Sinclair had hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket <b>pack,</b> <b>and</b> he sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow <b>pack</b> <b>and</b> the formation of ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers {{by one or more}} characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E

5|$|The British army {{encountered}} {{an extremely}} hostile population, prepared to resist {{to the degree}} that even women, children and slaves voluntarily participated in the defense. The headquarters of the Regiment of Patricians were located at the Real Colegio de San Carlos, where Saavedra and Juan José Viamonte stopped the column of Denis <b>Pack</b> <b>and</b> Henry Cadogan, composed of British infantry and a cannon. Pack united his remaining forces with Craufurd and resisted inside the Santo Domingo convent. Cadogan took the nearby house of Pedro Medrano, and fired from the rooftop. Both groups were finally defeated by the local soldiers. Finally, the British General John Whitelocke surrendered, ending the attack and pledging to withdraw all British forces from Montevideo.|$|E
5|$|The Kerry Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as <b>pack</b> <b>and</b> cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move on soft ground such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for hardiness and an ability to survive in harsh conditions.|$|E
