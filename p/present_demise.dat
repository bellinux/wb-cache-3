40|$|Based on {{twelve months}} of {{fieldwork}} from August 2001 [...] July 2002, the dissertation analyzes of the venture market in South Korea which, at the time, {{had undergone a}} significant depreciation of its national currency and instituted a series of market reforms, which included a novel experiment with an emergent financial organization {{in the form of}} venture capital market. This project is an anthropological inquiry into the events that followed. My ethnographic project analyzes the full arc of development and the <b>present</b> <b>demise</b> of venture industry in South Korea from 1997 [...] 2002 through two enduring points of reference: venture firm and venture capital firm. I place this development within the context of interaction between a new global financial form and articulation of Korea's social imaginary in its anxiety with celerity as an immanent expression of its modernity. In the end, I outline how venture industry fits into this narrative and give an overview of how the notion and practice of rapidity functioned in the making of the imaginaries and instantiation of venture not only as a market phenomena but as an immanent expression of the structure of rapidity itself as a cultural form. In doing so, I identify celerity as one of the central preoccupation of Korea's modernity. I frame my inquiry by placing the objective phenomenon of explosive growth and quick demise of venture market within the collective cultural idioms of hurriedness, or celerity. While taking into account of the local institutions and larger global reasons for failure of the venture market, I argue that, in Korea at least, two interacting logics were at work. First, instantiation of new financial technologies [...] -in their conception and implementation [...] -cannot be reduced to the logic of these technologies alone. In this case, the logic of the financial form was absorbed into a socio-structural logic, transforming both in the process. As such, celerity is seen as part of the mechanics {{of the structure of the}} market itself, and not only as an explanatory framework ex post to events. To open up that language of "mechanics" is to understand celerity as a cultural tempo, a structural component to the actual characteristic of the market. Second, drawing from the participant observation and interviews with venture participants themselves, as well as from my own cultural knowledge, I found that celerity has a thick social imaginary particular to the narrative of Korea's history and modernity. Or, put in another way, much of the discourse of venture market pointed to two spheres: the narrative of Korean history as an economic unfolding of troubled ascent into modernity, and the logic of what Koreans call pali-pali (hurry, hurry) syndrome, what I have chosen to call the problem of celerity. By this, I mean: the rush to and out of venture industry was seen as the manifestation of a long-standing historical problem of the uncertain status of Korea's modernity resolved through an intense but episodic engagement with signaling practices, practices that briefly absorb the attention of many in the middle and elite classes in Korea. This is the social and cultural manifestation of rapidity as a cultural phenomena that partakes polythetically in the language of speed but, at the same time, expresses the particular history of Korea in its engagement with modernity...|$|E

She also described devastation when Hawking announced by letter he was leaving her for his second wife, Elaine Mason. He ended up married to Mason for 10 years before that fell apart and then he and Jane mended fences. Which, as it happens, the movie fudges too.

He admits that the profession was manipulated by the [...] "class of 1929" [...] youth, but does not study the forces that shaped and directed their assaults. Not a word on Stalin's personal influence, not a word on rising terror. Khan-Magovedov discusses the 1929–1931 political assaults by VOPRA at length, but fails to mention that {{they were part of}} an all-out national campaign. As Khmelnitsky summarized it, [...] "Postconstructivism was born by terror. The very term is misleading. Traces of the Constructivist style in the Postconstructivism of the 1930s are a sign of indecision, not tradition. They banned constructivism, but didn't explain what to do; the result is an architectural pathology. Comparison with European parallels is useless.

Still in that wondering breath, the news shocks us with inhumane scenes of murder, torts and betrayal. From the north blows the evil wind of Boko Haram and the attractive package of Islamic banking. Still, another wind blows from Azikiwe’s grave, whispering “ONE NIGERIA”, amidst our eluding democracy. Within the gamut of the law, {{some have argued that}} human right and democracy are foreign to Islam. Some have maintained that democracy and human right, Ise’allah, is the sit of Islam. Surprisingly some have opined that until Nigeria becomes an Islamic state or embrace the tenets of Islam, only then will true democracy be achieved. The gist is that the Constitution forbids any state religion but recognizes Christianity and Islam alike; the Constitution present a gateway for democracy- a gateway which has been argued to be against the structural background of the Islamic jurisprudence, hence the question of the supremacy and fairness of the constitution.

40|$|Between the Acts (1941), Virginia Woolf's {{response}} to Nazism, the 2 nd world war and patriarchy, {{is set at}} the very end of the period between de wars and largely written while Brittain suffered the Blitz. Her reaction to (the threat of) war is a daring formal experiment, her final attempt to incorporate life in art, facing the limits of representation. While the house and the pageant provide the text with both outer and inner frmaes, underlining continuity, stability of place, family and history, its actual form undermines and eventually deconstructs this whole façade. The imminence of war threatens to fracture and rip apart humanity, art and culture. In such circumstances, Woolf confronts the dislocation and demolition of language, the suffering of language. In Between the Acts both everyday language and literary language are permanently tormented by means of allusions, blank spaces, (mis) quotations, spoken and unspoken words, clichés repeated over and over again, predictable narrative situations revisited and parodied, the use of verse, drama and novelistic devices subverted in a deliberate process where the general syntax of the novel is taken to pieces, dismantling former conventions and readers' expectations. 'The gramophone gurgled Unity - Dispersity. It gurgled Un [...] . dis [...] . And ceased'. <b>Presenting</b> the <b>demise</b> of civilization through the decay of language, Woolf brings the war into her text, in a characteristically ambivalent lament for tradition and celebration of its collapse. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The ?death of God? {{remains a}} {{recognisable}} frame to approach Western cultural malaise captured in its nihilism. Removed from this spatio-temporal horizon, however, claims of fin de si?cle appear partial, provincial, and extraneous. For worlds ?outside? the West, {{the idea of}} the death of God is an absurdity, excessive and irrelevant. Viewed from relativist positionality, God?s <b>demise</b> <b>presents</b> as a strictly Western problem. On the other hand, nihilism is neither a culturally restricted state nor a unique property of Western self-annihilating proclivities. This paper explores the assumed ?Otherness? of Islam in its encounter with nihilism, especially in reference to the question of political violence. Distinction between life-affirming and life-negating impulses of political violence helps situate religiously coded violence and the nihilistic violence of modernity. In the case of Islamic violence, it is argued, this distinction is often blurred. The paper maps out the cosmological basis of Islamic alterity, one that is increasingly tested under conditions of globalising modernity and its pathologies. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|An extinct,> 5000 -km-long Jurassic {{carbonate}} platform and barrier eef system lies buried beneath the Atlantic continental shelf and {{slope of the}} United States. A revised stratigraphic framework, a series of regional isopach maps, and paleogeographic reconstructions are used to illustrate the 42 -m. y. history of this Bahama-Grand Banks gigaptatform from its inception in Aalenian(?) (early Middle Jurassic) time to its demise and burial in Berriasian-Valanginian time (earty Early Cretaceous). Aggradation-progradation rates for the gigaplahbrm are {{comparable to those of}} the familiar Capitan shelf margin (Permian), and are closely correlated with volumetric rates of siliciclastic sediment accumulation and depocenter migration. Siliciclastic encroachment behind the carbonate tracts appears to have been animportant impetus for shelf-edge progradation. During the Early Cretaceous, ea-level changes combined with eutrophication (due to landward soil development and seaward upwelling) and the presence of cooler upwelled waters along the outer shelf appear to have decimated the carbonate producers from the Carolina Trough to the Grand Banks. This allowed advancing siliciclastic deltas to overrun the shelf edge despite a notable reduction in siliciclastic accumulation rates. However, upwelling did not extend southward to the Blake-Bahama megabank, so platform carbonate production proceeded there well into the Cretaceous. Subsequent s epwise carbonate abatement charac-terized the Blake plateau Basin, whereas the Bahamas have maintained production to the <b>present.</b> The <b>demise</b> of carbonate production on the northern segments of the gigaplatform helped to escalate deep-water carbonate deposition in the Early Cretaceous, but the sudden augmentation f deep-water carbonate r servoirs in the Late Jurassic was triggered by other agents...|$|R

Fetal <b>demise</b> occurs {{as a consequence of the}} compression of the cord by the presenting part. We conducted this study to determine profile of pregnancy and its outcome at the Central Hospital Yaounde, Cameroon. This was an observational, descriptive and retrospective study of deliveries complicated by cord prolapse between January 2003 and December 2006 at the Central Maternity of the Central Hospital Yaounde. Data was retrieved from patient’s files, operation room registers and admission registers. During this period, there were a total of 6924 deliveries amongst which 47 were complicated by umbilical cord prolapse (2. 8 per 1000 deliveries). Among the women with cord prolapse, 62. 2 % were delivered by emergency caesarean section. Fetal demise was reported in 32 % of the women upon admission. An abnormal pelvis was seen in 25. 5 % of the women. Artificial rupture of membranes was carried out in 40. 4 %. This study shows that cord prolapse is associated with severe fetal consequences in our unit.

40|$|In {{the course}} of ongoing global warming, {{environmental}} changes in the Arctic realm are most dramatic worldwide, comprising the shrinking of sea ice, the retreat of ice sheets and glaciers, sea-level rise, and the migration of vegetation belts. All these processes have strong impacts on living conditions for both animals and human beings. A serious problem, which often is underrated {{in the context of}} Arctic climate change, is the enhanced warming and degradation of permanently frozen ground (permfrost), which occupies about a fourth of Earths land surface. In particular, permafrost is widespread in the northern-hemispheric polar and subpolar regions. The modification of permafrost affects the landscape in manifold ways, as it changes the extent of wetlands, deepens the active surficial thaw layer during summer, increases river runoff to the ocean, and destabilizes the Arctic coasts and unglaciated land surfaces. Though such changes pose inconvenience on infrastructure in regard to the stability of buildings, pipelines, railway tracks, and road constructions, these problems can be overcome by innovative technologies. An enduring and alarming side-effect of permafrost degradation, however, is the associated release of trace gases, contributing to the accelerated greenhouse warming of the atmosphere. With their widespread organic-rich soils and subbottom methane hydrates, the permafrost regions represent a huge carbon reservoir in a frozen state. At <b>present,</b> the incipient <b>demise</b> of permafrost leads to prolonged venting of methane and carbon dioxide through enhanced microbial metabolism in soils, strong coastal and fluvial erosion of carbon-bearing soils and sediments, and the thermal destabilization of frozen gas hydrates. The consequence of these processes for the climate system could be harsh but are not fully understood so far...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} California's Basque boardinghouses, or ostatuak, {{is the subject}} of this dissertation. To date, {{scholarly}} literature on ethnic boardinghouses is minimal and even less has been written on the Basque "hotels" of the American West. As a result, conclusions in this study rely upon interviews, census records, local directories, early maps, and newspapers. The first Basque boardinghouses in the United States appeared in California in the decade following the gold rush and tended to be outposts along travel routes used by Basque miners and sheepmen. As more Basques migrated to the United States, clusters of ostatuak sprang up in communities where Basque colonies had formed, particularly in Los Angeles and San Francisco during the late nineteenth century. In the years between 1890 and 1940, the ostatuak reached their zenith as Basques spread throughout the state and took their boardinghouses with them. This study outlines the earliest appearances of the Basque ostatuak, charts their expansion, and describes their <b>present</b> state of <b>demise.</b> The role of the ostatuak within Basque-American culture and a description of how they operated is another important aspect of this dissertation. Information from interviews supports the claim that the ostatua was the most important social institution among Americanuak during peak years of Basque immigration. Since a majority of the Basque sojourners who arrived before 1930 were unmarried, unable to speak English, and intended to return to the Old World within a decade of their arrival, the Basque-American often substituted his "hotel" contacts for his Old World family. At the ostatuak, he found a familiar language and cuisine, as well as an employment agency, a place to vacation, translating services, an occasional loan, explanations of his host culture, and new friends from old villages. This history of California's ostatuak is the first of its kind and encourages future research on Basque boardinghouses throughout the American West...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} development of child welfare in twentieth-century China, and interprets those developments {{within the context of}} China's long history. The first chapter traces government efforts to provide support for indigent or abandoned children from the Southern Song Dynasty in the 13 th century CE to the early Republican era in the 20 th century. The Song government provided grain and other forms of assistance to destitute families and encouraged the adoption of abandoned children. Such initiatives were abandoned {{after the collapse of the}} Song dynasty, and revived only in the early Qing dynasty. In the Qing, however, members of a newly formed merchant-gentry elite took the lead in providing relief for foundlings; the Qing state encouraged these works through the provision of supplementary monetary support and honorary plaques. Government relief efforts were intensified and broadened after the devastation accompanying the Taiping upheaval in the mid- 19 th century. Thereafter, reformers began to focus greater attention on education and life skills, a trend that intensified in the 1910 s and ` 20 s when government officials and private activists endeavored to turn poor and indigent children into healthy and productive modern citizens. 	Chapter 2 traces child relief efforts in Shanghai during the Republican period. Rapid urbanization and the growing disparity between rich and poor motivated Chinese officials, business leaders, education reformers as well as Western expatriates to organize relief efforts and vocational educational opportunities for dependent children. State-private collaboration continued in supporting homes for abandoned infants, poor and orphaned children, and street urchins. Private institutions dominated relief work throughout the period, but the Republican government became increasingly involved in coordinating and supervising relief efforts after establishing the Social Affairs Bureau in 1930. Police and public health officials worked together to improve neonatal services for the destitute, to discourage child abandonment and infanticide, and to place street urchins in homes and give them vocational training. 	Chapter 3 concentrates on the impact of the Sino-Japanese war from 1937 to 1945 on government and private child welfare programs. The sheer numbers of displaced persons and "warphans" compelled the state and civic leaders to organize and coordinate relief efforts on a far greater scale than ever before. Relief efforts were combined with educational services to train poor and destitute children in the hope of transforming them into useful and public-minded modern citizens. 	Chapter 4 analyzes the intensification of Republican-era trends in the Maoist period (1949 - 1976), as the state created a hierarchy of welfare management agencies permeating society down to the county level. The state coordinated all communications media and a series of mass campaigns with the goal of transforming parentless children and homeless youths into healthy, loyal, hard-working, and productive citizens. During the New Democracy period (1949 - 1953) some private agencies continued to function but under increasing government supervision and coordination. From 1956 onward all private institutions were closed or subsumed by state-run organizations. 	The concluding chapter 5 analyzes the evolution of child relief efforts in the Post-Mao era. The "closed" centrally coordinated system of child relief of previous decades has given way to an "open-ended" multifocal support structure during the course of the Reform Period (1978 - <b>present).</b> The <b>demise</b> of the guaranteed employment of the Maoist era, and the one-child policy, have resulted in a rapid increase in the number of abandoned children, and China's opening to the outside world has led to a broader definition of those deserving support, and given rise to an emphasis on local initiative and experimentation. Throughout the 1980 s, China's state-managed facilities continued to employ a regimen of caregiving and youth training that had become the nationwide standard by the early 1960 s. But Civil Affairs authorities as well as domestic and international civic organizations new to the scene have since broken from this mold, pursuing a multiplicity of approaches to target the various developmental deficiencies - physiological, mental, social, emotional, etc. - of their charges. In conjunction with the embrace of "multi-approachism," we can observe a paradigmatic shift within China's child welfare sector from institution-based rearing toward family-centered care. As China entered the 21 st century, a growing commitment among child relief practitioners to the notion that a family setting was best suited to foster the dependent child's development was reshaping the field of care in a significant way for the first time since the welfare system was established in the mid- 1950 s...|$|R
