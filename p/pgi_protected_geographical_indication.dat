40|$|Summary FREE AMINO ACIDS AND BIOGENIC AMINES IN A SICILIAN TYPICAL PRODUCT, “SALAME S. ANGELO” PGI Samples of salami S. Angelo <b>PGI</b> (<b>Protected</b> <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indication)</b> aged at 10, 30 and 45 {{days were}} {{analyzed}} {{to evaluate the}} contents of biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine, spermidine and spermine) and free amino acids. The total level of biogenic amines raised (P< 0. 05) during the seasoning to amount to 467. 80 mg/kg in salami at end maturing. The increase involved tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine, whereas a decrease was observed for spermidine and spermine. The amines recovered in higher concentrations in the salami at end seasoning were tyramine (273. 07 mg/kg), putrescine (99. 20 mg/kg) and spermine (67. 32 mg/kg). Histamine was not detected in all the analyzed samples. This indicate a high hygienic quality of meat used in manufacturing. The total content of free amino acids and the levels of essential amino acids, except for threonine, tyrosine and arginine, increased (P< 0. 05) in the period between 10 and 30 days of maturing to stabilize after 45 days.

The structures of giffonins T and U were determined as highly hydroxylated cyclic diarylheptanoids by 1 D and 2 D NMR experiments. Their relative configurations were assigned by a combined quantum mechanical/NMR approach, comparing the experimental (13) C/(1) H NMR chemical shift data and the related predicted values. The absolute configurations of carpinontriol B (1) and giffonins T and U (2 and 3) were assigned by comparison of their experimental electronic circular dichroism curves with the TDDFT-predicted curves. The ability of the compounds to inhibit the lipid peroxidation induced by H 2 O 2 and H 2 O 2 /Fe(2 +) was determined by measuring the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of the methanol extract of leafy covers of C.  avellana and of the isolated compounds against the Gram-positive strains Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-negative strains Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was evaluated.

40|$|Cultivars of the Fagioli di Sarconi are {{a pool of}} {{high value}} common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{traditional}} cultivars selected from various landraces. These cultivars are protected by the European Union (Reg. CEE n° 1263 / 96) with the mark <b>PGI</b> (<b>Protected</b> <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indication)</b> and are cultivated in Basilicata (southern Italy) {{for the production of}} dry seeds. Fagioli di Sarconi cultivars are susceptible to common bacterial blight (CBB), a disease caused by the varieties fuscans and non- fuscans of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli. Five Fagioli di Sarconi cultivars (Tondino bianco, Verdolino, Cannellino, Tabacchino and Ciuoto) were artificially inoculated with two virulent strains of this bacterium, representative of 59 recently characterized strains of both the fuscans and non- fuscans varieties, with the aim to evaluate the susceptibility of these cultivars to the pathogens. Four CBB–resistant breeding–lines were used for comparison. Suspensions of the bacterium were injected into the first trifoliate leaflets of bean plants and produced typical CBB symptoms on the Fagioli di Sarconi cultivars, and hypersensitive necrotic lesions on the CBB–resistant breeding–lines. When cultivars were inoculated with the strain of the variety fuscans, Tondino bianco, Verdolino and Cannellino were more susceptible than Tabacchino and Ciuoto, whereas when they were inoculated with the non– fuscans strains, Tondino bianco, Tabacchino and Verdolino were more susceptible than Ciuoto and Cannellino. The tolerant cultivars appeared good candidates for the introgression of CBB–resistance characters in a breeding programme. The varying response of the traditional Fagioli di Sarconi bean cultivars to artificial inoculation suggests that several plant and pathogen factors are involved in the interaction between X. a. pv. phaseoli varieties and the bean cultivars. </p...|$|E
40|$|Sweet {{cherries}} (Prunus avium L.) {{are very}} attractive fruits for their taste and color attributes, {{as well as}} for their abundance of nutrients. Emilia Romagna Region, in conjunction with Puglia, Campania and Veneto, {{is one of the most}} typical production areas, and the harvests from Vignola area, where many sweet cherry cultivars are grown, are well known and appreciated. Cherry is rich in phenolic compounds (Usenik et al. 2008), principally known for its antioxidant properties, particularly useful against free radicals and diseases derived from them. The main phenolic antioxidants found in cherries are anthocyanins. Anthocyanins, responsible for the color of the fruit and the pulp (Mylnikov et al. 2005), represent a wide class of molecules, belonging to the family of flavonoids, phenolic substances widely distributed in the plant kingdom. This class of molecules is well known for their health-promoting effects, in particular for their free radical scavenging ability, which helps preventing cancer, cardiovascular diseases and retarding the aging process. In the present study, we characterized the anthocyanin fraction of 9 sweet cherry cultivars, grown in an experimental field of Vignola (Emilia Romagna). To achieve our purpose, it was developed an extraction and purification method by SPE. The anthocyanin fraction extracted was then characterized by HPLC-MS. The identification was carried out by analysing the MS and MS 2 fragmentation pattern and by comparing our results with literature data. Eight molecules have been identified in all. The Moretta is distinguished from other cultivars for the high anthocyanin content. This study aims to enhance the cherry fruit quality, focusing on healthy compoundss, especially considering the recent achievement of the <b>PGI</b> (<b>Protected</b> <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indication)</b> designation of origin in 2012...|$|E

40|$|Agri-food {{districts and}} PDO (protected {{designation}} of origin), <b>PGI</b> (<b>protected</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>indication)</b> and TSG (traditional specialty guaranteed) products are peculiarities of the Italian {{social and economic}} system. In fact, industrial districts are an Italian typical form of industrialization, which has been deeply studied by Italian scholars (e. g. G. Becattini, F. Sforzi, F. Signorini, S. Brusco). Moreover, Italy, with 235 brand products (88 PGI, 145 PDO and 2 TSG), is the European leader in terms of certified productions (23 %), followed by France with 187 and Spain with 154 branded products. The linkage of these two Italian peculiarities brings to the agri-food districts reality. The growing number of analysis in this field (Qualivita 2011, Istat 2011) show the increasing interest in local quality products linked to the territory. Despite the recent economic crisis, those productions showed positive economic performances, with better results than low-quality food productions, especially {{with regards to the}} exportation (Edison foundation 2010, Ismea 2010, Istat 2011). The national Law 57 in 2001 instituted the "Quality Agri-food Districts". The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify of those important realities, using the specialization indexes of each district and the localization of geographical identified products. The first level of analysis identified only provinces that contain quality agri-food districts (QAD) with a share of employment greater than 10 % of the area of reference. The following step is to study the 55 quality agri-food districts identified by Tagliacarne Institute (2004), using the previous cited specialization indexes. Moreover the impact of the crisis is studied to stress the opportunities of development of this specific sector. The different strategies of reaction to these specific conditions are also investigated, in order to understand if the positive externalities that have been defined as 'the district effect' (Signorini 1994, Fabiani and Pellegrini 1998) still persist. The analysis show a link both the provincial and quality agri-food districts level. The results could lead to new economic policies aimed to the development of those important realities, which are typical of the Italian economic system...|$|E
40|$|Near {{infrared}} (NIR) {{is one of}} {{the techniques}} belonging to vibrational spectroscopy. Its radiation (750 to 2500 nm) interacts with organic matter, and the absorption spectrum is rich in chemical and physical information of organic molecules. In order to extract valuable information on the chemical properties of samples, it is necessary to mathematically process spectral data by chemometric tools. The most important part in the development of an NIR method is building the predicting model generally called calibration. NIR spectroscopy has several advantages over other analytical techniques: rapidity of analysis, no use of chemicals, minimal or no samples preparation, easily applicable in different work environments (on/in/at line applications). On the other hand, NIR spectroscopy has some disadvantages: low ability to predict compounds at low concentration (< 0. 1 %), necessity of accurate analysis as reference, development of calibration models required high trained personnel, need of a large and up-to-date calibration data set (often difficult to obtain), difficulties to transfer calibration among instruments, initial high financial investments. In the feed industry, NIR spectroscopy is used for: feed composition, digestibility (in vivo, in vitro, in situ), traceability assessment (to avoid possible frauds). As far as animal products are concerned, NIR spectroscopy has been used to determine the main composition of meat, milk, fish, cheese, eggs. Furthermore, it was also used to predict some physical properties (tenderness, WHC (Water Holding Capacity), drip loss, colour and pH in meat; coagulation ability in milk; freshness, flavour and other sensorial parameters in cheese). Interesting applications of NIR spectroscopy regard issues like: determination of animal products’ authenticity and the detection of adulteration (in order to prevent frauds), discrimination PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and <b>PGI</b> (<b>Protected</b> <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indication)</b> from other non traditional products, detect handling aspects (freezing, thawing or fresh). There is a growing interest in the evaluation of animal products’ quality directly on-line to have a continuous control of the production process. Furthermore, new portable instruments are becoming now available, which will allow to easily monitor some processes at the factory (i. e. ripening and ageing of sausages and cheeses) ...|$|E
