5|$|When Tecumseh's War broke out, Buffalo and {{a number}} of other young warriors from the La <b>Pointe</b> area {{abandoned}} the Midewiwin for a time to follow the teachings of the Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa. While en route to Prophetstown to join the attack on the Americans, they were stopped by Michel Cadotte, the respected Métis fur trader from La <b>Pointe.</b> Cadotte convinced Buffalo and the others that it would be fruitless to fight the Americans.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the troops}} {{went to the}} nearby village of Saint-Philippe, where they stayed {{overnight}} and received assistance from the townspeople. Captain Holland contacted C. W. Bennett, the British Consul at Saint-Denis, and they secured passage to Mauritius on the SS Lalpoora, located at <b>Pointe</b> des Galets. After brief stops in Saint-Joseph and St. Pierre, the troops were transported to <b>Pointe</b> des Galets by train. The Lalpoora left Réunion on the mid-afternoon of 17 January, and they arrived in Mauritius early the next morning. The officers of Warren Hastings were praised for the discipline and bravery of the troops involved in the evacuation; however, Captain Holland had to face a court martial for losing the ship; he was reprimanded and subsequently acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the terms}} were agreed to, Buffalo marked and was {{recorded}} as Pe-zhe-ke, {{head of the}} La <b>Pointe</b> delegation. Although Buffalo and the other Lake Superior chiefs signed, they {{were said to be}} relatively silent compared with the Mississippi Chippewa chiefs during the negotiations. Historian Satz says this symbolized disagreement rather than acceptance of the terms of the treaty. Lyman Warren, a trader and interpreter from La <b>Pointe,</b> later complained that the Pillagers (bands from present-day Minnesota) had been bribed into selling the lands rightfully belonging to the Wisconsin bands.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{conflict}} {{as to the}} identity of Buffalo's father, who {{may also have been}} named Andaigweos. He {{appears to have been a}} descendant or relative of the famous war chief Waubojeeg. When he was about 10, Buffalo and his parents moved from La <b>Pointe</b> to the vicinity of what now is Buffalo, New York, and lived there until about he was about 12. The family relocated to the Mackinac Island area for a while before returning to La <b>Pointe.</b> In his youth, Kechewaishke was admired as a skilled hunter and athlete.|$|E
5|$|The 116th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division was to land two battalions in {{the western}} four beaches, to be {{followed}} 30 minutes later by the third battalion. Their landings were to be supported by the tanks of the 743rd Tank Battalion; two companies swimming ashore in amphibious DD tanks and the remaining company landing directly onto the beach from assault craft. To {{the left of the}} 116th RCT the 16th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division was also to land two battalions with the third following 30 minutes after, on Easy Red and Fox Green at the eastern end of Omaha. Their tank support was to be provided by the 741st Tank Battalion, again two companies swimming ashore and the third landed conventionally. Three companies of the 2nd Ranger Battalion were to take a fortified battery at <b>Pointe</b> du Hoc, five kilometers (3mi) to the west of Omaha. Meanwhile, C Company 2nd Rangers was to land on the right of the 116th RCT and take the positions at <b>Pointe</b> de la Percée. The remaining companies of 2nd Rangers and the 5th Ranger Battalion were to follow up at <b>Pointe</b> du Hoc if that action proved to be successful, otherwise they were to follow the 116th into Dog Green and proceed to <b>Pointe</b> du Hoc overland.|$|E
5|$|M-102 {{was first}} {{designated}} along 8Mile Road from US10 (Woodward Avenue, now M-1) to US25 (Gratiot Avenue, now M-3) in late 1928 or early 1929. In 1939, the eastern terminus was moved as M-102 was extended along 8Mile and Vernier Roads {{to end in}} Grosse <b>Pointe</b> Shores at M-29 (Jefferson Avenue). The highway was extended in the early 1940s from Woodward westward to US16 (Grand River Avenue, now M-5).|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, the {{untested}} 29th Infantry Division, {{along with}} nine companies of U.S. Army Rangers redirected from <b>Pointe</b> du Hoc, were to assault the western {{half of the}} beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, consisting of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{treaties}} were signed, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, acting {{in his capacity}} as US Indian agent, visited La <b>Pointe.</b> He reprimanded Buffalo for not stopping the continuing sporadic warfare between the Ojibwa and Dakota. Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Lac du Flambeau or other bands beyond La <b>Pointe</b> from going against the Dakota. Historians take this to mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could not control the day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, particularly about warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not done enough to help maintain the peace among the tribes.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the new Skyway Monte Bianco cable car on the Italian side of the massif {{is expected to increase}} visitor numbers to Courmayeur from 100,000 to 300,000 per annum, following complete replacement of an earlier cable car system in 2015. It takes tourists from La Palud up to the Torino Hut at its top on <b>Pointe</b> Helbronner.|$|E
5|$|The {{delegation}} traveled back to Wisconsin by rail, {{spreading the}} good news to the various Ojibwa bands as they went. Buffalo also announced that all the tribal representatives should gather at La <b>Pointe</b> for payments the next summer (1853), and he would reveal {{the specifics of the}} agreement.|$|E
5|$|To {{force the}} Ojibwa to comply, the {{subagent}} Watrous {{announced he would}} pay future annuities only at Sandy Lake, Minnesota instead of La <b>Pointe,</b> {{where they had been}} paid previously. This change resulted in the Sandy Lake Tragedy, when hundreds of Ojibwas starved or died of exposure in Minnesota and on the journey home because the promised annuity supplies were late, contaminated or inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Assault groups O1 to O3, {{tasked with}} landing {{the main body}} of the assault, were {{organised}} along similar lines, with each comprising three infantry transports, and varying numbers of tank landing ships (LST), Landing Craft Control (LCC), Landing Craft Infantry (LCI(L)), Landing Craft Tank (LCT), and Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM). Assault Group O4, tasked with landing the Rangers and the Special Engineer Task Force at <b>Pointe</b> du Hoc and Dog Green, comprising only six smaller infantry transports.|$|E
5|$|At Omaha Beach, {{parts of}} the Mulberry harbour are still visible, {{and a few of}} the beach {{obstacles}} remain. A memorial to the American National Guard sits at the location of a former German strongpoint. <b>Pointe</b> du Hoc is little changed from 1944, with the terrain covered with bomb craters and most of the concrete bunkers still in place. The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is nearby, in Colleville-sur-Mer. A museum about the Utah landings is located at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, and there is one dedicated to the activities of the American airmen at Sainte-Mère-Église. Two German military cemeteries are located nearby.|$|E
5|$|Back in La <b>Pointe,</b> Buffalo {{took several}} actions to {{forestall}} and prevent removal. He {{and other leaders}} petitioned the US government {{for the next two}} years to no avail. They did win considerable sympathy from whites who learned of the debacle in Sandy Lake. Newspapers throughout the Lake Superior region ran editorials condemning the removal effort. Buffalo sent two of his sons to St. Paul, the state capital, where they obtained a portion of the annuities still owed.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{inherited}} {{not only}} the status afforded his family, but also had skills praised in his grandfather Andaigweos. Noted for his abilities in hunting and battle, Buffalo was recognized as chief by his people because of his speaking and oratorical skills, which were highly valued in his culture. By the time the Ojibwa of Wisconsin and Minnesota started treaty negotiations with the US Government, Buffalo was {{recognized as one of}} the primary spokesmen for all the bands, not just for the Ojibwa from La <b>Pointe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Downtown had short skyscraper-building booms {{beginning}} in the 1970s. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The <b>Pointe</b> of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Saint Paul is {{the location of the}} Hmong Archives.|$|E
5|$|Ferrell {{was married}} to Ruth Virginia Wilson from 1941 until her death in 1968. Together they had four children, two sons and two daughters. His family first lived in Greensboro, then later in Grosse <b>Pointe,</b> Michigan. He lived in Troy, Michigan for the {{remaining}} 18 years of his life, until he was admitted into a nursing home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. It was here that he died of arrhythmia on July 27, 1995, and is interred at New Garden Cemetery in Greensboro, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Buffalo was {{presented}} with the Treaty of La <b>Pointe</b> covering his lands. Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs Henry Stuart, who was promoting development of the Lake Superior copper industry, led the negotiations for the US government. No record of the negotiations was made. But materials written by missionaries, traders, and the Ojibwa through their agent indicated that Stuart used bullying and outright deception to force the Ojibwa to accept the terms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} decades, there was {{pressure}} from Americans {{who wanted to}} exploit the mineral and timber resources of Ojibwa country, and the US government sought to acquire control of the territory through treaties. The Treaties of 1837 and 1842 covered La <b>Pointe</b> and territories held by other bands over which Buffalo held considerable influence. In both treaties, Americans recognized Buffalo's position as the principal chief of all the Lake Superior Chippewa.|$|E
5|$|Mackinac Island {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of terrain, including fields, marshes, bogs, coastline, boreal forest, and limestone formations. The environment is legally preserved on the island by the State Historic Park designation. About half of the shoreline and adjacent waters off Mackinac Island, including the harbor (Haldimand Bay) and the southern and western shore from Mission Point to <b>Pointe</b> aux Pins, is protected as part of the Straits of Mackinac Shipwreck Preserve, a state marine park.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, {{just hours}} before Sullivan's arrival, Thompson sent 600 troops {{under the command of}} Colonel Arthur St. Clair toward Trois-Rivières with the goal of {{surprising}} and beating back the small British force believed to be there. Sullivan, on his arrival at Sorel, immediately dispatched Thompson with an additional 1,600 men to follow. These forces caught up with St. Clair at Nicolet, where defenses against troop movements on the river were erected the next day. On the night of June 7, Thompson, St. Clair, and about 2,000 men crossed the river, landing at <b>Pointe</b> du Lac, a few miles above Trois-Rivières.|$|E
5|$|On September 25, 2016, Fernández {{was killed}} in a boating {{accident}} off Miami Beach, Florida. The U.S. Coast Guard found the boat, Kaught Looking, at about 3:00a.m., overturned on a jetty near Government Cut and South <b>Pointe</b> Park, and found Fernandez and two other men, Eduardo Rivero and Emilio Jesus Macias, dead. A Florida Wildlife Commission official initially confirmed that Fernández had died from the impact of the crash. The commission received a toxicology report from the medical examiner of Miami-Dade County, but opted not to release the results.|$|E

5|$|The {{beaches of}} Normandy are still known by their {{invasion}} code names. Significant places have plaques, memorials, or small museums, and guide books and maps are available. Some of the German strong points remain preserved; <b>Pointe</b> du Hoc {{in particular is}} little changed from 1944. The remains of Mulberry harbour B still sits in the sea at Arromanches. Several large cemeteries in the area serve as the final resting place {{for many of the}} Allied and German soldiers killed in the Normandy campaign.|$|E
5|$|To {{celebrate}} the event, TNA arranged travel packages and organized festivities {{to take place}} the weekend prior to the show. On October 13, 2012, the Bound for Glory VIP Weekend hosted {{events such as the}} Inaugural Hall of Fame Induction Celebration for Sting that was held at the <b>Pointe</b> Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort, and on that same day, the annual Bound for Glory Fan InterAction gave fans a chance to get close with their favorite stars for conversations, autographs, and photographs.|$|E
5|$|A year later, the US and Ojibwe {{signed the}} Treaty of Fond du Lac {{at a meeting}} at the western edge of Lake Superior. The signatories were listed by band, and Buffalo, {{recorded}} as Peezhickee, signed as the first chief from La <b>Pointe.</b> The treaty, mainly dealing with mineral rights for Ojibwa lands in what is now Michigan, had little immediate effect but foreshadowed future treaties. Buffalo did not speak on the copper issue. He praised the US officials for their ability to keep their young people under their control; he asked for whiskey to accomplish the same ends among the younger members of his band. When the agent presented him with a silver medal as a symbol of his chieftainship, Buffalo said that his power was based in his clan and reputation, and not from anything received from the U.S. Government.|$|E
5|$|After spring thaw in 1852, {{the elderly}} Buffalo, Oshaga, Armstrong, and four others {{set out from}} La <b>Pointe</b> for Washington, D.C. by birch bark canoe. Along the way, they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, {{securing}} hundreds of signatures in support of their cause. At Sault Ste. Marie, they were held by the US Indian agent, who told them that no unauthorized Ojibwa delegations could go to Washington {{and they had to}} turn back. The men pleaded the urgency of their case and traveled to Detroit by steamship. There another Indian agent tried to stop them. Once allowed to proceed, they sailed through Lake Erie to Buffalo, New York and then on to Albany and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in <b>Pointe</b> Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|An hour later, having {{endured the}} fire of the guns on both shores, Aigle was in a {{position}} to attack the rear-most frigate of the pair as they emerged from the western side of the island. This frigate sought the shelter of Groix' batteries, so Aigle set off in pursuit of the other which was now making for Lorient. As it was now dark, Aigle displayed a blue light to indicate her position to the closing Impétueux, and at 21:00, coming within 50 yards, exchanged fire with the Frenchman. To prevent a boarding, which Wolfe was determined upon, the frigate came about and, shortly after the British had broken off their attack for lack of sea room, ran aground on the <b>Pointe</b> de Chats on the eastern edge of Groix.|$|E
5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La <b>Pointe</b> in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong with taking care of the details in the written version.|$|E
5|$|Brad Pitt is an American {{actor and}} film producer, whose acting career began in 1987 with uncredited {{roles in the}} films No Way Out and Less Than Zero. He {{subsequently}} appeared in episodes for television shows during the late 1980s, and played his first {{major role in the}} slasher film Cutting Class (1989). He gained recognition in Thelma & Louise (1991) and A River Runs Through It (1992).

5|$|Herm is only 1½miles long (north-south) {{and less}} than half a mile wide (east-west). In the {{northern}} part of the island are two hills, Le Petit Monceau and Le Grande Monceau. To the north of these is a common, leading to Mouisonniere Beach on the northern coast, with Oyster Point in the northwestern corner and La <b>Pointe</b> du Gentilhomme or Alderney Point at the northeastern corner. To the east of the common is Shell Beach and to the west is The Bear's Beach, leading down to the harbour. Half of the coastline of {{the northern part of the}} island is surrounded by sandy beaches; the southern half is rocky. Much of Herm's bedrock is granite. In 2008, Adrian Heyworth, who was at the time the island's tenant, said that two or three metres of sand were being lost annually at Alderney Point.|$|E
