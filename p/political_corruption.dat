5|$|The <b>political</b> <b>corruption</b> {{which had}} grown {{considerably}} during Brezhnev's tenure {{had become a}} major problem to the Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s. In response, Andropov initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign. Andropov believed that the Soviet economy could possibly recover if the government were able to increase social discipline amongst workers. Brezhnev was seen as very vain and self-obsessed, but was praised for leading the Soviet Union into an unprecedented age of stability and domestic calm.|$|E

5|$|His {{first major}} work, the poem London, {{contains}} {{an early version}} of Johnson's ethics and morality system. Within the poem, he combined attacks on the politics of Walpole and the British government with the immoral actions of the common Londoner to form a general satire of 18th-century London society. Johnson compares London to the Roman Empire in its decline and blames moral and <b>political</b> <b>corruption</b> for its fall. Although Johnson did not start his literary criticism career until later, London is an example of what Johnson thought poetry should be: it is youthful and joyous, but it also relies on simple language and easy to understand imagery.|$|E

40|$|Do {{perceptions}} of <b>political</b> party <b>corruption</b> {{play a significant}} role in vote choice? More specifically, is intention to vote for a specific party influenced by {{perceptions of}} corruption of that party, as well as by perceptions of the degree of corruption of competing parties? To determine whether perceptions of <b>political</b> party <b>corruption</b> matter at all for voters’ preferences, we propose a party choice model in which we estimate the influence of perceptions of corruption of each party, net of other variables, on vote intention. We focus on Poland, and use data from the Polish Panel survey, POLPAN, 1988 – 2008. Our analyses indicate that perceptions of <b>political</b> party <b>corruption</b> have an effect on the decision to participate in elections, on intention to vote for a particular party and on vote choice regardless of which party is chosen. Assessments of party malfeasance matter even when other determinants of the vote are considered...|$|R

After {{witnessing}} <b>political</b> <b>corruption</b> and voter fraud in their own ward and around the city, they became disillusioned with the party organization in the city and joined the reform effort led by Joseph S.

In 1949, Sawyer served as a Democratic committeeman and Clark and Dilworth won city offices that year.|$|E

5|$|Although a Junimist for a {{large part}} of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a {{precursor}} in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade in the Conservative Party's main journal, Epoca. One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher Marius Chicoş Rostogan, shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories. Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade Rădulescu, Ion Câmpineanu, and Nicolae Bălcescu, and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu—he identified the latter grouping with hypocrisy, demagogy, and <b>political</b> <b>corruption,</b> while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.|$|E
