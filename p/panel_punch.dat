25|$|A {{knockout}} punch, {{also known}} as a chassis punch, <b>panel</b> <b>punch,</b> Greenlee punch, or a Q-max, is a hand tool used to punch a hole through sheet metal. It is a very simple tool that consists of a punch, die, and screw. There are three different drive systems: manual, ratchet, and hydraulic.|$|E

50|$|In 1949, Remington Rand {{designed}} the Remington Rand 409, a control <b>panel</b> programmed <b>punched</b> card calculator (but not introduced {{as a product}} until 1952 as the UNIVAC 60 then in 1953 as the UNIVAC 120 with double the memory).|$|R
50|$|The Remington Rand 409 control <b>panel</b> {{programmed}} <b>punched</b> card calculator, {{designed in}} 1949, {{was sold in}} two models: the UNIVAC 60 (1952) and the UNIVAC 120 (1953). The model number referred {{to the number of}} decimal digits it could read from each punched card.|$|R
5000|$|Horizontal cabling wiring can be IW (inside wiring) or plenum cabling and connects {{telecommunications}} {{rooms to}} individual outlets or work {{areas on the}} floor, usually through the wireways, conduits or ceiling spaces of each floor. A horizontal cross-connect is where the horizontal cabling connects to a patch <b>panel</b> or <b>punch</b> up block, which is connected by backbone cabling to the main distribution facility.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the modern}} era, {{in some areas}} of the Alps, a goat or sheep's horn would be {{sharpened}} and a tin <b>panel</b> would be <b>punched</b> out using the alphabet and numbers from one to nine. This learning tool was known appropriately as [...] "the horn". Modern reproductions are decorated with such motifs as hearts and tulips.|$|R
50|$|Dalsin {{specializes in}} {{precision}} sheet metal contract manufacturing. They most often create products for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), companies which produce consumer products, which the OEM doesn't {{have the capacity}} or capability to produce. They help design and produce these products in both of their production facilities. The most important tools they use are robotic welding, <b>panel</b> bending, turret <b>punching,</b> laser cutting, and press brake forming..|$|R
5000|$|It {{consists}} of a 36-story tower and 13-story annex. It {{is one of the}} towers in a complex of five structures, anchored by two towers. The facades are constructed of unpolished rose-granite <b>panels</b> with <b>punched</b> aluminum framed and fixed in-place window openings. Windows are a take on tripartite windows but whose lunettes, or arched portions, are fake. A portion of both towers {{consists of}} an aluminum framed curtain wall system with a combination of reflective vision glass and spandrel glass. Elaborate classical lighting fixtures are located on exterior. [...] The building's crown {{consists of a}}n octagonal-based pyramid surrounded by a ring rising out of the tower and partially up the pyramid. This crown is illuminated at night.|$|R

It is reviewed their possible {{production and the}} selected method of Guérin is described. Sheet metal from austenitic stainless 17 240 is selected for the manufacturing. Forming tool is designed with interchangeable punches and elastic medium for various modifications and comparing shapes of punches. It is used hydraulic press CZR 600 for a experimental production...|$|R
40|$|Flat {{plates are}} favor {{structure}} systems usually used in parking garages and high-rise buildings {{due to its}} simplicity for construction. However, flat plates have some inherent structural problems, due to high shear stress surrounding the supporting columns which cause a catastrophic brittle type of failure called "Punching Shear Failure". Several solutions are used to avoid punching shear failure, {{including the use of}} drop <b>panels</b> or <b>punching</b> shear reinforcement. The latter is being a more sophisticated solution from the structural ductility, the architectural and the economical point of view. This study aims at investigating the effect of stirrups as shear reinforcement in enhancing the punching strength of interior slab-column connections. A total of four full-scale interior slab-column connections were tested up to failure. All slabs had a side length of 1700 mm and 160 mm thickness with 200 mm x 200 mm square column. The test parameters were the presence of shear reinforcement and stirrups concentration around the supporting column. The test results showed that the distribution of stirrups over the critical punching shear zone was an efficient solution to enhance not only the punching shear capacity but also the ductility of the connection. Furthermore, the concentrating of stirrups shear reinforcement {{in the vicinity of the}} column for the tested slabs increases the punching shear capacity by 13 % compared to the uniform distribution at same amount of shear reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|Replacement of {{concrete}} bridge decks {{can be an}} expensive process. In order to decrease costs and time of construction, precast deck panels {{can be used with}} closure strips cast in place between the panels. In order to ensure that these connections can withstand the rigors of a bridge’s life cycle, fatigue testing was completed on a specimen consisting of two precast concrete panels reinforced with GFRP and connected using a UHPC closure strip. These panels were subjected to 2, 000, 000 cycles of fatigue loading at three locations and subject to static failure loading at one location following fatigue loads. It was found that under fatigue loading the panels were able to maintain structural integrity while deflection values increased linearly following the initial cracking phase. At ultimate load, the <b>panel</b> failed in <b>punching</b> shear at levels less than those specified by bridge code. This is primarily due to the failure location adjacent to the closure strip failing on three punching shear planes and one plane along the interface between the UHPC...|$|R
40|$|In impact {{resistance}} of reinforced concrete (RC) panels against projectiles {{the contribution of}} the orthogonal mesh reinforcement has been ignored. In this study the contribution of mesh reinforcement to {{impact resistance}} and itseffect on the nature of local damage caused by impact of non-deformable projectiles are investigated. The investigation included a combination of 53 experiments and series of finite-element based numerical simulations. Three levels of local damage modes were investegated based on the severity of the degree of damage in the impacted panels. Mesh reinforcement ratio within the range of reinforcement ratio considered, namely 0. 19 % to 0. 48 %, was irrelevant to the impact behavior of RC panels under different impact velocities, while bar spacing was to be a controlling parameter for the degree of damage. RC panels reinforced with bar spacing greater than 1. 5 times the panel thickness have a tendency to spall concrete from the back face more than RC panels with closely spaced bars. RC panels reinforced with bar spacing greater than 1. 5 time the <b>panel</b> thickness formed <b>punching</b> shear crater, while panels reinforced with less than that limit distributed the damage over a wider area without forming the punching shear crater on the back face. Orthogonal mesh reinforcement with bars spaced no wider than one-third of the projectile diameter were able to prevent the projectiles from perforating the panels. Offseting the reinforcing meshes did not improve the impact resistance of RC panels. An equation was developed to estimate the perforation resistance of an RC panel under impact of non- deformable projectile with given mass, diameter, and impact velocity. ...|$|R
