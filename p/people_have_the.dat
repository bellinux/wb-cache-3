5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. <b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|Tsubasa {{explores the}} {{fragility}} of human relationships through Sakura losing all of her memories involving her love interest, Syaoran. Despite this tragedy, Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey. Furthermore, Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who {{at the same time}} starts falling for her again. The development of the characters' relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one, a severed one can be reformed if <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> will. At the same time, Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he met as a result of having to continue travelling. Despite also losing these new founds friends, these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E

The 5 year survival rate was higher for incidental than for symptomatic tumours: 85.3% versus 62.5%. Incidental lesions were significantly lower stage than those that cause symptoms, since 62.1% patients with incidental renal cell carcinoma were observed with Stage I lesions, against 23% were found with symptomatic renal cell carcinoma.|$|E

25|$|The {{three main}} styles of breaststroke seen today are the {{conventional}} (flat), undulating, and wave-style. The undulating style is usually swum by extremely flexible swimmers, (e.g. Amanda Beard), and few <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> flexibility to accomplish it. The wave-style breaststroke was pioneered by Hungarian Swimming Coach Joseph Nagy. The breaststroke style was swum and {{made famous by}} Mike Barrowman when he set a world record using it, is now commonly swum by Olympians, though Australian swimmers, most prominently Leisel Jones, generally seem to shun it. Olympian Ed Moses still swims a more flat- style, despite the rapidly increasing popularity of the wave-style.|$|E

The defense argued that this right was not affected {{by the fact that the}} material does not have any literary or artistic merit, and that since the federal obscenity laws imposed a complete ban on materials which <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to possess, they were unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|Many {{authors and}} {{scholars}} addressed this issue. Malcolm Gladwell discuses the “Law of the Few” in his book, The Tipping Point.

This handful of unique people can spread the word around and create a social epidemic through their connections, charm, personality, expertise and persuasiveness. The notion that {{a small group of}} people can influence others and cause them to adopt products, services or behaviors was the subject of another book, The Influentials by Edward Keller and Jonathan Berry. This minority comprises a wide range of people who act as experts in their field and their opinions are highly regarded by their peers.|$|E
25|$|Following the Brundtland Commission's report, one of {{the first}} {{initiatives}} to bring scientific principles to the assessment of sustainability was by Swedish cancer scientist Karl-Henrik Robèrt. Robèrt coordinated a consensus process to define and operationalize sustainability. At the core of the process lies a consensus on what Robèrt came to call the natural step framework. The framework is based on a definition of sustainability, described as the system conditions of sustainability (as derived from System theory). In the natural step framework, a sustainable society does not systematically increase concentrations of substances extracted from the Earth's crust, or substances produced by society; that does not degrade the environment and in which <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capacity to meet their needs worldwide.|$|E
