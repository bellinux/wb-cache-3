Malta {{is also a member}} of the <b>Partnership</b> <b>for</b> <b>Peace</b> and the European Union. However, each country has a long-standing policy of neutrality. Cyprus is the only Member state of the European Union that is not a member of the <b>Partnership</b> <b>for</b> <b>Peace,</b> with any treaty blocked by Turkey's {{concerns}} regarding the Cyprus dispute. According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with NATO is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E

5|$|Belarus has not {{expressed}} a desire to join NATO but has participated in the Individual Partnership Program since 1997, and Belarus provides refueling and airspace support for the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.

Participating in the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo, it received aid from NATO in dealing with refugees fleeing from Kosovo. In August 2001, NATO intervened in the 2001 insurgency, during which a rebel Albanian group, the National Liberation Army, fought government forces. In Operation Essential Harvest, NATO troops joined with the Macedonian military to disarm rebel forces following a cease-fire agreement.|$|E
5|$|Moldova's {{constitution}} forbids {{the country}} from joining a military alliance, but some politicians, such as Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO {{as part of a}} larger European integration. Moldova joined NATO's <b>Partnership</b> <b>for</b> <b>Peace</b> in 1994, and initiated an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2010. Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway Moldovan region. This separatist issue could preclude Moldova from joining NATO.|$|E
40|$|Literature on {{partnerships}} {{has grown}} {{rapidly in the}} past decade across different disciplines. However, despite conceptual attention to the value of strategic multi-stakeholder collaboration to promote peace and reconciliation, challenges posed by (post-) conflict, fragile contexts have barely been considered in empirical studies. In this article we contribute by bringing together debates from different partnership literatures and providing an overview of existing, relatively limited research insights on <b>partnerships</b> <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> in fragile states. We present a typology of different levels (local, national, international) at which collaboration takes place and different types of partnerships (philanthropic, transactional, engagement, transformative). This is exemplified with specific attention to Africa, where most fragile states are found, and to partnerships with transformative potential. The analysis suggests that the lowest-level (local) partnerships tend to exclude the national government, while the most recent international, multilateral-driven collaboration has not included business; national cases are most transformative but incidental and not yet leveraged internationally. Despite the interconnected nature of conflict and fragility issues, linkages between partnerships and partners at different levels are largely missing, offering potential for further development by a broad spectrum of scholars and thought leaders. Insights from ‘extreme’ unconventional contexts thus have relevance for management research more generally...|$|R

5|$|<b>Partnership</b> <b>for</b> <b>Peace</b> (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the former Myanmar President Thein Sein’s efforts to {{counterbalance}} Beijing’s sway over Yangon and the EU’s attempts to identify a role for itself in the region. It aims to discuss the assumption that, by sponsoring the 2016 Special <b>Partnership</b> <b>for</b> Democracy, <b>Peace</b> and Prosperity with Myanmar, the EU was seeking to promote its role in Southeast Asia. It focuses on a few developments that contribute towards enhancing the EU’s involvement in cooperating with Myanmar. It examines how the former Myanmar President entertained diplomatic relations, in 2013, with the European capitals and the EU, and questions whether President Sein was possibly making efforts to free the country from subjection to other powers, specifically China. It discusses how Yangon’s slight distancing of itself from Beijing, combined with Sein’s opening up towards Europe, played the effect of boosting political activity regarding Myanmar at the EU level. It explores the EU’s policies on Myanmar and whether these attempt to respond to Sein’s search for assistance. It, lastly, assesses the article’s assumption.
