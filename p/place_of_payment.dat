6000|$|In {{reply to}} your inquiry; {{requesting}} our written opinion {{as to what}} your duty requires you to do in executing the latter clause of the Seventh Section of [...] "An Act {{in relation to the}} payment of the principal and interest of the State debt," [...] approved Feb'y 22, 1859, we reply that said last clause of said section is certainly indefinite, general, and ambiguous in its description of the bonds to be issued by you; giving no time at which the bonds are to be made payable, no place at which either principal or interest are to be paid, and no rate of interest which the bonds are to bear; nor any other description except that they are to be coupon bonds, which in commercial usage means interest-paying bonds with obligations or orders attached to them for the payment of annual or semiannual interest; there is we suppose no difficulty in ascertaining, if this act stood alone, what ought to be the construction of the terms [...] "coupon bonds" [...] and that it, would mean bonds bearing interest from the time of issuing the same. And under this act considered by itself the creditors would have a right to require such bonds. But your inquiry in regard to a class of bonds on which no interest is to be paid or shall begin to run until January 1, 1860, is whether the Act of February 18, 1857, would not authorize you to refuse to give bonds with any coupons attached payable before the first day of July, 1860. We have very maturely considered this question and have arrived at the conclusion that {{you have a right to}} use such measures as will secure the State against the loss of six months' interest on these bonds by the indefiniteness of the Act of 1859. While it cannot be denied that the letter of the laws favor the construction claimed by some of the creditors that interest-bearing bonds were required to be issued to them, inasmuch as the restriction that no interest is to run on said bonds until 1st January, 1860, relates solely to the bonds issued under the Act of 1857. And the Act of 1859 directing you to issue new bonds does not contain this restriction, but directs you to issue coupon bonds. Nevertheless the very indefiniteness and generality of the Act of 1859, giving no rate of interest, no time due, no <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> no postponement of the time when interest commences, necessarily implies that the Legislature intended to invest you with a discretion to impose such terms and restrictions as would protect the interest of the State; and we think you have a right and that it is your duty to see that the State Bonds are so issued that the State shall not lose six months' interest. Two plans present themselves either of which will secure the State. 1st. If in literal compliance with the law you issue bonds bearing interest from 1st July, 1859, you may deduct from the bonds presented three thousand from every $100,000 of bonds and issue $97,000 of coupon bonds; by this plan $3000 out of $100,000 of principal would be extinguished in consideration of paying $2910 interest on the first of January, 1860--and the interest on the $3000 would forever cease; this would be no doubt most advantageous to the State. But if the Auditor will not consent to this, then, 2nd. Cut off of each bond all the coupons payable before 1st July, 1860.|$|E

The focus is on charting how carers perceive their task as ‘parenting’ or ‘job’, whether and how they experience payment as compensation or as an appropriate reward for their skills. Also examined are the ways in which payment may impact upon the practice of foster care, for example in decision making over the taking or ending of placements and the provision of aftercare support for care leavers. The study highlights the distinctive nature of foster care as an institution that straddles the public and private domains, and examines the resulting complexities. It concludes by suggesting that while payment issues provide important threads that run throughout foster care, their influence is ultimately limited by the latter's base within the family...|$|E

The thesis is separated into several parts, in the first chapter I use general characteristic of negotiable instruments for the bill of exchange. In the second chapter I briefly discuss relations {{of the bill of}} exchange, because we have to pay attention not only to the essentials but also to other terms of drawing the bill. In the third chapter I deal with the bill of exchange and promissory note and their essentials. The difference between the bill of exchange and the promissory note is an unconditional order to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer to drawee, which is characteristic for the bill of exchange; whereas the promissory note is characterized by an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer. The rest of essentials, except for the name of drawee logically, are the same. These essential are the term "bill of exchange" incorporated {{in the body of the}} bill of exchange in the same language as a text of the bill of exchange, maturity, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> name of payee, place and date of drawing a bill of exchange and signature of drawer.

40|$|This {{research}} paper discusses how minimised government {{interference in the}} operation of commercial letters of credit can actually improve their development as they are regulated by the Uniform Customs and Practice of Documentary Credits (UCP 600). Government interference takes shape in foreign exchange control legislation, which does impede both payment and financing. Illegality attaches where the credit fails to meet legal requirements at <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> or performance. Illegality is an established exception to the principle of autonomy under UCP 600. Exceptions to the independence of the credit are necessary to safeguard against abuse. Illegality should not be extended to include government control as it distorts the operation of the credit. Illegality should be interpreted narrowly to include only parties to the agreement. Letters of credit are popular payment methods due to the security they offer and they are an autonomous transaction. Various negative implications arise where illegality is raised as a result of foreign exchange control; parties may attempt to defeat such illegality even through unlawful means. The research tracks the historical development of the standardisation of the commercial credit vis-a-vis common law. It is argued that the introduction of UCP has contributed little to the common law as UCP is not drafted in legal terms as it is intended as a code of practice for banks. It does not cover crucial legal consequences, rights and obligations. In the interests of trade facilitation WTO member states should review current exchange control regimes in their jurisdictions, to allow for free flow and uniform trade financing...|$|E

The motivation of this institution is not achieving at the level of income but prefer the service to the community, however, {{does not mean that the}} level of profits from services provided is not a concern at all. Karanganyar Hospital Revenue derived from a variety of services including revenue derived from drug sales, revenue from outpatient care, and revenues from laundry services. Supervision and control over cash receipts derived from services to the patients continued to receive attention from management, because cash is an asset of a company that is very liquid.

These advantages include: a document that is used quite adequate, there are several related functions inside it, the separation of functions, which are adequate records and systems authorization is good. In addition to these advantages, there are also several weaknesses, among others: Documents used authorized by the competent authority is not maximal, as in the Inpatient Fee Schedule (RBRI) is only authorized by the treasurer, showing error is usually in terms of employees who are less careful or experienced saturation due to face the same things and at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> in-patients there was only one cashier, so many patients are waiting too long in making a payment. Some of these weaknesses allow for the boredom of his job so employees can make employees less rigorous on the job.

This new US farm bill eliminates fixed direct payments made to farmers since 1996. In <b>place</b> <b>of</b> those <b>payments,</b> the 2014 farm bill strengthens protections against downside price and revenue risks. Crop insurance is enhanced as a pillar of the US farm safety net. In addition, new programs are enacted to address two types of loss: shallow losses that coincide with the deductible on individual farm insurance and losses resulting from multiple years of low prices or declining revenue that {{are not covered by}} insurance. Because of the lack of consensus on the design of assistance programs for such risks, farmers are given choices among several program options. The strengthened safety net will result in less certain annual support payments to farmers, with spending that could prove lower or higher than had the 2014 farm bill not been enacted.

In the light of certain more recent decisions or judicial utterances the question may properly be asked again: Should the courts of the United States adopt the renvoi theory in the conflict of laws? Although no discussion of the problem is yet to be found in any American decision, there are cases in which the renvoi doctrine has been sanctioned either expressly or by necessary implication. The case of Guernsey v. The Imperial Bank of Canada and the case of Lando v. Lando may serve as illustrations. In the former case an action was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Wyoming against the indorser of a promissory note. The note was made and indorsed in Illinois, but it was payable in Canada. Presentment, demand and protest were made, and notice of dishonor was given in compliance with the law of Canada; but the indorser claimed that the notice would have been insufficient to charge the indorser if the note had been payable in Illinois. The court below held that the notice was good and rendered judgment against the indorser. The latter 2 ̆ 7 s counsel insisted that the ruling was error on the ground that the sufficiency of the notice was governed by the law of the place of indorsement and not by the law of the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> On appeal, the learned court made the following remarks concerning the above contention: 2 ̆ 2 To this contention there is a short and conclusive answer. The place of the indorsement was the state of Illinois. The law of that state was, when the indorsement was made, and it still is, that when commercial paper is indorsed in one jurisdiction and is payable in another the law of the place where it is payable governs the time and mode of presentment for payment, the manner of protest, and the time and manner of giving notice of dishonor, and the law of the place of indorsement is inapplicable to them. Wooley v. Lyon, II 7 Ill. 248, 250,. 6 N. E. 885, 886, 57 Am. Rep. 867. If, therefore, as counsel contend, the law of the place where the indorsement was made,- the law of Illinois, governs the sufficiency of the notice of dishonor in this case that notice was good, for it was sufficient under the law of Ca 1 zad where the note was payable, and the law of Illinois was that in a case of this character the law of the place where,the note was payable governed the time and manner of giving the notice of dishonor. 2 ̆...|$|E

Vendar pa ima lahko kupec tudi druge (tj. dodatne obveznosti), če sta se stranki zanje dogovorili v pogodbi. Teh konvencija sicer ne ureja, ampak le predvideva možnost dogovora strank o tem. Obveznosti plačila kupnine je v CISG namenjeno kar šest členov in je tako zelo podrobno urejena. CISG tako ureja problematiko vsebine same obveznosti plačila in jo tako v 54. členu podrobneje opredeljuje. Nadalje se posveča tudi primeru nedoločene ali nedoločljive cene in to ureja v 55. členu. V 57. členu se CISG posveča kraju plačila kupnine, v 58. členu pa času plačila kupnine. V 59. členu razrešuje dilemo o zahtevi za plačilo in določa, da zahteva za plačilo ni pogoj za dospelost. Prevzem dobave je urejen le v enem členu, ki to obveznost podrobneje opredeljuje. Pravna sredstva prodajalca so urejena v členih od 61 do 65. CISG.

Ob branju te določbe lahko dobimo vtis, da je uporaba sredstva mogoča ne glede na vrsto kršitve, vendar pa 64. člen vsebuje posebni ureditvi za kršitev obveznosti plačila ali kršitev obveznosti prevzema, 65. člen pa ureja posebno pravno sredstvo pri prodaji s specifikacijo.

As such they are not handled explicitly in the convention-in it they are only forseen as an option of two clients bargaining over it. Obligation of paying the price is very meticulously described in the CISG, because it is discussed in no less than six articles. So the CISG regulates the problematic content of the obligation of paying as such and it also goes into great details {{about it in the}} 54 th article. Next, the case is given to a further examination in the case of undefined or undetermined prices. This is regulated in the 55 th article.
