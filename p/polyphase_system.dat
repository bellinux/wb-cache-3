5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> which that company would eventually market.|$|E
500|$|Tesla's {{demonstration}} of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, {{came at the}} time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thompson-Houston, were trying to grow in a capital intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a [...] "War of Currents" [...] propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> right away.|$|E

50|$|Three-phase {{electric}} {{power is a}} common method of alternating current {{electric power}} generation, transmission, and distribution.

50|$|A {{rotary phase}} converter, {{abbreviated}} RPC, is an electrical machine that converts power from one <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> (including frequency) to another, converting through rotary motion. Typically, single-phase electric power {{is used to}} produce three-phase electric power locally to run three-phase loads (any industrial machinery with three-phase motors) in premises (often residential or consumer) where only single-phase is available.|$|E
50|$|The oldest Jaruga {{power plant}} {{was the first}} {{alternating}} current (AC) power system in Croatia, the first commercial hydro power plant in Europe, and second in the world. It was set in operation on 28 August 1895 at 20:00, {{two days after the}} Adams Power Plant on the Niagara Falls. It was designed to power the street lights in Šibenik, making it the first city in the world with street lights powered by a <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> of alternating current (AC).|$|E
50|$|Polyphase coils are {{electromagnetic}} coils connected {{together in a}} <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> such as a generator or motor. In modern systems, the number of phases is usually three or a multiple of three. Each phase carries a sinusoidal alternating current whose phase is delayed relative to one of its neighbours and advanced relative to its other neighbour. The phase currents are separated in time evenly within each period of the alternating current. For example, in a three-phase system, the phases are separated from each other by one-third of the period.|$|E
50|$|For two {{electrical}} {{systems to}} be synchronized, both systems must operate {{at the same}} frequency, and the phase angle between the systems must be zero (and two <b>polyphase</b> <b>systems</b> must have the same phase sequence). Synchroscopes measure and display the frequency difference and phase angle between two power systems. Only when these two quantities are zero {{is it safe to}} connect the two systems together. Connecting two unsynchronized AC power systems together is likely to cause high currents to flow, which will severely damage any equipment not protected by fuses or circuit breakers.|$|R

50|$|When {{using the}} method of {{symmetrical}} components, separate one-line diagrams are made {{for each of the}} positive, negative and zero-sequence systems. This simplifies the analysis of unbalanced conditions of a <b>polyphase</b> <b>system.</b> Items that have different impedances for the different phase sequences are identified on the diagrams. For example, in general a generator will have different positive and negative sequence impedance, and certain transformer winding connections block zero-sequence currents. The unbalanced system can be resolved into three single line diagrams for each sequence, and interconnected to show how the unbalanced components add in each part of the system.|$|E
50|$|Any <b>polyphase</b> <b>system,</b> {{by virtue}} of the time {{displacement}} of the currents in the phases, makes it possible to easily generate a magnetic field that revolves at the line frequency. Such a revolving magnetic field makes polyphase induction motors possible. Indeed, where induction motors must run on single-phase power (such as is usually distributed in homes), the motor must contain some mechanism to produce a revolving field, otherwise the motor cannot generate any stand-still torque and will not start. The field produced by a single-phase winding can provide energy to a motor already rotating, but without auxiliary mechanisms the motor will not accelerate from a stop when energized.|$|E

40|$|The paper formulates {{the problem}} of {{optimizing}} power flows in <b>polyphase</b> <b>systems</b> with significant source (line) impedance. The problem is stated in a Hilbert space, and then solved explicitly for {{the case of a}} linear line and load. Properties of the solution are illustrated on the example of an asymmetrical three-phase induction motor supplied with unbalanced non-sinusoidal voltages. While the optimal compensator current depends on explicit knowledge of numerous network and load parameters, the paper also explores an alternative close-to-optimal solution which gener-alizes the Fryze compensator and relies only on knowledge of load voltage and current, thus being easier to implement in practice. ...|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} one century of {{evolution}} of alternating current (ac) {{and thanks to the}} competitive costs of alternators and transformers, today a great majority of electricity is produced, transmitted, and distributed worldwide by means of ac <b>polyphase</b> <b>systems</b> [1], [2]. Nevertheless, about 200 high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems are spread over the world to provide services where they are more convenient than ac systems. Moreover, the number of direct current (dc) systems is increasing, primarily due to the expansion of intermitted renewable energy sources and the inherent need to provide them with storage capabilities and, secondly, because of the enhanced competitiveness of solid-state converters. These two aspects can merge to form visionary concepts such as the energy hub, which fosters medium-voltage ?direct current transmission...|$|R
5000|$|No {{arrangement}} of transformers can convert a single-phase load into a balanced load on a <b>polyphase</b> <b>system.</b> A single-phase load may be powered from a three-phase distribution system either by connection between a phase and neutral or by connecting the load between two phases. The load device must be {{designed for the}} voltage in each case. The neutral point in a three phase system exists at the mathematical center of an equilateral triangle formed by the three phase points, and the phase-to-phase voltage is accordingly √3 times the phase-to-neutral voltage. [...] For example, in places using a 415 volt 3 phase system, the phase-to-neutral voltage is 240 volts, allowing single-phase lighting to be connected phase-to-neutral and three-phase motors {{to be connected to}} all three phases.|$|E
50|$|Other {{scientists}} {{had come to}} the United States {{to take part in the}} nation's rapid growth. Alexander Graham Bell, who arrived from Scotland by way of Canada in 1872, developed and patented the telephone and related inventions. Charles Steinmetz, who came from Germany in 1889, developed new alternating-current electrical systems at General Electric Company, and Vladimir Zworykin, an immigrant from Russia in 1919 arrived in the States bringing his knowledge of x-rays and cathode ray tubes and later won his first patent on a television system he invented. The Serbian Nikola Tesla went to the United States in 1884, and would later adapted the principle of rotating magnetic field in the development of an alternating current induction motor and <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> for the generation, transmission, distribution and use of electrical power.|$|E
50|$|A <b>polyphase</b> <b>system</b> is a {{means of}} distributing alternating-current {{electrical}} power. Polyphase systems have three or more energized electrical conductors carrying alternating currents with a definite time offset between the voltage waves in each conductor. Polyphase systems are particularly useful for transmitting power to electric motors. The most common example is the three-phase power system used for industrial applications and for power transmission. A major advantage of three phase power transmission (using three conductors, as opposed to a single phase power transmission, which uses two conductors), is that, since the remaining conductors act as the return path for any single conductor, the power transmitted by a balanced three phase system is three times that of a single phase transmission but only one extra conductor is used. Thus, a 50% / 1.5x increase in the transmission costs achieves a 200% / 3.0x increase in the power transmitted.|$|E
