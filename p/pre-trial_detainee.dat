40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{protection}} of human rights of <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detainees</b> under Zanzibar law and practices. In this study, I wish to consider whether problems and conditions associated with the abuses of human rights of the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detainees</b> in Zanzibar can be solved and improved. The law in Zanzibar has made a significant progress in the protection of the right to personal liberty and rights of persons deprived of their liberty through Constitutional reform since 1984. The Zanzibar Constitution of 1984 contains the Bill of Rights which guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms of all persons including the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detainees.</b> However, since the aftermath of the first multiparty election in 1995, there has been continuing problems of abuse of powers by law enforcement officials. For instance, arbitrary deprivation of liberty has become a common practice in Zanzibar, suspects of criminal offences are denied their right to bail, to legal assistance, to communicate with relatives, in some cases <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detainees</b> are subjected to torture and other ill treatments. Thus, there is a gap between what the law provides as rights and the practices of law enforcement officials. The violations of right to liberty and rights of <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detainees</b> in Zanzibar persist because of various factors including police corruption, lack of awareness of legal rights, disrespect of the law by the law enforcers, political misuse of the law enforcers and absence of an independent and effective system of supervision of police practices. The existence of an independent monitoring system is very important to safeguard rights of <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detainees</b> and also to ensure the law enforcement officials comply with safeguards against unlawful deprivation of liberty and respect for the rights of <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detainees.</b> Lack of external monitoring body makes individual and unscrupulous police officers to feel quite confident to abuse their power with impunity. Therefore, in order to ensure the law enforcement official comply with the law it is important to intensify internal supervision of police conducts, to establish independent monitoring system of police stations and also to make sure that law enforcers who abuse their powers are brought to justice...|$|R

Methods We test our hypotheses with peer network and health data from 467 Dutch male <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detainees.</b> Results Results suggest that peer trust has no direct association with reported rates of peer aggression while detained and low peer trust is generally protective for mental health. Conclusions Our study adds to a small body of literature finding that social integration within certain correctional settings may not operate {{in the same way}} that it does in the general population and may actually contribute to adverse mental health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Considering debates {{frequently}} {{raised in}} France concerning {{the situation of}} pre-trial detention, the author identifies some trends: the constant reference to statistics; lack of efforts to precise the meaning of indicators used in making a demonstration — in fact the same statistics {{can be used to}} demonstrate contradictory theses —, a largely spread habit to always speak of more : more use of pre-trial incarceration, more <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detainees</b> [...] . Those practices, argue the author, lead to ignore important changes in trends and to avoid questioning the meaning of those. The limited interest in research using more sophisticated indicators — that could add usefully informations to the data published regularly by the prison administrations —, international comparisons between data not necessarily comparable, references to old statistics, all result in everyone continuing to attribute to France the European championship in terms of pre-trial detention, while the actual situation could be totally different.
