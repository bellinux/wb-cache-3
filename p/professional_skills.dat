The bureaucracy was relatively low, with most applications taking less than a fortnight for finalising paperwork and receiving approval. Each subproject was given a nine-month deadline for completion.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Fredrik Reinfeldt {{was born}} in Allmänna BB {{hospital}} in Stockholm and was the oldest of three brothers to his parents Bruno (1938-2016) and Birgitta Reinfeldt. At {{the time of his}} birth his parents lived in an apartment in Österhaninge, in the south of Stockholm County, but a short time afterwards the family moved to London, where his father worked as a consultant for Shell. Upon returning to Sweden, the family first lived in an apartment in Handen before moving to a terraced house in Bromsten in northwestern Stockholm. The Reinfeldt family was living in Bromsten when Fredrik's younger brothers, Magnus and Henrik, were born in 1969 and 1973. In 1976 the family moved into a single-family home in Täby in northeastern Stockholm County. His mother Birgitta was a leadership and management consultant, and some of her <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> might have inspired and impressed the young Fredrik.|$|E
5|$|The King, {{weakened}} by illness, became progressively less {{active in the}} last years of his reign, devoting an increasing amount of time to prayer, as did his aging mother, who had returned from Poland in 1374. These circumstances allowed Elizabeth to assume a more prominent role at court. Her influence had grown steadily since she had given her husband heirs. It appeared probable that the crowns would pass to one of Elizabeth's underage daughters and by 1374, their rights were confirmed. Behind the scenes, Elizabeth began ensuring that the succession would be as smooth as possible by encouraging a slow but decisive change in the personnel of the government. Warlike and illiterate barons were gradually replaced by a small group of noblemen who excelled in their <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> but were not distinguished by birth or military ability. Palatine Nicholas I Garai led the movement and enjoyed the full support of the Queen, and their power eventually became virtually unrestricted.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSoft skills {{especially}} ethics, {{moral and}} <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> {{play an important}} role in sharpening individual's excellent personality by complementing his/her hard skills to the teacher communities. The complicated nature of teaching, in both practice and preparation, encourages teacher educators to explore the complexity of the novice teachers’ experiences and identify the concerns they face in their induction year. This study aims to examine the ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> of novice teachers in secondary schools of Malaysia from the views of their administrators. In addition, findings are triangulated by the self-rating data done by novice teachers themselves on this particular skill. The main purpose of this study is to explain and interpret the practice of ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> from the two different perspectives. This study employed qualitative method using focus group interviews to collect data from 31 administrators and quantitative method using self-rating questionnaire from 250 novice teachers. Among the seven soft skills components which comprised of communicative skill, critical thinking and problem solving skills, team work skill, life-long learning and management of information, entrepreneurship skill, ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill,</b> and leadership, quantitative finding showed that ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> has been rated as second least needed after entrepreneurship skill in the workplace according to novice teachers. However, quantitative finding found to be contradicted with qualitative data. School administrators stated that soft skill components are the most needed and most of the novice teachers are lacking of is ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill.</b> In conclusion, keeping abreast of developments in teacher education would ensure that novice teachers remain current and relevant in their profession, and that novice teachers be equipped with necessary ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> to survive in an increasingly complex teaching environment...|$|R

25|$|By 1980, {{achievement}} {{was once again}} accepted {{as the basis for}} admission and promotion in education. This fundamental change reflected the critical role of scientific and technical knowledge and <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> in the Four Modernizations. Also, political activism was no longer regarded as an important measure of individual performance, and even the development of commonly approved political attitudes and political background was secondary to achievement. Education policy promoted expanded enrollments, with the long-term objective of achieving universal primary and secondary education. This policy contrasted with the previous one, which touted increased enrollments for egalitarian reasons. In 1985 the commitment to modernization was reinforced by plans for nine-year compulsory education and for providing good quality higher education.|$|E

25|$|According to the 2007 {{study by}} Memorial and Demos human rights organisations, Russian policemen lose their {{qualifications}} and <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> during their duty tours in Chechnya. This conflict {{was linked to}} the rising brutality and general criminalisation of the Russian police forces. According to human rights activists and journalists, tens of thousands of police and security forces that have been to Chechnya learned patterns of brutality and impunity and brought them to their home regions, often returning with disciplinary and psychological problems. Reliable numbers on police brutality are hard to come by, but in a statement released in 2006, the internal affairs department of Russia's Interior Ministry said that the number of recorded crimes committed by police officers rose 46.8% in 2005. In one nationwide poll in 2005, 71% of respondents said they didn't trust their police at all; in another, 41% Russians said they lived in fear of police violence. According to Amnesty International, torture of detainees in Russia is now endemic. Since 2007, police officers from outside Caucasus are now not only being sent to Chechnya, but to all the region's republics.|$|E

[...] Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express was mixed in his review. Although he commended Hamasaki's transition to rock music and her song writing, he said he became [...] "worried" [...] about the production and found it regressive in comparison to Next Level.|$|E
