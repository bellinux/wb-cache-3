Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 209 pages. <b>Valve</b> <b>timing</b> {{is critical to}} the performance of hydraulic piston motors and pumps. With non-optimal <b>valve</b> <b>timing,</b> the pressure differential across the valve during a valve opening or closing can be significant, causing transitional throttling loss and reducing the energy efficiency. The goal of this thesis is to provide a fundamental understanding of the role of <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> and propose a viable active valve solution for better efficiency of hydraulic pumps and motors. Previously, researchers have proposed a variety of <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> models based on analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and optimization. However, many critical questions, such as the relationship between the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> and throttling energy loss, the meaning of the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> optimality, and the influence of the fluid compressibility with entrained gas, have not been fully answered. Prior work on <b>valves</b> with active <b>timing</b> have focused on reducing the valve transition time, leakage, and dead volume. The cylindrical rotary valve architecture {{has been found to be}} a promising solution, provided that the leakage issue is solved. In this research, a new two-phase analytical <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> solution, a complete active motor-valve numerical model, a prototype cylindrical rotary valve, and a novel fluid compressibility experiment have been developed. Results have shown that the analytical <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> solution is capable of capturing the trade-offs between throttling energy loss and output piston work. A full model of a motor was used to optimize <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> for a specific operating condition. The numerical model was validated experimentally, where a prototype active rotary valve was integrated into a commercial pump. A rectified bulk modulus model was derived from a novel mass transfer experiment to determine the compressibility of oil with entrained gas based on an optical bubble size measurement. The contributions of the thesis are: (1) the validated analytical and numerical models that allow finding the optimal <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> as a function of the operating conditions, (2) a new active valve architecture that enables variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> motor/pump, and (3) a rectified fluid compressibility model based on a lumped interfacial mass transport equation that predicts the effective fluid bulk modulus dynamically...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the area}} of systems health management, the task of prognostics centers on {{predicting}} when components will fail. Model-based prognostics exploits domain knowledge of the system, its components, and how they fail by casting the underlying physical phenomena in a physics-based model that is derived from first principles. Uncertainty cannot be avoided in prediction, therefore, algorithms are employed that help in managing these uncertainties. The particle filtering algorithm has become a popular choice for model-based prognostics due to its wide applicability, ease of implementation, and support for uncertainty management. We develop a general modelbased prognostics methodology within a robust probabilistic framework using particle filters. As a case study, we consider a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> from the Space Shuttle cryogenic refueling system.

During pneumatic hybrid operation the engine {{can be used as a}} 2 -stroke compressor for generation of compressed air during vehicle deceleration and during vehicle acceleration the engine can be operated as an air-motor driven by the previously stored pressurized air. The compressed air is stored in a pressure tank connected to one of the inlet ports.
