40|$|Nowadays, {{despite the}} {{large volume of}} {{worldwide}} academic research on various aspects of metal cutting the control of workpiece precision still relies <b>on</b> <b>machine-tool</b> operator's experience and trial and error runs. In order {{to increase the efficiency}} of machining systems, many empirical models based on artificial intelligent (AI) approaches have been proposed in the past, where important process improvements were reported. This paper overviews the AI approaches applied in machining operations to predict part accuracy in terms of dimensional deviations and surface roughness. Successful techniques applied in this field such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference systems and Bayesian networks are briefly reviewed and compared to facilitate its use. For each AI approach, the most relevant research works are described and based on those works some guidelines are proposed for its implementation. In addition, advantages and drawbacks of each approach are summarised and a generic guideline for AI approaches selection is proposed...|$|R
