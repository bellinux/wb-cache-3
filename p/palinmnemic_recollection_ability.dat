40|$|Outcome {{knowledge}} influences {{recall of}} earlier predictions of an event. Compared to younger adults, older adults {{are more susceptible}} to the two underlying bias processes that contribute to this hindsight bias (HB) phenomenon, recollection bias and reconstruction bias. However, the role of cognitive abilities in these processes remains unclear. In Experiment 1, we extended the multinomial processing tree model for HB by incorporating individual variation in cognitive abilities into parameter estimation in a sample of 60 older (M = 72. 50, range = 65 to 87) and 62 younger (M = 20. 10, range = 18 to 25) adults. In older adults, our findings revealed that (1) higher episodic memory was associated with higher <b>recollection</b> <b>ability</b> in the absence of outcome knowledge, (2) higher episodic memory, inhibitory control, and working memory capacity were associated with higher <b>recollection</b> <b>ability</b> in the presence of outcome knowledge, and (3) higher inhibitory control was associated with less reconstruction bias. Although the pattern of effects was similar in younger adults, the cognitive covariates did not significantly predict the underlying processes in this age group. In Experiment 2, we collected memory judgment HB data on an additional 80 older adults (M = 71. 40, range = 65 to 87) to assess whether a) experimentally increasing inhibition demands via outcome rehearsal during the HB task impacts the underlying HB processes, and b) the effects of this cognitive load manipulation on the underlying HB processes vary with an individuals’ inherent cognitive abilities. Our findings revealed that cognitive load increased recollection bias independently of individuals’ cognitive abilities. Conversely, cognitive load only increased reconstruction bias in individuals with high inhibitory control, resulting in these individuals performing similarly to individuals with low inhibitory control. Our findings support the role of inhibitory control in older adults’ recollection and reconstruction biases, and suggest that even high functioning individuals are susceptible to HB when available processing resources are limited...|$|R
40|$|With over 800, 000 {{people living}} in the UK with {{dementia}} and this figure expected to rise to one million by 2025, dementia is a health and social care priority. With more responsibility for care being given to families and lay carers, {{it is important that we}} increase public awareness of the condition. The new dementia facebook app is focused upon the memory loss and memory disruption aspects of the condition. We build up a personal history with its mix of emotions on our facebook sites, as we also do in our minds. Our sense of who we are is linked to our autobiographical memory. The message behind this dementia app is that if we lose this mental history and <b>recollection</b> <b>ability,</b> then we lose something of ourselves. We cannot function so well if our memories are lost, unclear or scrambled and this will hopefully be felt to some degree, by those trying out the new app...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{functional}} neuroimaging {{studies have}} observed lateral parietal lobe activation during memory tasks: {{a surprise to}} clinicians who have traditionally associated the parietal lobe with spatial attention rather than memory. Recent neuropsychological studies examining episodic recollection after parietal lobe lesions have reported differing results. Performance was preserved in unilateral lesion patients on source memory tasks involving recollecting {{the context in which}} stimuli were encountered, and impaired in patients with bilateral parietal lesions on tasks assessing free recall of autobiographical memories. Here, we investigated a number of possible accounts for these differing results. In 3 experiments, patients with bilateral parietal lesions performed as well as controls at source recollection, confirming the previous unilateral lesion results and arguing against an explanation for those results in terms of contralesional compensation. Reducing the behavioral relevance of mnemonic information critical to the source recollection task did not affect performance of the bilateral lesion patients, indicating that the previously observed reduced autobiographical free recall might not be due to impaired bottom-up attention. The bilateral patients did, however, exhibit reduced confidence in their source <b>recollection</b> <b>abilities</b> across the 3 experiments, consistent with a suggestion that parietal lobe lesions might lead to impaired subjective experience of rich episodic recollection...|$|R
50|$|Korsakoff's Syndrome causes {{deficits in}} {{declarative}} memory in most patients, but leaves implicit spatial, verbal, and procedural memory functioning intact. People who have Korsakoff's syndrome have deficits in {{the processing of}} contextual information. Context memories refers to the where and when of experiences, and {{is an essential part}} of <b>recollection.</b> The <b>ability</b> to store and retrieve this information, such as spatial location or temporal order information, is impaired. Research has also suggested that Korsakoff patients have impaired executive functions, which can lead to behavioral problems and interfere with daily activities. It is unclear, however, which executive functions are affected most. Nonetheless, IQ is usually not affected by the brain damage associated with Korsakoff's syndrome.|$|R
40|$|Outcome {{knowledge}} influences {{recall of}} earlier {{predictions of the}} event in question. Researchers have hypothesized that age-related declines in inhibitory control may underlie older adults' increased susceptibility to the two underlying bias processes that contribute to this hindsight bias (HB) phenomenon, recollection bias and reconstruction bias. Indeed, Coolin et al. (2015) found that older adults with lower inhibitory control {{were less likely to}} recall their earlier predictions in the presence of outcome knowledge (lower <b>recollection</b> <b>ability)</b> and {{were more likely to be}} biased by outcome knowledge when reconstructing their forgotten predictions (higher reconstruction bias) than those with higher inhibitory control. In the present study, we assess intraindividual differences in older adults' recollection and reconstruction processes using a within-subjects manipulation of inhibition. We tested 80 older adults (Mage = 71. 40, range = 65 to 87) to assess whether (a) experimentally increasing inhibition burden via outcome rehearsal during the HB task impacts the underlying HB processes, and (b) the effects of this outcome rehearsal manipulation on the underlying HB processes vary with individual differences in cognitive abilities. Our findings revealed that outcome rehearsal increased recollection bias independently of individuals' cognitive abilities. Conversely, outcome rehearsal only increased reconstruction bias in individuals with higher inhibitory control, resulting in these individuals performing similarly to individuals with lower inhibitory control. These observations support the role of inhibitory control in older adults' HB and suggest that even individuals with higher inhibition ability are susceptible to HB when processing resources are limited.

40|$|Despite {{being the}} second most popular team sport in Europe (Beech, 2012) {{handball}} in Britain it is a developmental sport, trailing behind the majority of Europe in both playing standard and talent pool (England Handball Progress Report, 2011). A crucial factor {{in the development of}} youth players is the impact from a coach (Fry; 2010), with performance feedback from a coach essential in aiding athlete improvement (Carling, Williams & Riley, 2005). The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate coach recollection in elite adolescent British handball to explore if the use of Performance Analysis (PA) could aid the coaching process. To further the research into how PA can aid the coaching process, the study also aimed to examine whether game outcome (winning or losing) affects coach recollection. The study gathered results in two sections: firstly 8 coaches completed questionnaires which explored previously defined key indicators of handball performance immediately following three competitive games and secondly data on the same indicators was generated using PA. Following data collection the results were compared and statistically analysed using chi-square goodness of fit tests and tests of independence. Findings of the study reinforce previous literature which has examined coach recollection capabilities, with an overall recollection rate of 33. 10 % of all indicators. This is similar to the majority of PA studies, which typically discuss the inadequacy of coaches to recall any greater than 40 % of pertinent information (e. g. Franks & Miller’s, 1986). The study also found that coaches more frequently recalled attacking indicators correctly compared to defensive ones, as well as having more competent <b>recollection</b> <b>ability</b> when a game was lost as opposed to won. These findings not only add to current literature on the subject but also offer insights into potential areas were the coaching process could be aided. This in turn promotes the use of PA, which could potentially aid the development of elite level adolescent British Handball...|$|R
40|$|Memory {{encoding}} and retrieval {{were studied}} in a nonclinical sample of participants that differed {{in the amount}} of reported dissociative experiences (trait dissociation). Behavioral as well as functional imaging (fMRI) indices were used as convergent measures of memory functioning. In a deep vs. shallow encoding paradigm, the influence of dissociative style on elaborative and avoidant encoding was studied, respectively. Furthermore, affectively neutral and negative words were presented, to test whether the effects of dissociative tendencies on memory functioning depended on the affective valence of the stimulus material. Results showed that (a) deep encoding of negative vs. neutral stimuli was associated with higher levels of semantic elaboration in high than in low dissociators, as indicated by increased levels of activity in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex during encoding and higher memory performance during recognition, (b) high dissociators were generally characterized by higher levels of conscious recollection as indicated by increased activity of the hippocampus and posterior parietal areas during recognition, (c) nonclinical high dissociators were not characterized by an avoidant encoding style. These results support the notion that trait dissociation in healthy individuals is associated with high levels of elaborative encoding, resulting in high levels of conscious <b>recollection.</b> These <b>abilities,</b> in addition, seem to depend on the salience of the presented stimulus materia...|$|R
40|$|What is {{conscious}} recollection? Is it {{special to}} humans or do animals have this capacity as well? What brain circuitry supports {{the kinds of}} information processing that constitute recollection? This review will outline recent evidence from studies on rodents, monkeys and humans bearing on these questions. This review focuses on a comparative approach that identified features of recollection that can be studied across species, explores these elements of recollection in animals, and examines in animals {{the role of the}} medial temporal areas that are critically involved in conscious recollection in humans. Substantial evidence indicates that animals exhibit all the fundamental features of <b>recollection,</b> that these <b>abilities</b> depend on the hippocampus in animals as well as humans, and that neuronal representations in the hippocampus reflect information processing fundamental to the features of recollection. In addition, the functional circuitry of the hippocampal system is largely conserved across species, and its organization suggests information processing mechanisms that support the features of recollection are common across species. Aristotle (350 BC) contended that “…other animals (as well as man) have memory, but, of all that we are acquainted with, none, we venture to say, except man, shares in the faculty of recollection. ” Here Aristotle distinguishes “memory, ” as an elementary matching of current sensation...|$|R
30|$|It was {{previously}} discovered that listening to unfamiliar songs relates to <b>recollection,</b> the cognitive <b>ability</b> to recall a former context {{associated with a}} musical excerpt by utilizing episodic memory [16]. We hypothesized that subjects in our experiment might recollect past experience from episodic memory to identify a novel song. Previous research [17] that showed relatively higher gamma power over the parietal scalp during the act of recollection (as opposed to the act of experiencing familiarity) is consistent with our results that showed a marginally higher gamma-PSD obtained from the Pz electrode while listening to an unfamiliar song. In addition, Hsieh and Ranganath [18] also reported on the implication of the frontal midline θ in working and episodic memory in which the associated memories could possibly be relevant to unfamiliar song listening. However, subjects in the DEAP experiments produced higher gamma and frontal midline theta power while watching familiar music videos; we suspect that the underlying {{reason for this is}} that the subjects used memory to a greater extent to anticipate the next scene of a music video because they might have occasionally watched the music video versions of regularly listened to songs. Unlike our dataset, subjects in DEAP dataset experiment who watched a particular music video for the first time or who had minimal experience with the video would engage so intensely enough in watching the video that they avoided using any recollection memory to associate the music with previous experiences. This evidence indicated that familiarity to video scenes had a higher influence on brain activities than familiarity with the music used as background sounds in the music video.|$|R
40|$|Background. - Persistent {{impairment}} in cognitive function {{has been described}} in euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder. Collective work indicates that obesity is associated with reduced cognitive function in otherwise healthy individuals. This sub-group post-hoc analysis preliminarily explores and examines the association between overweight/obesity and cognitive function in euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder. Methods. - Euthymic adults with DSM-IV-TR-defined bipolar I or II disorder were enrolled. Subjects included in this post-hoc analysis (n = 67) {{were divided into two}} groups (normal weight, body mass index [BMI] of 18. 5 - 24. 9 kg/m(2); overweight/obese, BMI >= 25. 0 kg/m(2)). Demographic and clinical information were obtained at screening. At baseline, study participants completed a comprehensive cognitive battery to assess premorbid IQ, verbal learning and memory, attention and psychomotor processing speed, executive function, general intellectual <b>abilities,</b> <b>recollection</b> and habit memory, as well as self-perceptions of cognitive failures. Results. - BMI was negatively correlated with attention and psychomotor processing speed as measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (P < 0. 01). Overweight and obese bipolar individuals had a significantly lower score on the Verbal Fluency Test when compared to normal weight subjects (P < 0. 05). For all other measures of cognitive function, non-significant trends suggesting a negative association with BMI were observed, with the exception of measures of executive function (i. e. Trail Making Test B) and recollection memory (i. e. process-dissociation task). Conclusion. - Notwithstanding the post-hoc methodology and relatively small sample size, {{the results of this study}} suggest a possible negative effect of overweight/obesity on cognitive function in euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder. Taken together, these data provide the impetus for more rigorous evaluation of the mediational role of overweight/obesity (and other medical co-morbidity) on cognitive function in psychiatric populations.
