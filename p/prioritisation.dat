40|$|Business {{models have}} been {{emphasised}} in research as an important concept for studying and understanding firms’ value creation and performance. The business model in literature is understood as how firms configure their businesses, including how they create and deliver value for their customers, and how they capture economic value from its offering. Recently, research has highlighted the founder’s role in the firm’s business model, pointing to a cognitive perspective in business models. Emphasising this perspective makes founders’ perceptions and <b>prioritisations</b> essential in understanding the link between business models and firm performance. However, the relationship of these <b>prioritisations</b> to the business model dimensions in extant literature still requires clarification, and so far, such a connection has not been fully addressed. The purpose of this thesis is to connect business model dimensions and founders’ <b>prioritisations.</b> This is addressed through a systematic literature review of business models and through a multiple-case study, including interactive and retrospective parts, of eight new technology-based firms (NTBFs). The results recognise three measurable dimensions of the business model in literature: innovation, change, and efficiency. Measurements are identified {{for each of these}} dimensions to facilitate the connection of each dimension with firm performance. Further, the case study’s results demonstrate three distinct ways in which founders of NTBFs prioritise within their business model in the start-up phase. These <b>prioritisations</b> focus on customers, value chain partners, and finance. This thesis further recognises a connection between the customer-focused business model in NTBFs and innovation and change dimensions, and a connection between prioritising partners and the change and efficiency dimension. Additionally, the results indicate a connection between the financial focus and the business model’s dimension of efficiency. The thesis contributes to business model literature, and to the field of entrepreneurship, by addressing the connection between business model dimensions in literature and founders’ <b>prioritisations.</b> Moreover, the thesis suggests future research with a focus on the interrelations among business model dimensions, and potential effect of these dimensions and founders’ <b>prioritisations</b> on firm performance. </html...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Graph-theoretic {{connectivity}} analyses {{have received}} much attention in connectivity evalu-ation {{during the last}} few years. Here, we explore the underlying conceptual differences of various graph-theoretic connectivity measures. Based on connec-tivity analyses from three reserve networks in forested landscapes in Central Finland, we illustrate how these conceptual differences cause inconsistent connectivity evaluations at both the landscape and patch level. Our results also illustrate how the characteristics of the networks (patch density) may affect the performance of the different measures. Many of the connectivity measures react to changes in habitat connectivity in an ecologically undesirable manner. Patch <b>prioritisations</b> based on a node removal analysis were sensitive to the connectivity measure they were based on. The patch <b>prioritisations</b> derived from different measures showed a disparity in terms of how much weight they put on patch size versus patch location and how they value patch location. Although graphs operate at the interface of structure and function, there is still much to do for incorporating the inferred ecological process into graph structures and analyses. If graph analyses are going to be used for real-world management and conservation purposes, a more thorough understand-ing of the caveats and justifications of the graph-theoretic connectivity measures will be needed...|$|R

5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. <b>Prioritisation</b> of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{population}} growth in southern Buckinghamshire caused by the railway, Chesham remained relatively unaffected by development. Although there was extensive development in Chesham Bois, roughly halfway between Chesham and Amersham, between 1889 and 1925 the population of Chesham itself grew by less than 2,000, and between 1925 and 1935—the peak of the Metro-land boom—by only 225. Between 1921 and 1928 the season ticket revenue from Amersham and Chalfont& Latimer stations rose by 134%; that from Chesham by only 6.7%. Although the MR owned large tracts of land around Chesham, bought {{in anticipation of a}} revival of the LNWR connection scheme, Selbie chose not to build a housing estate on the site, instead selling much of it to the local council. By this time, service on the Chesham branch was of a relatively poor quality. Improvements to the central London section and the <b>prioritisation</b> of the Aylesbury line had led to ageing surplus stock often being used on the Chesham branch, and the partial electrification caused delays at Rickmansworth as steam locomotives were coupled and uncoupled. As the branch was mainly operated as a shuttle service passengers to and from Chesham were obliged to wait at Chalfont& Latimer station. This had been built to serve a lightly populated area, but the Metro-land development had caused a much larger number of users than it had been designed for, and it had few waiting facilities, poor lighting, inadequate shelter, and dirty toilets. As Amersham grew, {{more and more of the}} trains which had previously run direct from London to Chesham instead ran to Amersham, causing further crowding as passengers waited for the shuttle service at Chalfont& Latimer. Improving road transport caused an increasing number of commuters to abandon the Chesham line, which in turn prompted the MR to further reduce passenger services.|$|E

40|$|With an {{increasing}} proportion of elderly and {{an increasing}} demand for healthcare, managerial efforts are needed in order make {{the best use of}} resources and to keep cost under control. One of the most critical and expensive resources in a hospital is the operating theatre. This thesis aims to investigate the potential of computer-based modelling for supporting healthcare decision makers to improve management policies related to the hospital operating theatre. In a study conducted at a medium sized Swedish hospital we identify important <b>prioritisations</b> and decisions made in relation to patient scheduling and resource allocation when planning for surgery. Patient scheduling and operating room planning are complex tasks with a number of influencing factors to consider like, e. g., uncertainty in patient arrival, uncertainty in surgery procedure time and medical <b>prioritisations</b> and diagnosis. Further, several intersected dependencies, e. g. pre- and post operative care, have to be considered as to prevent occlusion and obtain a maximum patient through-put. With an optimisation-based approach we demonstrate how different criteria in patient scheduling and resource allocations can affect various objectives in terms of patient perspectives, staff perspectives and costs. For instance, we show that the current policy for resource allocation does not handle the variability generated by the patient diagnosis very well. In Sweden a law has recently been introduced, which advocates restrictions in elective patient waiting times. We extend the optimisation-based approach to include post-operative care and simulate a scenario based on patient data from a Swedish hospital to be able to predict the possible impact of the new law. The results indicate that the law causes an unsuitable increase in the waiting times for medium prioritised patients. Furthermore, we propose a combination of discreteevent simulation and optimisation to examine what impact different resource allocations of emergency and elective resources have on both utilisation rate and disturbance consequences, i. e. surgery cancellation and overtime work, due to emergency cases and other unexpected events. We show that both utilisation rate and cancellation frequencies can be improved significantly by the application of some minor changes in the resource allocation. Finally, we explore some future possibilities of using agent technology for modelling health care management decisions...|$|R

By studying general policy documents, the ambition is to gain a wider understanding of the role of public transport based on the societal context it is situated in.

Results show that public transport is regarded as an important factor towards achieving other goals and other public values, particularly those related to economic and environmental issues; and that the social dimension is not as prioritised.

However, the studied documents showed large overall differences in how counties and municipalities address public transport issues. It should be a priority in Sweden’s main steering documents to treat public transport consistently and give it the same priority as other societal functions—not least because Sweden’s treatment of public transport is a reasonable reflection of its overall society and can influence <b>prioritisations</b> and considerations in counties and municipalities across the country...|$|R
40|$|To {{halt the}} decline of marine biodiversity, {{networks}} of interacting marine protected areas (MPAs) – intertidal and subtidal areas "reserved by law or other effective means to protect part {{or all of the}} enclosed environment" (Kelleher 1999) – need to be expanded. Systematic conservation planning (hereafter 'systematic planning') offers a way forward with its explicit methods for locating and designing resource management (hereafter 'management') in time and space to promote the conservation of biodiversity (Margules and Pressey 2000). The implementation of systematically planned MPA networks has been demonstrated in some regions. However, numerous challenges (e. g. understanding the willingness of people to engage in conservation) impede translations of many spatial <b>prioritisations</b> into management. Spatial <b>prioritisations</b> are the technical activities within systematic planning that identify the configuration of priority areas for conservation action. Conservation actions are interventions that contribute to conservation goals (e. g. establishing education programs or management) (Salafsky et al. 2008). The failure of many spatial <b>prioritisations</b> to motivate conservation action {{is referred to as the}} knowing-doing gap. The conservation biology literature contains a heated discussion about the best investment of conservation resources, leading to a polarization between systematic planning and opportunistic conservation – conservation that takes advantage of opportunities without considering spatial context or regional conservation goals. Although it can be useful to polarize these perspectives to better understand their respective strengths and limitations, academics and resource managers are now exploring how they can be made complementary. Opportunistic conservation actions can be 'scaled up' to better achieve fisheries and conservation objectives that require perspectives broader than individual local governance units. At the same time, spatial <b>prioritisations</b> must be 'scaled down' or adapted to better inform implementation of conservation actions by incorporating local objectives, unforeseen constraints on conservation actions, and errors in data. The goal of this thesis is to better understand options for integrating systematic planning with local management. With this goal in mind, my thesis has two main objectives: 1. To investigate methods for scaling down systematic planning to inform conservation actions, focusing on opportunities for implementing multiple forms of management with different contributions to conservation goals; and; 2. To explore considerations for scaling up conservation actions to achieve regional conservation goals. To achieve these objectives, first I examine the mismatch of spatial scales between systematic planning and conservation actions. I review key decisions about spatial scale in systematic planning, and the considerations and implications of these key decisions for informing conservation actions (Chapter 2). In Chapter 2, I develop a framework in which decisions about spatial scale can be made explicit, investigated further, and potentially addressed during systematic planning. In this framework, I identify five decisions about spatial scale: extent and delineation of the planning region, resolution of data, size and delineation of planning units, MPA network design, and applying conservation actions. Each of these decisions involves several considerations, including the extent of available data, extent of bioregions, and social, economic and ecological characteristics of study areas. My framework helps to link theory and application in systematic planning, facilitates learning, and promotes the application of conservation actions that are both regionally and locally significant. To scale up conservation actions or scale down systematic plans, the differential contributions of several forms of management (e. g. permanent and temporary closures to resource extraction) to conservation goals must be understood, so I develop a method to do so (Chapter 3). Using Fiji as a case study, I gather expert knowledge through dialectic inquiry to obtain perceived effectiveness scores for four forms of management, and use these in a national gap analysis. Permanent closures were the benchmark with an ecological effectiveness score of 1. 0. Temporary closures with controlled harvesting had relatively high scores and temporary closures with uncontrolled harvesting and 'other management' had relatively low scores. Understanding the relative contribution of different forms of management to conservation goals facilitates scaling up and down in three ways: (1) forms of management that complement each other in terms of the level of protection they offer and their social acceptability can be identified; (2) conservation achievements in countries where multiple forms of management will be needed to achieve national conservation goals can be assessed; and (3) spatial <b>prioritisations</b> can be tailored to management that is relevant within the ecological, social, economic and political context of the selected planning regions. To contribute to existing knowledge on opportunities for implementing multiple forms of management, I develop a method to model conservation opportunity at fine resolution for different forms of management (Chapter 4). I also develop an approach to investigate the social characteristics of villages with different forms of management, thereby providing insights into conservation opportunity (Chapter 5). In Chapter 4, I use key informant interviews and remotely collected data, and model conservation opportunity for different forms of management at regional scales using Maxent. This model provides information on the relative suitability of one area for a particular form of management. I find that two of the most important predictors of suitability for the different forms of management are distance from the nearest road and proportion of inshore fishing ground already closed. This approach is promising, because it produces good fits to the existing data (cross-validated AUC at least 0. 98). It also provides insight into the factors influencing the presence and characteristics of different forms of management, and matches accounts in the literature on factors important to establishing closures. In Chapter 5, I use the social-ecological systems diagnostic framework, and compare the performance of data at different resolutions for informing conservation opportunity. Even though conservation opportunity is context specific, using a well-recognized diagnostic framework allows identification of characteristics that lead to effective governance within different contexts. I use canonical correspondence analysis to examine the association between the presence and form of management on one hand and, on the other, human and social characteristics of villages. I find that, in the Solomon Islands, human and social characteristics that influence the presence and absence of management can be more easily differentiated than those related to different forms of management. Furthermore, I find that household-scale data are more effective than village-scale data at identifying the human and social characteristics associated with management. Understanding these characteristics and mapping conservation opportunity facilitate the scaling down of systematic plans by informing planners of priorities for feasible forms of management within a social-ecological system. To further explore considerations for scaling up conservation actions to achieve regional conservation goals (objective 2), the conservation opportunity model developed in Chapter 4 is used as the basis for comparing systematic planning and opportunistic approaches to conservation. I carry out 10 -year simulations of additional conservation actions with systematic planning and opportunistic conservation approaches, identifying the difference between the upper and lower bounds of plausible future conservation achievements (Chapter 4). To predict future conservation action, I use data on conservation opportunity (Maxent suitability model), established MPAs, key informant interviews, and Marxan with Zones (systematic planning software). The opportunistic approach achieves quantitative conservation objectives for half the ecosystems, while all objectives are achieved or nearly achieved with the systematic planning approach. Chapter 4 informs policy makers about what incentives and regulations are needed to steer Fiji toward achieving national conservation goals into the future. My thesis contributes to the theoretical advancement of the field of conservation biology by investigating the results of different approaches to conservation (i. e., systematic planning and opportunistic approaches) and developing methods that help integrate them. Chapter 2 informs both scaling up and scaling down by identifying the considerations needed and the trade offs between considerations when making decisions about spatial scale. Chapter 3 provides a method to understand the differential effectiveness of management and integrates this understanding into a national gap analysis, which facilitates scaling down of outputs from systematic plans by tailoring them to specific regions. Understanding differential effectiveness also helps to scale up management by informing decision makers about complementary forms of management. Together, chapters 4 and 5 provide methods to understand opportunity for conservation. This is critical if spatial <b>prioritisations</b> are to identify priority areas that are most likely to be implemented, thereby facilitating the scaling down of systematic plans. Lastly, Chapter 4 also demonstrates a method to understand the benefits of coordinating opportunistic management to facilitate the development of policies and incentives...|$|R
40|$|NEWS COVERAGE: A {{news release}} {{based on this}} journal {{publication}} is available online: Study: It's not cheating unless a species gets hurt [[URL] is a focal concept {{in the study of}} mutualism, with the majority of researchers considering cheating to be both prevalent and highly damaging. However, current definitions of cheating do not reliably capture the evolutionary threat that has been a central motivation for the study of cheating. We describe the development of the cheating concept and distill a relative-fitness-based definition of cheating that encapsulates the evolutionary threat posed by cheating, i. e. that cheaters will spread and erode the benefits of mutualism. We then describe experiments required to conclude that cheating is occurring and to quantify fitness conflict more generally. Next, we discuss how our definition and methods can generate comparability and integration of theory and experiments, which are currently divided by their respective <b>prioritisations</b> of fitness consequences and traits. To evaluate the current empirical evidence for cheating, we review the literature on several of the best-studied mutualisms. We find that although there are numerous observations of low-quality partners, there is currently very little support from fitness data that any of these meet our criteria to be considered cheaters. Finally, we highlight future directions for research on conflict in mutualisms, including novel research avenues opened by a relative-fitness-based definition of cheating...|$|R
