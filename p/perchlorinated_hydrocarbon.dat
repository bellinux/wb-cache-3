40|$|Many {{chlorocarbons}} are environmental {{dangers and}} health hazards. The simplest <b>perchlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> carbon tetrachloride, {{is near the}} top of the list of hazardous compounds. Carbon tetrachloride was used as a cleaning fluid, solvent, and fire-extinguishing agent. The nuclear and defense complexes also employed great quantities of carbon tetrachloride and other chlorocarbons as cleaning and degreasing agents. Many sites nationwide have underground chlorocarbon contamination plumes. Bulk chlorocarbon inventories at many locations await treatment and disposal. Often the problem is compounded by the chlorocarbon being radioactively contaminated. Waste inventory and groundwater contamination problems exist for many other chlorocarbons, especially methylene chloride, chloroform, and tri- and tetrachloroethylene. In this work solid soda lime (a fused mixture of approximately 95 % CaO and 5 % NaOH in a coarse, granulated form) at 350 C to 400 C acts as the hydrolyzing degradation, and off-gas scrubbing medium. Within soda lime CO{sub 2 } and HCl from hydrolysis and degradation convert immediately to calcium and sodium chlorides and carbonates, with water vapor as a volatile byproduct...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} and {{mechanism of}} the thermal activation of peroxydisulfate, in the temperature range from 60 to 80 degrees C, was investigated in the presence and absence of sodium formate as an additive to turn the oxidizing capacity of the reaction mixture into a reductive one. Trichloroacetic acid, TCA, whose degradation by a reductive mechanism is well reported in the literature, {{was used as a}} probe. The chemistry of thermally activated peroxydisulfate is described by a reaction scheme involving free radical generation. The proposed mechanism is evaluated by a computer simulation of the concentration profiles obtained under different experimental conditions. In the presence of formate, SO(4) (center dot-) radicals yield CO(2) (center dot-), which are the main species available for degrading TCA. Under the latter conditions, TCA is more efficiently depleted than in the absence of formate, but otherwise identical conditions of temperature and [S(2) O(8) (2 -) ]. We therefore conclude that activated peroxydisulfate in the presence of formate as an additive is a convenient method for the mineralization of substrates that are refractory to oxidation. such as <b>perchlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and TCA. This method has the advantage that leaves no toxic residues. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ANPCyT, Argentina[PICT 2003 14508...|$|R
40|$|Perchloroacenaphthylene(C 12 Cl 8), a <b>perchlorinated</b> {{polycyclic}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{composed of}} two hexagons and a pentagon, was ablated by a pulsed laser beam in a vacuum. The products created from the laser ablation were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry and rapid-scan ultraviolet spectrophotometric detection. Buckminsterfullerene C- 60 and various perchlorinated carbon clusters have been observed among the products. The observation is helpful for understanding the formation mechanisms of fullerenes and suggests that the Pentagon Road scheme is feasible with the involvement of chlorines...|$|R
40|$|By laser ablating {{graphite}} in {{the vapor}} of tetrachloromethane, {{a series of}} <b>perchlorinated</b> polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> were synthesized. Among them, hexachlorobenzene (C- 6 Cl- 6), octachloronaphthalene (C- 10 Cl- 8), octachloroacenaphthylene (C- 12 Cl- 8), decachloroanthracene (C- 14 Cl- 10), decachlorophenanthrene (C- 14 Cl- 10), decachloropyrene (C- 16 Cl- 10), decachlorofluoranthene (C- 16 Cl- 10), C- 18 Cl- 10, C- 20 Cl- 10, C 22 Cl 12 and C- 24 Cl- 12 were identified by HPLC-UV-MS. The results demonstrate {{the potential of the}} reaction for synthesizing the compounds with special structures...|$|R
40|$|High-performance liquid {{chromatography}} (HPLC) was coupled with ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (UV) for the simultaneous separation and {{identification of a}} series of <b>perchlorinated</b> polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> such as perchlorobenzene (C 6 Cl 6), perchloronaphthalene (C 10 Cl 8), perchlorobiphenyl (C 12 Cl 10), perchloroanthracene (C 14 Cl 10), perchlorophenanthrene (C 14 Cl 10), perchloroacenaphthylene (C 12 Cl 8), perchloropyrene (C 16 Cl 10) and perchlorofluoranthene (C 16 Cl 10). HPLC was performed on an ODS column using methanol-hexane (80 : 20) as mobile phase at a flow-rate of 1. 0 ml/min. UN absorption spectra of the elutes were detected in the region of 210 - 350 nm.

40|$|Simultaneous {{separation}} and identification of <b>perchlorinated</b> polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PCPAHs) and fullerenes is of practical interest {{due to the}} growth mechanism of fullerenes involved with PCPAHs. Non-aqueous reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with an ODS column and a gradient mobile phase of methanol-ethanol-cyclohexane mixtures, was combined with both rapid-scan ultraviolet spectrometry (UV) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) for the {{separation and}} identification of over 80 PCPAHs as well as fullerenes C- 60 and C- 70, that were synthesized in the discharge reaction of chloroform. PCPAH retention was found {{to depend on the}} number of aromatic rings and the degree of non-planarity of PCPAH structure. Based on the isotopic pattern of molecular ion or/and quasi-molecular ion peaks in corresponding mass spectra, molecular compositions of the PCPAH products were unambiguously determined. The results obtained from the HPLC-UV-MS analysis not only are helpful for the understanding of the fullerenes formation mechanism, but also contribute to the analytical technique capable of separating and identifying the complicated mixture of PCPAHs and fullerenes.
