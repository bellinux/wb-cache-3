30|$|In {{examining}} the {{variation of the}} yellowing parameter Y with respect to time, we can draw a number of conclusions. Firstly, there is a non linear and complex relationship between the yellowing of paper and time in this case. The generally accepted statement that paper yellows with time is not held to be true and that possibly, {{the composition of the}} paper was far more a determination of yellowing. A simple visual inspection showed the change of paper from pre and post 1912, however the subtle changes in pre- 1912 samples observed in the two regions (1868 – 1880 and 1880 – 1912) would probably not be picked up by eye. This region suggests change in medium or storage pre and post 1880. The initial paper used for the Daily Advertiser appears to have maintained a low yellowing level and also is relatively robust as copy. As soon as journals post 1912 print date were studied, previous access indicate damage to many copies, with fragments of newsprint present in the folders as change has occurred. Although this is not a multifactorial study of paper properties, it was observed that the brittleness of paper also changed discontinuously as a function of time. A visual examination showed the journal newsprint from 1912 to 1930 exhibiting the greatest fragility. Both these observations point to a change {{in the use of the}} <b>paper</b> <b>source</b> and variation in <b>paper</b> <b>source</b> and processing over time.|$|E
30|$|Cascades of information, ideas, rumors, {{and viruses}} spread through networks. Sometimes, it is {{desirable}} to find {{the source of a}} cascade given a snapshot of it. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>source</b> inference problem is tackled under Independent Cascade (IC) model. First, the #P-completeness of source inference problem is proven. Then, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to find a solution. It is worth noting that our algorithm is designed to handle large networks. In addition, the algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge of when the cascade started. Finally, experiments on real social network are conducted to evaluate the performance. Under all experimental settings, our algorithm identified the true source with high probability.|$|E
