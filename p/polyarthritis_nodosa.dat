40|$|Introduction : Polyarthritis, {{also called}} periarthritis nodosa (PAN) {{is a disease}} of small and {{medium-sized}} arthritis. In a subset of patient with PAN, however, the disease process remains localized within a single organ or a precise anatomical area. Case Report : A 29 -year old man was referred to our department for the pain in the 2 / 3 upper of the external face of his left arm. The radiography was consistent with soft tissue swelling and periosteal reaction. MRI showed abnormal signal involving muscle in some parts. The surgical biopsy was done. Conclusion : Pathological study on the specimen supported the PAN (<b>polyarthritis</b> <b>nodosa)</b> so prednisolone 1 mg/kg was started and provided relief of pain and myalgia...|$|E
30|$|Subcutaneous panniculitis {{is divided}} into five histopathologic {{patterns}} (Ho and Lam 2002; Walsh et al. 2008; Fernando et al. 2003; Ter Poorten and Thiers 2002; Ferrara et al. 2013): 1) lobular panniculitis without vasculitis, 2) lobular panniculitis with vasculitis, 3) septal panniculitis without vasculitis, 4) septal panniculitis with vasculitis, and 5) mixed panniculitis involving septa and lobules. Lobular panniculitis {{may be related to}} idiopathic Weber-Christian disease, trauma, intragenic injections, cold exposure, sickle cell disease, alpha- 1 antitrypsin deficiency, pancreatic disease, systemic lupus erythema, scleroderma, erythema induratum, and paraneoplastic disease. Septal panniculitis may be associated with erythema nodosum, eosinophilic fasciitis, and polyarteritis nodosa. Mixed panniculitis may occur in lupus profundus, and subcutaneous sarcoidosis. Once a vasculitis has been detected within the subcutaneous tissue by histopathology, <b>polyarthritis</b> <b>nodosa,</b> erythema nodosum, and nodular vasculitis should be considered (Ferrara et al. 2013; Gilchrist and Patterson 2010).|$|E
40|$|Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies {{have been}} {{detected}} in patients with some autoimmune and vascular diseases such as Wegner's granulomatosis, <b>polyarthritis</b> <b>nodosa</b> and systemic lupus erythematosus. Indirect immunofluorescence technique has been employed to detect these autoantibodies. By this method, two general patterns of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were seen: a cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) and a perinuclear form (P-ANCA). These antibodies have also been observed in uveitis. In this study, the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in 25 patients with uveitis and its relationship with anatomical location of the autoimmune reaction was evaluated. According to the results, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were detected in 16 % (4 out of 25) of the patients, {{all of which were}} C-ANCA type. The results also showed that there was no significant correlation between the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anatomical location of the disease (p= 0. 65) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Comorbid {{inflammatory}} {{conditions in}} multiple sclerosis (MS) patients suggest shared risks with MS. Objective: To estimate if {{the risk of}} immune-mediated disease in MS patients and their parents is increased. Methods: Swedish register data were analysed using Cox regression to estimate immune-mediated disease risk among 11284 fathers and 12006 mothers of MS patients, compared with 123158 fathers and 129409 mothers of index subjects without MS. Similar analyses were conducted among 20276 index subjects with MS and 203951 without. Results: Parents of patients with MS {{did not have a}} significantly altered immune-mediated disease risk. Patients with MS had a consistently raised risk for several immune-mediated diseases: ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, <b>polyarthritis</b> <b>nodosa</b> and pemphigoid. The risk was more pronounced for diseases diagnosed subsequent to MS onset. Conclusion: The increased occurrence of other immune-mediated diseases in MS patients may not be due to shared genetic factors and surveillance bias {{is likely to be the}} main or possibly the entire explanation. If not entirely explained by surveillance bias, a modestly raised occurrence of comorbid diseases may be due to shared environmental risks or factors related to MS disease characteristics.

40|$|Objective: Viral {{diseases}} {{are one of}} the common causes of hearing loss. The inner ear may be involved directly or by secondary reaction (e. g., <b>polyarthritis</b> <b>nodosa).</b> This study was performed to investigate the relation between positive HBS-Ag (hepatitis B disease) and hearing loss. Methods: This case-study research was done on 95 hepatitis-B patients as the case group and 97 normal cases as the control group. They were selected sequentially and audiologic tests were performed on the participants. The hearing thresholds of the two groups were compared using the t-test. Results: According to audiometry results, pure tone average (mean thresholds of 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz) were 22. 1 dB for the left ear and 23. 95 dB for the right ear in hepatitis-B group and 8. 4 dB for the left ear and 8. 95 dB for the right ear in the control group (HBS-Ag negative). The difference between two groups was statistically significant with p-value less than 0. 05. Conclusion: The results show that hepatitis-B patients are more prone to hearing loss and that hepatitis B disease can cause hearing loss. This study suggests that hepatitis B prophylaxis is important in decreasing hepatitis-B involvement and therefore, hearing loss...|$|E
