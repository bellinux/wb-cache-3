500|$|On April 14, 1995, McVeigh {{paid for}} a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas. The {{following}} day he rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because {{it reminded him of}} the Klingon warriors of Star Trek. On April16, 1995, he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator Terry Nichols where he parked a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols' blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the license plate from the car, he left a note covering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plate that read, [...] "Not abandoned. <b>Please</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery & cable)." [...] Both men then returned to Kansas.|$|E

50|$|The {{appeal was}} dismissed. The {{court held that}} the fact that Saunders was free to breathe the {{poisonous}} gas or <b>not</b> as she <b>pleased</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> free the accused from criminal responsibility for his acts. The accused had contemplated and expected that, as a consequence of his acts, Saunders would die; he therefore intended to kill her, however little he may have desired her death.|$|R

500|$|Koussevitzky {{then decided}} to perform all of Sibelius's symphonies in the Boston Symphony's 1932–33 season, with {{the world premiere of}} the Eighth as the culmination. In June 1932 Sibelius wrote to Koussevitzky {{suggesting}} that the Eighth be scheduled for the end of October. A week later he retracted: [...] "I am very disturbed about it. <b>Please</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> announce the performance." [...] Further promises, for December 1932 and January 1933, brought forth no scores. Koussevitzky was by now losing hope, yet he inquired once more, in the summer of 1933. Sibelius was evasive; he made no promise of delivery but would [...] "return to the matter at a later date". So far as Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony were concerned, the matter ended there. Sibelius had made agreements with other conductors; he had promised the European premiere to Basil Cameron and the Royal Philharmonic Society, and the first Finnish performance to Georg Schnéevoigt, who had recently taken over direction of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. These arrangements were, however, subject to the illusory Boston premiere, and thus were stillborn. Later in the decade, Eugene Ormandy, a fervent admirer of Sibelius who directed the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1936, is thought to have lobbied strongly for the right to perform the premiere, should the symphony in due course emerge.|$|E
500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' <b>Please</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2001, Zhang was {{transferred}} to the eastern coastal province of Shandong to become governor.

[...] This was seen as Zhang trying to send a signal that he intended to distance himself from a political culture rife with corruption and complex rules around guanxi. In Shandong, Zhang was known to conduct 'undercover visits' to survey the lives of ordinary people. When Zhang left office, Shandong's GDP had exceeded 2 trillion yuan (~$300 billion), ranking second among provinces in the country.|$|E

They ask for individual volunteers from the audience to act out various scenes such as being in an armed hold-up, pointing at the getaway vehicle and ooohing and aaahing at near-misses. The final piece of filming with the audience is a mexican wave featuring all 2000 audience members. Dave then sends Marty off to get the buggy and to reset red rally car.

2500|$|In 2004, the BBC apologised unreservedly {{and paid}} £250 in {{compensation}} to a Somerset parish council, after Clarkson damaged a 30-year-old horse-chestnut tree by driving into it {{to test the}} strength of a Toyota Hilux. In December 2006, the BBC complaints department upheld the complaint of four Top Gear viewers that Clarkson had used the phrase [...] "ginger beer" [...] (rhyming slang for [...] "queer") in a derogatory manner, when Clarkson picked up on and agreed with an audience member's description of the Daihatsu Copen as being a bit [...] "gay". The [...] was criticised by the BBC Trust for glamorising drink driving in a scene showing Clarkson and James May in a vehicle, despite Clarkson saying to the camera [...] "And <b>please</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> write to us about drinking and driving, because I am not driving I am sailing" [...] (as they were on top of international, frozen waters).

[...] He awarded Li Jing with even more silk. [...] Later in 630, he made Li Jing Shangshu Pushe (尚書僕射), the head of the important executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng), also a chancellor post. [...] It was said that Li Jing spoke very little when conferencing with other chancellors—then considered a virtue. [...] A more plausible explanation is that Taizong didn't trust his high officials, especially the generals, and Li Jing was very sure about it. [...] He deliberately tried to keep a low profile in order not to raise Taizong's suspicion.|$|E
