30|$|To {{comment on}} the general results at the {{profiles}} level, {{we were unable to}} use our approach to distinguish between students and employees (thus, natural and unnatural personae). This could be because the type of personae represented by individuals # 4 and # 5 is very similar to our natural <b>profile</b> <b>template,</b> or because there was too much variation in our sample used to define naturalness. To test this last hypothesis we adopted the approach mentioned in Step 1 that focused on defining and reflecting on the average penalty and the standard deviation for the initial participant sample. From this analysis, we found that at this level, there were six participants that had a penalty score higher than the mean penalty (0.0343) plus one standard deviation (0.0334) and one participant (of that six) with a score higher than the mean plus two standard deviations (unnatural). In some ways, these individuals could be considered as outliers whose profiles could have weakened the naturalness characterisation process.|$|E

40|$|Rail {{grinding}} {{is used by}} {{rail infrastructure}} owners to remove rail corrugations, rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks and for re-profiling the rail. In North America, the standard practice is Preventive and Preventive-Gradual grinding strategy which uses high production rail grinders to complete a single pass on most track locations at high grinding speed. These practices have been proven in field tests {{to be the most}} cost effective grinding strategies. To plan rail grinding on Queensland Rail a Rail Inspection Vehicle (RIV) is used to gather data of rail profiles and rail surface photos. This inspection technology generates a Grinding Quality Index. This paper proposes the standards utilised in accepted best practices [13] as a standard for Australian railways and their challenges and drawbacks to implementation as well as a better method of addressing RCF defects. Grinding Quality Index (GQI) is estimated by comparing the measured rail profile with the target rail <b>profile</b> <b>template</b> for the area of material to be removed for a particular grinding pass. Based on the rail surface photos taken by the RIV, the operator decides the additional depth of cut and number of passes based on experience with that track. GQI is currently estimated based on profiles and do not consider RCF. Current GQI does not show any relationship with the RCF cracks and can be very good from a profile perspective, but still can have RCF cracks on the surface. Close monitoring of pre and post grind rail profiles for compliance and inclusion of RCF factor has been proposed as an enhancement to the current GQI for effective assurance on the quality of grinding.

40|$|Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) has {{garnered}} {{increasing interest}} and research attention and become particularly significant in many studies of translation. The {{present study is}} located {{within the framework of}} descriptive and applied Translation Studies. The thesis reports a study investigating the applicability of SFL to translating English prose fiction into Arabic. What makes this study so important is that it addresses several interrelated issues serving two vital purposes in Translation Studies: assessing translations and training translators. The two purposes are kept in balance in a well-constructed, three-phase research model, establishing the joint effect of testing the viability of SFL in English-to-Arabic translation of fiction. In the area of assessment, two SFL-based models are applied and developed. Firstly, Kim's metafunction shift analysis is applied to a 48 -clause sample from seven Arabic translations of Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. The results of this rigorous metafunctional match analysis show that Process and Circumstance top the 10 -catgory list of optional shifts. The seven translations are ordered based on this matching analysis. Using the same sample, another in-depth study is carried out on three translations (those having the highest, the lowest and medial number of metafunction shifts) to examine the validity of a newly created multi-level schema of optional explicitation located beyond the scope of metafunction shift analysis model. The results demonstrate that the order of the three translations is maintained. This schema suffices to adequately describe the lexicogrammatical nature of the explicitatives (at the micro-level) and to show how this can facilitate identifying their effect on the texture of the target text (at the macro-level). Secondly, in implementing House's well-established model for translation quality assessment, three interdependent developmental processes are introduced to facilitate its application, develop its tools and gauge its efficiency. A source text <b>Profile</b> <b>Template,</b> a Match Tracer and a statistical comparative table (which can together be potentially exploited in other genres or adapted for other language pairs) are applied to the same three translations using a longer excerpt. The results show that the order of the three translations remains the same. In summary, the results of the three studies lend further support to the general premise that the SFL framework can be applied reliably in assessing Arabic translations of English fiction. The applicability of SFL is also tested empirically in the area of training. A three-month training experiment involving a sample of two groups (control and experimental) of final-year Arab university students majoring in English (40 participants each) is designed and carried out to compare the progress of performance between the two groups with and without the presence of an SFL-based translator training course. The data are gathered through initial and final exams involving assessing short Arabic translated extracts of English fiction and translating a longer extract into Arabic. The results indicate that the four sub-competences constituting the scoring rubric of the control group show an increase/decrease of 10...|$|E

In this grinding system PZT actuating table and templates are used together with personal computer. Conventional surface grinding machine is used.

In the case {{on the condition of}} little movement deviation of table in z direction by repeated feed operations, compensating grinding method using personal computer and actuating table is effective. From the experiments 0. 2 μm of straightness along 250 mm length at 6 mm width is obtained on the condition of work speed v= 50 mm/s. and depth of cut 1 μm. Further precise compensating grinding system is proposed. Template is set nearly and parallel to the work and displacement sensor is installed under the arm fixed on the column.

40|$|The success {{probability}} of side-channel attacks {{depends on the}} used measurement techniques {{as well as the}} algorithmic processing to exploit available leakage. This is particularly critical in case of asymmetric cryptography, where attackers are only allowed single side-channel observations because secrets are either ephemeral or blinded by countermeasures. We focus on non-profiled attacks which require less attacker privileges and cannot be prevented easily. We significantly improve the algorithmic processing in non-profiled attacks based on clustering against exponentiation-based implementations compared to previous contributions. This improvement is mainly due to PCA and a strategy to select few mid-ranked components where exploitable, low-variance leakage is concentrated. As a result from a practical experiment using single-channel high-resolution magnetic field measurements, we report a significant improvement in the number of successful attacks. Further, we present the first practical results from using three such channels simultaneously. The combination of three channels leads to further improved results over the best individual channel when applying a <b>profiled</b> <b>template</b> attack.

Using Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph data we detect the 10 micron silicate absorption feature with a detection significance of 10. 7 -sigma. We fit laboratory-derived silicate dust <b>profile</b> <b>templates</b> obtained from literature to the observed 10 micron absorption feature, and find that the best single-mineral fit is obtained using an amorphous olivine template with a measured peak optical depth of tau_ 10 = 0. 49 +/- 0. 02, which rises to tau_ 10 ~ 0. 67 +/- 0. 04 if the covering factor is taken into account. We also detected the 18 micron silicate absorption feature in our data with a > 3 -sigma significance. Due to {{the proximity of the}} 18 micron absorption feature to the edge of our covered spectral range, and associated uncertainty about the shape of the quasar continuum normalization near 18 micron, we do not independently fit this feature. We find, however, that the shape and depth of the 18 micron silicate absorption are well-matched to the amorphous olivine template prediction, given the optical depth inferred for the 10 micron feature. The measured 10 micron peak optical depth in this absorber is significantly higher than those found in previously studied quasar absorption systems. The reddening, 21 -cm absorption, and velocity spread of Mg II are not outliers relative to other studied absorption systems, however. This high optical depth may be evidence for variations in dust grain properties in the ISM between this and the previously studied high redshift galaxies. Comment: 40 pages with 9 figures.
