25|$|A false aneurysm, or <b>pseudoaneurysm,</b> is a {{collection}} of blood leaking completely out of an artery or vein, but confined next to the vessel by the surrounding tissue. This blood-filled cavity will eventually either thrombose (clot) enough to seal the leak, or rupture out of the surrounding tissue.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} review found 31 cases of vascular injuries caused by acupuncture, three resulting in death. Two died from pericardial tamponade {{and one was}} from an aortoduodenal fistula. The same review found vascular injuries were rare, bleeding and <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> were most prevalent. A 2011 {{systematic review}} (without restriction in time or language), aiming to summarize all reported case of cardiac tamponade after acupuncture, found 26 cases resulting in 14 deaths, with little doubt about causality in most fatal instances. The same review concluded cardiac tamponade was a serious, usually fatal, though theoretically avoidable complication following acupuncture, and urged training to minimize risk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{procedure}} {{is not without}} risk, and complications can be life-threatening. [...] It can lead to arrhythmias, <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> formation or rupture of the pulmonary artery, thrombosis, infection, pneumothorax, bleeding, and other problems.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe report 13 {{successful}} emergency embolisations for 12 <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> {{performed in}} 10 patients. For five <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> the embolisation technique was modified according to number of supplying vessels, flow rate of <b>pseudoaneurysms,</b> vascular anatomy {{and whether there}} was clinical evidence of re-bleeding or not. Apart from traditional embolisation technique, modified embolisation techniques are also useful for endovascular therapy of <b>pseudoaneurysms...</b>|$|R
30|$|In this case, {{we first}} treated the AB fistula {{formed by the}} rupturing of the anastomotic <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> using TEVAR. The {{hemoptysis}} initially stopped because the TEVAR blocked the {{blood flow to the}} <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> and reduced the pressure within them. However, 2 months later the hemoptysis relapsed because a type 2 endoleak increased the pressure within the aortic sac and <b>pseudoaneurysms.</b> Moreover, the type 2 endoleak supplied blood flow into the aortic sac and <b>pseudoaneurysms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Femoral <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> may complicate up to 8% of {{vascular}} interventional procedures. Small <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> can spontaneously clot, {{while others}} need definitive treatment.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{option for}} {{treatment}} is ultrasound probe compression {{of the neck}} of the <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b> The [...] "neck" [...] of the <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> is the narrow path of blood flow between the artery, through the arterial wall, and into the <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> cavity. The artery, neck, and <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> are seen on ultrasound. The ultrasound probe can be pushed firmly against the patient's skin to compress {{the neck of the}} <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> for usually about 20 minutes. During this time, the blood within the <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> clots; after the probe is then removed, the <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> will hopefully remain clotted and will not continue to expand. The procedure may be stopped early due to patient discomfort. It is less successful if the patient is obese, since there is more fatty tissue between the skin and the neck of the <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b> It also is less successful if the neck of the <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> is wider, since it is less likely to clot off during the period of compression. Finally, it is also much less successful if the patient is taking aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or another anticoagulant, since these would prevent clotting of blood within the <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b> Advantages are that this is the least invasive method of stopping arterial blood flow into a <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> {{may also}} {{occur in a}} chamber of the heart {{following}} myocardial damage due to ischemia or trauma. A <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> of the left ventricle is a potentially lethal complication from a myocardial infarction.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} suspected {{if the patient}} {{has a history of}} arterial trauma. This can include arterial access for catheterization (i.e. the common femoral artery), blunt trauma (i.e. to an extremity), or penetrating trauma (i.e. gunshot or blast injury). Blunt or penetrating trauma can cause a disruption in the arterial wall, leading to a <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b> A patient with such a history who presents with a painful, pulsatile, tender mass at the site of catheterization or trauma should be suspected to have a <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b> The diagnosis should be confirmed using Duplex ultrasonography, which will reveal arterial blood flow into the <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b> A CT angiogram or conventional angiogram can also diagnose a <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE:The most catastrophic {{complication}} of <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> is rupture.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to provide a {{detailed}} description of echocardiographic and Doppler features of <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> involving the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa and to compare echocardiographic and aortographic findings. Background. Infection of the aortic valve may spread to the aortic annulus, resulting in ring abscesses or <b>pseudoaneurysms,</b> or both, of the intervalvular fibrosa, which can alter patient management and prognosis. Methods. The echocardiographic and Doppler findings of 20 patients with <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> or ring abscesses, or both, were reviewed and compared with surgical and aortographic results. Results. A total of 23 lesions were identified, of which 16 were intervalvular <b>pseudoaneurysms,</b> and 7 were ring abscesses. Transthoracic echocardiography detected 43 % of the lesions, whereas transesophageal echocardiography identified 90 % (p < 0. 01). The most distinct feature of the <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> was marked pulsatility, with systolic expansion and diastolic collapse (mean systolic area [±SD] 4. 1 ± 3. 4 cm 2 vs. diastolic mean area 1. 8 ± 2. 2 cm 2, p < 0. 05). Using color Doppler, two types were identified: unruptured <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> (n = 9), which communicated only with the left ventricular outflow tract and had a distinct flow pattern, and ruptured <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> (n = 7), which, in addition, communicated with the left atrium or aorta. Compared with <b>pseudoaneurysms,</b> ring abscesses were smaller and nonpulsatile and showed either no flow or continuous systolic and diastolic flow, the site of paravalvular aortic insufficiency. In 10 patients who underwent aortography, three lesions were identified, and findings were concordant with echocardiography. However, in seven patients aortographic findings were normal, whereas echocardiography identified intervalvular <b>pseudoaneurysms,</b> all of which were documented at operation. Conclusions. Intervalvular <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> are more frequently detected by transesophageal echocardiography than by aortography or transthoracic examination and exhibit distinct dynamic features and Doppler patterns that can further help characterize cavitary lesions in the aortic root and guide appropriate surgical intervention...|$|R
40|$|Behcet’s {{disease is}} a rare immune {{mediated}} systemic vasculitis which besides it’s more frequent involvement of eyes and skin, sometimes present with aortic pseudo aneurysm and more rarely cardiac inflammatory masses. A 51 -year-old patient with Behçet’s Disease presented with two symptomatic aortic <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> concomitant with a right atrial mass. Computed tomography (CT) revealed one supra-celiac and another infrarenal aortic <b>pseudoaneurysms.</b> Echocardiography showed a large mobile mass in the right atrium. Both <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> were successfully excluded simultaneously via endovascular approach with Zenith stent-grafts, and the atrial mass was surgically removed 10 days later. Post-implant CT showed successful exclusion of both pseudo-aneurysms, patency of all relevant arteries, and patient is now asymptomatic and has returned to normal lifestyle. Multiple <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> concomitant with a right atrial mass can be an initial manifestation of Behçet’s disease.

5000|$|Open surgery {{may also}} be {{performed}} to remove pseudoaneurysms or prevent them from expanding. If the artery is small and [...] "expendable" [...] - the tissues it supplies have adequate collateral blood flow - then the artery supplying the <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> may be ligated both proximally and distally to the <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b> The <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> {{may or may not}} be removed. If the tissues supplied by the artery do not have sufficient collateral flow (the artery is not expendable), then a vein or synthetic graft would have to be anastomosed proximally and distally to allow for continued blood flow around the <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b> Advantages are that the technique has been successful in the treatment of pseudoaneurysms for many years. However, it is more invasive (a large skin incision is necessary), and there is more postoperative pain and a risk for wound infection. One of the less invasive options may be preferred in a patient with many comorbidities, who is at high risk for surgery.|$|E

40|$|Summary: We {{present a}} case of an 85 -year-old woman with a 40 -year history of {{progressive}} bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging studies demonstrated bilateral <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> of the petrous portion of the internal carotid arteries eroding into both cochleas. To our knowl-edge, {{this is the first}} case report of such lesions. <b>Pseudoaneurysms</b> of the petrous internal carotid artery (ICA), although uncommon, have been de-scribed in the literature (1, 2). Presenting symptoms of these <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> are varied, depending on the adjacent structures and vessels involved. We re-port {{a case of}} bilateral petrous ICA <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> eroding into both cochleas presenting with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, which to our knowledge has not been previously reported...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTranscatheter {{endovascular}} embolization {{within a}} reasonable time before rupture or deterioration of a patient's general condition is an important procedure for managing visceral <b>pseudoaneurysms.</b> N-butyl 2 -cyanoacrylate (NBCA, enbucrilate) is an embolic material used in the blockade of visceral <b>pseudoaneurysms.</b> This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of transcatheter embolization of visceral artery <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> using NBCA. Patients and methodsBetween June 2004 and February 2014, 13 patients (9 males and 4  females; age range, 26 – 80 years; mean, 57. 9 years) with 14 <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> were treated by transcatheter embolization using NBCA. NBCA was mixed with iodized oil at a 1 : 3 ratio to control its polymerization time and to render it radiopaque. <b>Pseudoaneurysms</b> were located on the gastroduodenal artery (n= 1), pancreaticoduodenal artery (n= 2), dorsal pancreatic artery (n= 1), proximal jejunal artery (n= 1), colic artery (n= 1), splenic artery (n= 3), renal artery (n= 4; two in one patient), and hepatic artery (n= 1). ResultsAll patients recovered immediately following the embolization procedure, and two patients showed minor complications that required only medical observation. ConclusionsTranscatheter embolization using NBCA {{for the treatment of}} visceral <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> is a safe, effective, and low-cost treatment method with a high success rate...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to covered stent placement, another popular, minimally-invasive technique used today is ultrasound-guided thrombin injection. Thrombin (factor IIa in the coagulation cascade)is a clotting factor that converts fibrinogen into fibrin, which then polymerizes {{to form a}} blood clot. Under ultrasound guidance, thrombin can be injected directly into a <b>pseudoaneurysm,</b> causing it to clot. Advantages are that the technique {{is relatively easy to}} perform, is successful, and is minimally invasive. One contraindication to this procedure is if there is an arteriovenous fistula (communication between an artery and vein), in {{addition to}} the <b>pseudoaneurysm.</b> This occurs with about 10% of pseudoaneurysms. If this is present, thrombin injected into the <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> could then enter the venous circulation and possibly lead to distant thrombosis.|$|E
5000|$|Since the <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> {{communicates}} with {{an artery}} {{through a hole}} in the arterial wall, a covered stent may be placed endovascularly across this hole to [...] "exclude it," [...] or to prevent it from receiving blood flow from the artery. The covered stent is composed of metal and is covered with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or another sterile fabric-like material. The covered stent remains in place permanently, and the <b>pseudoaneurysm,</b> without a continuous flow of arterial blood, then thromboses. Advantages of this technique are that it has a high success rate without the need for an open surgery. Complications include covered stent migration, persistent leakage of blood into the <b>pseudoaneurysm,</b> fracturing (breaking) of the stent, and infection of the stent or of the arterial insertion site.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionAnastomotic aneurysms are a late {{complication}} after arterial reconstruction.

Control angiography confirmed immediate technical success in all cases. Exclusion of the para-anastomotic aneurysm was obtained in all cases. No major complications or postoperative mortality were observed. No occlusions of the endografts occurred and no endoleaks were noticed.

25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of arterial manifestations of BD bears many pitfalls, since the obliterative endarteritis of vasa vasorum causes thickening of the medial layer and splitting of elastin fibers. Therefore, anastomotic <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> {{are likely to}} form, as well as <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> {{at the site of}} puncture in case of angiography or endovascular treatment; furthermore, early graft occlusion may occur.|$|R
5000|$|It {{should also}} not be {{confused}} with a <b>pseudoaneurysm,</b> coronary artery aneurysm or a myocardial rupture (which involves a hole in the wall, not just a bulge.) ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} that the diagnosis be confirmed before any procedures are performed. Incision and drainage of a suspected abscess, which instead is a <b>pseudoaneurysm,</b> could lead to extensive hemorrhage.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{is not without}} risk, and complications can be life-threatening. It can lead to arrhythmias, <b>pseudoaneurysm</b> formation or rupture of the pulmonary artery, thrombosis, infection, pneumothorax, bleeding, and other problems.|$|E
30|$|Unlike true aneurysms, <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> are periarterial haematomas {{resulting}} from a tear of the arterial wall [20]. Typically, <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> are acquired because of blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma, iatrogenic injury, or inflammation, and they possess subsequent potential for enlargement and/or rupture [20, 21]. These rare lesions are often saccular in appearance and may be either intraparenchymal or extraparenchymal.|$|R
30|$|We {{present a}} case of {{hemoptysis}} caused by a type 2 endoleak that occurred after TEVAR for a ruptured TAA. The hemoptysis was secondary to aortobronchial fistulas caused by anastomotic aortic <b>pseudoaneurysms.</b> Transcatheter arterial embolization of the type 2 endoleak was very effective against the hemoptysis, and the <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> also disappeared.

30|$|It can be {{difficult}} to distinguish true left ventricular aneurysms from <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> or congenital diverticula, but correct differentiation is crucial since <b>pseudoaneurysms</b> have a high risk of rupture and surgical repair is recommended, while true aneurysms and diverticula can often be managed medically. Two features which may help distinguish these entities include location and ostial (neck) diameter.|$|R
