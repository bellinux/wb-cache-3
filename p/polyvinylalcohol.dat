In the present work, we studied the possibility of developing a versatile synthesis protocol to hierarchically construct drug-functionalized-SPIONs as potential anti-cancer agents. Our model biocompatible SPIONs consisted of an iron oxide core (9 - 10 nm diameter) coated with <b>polyvinylalcohols</b> (PVA/aminoPVA), which can be internalized by cancer cells, depending on the positive charges at their surface. To develop drug-functionalized-aminoPVA-SPIONs as vectors for drug delivery, we first designed and synthesized bifunctional linkers of varied length and chemical composition to which the anti-cancer drugs 5 -fluorouridine or doxorubicin were attached as biologically labile esters or peptides, respectively. These functionalized linkers were in turn coupled to aminoPVA by amide linkages before preparing the drug-functionalized-SPIONs that were characterized and evaluated as anti-cancer agents using human melanoma cells in culture. The 5 -fluorouridine-SPIONs with an optimized ester linker were taken up by cells and proved to be efficient anti-tumor agents.

Modifications were made to these membranes in efforts to improve their RO performances by improving the rate of water transport (flux) through the membranes without adversely affecting their salt-retention properties. Two approaches were used. First, the compositions of the PVI precursor solutions were modified to include selected hydrophilic additives: piperazine, <b>polyvinylalcohol</b> or HA- 1 (a proprietary copolymer). The average fluxes of membranes made from precursors comprising PVI I + <b>polyvinylalcohol</b> and PVI I + piperazine were {{higher than that of}} the control PVI I/A membrane. Membranes made from precursors comprising PVI II + <b>polyvinylalcohol</b> and PVI II + HA- 1 gave good performances at an operating pressure of 500 kPa (average of 90 % retention and 200 lmd flux). Second, membranes were post-treated, post-reacted or stored in various ways. This approach was used in efforts to also improve the storage life of the membranes. (Dry storage of PVI/A membranes for about one week had led to a decline in their salt retention.) Good RO test results were recorded for a set of PVI I/A membranes which had been stored in a pH 11 buffer solution for one week (99. 1 ± 0. 3 % retention and 540 ± 88 lmd flux).

40|$|This work {{conducted}} within Prof. Paradossi’s {{group at}} the Department of Chemical Science and Technology in the University of Rome Tor Vergata aimed to develop an easily applicable strategy enabling functionalization of graphene, suspended in an aqueous medium in its pristine form, to biocompatible polymeric surfaces, in particular “poly(vinylalcohol) ”platforms, designed for biomedical applications. Nowadays graphene, this new two-dimensional material with fascinating properties, is emerging in many scientific fields. Exploitation of graphene propertieshas {{been one of the}} motivations to implement biomedical applications of interest for our laboratory. Ourinvestigations are aboutwhat kind of functionalities can be introduced ina polymeric platform, such as hydrogel sponges for anti-tumor drug delivery or the surface of microbubbles, still inthedevelopment phase as multimodal imaging contrast agents mainly for ultrasoundsand photoacoustics. To this regard, photoacoustic imaging is a high-resolution preclinical fast developing diagnostic tool. Evolution of this imaging methodology can bring to a new clinical tool designed for human investigationandis a major challenge that can be tackled by ad hocengineered contrast agents. To this aiman optimized selection of advanced hybrid platforms is needed. Graphene derivatives, mainly graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO),exhibiting depleted properties with respect to pristine graphene, but chemically more versatile, have beenhighlighted in the recent literature. These forms derive from the chemical modifications of the 2 D structure of graphene in very harsh conditions, which introduce kinks and irregularities in the carbonic material. Such modifications make GO and RGO more reactive and more processable than pristine graphene, but jeopardize the electrical, optical and mechanical properties of this material. Despite this fact, we have not found a study thatreports theincorporation of pristine graphene into biomedical devicesstarting from its suspended form in aqueous media. The challenge herein was to preserve the graphene original properties which are important for the applications we address;and find the intermediate key to adequately tether graphene on our studied <b>poly(vinylalcohol)</b> composites. For this, Prof. Paradossi’s group strong background about <b>poly(vinylalcohol)</b> hydrogels and microbubbles was a great advantage. The first chapter of the thesis is a brief general introduction about graphene and <b>poly(vinylalcohol)</b> providing the necessary details of why these materials could be interesting candidates for our research, taking into accountthe main problems concerning the separate materials as well as their assembly and formulatinghypothesis regarding the efficiency and biocompatibilityof the hybrid systems. The second chapter is a proof of concept on the method allowing pristine graphene entrapment into a <b>poly(vinylalcohol)</b> hydrogel matrix with potential in drug release at physiological temperature by using thermosensitive moieties. The third chapter of this thesisis a general introduction to the photoacoustic imaging. It provides the basic theoretical foundation for understanding this method and the physical mechanisms related to photoacoustic generation in biological tissues. First, we describe light propagation mechanisms in tissues, and the deposition of heat via optical absorption. Assimilating the biological tissue to a liquid medium, wethen introduce the fundamental equations describing the photoacoustic issue, and the assumptions used in imaging to improve diagnosis. We also introduce ultrasound imaging and its inherent clinical approach for diagnostic and therapy. Finally, the contrast agents used in both ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging modalities are discussed through two important examples: microbubbles and NIR absorbing agents. The chapter IV details {{the state of the art}} in the context of the objectives we pursued during this thesis regarding hybrid contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging based pristine graphene and <b>poly(vinylalcohol)</b> microbubbles. Details on the microdevice fabrication as well as its physico-chemical characterization are provided. Finally, the potential of the graphene <b>poly(vinylalcohol)</b> microbubbles in enhancing the photoacoustic signal is assessed in vitro and in vivo. In the chapter V, we present a study on the influence of diamine intermediates and PEGylation used as links between graphene and the PVA microbubbles on the colloidal behavior, acoustic properties, and cytotoxicity of the overall system.
