40|$|A {{key driver}} of Australian sweetpotato {{productivity}} improvements and consumer demand has been industry adoption of disease-free planting material systems. On a farm isolated from main Australian sweetpotato areas, virus-free germplasm is annually multiplied, with subsequent 'pathogen-tested' (PT) sweetpotato roots shipped to commercial Australian sweetpotato growers. They in turn plant their PT roots into specially designated plant beds, commencing in late winter. From these beds, they cut sprouts {{as the basis}} for their commercial fields. Along with other intense agronomic practices, this system enables Australian producers to achieve worldRSQUOs highest commercial yields (per hectare) of premium sweetpotatoes. Their industry organisation, ASPG (Australian Sweetpotato Growers Inc.), has identified productivity of mother plant beds as a key driver of crop performance. Growers and scientists are currently collaborating to investigate issues such as catastrophic plant beds losses; optimisation of irrigation and nutrient addition; rapidity and uniformity of initial <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> harvests; optimal <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> harvest techniques; virus re-infection of plant beds; and practical longevity of plant beds. A survey of 50 sweetpotato growers in Queensland and New South Wales identified a substantial diversity in current <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> systems, apparently influenced by growing district, scale of operation, time of planting, and machinery/labour availability. Growers identified key areas for <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> research as: optimising the size and grading specifications of PT roots supplied for the plant beds; change in sprout density, vigour and performance through sequential cuttings of the plant bed; optimal height above ground level to cut sprouts to maximise commercial crop and <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> performance; and use of structures and soil amendments in <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> systems. Our ongoing multi-disciplinary research program integrates detailed agronomic experiments, grower adaptive learning sites, product quality and consumer research, to enhance industry capacity for inspired innovation and commercial, sustainable practice change...|$|E

40|$|Changes {{in plant}} and macroinvertebrate {{communities}} were found following replacement of extensive zones of floating-attached/submergent native vegetation within Fitzroy River backwaters {{by the major}} environmental weed Hymenachne amplexicaulis (Poaceae). Impacts of H. amplexicaulis on native littoral flora and fauna (macroinvertebrates and fish) were assessed by comparing three sites previously supporting native vegetation and now invaded by H. amplexicaulis with nearby stands of native backwater vegetation. Plant biomass of Hymenachne <b>plant</b> <b>beds</b> was thirty-fold greater than Native <b>plant</b> <b>beds</b> whereas <b>plant</b> species diversity (richness) was significantly less. Macroinvertebrate communities of Hymenachne beds were significantly lower in abundance of insect orders Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera and Odonata while Coleoptera were more abundant in Hymenachne beds. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of macroinvertebrate Family abundance and composition data showed that Hymenachne <b>plant</b> <b>beds</b> had a different assemblage to that in Native <b>plant</b> <b>beds.</b> In common with other studies of weed invasions, an increased abundance of some vertebrate fauna was observed (in this case an introduced fish species Xiphophorus maculatus comprised 75 % of fish captured in Hymenachne beds compared with 0 % in Native <b>plant</b> <b>beds).</b> Change in vegetation structure was implicated as an important factor influencing macroinvertebrate and fish faunal composition and with potential to impact on waterbird habitat values of wetlands. and decline in habitat value of Hymenachne-invaded wetlands are discusse...|$|R

40|$|Aquaponics {{is the use}} {{of water}} from a fish tank to provide {{nutrients}} to plants in a soil-less environment. The rocks cultivate the bacteria that turns the ammonia into nitrates that the plants need, and the <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> functions as a filter for the fish tank. In this study, with the guidance of Doctor Dudley Burton, Doctor Brook Murphy, we researched the optimal plant density for basil in an Aquaponics system. We attempted to control or measure all the other variables to consider, as to isolate the variable of distance between plants. The water flow was spread through the <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> through a manifold and placed on the opposite side as the bell syphon to attempt to evenly spread the nitrates, and plants were selected from 5 or 6 different plants and variously placed in the samples. Plastic sheeting was used to hold the distance between plants constant, and net pots were used to place the plants. A light meter was used to measure the light hitting the 4 corners of the <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> to account for that variable, {{and the size of the}} plants from the start was mixed within the samples. The preliminary results were, based on observation only, that basil plants at 8 cm and 12 cm apart would be too crowded to reach maximum growth. The best distance to space basil plants in an Aquaponic system would be 16 cm or 20 cm apart...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{quantitative}} data {{has previously been}} collected from plant megafossil assemblages from a Middle Jurassic (Aalenian) <b>plant</b> <b>bed</b> from Hasty Bank, North Yorkshire, UK. We conducted a similar analysis of palynological dispersed sporomorph (spore and pollen) assemblages collected from the same section using the same sampling regime: 67 sporomorph taxa were recorded from 50 samples taken at 10 cm intervals through the <b>plant</b> <b>bed.</b> Basic palynofacies analysis was also undertaken on each sample. Both dispersed sporomorph and plant megafossil assemblages display consistent changes in composition, diversity (richness), and abundance through time. However, the dispersed sporomorph and plant megafossil records provide conflicting evidence for the nature of parent vegetation. Specifically, conifers and ferns are underrepresented in plant megafossil assemblages, bryophytes and lycopsids are represented only in sporomorph assemblages, and sphenophytes, pteridosperms, Caytoniales, Cycadales, Ginkgoales and Bennettitales are comparatively underrepresented in sporomorph assemblages. Combined multivariate analysis (correspondence analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling) of sporomorph occurrence/abundance data demonstrates that temporal variation in sporomorph assemblages {{is the result of}} depositional change through the <b>plant</b> <b>bed.</b> The reproductive strategies of parent plants are considered to be a principal factor in shaping many of the major abundance and diversity irregularities between dispersed sporomorph and plant megafossil data sets that seemingly reflects different parent vegetation. Preferential occurrence/preservation of sporomorphs and equivalent parent plants is a consequence of a complex array of biological, ecological, geographical, taphonomic, and depositional factors that act inconsistently between and within fossil assemblages, which results in notable discrepancies between data sets. ...|$|E
