25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Ulster Unionist Party in the 2005 UK general election and Sinn Féin's continual abstention from Westminster, the SDLP was the second largest parliamentary grouping from Northern Ireland at Westminster. The SDLP saw this as a major opportunity to become the voice of Irish Nationalism in Westminster and to provide effective opposition to the much enlarged Democratic Unionist Party group. The SDLP was consequently <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> to the Westminster Parliament and working to strengthen its ties with the Parliamentary Labour Party, whose whip they informally accepted. The SDLP was a vocal opponent at Westminster of the proposal to extend detention without trial to 42 days and previously opposed measures to extend detention to 90 days and 28 days. SDLP MP and former leader Mark Durkan tabled an Early Day Motion on cluster munitions which gained cross-party support and was quickly followed by a decision by the UK government to support a ban.|$|E

500|$|African American Studies scholar James Smethurst {{was more}} critical, writing in The Boston Globe that [...] "this {{catalogue}} of the nadir {{is one of the}} book's weaknesses, since it sometimes departs from its account of peonage without much transition. <b>Paying</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> to the considerable presence of involuntary servitude in African-American literature and intellectual history, reaching back to Charles Chesnutt and Paul Laurence Dunbar, would have helped".

500|$|Washington lived {{an aristocratic}} lifestyle—fox hunting was a {{favorite}} leisure activity. He also enjoyed going to dances and parties, {{in addition to the}} theater, races, and cockfights. He also was known to play cards, backgammon, and billiards. Like most Virginia planters, he imported luxuries and other goods from England and paid for them by exporting his tobacco crop. [...] By 1764, these luxuries, coupled with a poor tobacco market, left Washington ₤1,800 in debt. He began to pull himself out of debt in the mid-1760s by diversifying his previously tobacco-centric business interests into other ventures and <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> to his affairs, especially in the form of buying fewer imported luxuries.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} January 1993, Zosky was {{expected}} to be the Toronto Blue Jays' starting shortstop for the 1993 regular season. However, later that month Zosky was shut down due to a muscle problem in his throwing elbow. To provide insurance in case Zosky floundered, the Toronto Blue Jays signed veteran free agent Dick Schofield, who had played for the California Angels and New York Mets the previous season. They also re-signed Alfredo Griffin and traded Kelly Gruber and cash to the California Angels for Luis Sojo, who would provide even further insurance in case Zosky failed. Though Zosky {{was expected to}} be the starting shortstop earlier in the year, by February Schofield was the leading contender for the position. Due to his struggles in 1992 – not only did he hit [...]231, he also committed 27 errors – and his injuries, the Blue Jays began looking beyond Zosky as the future starting shortstop for the team, <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> to their other prospect Alex Gonzalez.|$|E
500|$|When the USSR's {{economic}} growth stalled in the 1970s, {{the standard of}} living and housing quality improved significantly. Instead of <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> to the economy, the Soviet leadership under Brezhnev tried to improve the living standard in the Soviet Union by extending social benefits. This led to an increase, though a minor one, in public support. The standard of living in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) had fallen behind that of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR) and the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR) under Brezhnev; this led many Russians to believe that the policies of the Soviet Government were hurting the Russian population. The state usually moved workers from one job to another, which ultimately became an ineradicable feature in Soviet industry. Government industries such as factories, mines and offices were staffed by undisciplined personnel who put a great effort into not doing their jobs; this ultimately led, according to Robert Service, to a [...] "work-shy workforce". The Soviet Government had no effective counter-measure; it was extremely difficult, if not impossible to replace ineffective workers because of the country's lack of unemployment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} sleep {{medicine}} {{belongs to the}} second half of the 20th century. Due to the rapidly increasing knowledge about sleep, including the growth of the research field chronobiology from about 1960 and the discoveries of REM sleep (1952–53) and sleep apnea (first described in the medical literature in 1965), the medical importance of sleep was recognized. The medical community began <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> than previously to primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, as well as the role and quality of sleep in other conditions. By the 1970s in the US, and in many western nations within the two following decades, clinics and laboratories devoted to the study of sleep and the treatment of its disorders had been founded. Most sleep doctors were primarily concerned with apnea; some were experts in narcolepsy. There was as yet nothing to restrict the use of the title [...] "sleep doctor," [...] and a need for standards arose.|$|E

Still upset with Franz, Swanhilda shakes an ear of wheat to her head: if it rattles, then she will know that Franz loves her. Upon doing this, however, she hears nothing. When she shakes it by Franz's head, he also hears nothing; but then he tells her that it rattles. However, she does not believe him and runs away heartbroken.|$|E

Legal disputes delayed the official opening until 1742, and a barge loaded with coal from the Tyrone coalfields reached Dublin on 28 March 1742, although the first part or the journey had involved carriage of the coal overland to Lough Neagh, as the Tyrone Navigation, begun in 1732, was far from complete.
