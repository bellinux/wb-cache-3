50|$|Burlesque was {{released}} on Wednesday, November 24, 2010, the day before Thanksgiving in the United States; on its opening day, it came in third to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - <b>Part</b> 1 and <b>Tangled.</b> On Thursday, November 25, 2010, it dropped down to fourth place in the box office behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: <b>Part</b> 1, <b>Tangled</b> and Unstoppable {{and went down to}} fifth on Friday, November 26, 2010. On Sunday, November 28, 2010, it went back up to third place behind Tangled and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. It stayed in the top five until December 10, 2010, when it fell to sixth behind The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Tourist, Tangled, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Unstoppable. By the Christmas weekend, it was number 15 at the box office.|$|R

50|$|The Comte de Guiche {{appears in}} Alexandre Dumas's novels Twenty Years After and The Vicomte de Bragelonne, {{where he is}} portrayed as the closest friend of Raoul, son of the musketeer Athos. In the latter novel, he is {{included}} in the entourage of Prince Philippe, and takes a central <b>part</b> in the <b>tangled</b> web of romantic intrigues which engulf the court.|$|R
25|$|Double-tailed tent spiders build large nonsticky webs of two <b>parts</b> – a <b>tangle</b> web and a finely-meshed {{horizontal}} orb web. The {{females of}} the species are larger than the males and they may vary considerably in colour. They are easily distinguishable by their shape, the markings on their backs, {{and the way the}} females have the habit of guarding their eggs by splaying their bodies over them.|$|R
5000|$|Cardinal Lang {{was one of}} {{the chief}} ministers of Charles V; he played an {{important}} <b>part</b> in the <b>tangled</b> international negotiations of his time; and he was always loyal to his imperial masters. Not without reason has he been compared with Cardinal Wolsey. The writer and courtier Maximilianus Transylvanus, a secretary to Charles V, is often said to be a son of Lang's (see Maximilianus Transylvanus for this discussion). In any case, Transylvanus addressed his De Moluccis Insulis, the first published description of Magellan's voyage around the world, to Lang.|$|R
60|$|Twenty-four {{hours away}} from his silent hills, John looked out with puzzled eyes from his dusty seat among ropes and pulleys and leaning {{fragments}} of scenery. What he saw and heard seemed to him, for the most <b>part,</b> a meaningless <b>tangle</b> of gestures and phrases. The {{men and women in}} fashionable clothes, moving about before that gloomy space of empty auditorium, looked more like marionettes than creatures of flesh and blood, drawn this way and that at the bidding of the stout, masterly Frenchman, who was continually muttering exclamations and banging the manuscript upon his hand.|$|R
50|$|Of the top 50 {{grossing}} {{movies of}} the year, 55 nominations went to 15 films on the list. Only Toy Story 3 (1st), Inception (5th), How to Train Your Dragon (9th), True Grit (17th), The Social Network (29th), The Town (32nd), Black Swan (38th), and The Fighter (45th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, Best Picture or Animated Feature.

5000|$|The Tangle Lakes {{area has}} been the subject of {{extensive}} archaeological exploration. Prior to 1976, almost 150 sites had been discovered showing that The Tangle Lakes have been populated intermittently since the settlement of the New World. The sites are concentrated closely to the lakes in a range covering about 80 square kilometers and the attraction of the location was most likely that the windswept hills surrounding the lakes would have attracted caribou seeking to graze on the exposed lichen (not for fishing as the lakes would not have been able to support a settlement). [...] <b>Part</b> of the <b>Tangle</b> Lakes {{area has been}} listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an archaeological district in 1971.|$|R
30|$|The {{history of}} {{computational}} trust and trust management, though short (indeed, around 20 years), is exciting and sometimes <b>tangled.</b> <b>Part</b> {{of the problem}} is the close relationship trust has with security. Like any close relationship, it has its ups and downs and its fair share of misunderstandings, and we are just beginning to get to grips with the differences between trust and security, as well as their co-existence. Future observations both here, as part of a new JoTM blog, and one hopes in papers within the journal, will undoubtedly touch upon this fascinating area with much more grace than a simple editorial paragraph can do (the interested reader is however recommended to read Gollmann’s expositions on the topic (Gollmann [1, 2]) as a start.|$|R
50|$|The tornado {{maintained}} F3 intensity as {{it crossed}} the into {{the southern part}} of Kokomo. The tornado then continued in Kokomo, roughly following Lincoln St. At that point, it began to grow rapidly in width, and a second brief area of F4 damage was noted near South May Avenue, where several homes were leveled, and one was swept away from its foundation (this home was determined to have been nailed, rather than bolted to its foundation). A vehicle frame, engine block, and various other vehicle <b>parts</b> were found <b>tangled</b> within a grove of completely debarked trees in this area.As the tornado began to cross Greentown, a traffic jam had occurred for a stretch of several miles along Washington Avenue. The tornado weakened briefly to an F3 before re-intensifying to F4 intensity near Forman Drive, flattening several homes as it moved through mostly rural areas south of Southwest 31. As the tornado struck a Chrysler plant, the east and west sides of the wall were leveled.|$|R
50|$|Megamind {{opened to}} $12,530,397 on opening day, and earned $46,016,833 over the three-day weekend, taking the No. 1 spot and {{averaged}} $11,668 from around 7,300 screens at 3,944 theaters. The opening {{was a bit}} higher than How to Train Your Dragon, which earned $43.7 million back in March 2010. It was the fifth-highest opening for an animated feature in 2010. In its second weekend, it repeated at No. 1 and dropped 37% to $29,120,461 for a $7,374 average from 3,949 theaters, and bringing its 10-day cumulative total to $88,822,635. On its third weekend, it fell 45% to $16,012,831 and finished second to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1, averaging $4,237 from 3,779 theaters. Over Thanksgiving weekend, it held well with just a 22% drop to $12,575,778 and slid to third place behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - <b>Part</b> 1 and <b>Tangled</b> (it earned $17,304,307 over the five-day Thanksgiving period). Following Thanksgiving, the film fell a sharp 61% in its fifth weekend to $4,936,851 and finished in sixth place.|$|R
5000|$|Another passenger, Mr. Theo, {{calls for}} Poly's godfather, Canon Tallis, {{to come and}} investigate, but Tallis and Simon are both kidnapped by the local police chief upon arrival in Port of Dragons, Venezuela, and left {{stranded}} in the jungle. Miss Leonis also arrives, having learned before the murder that the check paying for the portrait was worthless. She has also just read Quentin Phair's letters and journals, thus learning belatedly that Simon's heroic ancestor left behind a wife and son among the Quiztano Indians of Dragonlake in Venezuela. Phair also started the [...] "Caring Places", two large buildings in which Quiztano healers, some of them with medical degrees, help the sick and the dying. The connection between Quentin Phair and Umara of the Quiztanos is the underlying cause of Simon's current predicament, <b>part</b> of a <b>tangled</b> web of murder, smuggling, blackmail and a generations-old grudge. Alejandro Hurtado, a friend of Tallis, initially arrests Jan, a Dutch sailor with Quiztano blood, but the ship's first mate, Lyolf Boon, soon confesses to Phair's murder.|$|R
40|$|A nuclear capture {{reaction}} {{of a single}} neutron by ultra-cold superfluid ^ 3 He results in a rapid overheating followed by the expansion and subsequent cooling of the hot subregion, in a certain analogy with the Big Bang of the early Universe. It was shown in a Grenoble experiment that {{a significant part of}} the energy released during the nuclear reaction was not converted into heat even after several seconds. It was thought that the missing energy was stored in a tangle of quantized vortex lines. This explanation, however, contradicts the expected lifetime of a bulk vortex tangle, 10 ^- 5 - 10 ^- 4 s, which is much shorter than the observed time delay of seconds. In this Letter we propose a scenario that resolves the contradiction: the vortex tangle, created by the hot spot, emits isolated vortex loops that take with them a significant <b>part</b> of the <b>tangle's</b> energy. These loops quickly reach the container walls. The dilute ensemble of vortex loops attached to the walls can survive for a long time, while the remaining bulk vortex tangle decays quickly.

60|$|The words {{returned}} on him, {{and with}} them what his father had said, 'You have had a thread running through your life.' He {{was in a state}} between sleeping and waking, when the confines of reflection and dreaming came very near together, and when vague impressions, hardly noticed at the time they were made, began to tell on him without his own conscious volition. It was to him as if from that brightening eastern heaven, multitudes of threads of light were floating hither and thither, as he had often watched the gossamer undulating in the sunshine. Some were firm, purely white, and glistening here and there with rainbow tints as they tended straight upwards, shining more and more into the perfect day; but for the most <b>part</b> they were <b>tangled</b> together in inextricable confusion, intermingled with many a broken end, like fleeces of cobweb driven together by the autumn wind,--some sailing aimlessly, or with shattered tangled strands-some white, some dark, some anchored to mere leaves or sprays, some tending down to the abyss, but all in such a perplexed maze that the eye could seldom trace which were directed up, which downwards, which were of pure texture, which defiled and stained.|$|R
60|$|After well {{wringing}} out our {{wet clothes}} {{and putting them}} on, we again proceeded along a similar narrow forest track as before, choked with rotten leaves and dead trees, and in the more open <b>parts</b> overgrown with <b>tangled</b> vegetation. Another hour brought us to a smaller stream flowing in a wide gravelly bed, up which our road lay. Here w e stayed {{half an hour to}} breakfast, and then went on, continually crossing the stream, or walking on its stony and gravelly banks, till about noon, when it became rocky and enclosed by low hills. A little further we entered a regular mountain-gorge, and had to clamber over rocks, and every moment cross and recross the water, or take short cuts through the forest. This was fatiguing work; and about three in the afternoon, the sky being overcast, and thunder in the mountains indicating an approaching storm, we had to loon out for a camping place, and soon after reached one of Mr. Rosenberg's old ones. The skeleton of his little sleeping-hut remained, and my men cut leaves and made a hasty roof just as the rain commenced. The baggage was covered over with leaves, and the men sheltered themselves as they could till the storm was over, by which time a flood came down the river, which effectually stopped our further march, even had we wished to proceed. We then lighted fires; I made some coffee, and my men roasted their fish and plantains, and {{as soon as it was}} dark, we made ourselves comfortable for the night.|$|R
40|$|The Very Large Array {{has been}} used at five {{frequencies}} to study the structure and linear polarization of SS 433 on scales as small as ~ 0. 1 " ~ 500 AU. Each jet consists of a sharp, curving ridge-line at the leading edge, plus significant trailing off-jet emission, showing that they are enveloped by diffuse relativistic plasma. No kinematic model with constant jet speed fits our images on all scales, but they are consistent with variations in jet speed of around 10 % around the optical value. Our images show continuous jets with bright components occurring simultaneously in the two jets roughly every 35 days. When corrected for projection effects and Doppler boosting, the intensities of the two jets are intrinsically very similar. Fractional linear polarization up to 20 % is present along the ridge-lines, while the core is essentially unpolarized. The rotation measures are consistent with a foreground screen with RM ~ + 110 radians per meter squared, plus a larger, asymmetrical contribution close to the core. The apparent magnetic fields in the jets are roughly aligned with the ridge-lines in most {{but not all of}} each jet. The jet is more highly polarized between the components than in the components themselves, suggesting that the mechanism that creates them compresses a <b>tangled</b> <b>part</b> of the magnetic field into a partially-ordered transverse layer. The off-jet emission is remarkably highly polarized, with m ~ 50 % in places, suggesting large-scale order of the magnetic field surrounding the jets. This polarized signal may confuse the determination of magnetic field orientations in the jets themselves. However, the images are consistent with a jet magnetic field that is everywhere parallel to the helices. Comment: To appear in Ap. J. (27 pages, 12 figures...|$|R
50|$|The tornado {{maintained}} EF3 intensity as {{it crossed}} the Canadian River into Cleveland County, and a decommissioned U.S. 62/U.S. 277 bridge was severely damaged; this bridge {{had to be}} demolished after the tornado ripped part of it from its mount and tossed it across Interstate 44. The tornado then continued directly toward south Oklahoma City and Moore, roughly following Southwest 149th Street. At that point, it began to grow rapidly in width, and a second brief area of EF4 damage was noted near South May Avenue, where several homes were leveled, and one was swept away from its foundation (this home was determined to have been nailed, rather than bolted to its foundation). A vehicle frame, engine block, and various other vehicle <b>parts</b> were found <b>tangled</b> within a grove of completely debarked trees in this area. As the tornado began to cross into south Oklahoma City, a traffic jam had occurred for a stretch of several miles along Santa Fe Avenue, as residents attempted to either escape from or pick up their children at schools located near the tornado's path. As the station's news helicopter was capturing live video of the tornado, then-KWTV chief meteorologist Gary England − upon seeing footage of the backup that was being relayed by pilot Jim Gardner − urged drivers caught in the jam {{that may have been}} listening to the station's audio simulcast on area radio outlets to use nearby streets to detour out of the tornado's expected track. The tornado weakened briefly to an EF3 before re-intensifying to EF4 intensity near Forman Drive, flattening several homes as it moved through mostly rural areas south of Southwest 149th Street. As the tornado struck an oil production site, four oil tanks were blown away, one of which was never found. The others were thrown considerable distances, one of which was found a mile away.|$|R
