It is unknown whether patients with Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> can utilise an attentional strategy, and what effect this strategy {{would have on the}} premovement cortical activity. Movement-related potentials were recorded from 12 Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients and controls performing externally cued finger tapping movement, allowing an examination of cortical activity related to movement performance and bradykinesia in this disease. All subjects were tested in two conditions, which differed only by {{the presence or absence of}} the cognitive strategy.

40|$|Purpose of review: To {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} between androgens, cognition and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Recent findings: It {{has been found that}} low circulating levels of androgens are a risk factor for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Decreased circulating androgens are also associated with declining cognitive performance, particularly in memory-related tasks. Conversely, androgen supplementation to hypogonadal men results in improved memory performance. It has therefore been hypothesized that androgen supplementation may be beneficial in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In recent studies, animal models have been used to elucidate the molecular mechanism behind this relationship between androgens and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> These studies have shown that androgen depletion results in increased levels of beta amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, changes which are thought to be associated with subsequent neuronal death.

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, {{suggesting that the}} striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the “off” state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “on” state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> when in the “off” state.

Eighteen participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> who had undergone surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) completed a lexical decision task at short and long stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), during on and off stimulation conditions. Nineteen non-neurologically impaired participants acted as controls. The results indicated that automatic lexical-semantic {{and emotional}} evaluative processes are unimpaired in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> as reflected in the presence of comparable semantic and affective priming effects at the short SOA in on and off stimulation conditions compared with healthy controls. In contrast, participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the off stimulation condition showed a pattern of aberrant controlled lexical-semantic processing as evidenced by a lack of semantic priming effects at the long SOA condition. Controlled semantic priming was present, however, when the participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> were receiving stimulation of the STN, suggesting that STN stimulation modulates basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits involved in such processes.

Although much is known about the molecular events leading to the formation of plaques and tangles as well as their relevance in neuronal cell loss associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> the link between these two pathologies is presently unknown. The exact mechanism of neuronal cell death in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain has been a debated issue with both the necrosis and apoptosis pathways having been implicated. The activation of apoptosis in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain has recently gained momentum, namely because of the development of specific markers for caspase activation. These markers consist of antibodies, termed caspase-cleavage site-directed antibodies that are designed to detect either the active enzymatic fragments of caspases following their activation or protein products targeted for caspase cleavage. The use of these markers has demonstrated the widespread activation of caspases in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain. In addition, many of these markers have been co-localized with markers for neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting that caspases {{may play a role in}} the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and, thus, do not simply represent end-stage events associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In this review, recent studies documenting the role of caspases in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain will be discussed, along with the methodology behind the synthesis of site-directed caspase-cleavage antibodies.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} selenium, which is mainly conferred by its incorporation into dedicated selenoproteins, {{has been suggested}} as a possible neuroprotective approach for mitigating neuronal loss in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> However, there is inconsistent information with respect to selenium levels in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain. We examined the concentration and cellular compartmentalization of selenium in the temporal cortex of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and control brain tissue. We found that Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with decreased selenium concentration in both soluble (i. e., cytosolic) and insoluble (i. e., plaques and tangles) fractions of brain homogenates. The presence of the APOE ϵ 4 allele correlated with lower total selenium levels in the temporal cortex and a higher concentration of soluble selenium. Additionally, we found that age significantly contributed to lower selenium concentrations in the peripheral membrane-bound and vesicular fractions. Our findings suggest a relevant interaction between APOE ϵ 4 and selenium delivery into brain, and show changes in cellular selenium distribution in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{instruments}} are currently used to diagnose Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease.</b> These instruments however, do not adequately assess behavioral changes of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> patients. These shortcomings limit {{the ability to}} assess the behaviors faced by the caregivers of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> patients on a daily basis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to provide evidence to support the validity of the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> Behavior Scale - Nursing Home (ADBS-NH), a behavior based caregiver report designed to be sensitive and specific to Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease.</b> ^ Content validity was performed using a convenience panel of experts in geriatric psychiatry. Thirty persons were then recruited for each of the following known five groups: depressed, vascular dementia, mild Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease,</b> moderate to severe Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease,</b> and normal controls. The group assignments were determined by the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental State Examination and Hachinski scores. ^ It was then determined that the most appropriate cutoff score was 25 for this sample as this maximized the sensitivity and specificity. The study then analyzed the construct validity using oblique rotated factor analysis. The results deviated significantly from the expected dimensions that were agreed upon by the content experts. The derived factors named were based upon the items that loaded into each dimension. The dimension names were created using a common language, to make it user friendly to both health care professionals and non-professionals. ^ The concurrent validity of the ADBS-NH was then evaluated and found to be satisfactory. Convergent and discriminate validity was then analyzed. The ADBS-NH correlated poorly with the Hachinski Ischemic Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale in all groups. It correlated well with the MMSE in both Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> groups. These correlations prove that the ADBS-NH did not measure the same dimensions that the Hachinski Ischemic Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale measured. The ADBS-NH did correlate well with the MMSE in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> groups, which was expected, as both instruments measured the cognitive deficits of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease.</b> Internal consistency reliability was assessed using Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s Alpha, which was acceptable at. 86. Two week stability reliability was evaluated and found to possess a satisfactory stability at. 98. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Tumour {{necrosis}} factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) {{plays an}} important role in the pathology of Crohn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Infliximab, a chimeric antibody against TNF-alpha, has been shown in controlled clinical trials to be effective in two-thirds of patients with refractory or fistulating Crohn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> The factors that determine a clinical response in some patients but not others are unknown. Aims: To document the early Australian experience with infliximab treatment for Crohn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and to identify factors that may determine a beneficial clinical response. Methods: Gastroenterologists known to have used infliximab for Crohn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> according to a compassionate use protocol were asked to complete a spreadsheet that included demographic information, Crohn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> site, severity, other medical or surgical treatments and a global clinical assessment of Crohn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> outcome, judged by participating physicians as complete and sustained (remission for the duration of the study), complete but unsustained (remission at 4 weeks but not for the whole study) or partial clinical improvement (sustained or unsustained). Results: Fifty-seven patients were able to be evaluated, with a median follow-up time of 16. 4 (4 - 70) weeks, including 23 patients with fistulae. There were 21 adverse events, including four serious events. Fifty-one patients (89...|$|R
40|$|Cortical {{activity}} {{associated with}} voluntary movement is shifted from medial to lateral premotor areas in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> This occurs bilaterally, even for unilateral movements. We have used both EEG and MEG to further investigate medial and lateral premotor activity {{in patients with}} hemi-Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> in whom basal ganglia impairment is most pronounced in one hemisphere. The CNV, recorded from 21 scalp positions in a Go/NoGo task, was maximal over central medial regions in control subjects. For hemi-Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> subjects, activity was shifted more frontally, reduced in the midline and lateralised towards the side of greatest basal ganglia impairment. With 143 channel whole-scalp magneto encephalography (MEG) we are further examining asymmetries in supplementary motor/premotor cortical activity prior to self-paced voluntary movement. In preliminary results, one hemi-Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patient with predominantly left-side symptoms showed strong medial activity consistent with a dominant source in the left supplementary motor area (SMA). Three patients showed little medial activity, but early bilateral sources within lateral premotor cortex. Results suggest greater involvement of lateral premotor rather than the SMA prior to movement in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and provide evidence for asymmetric function of the SMA in hemi- Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> with reduced activity {{on the side of}} greatest basal ganglia deficit...|$|R
