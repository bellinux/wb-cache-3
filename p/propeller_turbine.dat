"In {{the field}} of {{intercity}} transports employing the <b>propeller</b> <b>turbine,</b> the Vickers Viscount Model 700 appears to be considerably superior to anything else in its class. hasexceptionally fine flying qualities and is a most comfortable vehicle in which to travel." [...] John Watkins, Chief Technical Officer of Trans Australia Airlines. All production Viscounts were powered by the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine; from its initial 800 hp, and then 1,000 hp and higher, Rolls-Royce extensively developed the Dart engine, due to its popularity and use on the Viscount and several later aircraft. One key model was the Dart 506 engine, which had far greater fuel efficiency than earlier models; this enabled the airlines to deploy their Viscounts onto longer routes and to carry a greater maximum weight. Coupled with the availability of increasingly powerful engines, Vickers continued to develop and modify the Viscount's design. Later models could carry increasing numbers of passengers and had fewer load limitations.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to improve}} the {{understanding}} of the flow in the runner of a hydraulic <b>propeller</b> <b>turbine.</b> The focus is put on the leakage flow (q) and the tip vortex occurring at the clearance between the runner blades and the shroud. The influence of the tip clearance size on the runner flow is analyzed to provide an insight into the importance of this parameter for <b>propeller</b> <b>turbine</b> performance. Three blade tip gaps (τ=h/D) have been simulated with an eddy-viscosity model: τ= 0. 0, τ= 0. 0009 and τ= 0. 0013, being h the gap size and D the diameter of the turbine at the runner. A Q-criterion approach is used to identify the vortex core at the suction side of the blade. It is found that a smaller gap represents a less important loss in the runner and a larger gap presents more risk of cavitation in the suction side of the blades. Velocity profiles highlight that the gap has an influence on the velocity field at the draft tube inlet. 1...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{interest}} in the air bus conception of air travel {{is reflected in the}} aircraft chosen for study by the students in the Department of Aircraft Design during the 1963 and 1965 academic years. The first study was based upon the use of four <b>propeller</b> <b>turbine</b> engines to power an aircraft capable of carrying up to 40, 000 lb. of payload over short stage lengths.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simplified <b>propeller</b> <b>turbine</b> unit to produce power in a low head micro hydroelectric power installation. To be appropriate for remote areas and developing countries, a micro hydro system needs to be simple in design. There are good turbine designs for medium to high heads but traditional designs for heads under about 10 m, ie, the crossflow turbine and waterwheel, are slow running, requiring substantial speed increase to drive an AC generator. Propeller turbines have a higher running speed but are normally too complicated for micro hydro installations. In this thesis a suitable <b>propeller</b> <b>turbine</b> was developed. The effect of flat blades and optimum turbine blade and guide vane angles has been determined, as has the effect of various cones attached to the downstream end of the hub. The large hub diameter is an important compromise. A prototype turbine for installation on a New Zealand farm was developed from model tests. The turbine has a hub diameter to blade tip diameter ratio of 0. 66 and 8 flat blades set at 30 ° to tangential (60 ° from axial). The best efficiency of the model turbine was 62 %, with an efficiency of 57 % at the best power point. Using scaling laws it is predicted that the prototype, with a blade tip diameter of 0. 410 m, will produce 6. 0 kW at 612 RPM from a head of 2. 7 m and a flow rate of 0. 41 m³/s. This gives 4. 3 kW output from the 50 Hz 2 -pole generator. This prediction is for no cone fitted on the downstream end of the hub, but model tests indicate that the power could be improved by about 5 % {{with the addition of a}} straight sided cone on the hub...|$|E

The first one was a Pelton turbine which is suitable for high heads and low flow rates. The second one was a <b>propeller</b> <b>turbine</b> used for low heads and high flow rates. Several turbine geometries and nozzle diameters were tested for the Pelton system. For the propeller, a three-bladed turbine was tested for different heads and draft tubes.

A small three-phase generator was developed for coupling with the turbines in order to evaluate the generated electric power. Selected turbines were used to test battery charging with hydroelectric systems and a comparison between several efficiencies of the systems was made.

40|$|During the {{operation}} of a hydro turbine the fluid mechanical pressure loading on the turbine blades provides the driving torque on the turbine shaft. This fluid loading results in a structural load on the component which in turn causes the turbine blade to deflect. Classically, these mechanical stresses and deflections are calculated by means of finite element analysis (FEA) which applies the pressure distribution on the blade surface calculated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a major boundary condition. Such an approach {{can be seen as}} a one-way coupled simulation of the fluid structure interaction (FSI) problem. In this analysis the reverse influence of the deformation on the fluid is generally neglected. Especially in axial machines the blade deformation can result in a significant impact on the turbine performance. The present paper analyzes this influence by means of fully two-way coupled FSI simulations of a <b>propeller</b> <b>turbine</b> utilizing two different approaches. The configuration has been simulated by coupling the two commercial solvers ANSYS CFX for the fluid mechanical simulation with ANSYS Classic for the structure mechanical simulation.
