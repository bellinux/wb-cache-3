5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a <b>profit-making</b> enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} created to {{experiment}} with {{a new type of}} 3D film technology pioneered by producer Steve Schklair. After considering shooting American football games in 3D, Schklair's company 3ality Digital decided to create a concert film with U2. The band were hesitant to participate, but agreed to the project mainly as a technological experiment rather than a <b>profit-making</b> venture. Although set in Buenos Aires, U2 3D was shot at seven concerts across Latin America, and two in Australia. The film's complex setup involved shooting with up to 183D cameras simultaneously and capturing the footage digitally.|$|E
5|$|Since 1972, BGH {{provides}} {{ground-handling services}} for all airports in Bangladesh; {{the company reported}} a profit of BDT4.5billion for the FY 2011–12. The wholly owned subsidiary BFCC {{was set up in}} 1989 to provide in-flight meals. It is one of Biman's profitable operations, supplying food to Saudia, Etihad, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, Emirates, Dragon Air, China Southern Airlines and Regent Airways, along with casual orders from other airlines operating into Bangladesh. The BFCC consumes 90% of the eggs and chickens from the BPC, another <b>profit-making</b> subsidiary of Biman formed in 1976 and put into operation in November 1980 to rear poultry at farms in Dhaka. Bird flu was detected at one of the farms in March 2007, and many of the birds were culled. This was the first incident of bird flu in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Only {{weeks after}} the Darlington affair, the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declared}} the act creating the dispensary system {{in violation of the}} state constitution {{on the grounds that the}} government had no right to run a <b>profit-making</b> business. The vote was 2–1, with Justice Samuel McGowan in the majority. McGowan was a lame duck in office; Lieutenant Governor Gary had been elected to fill his seat effective August 1, 1894. Tillman closed the dispensaries temporarily, resulting in prohibition in South Carolina, and fired the constables. He had taken the precaution, once the court agreed to take the dispensary case, of having the 1893 legislature pass a revised dispensary law. When Gary took the bench, the Tillmanites would have a majority on the state Supreme Court, and Tillman instructed trial justices not to hear challenges to the 1893 law until after August 1. Tillman kept the law suspended until then, afterwards reopening the dispensaries under that statute. The high court declared the 1893 act constitutional on October 8, 1894, 2–1, with Gary voting in the majority.|$|E
5|$|Sivaji, an Indian {{software}} architect, {{returns to}} India from the United States. He aims {{to establish a}} non-profit trust called Sivaji Foundation, which includes a network of hospitals and educational institutions that serve the poor free of charge. An influential businessman, Adiseshan, sees Sivaji as his competitor because he runs <b>profit-making</b> educational institutions and hospitals. Sivaji is forced to bribe the corrupt civil service, but eventually, the bribes demanded become so high {{that he has to}} mortgage his house and sell his car to pay them. When Sivaji goes to court, he loses the case filed against him by Adiseshan regarding the methods Sivaji had used to open his foundation as a result of bribing numerous government officials. Simultaneously, Sivaji {{falls in love with a}} girl named Tamizhselvi. However, upon asking for his horoscope, an astrologer warns that their union will result in Sivaji's death. When Tamizhselvi refuses the proposal due to her concern for Sivaji, he calms her fears and convinces her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|The {{match against}} England was causing the Natives' players and {{management}} problems {{before it had}} even begun. The team manager, Scott, was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played– the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at Blackheath's ground, but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval, where a larger crowd, and therefore higher gate receipts, could be secured. The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the <b>profit-making</b> motives of the Natives, and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue. The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home Unions over {{the formation of the}} International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). Following a disputed try in an England–Scotland international match in 1888, the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game, but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote, arguing that they deserved this as they were, they asserted, the senior body, and had the most member clubs. Ireland, Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891, when, following arbitration, the RFU relented and joined the IRFB. The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the Natives on 16 February 1889.|$|E

25|$|IR earns about 70% of its {{revenues}} from freight traffic (₹686.2 billion from freight and ₹304.6 billion from passengers in 2011–12). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this {{makes up for}} losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the <b>profit-making</b> freight traffic.|$|E
25|$|In late 1991, McDonnell Douglas {{made a move}} to {{separate}} its civil and military divisions {{in a bid to}} raise the estimated $4 billion development costs needed to develop the MD-12X trijet. Separating the costly military C-17 airlifter development, which had been a drain on the company's resources, from the <b>profit-making</b> production of the MD-80 and MD-11 airliners would make it easier to attract foreign investors for the MD-12X.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the primary}} {{sponsors}} {{are part of}} the breast cancer industry, particularly cancer drug makers like AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Novartis. Because the national breast cancer organizations are dependent on corporate sponsorships for survival, this situation may represent a conflict of interest that prevents these organizations from representing the needs of current and future people with breast cancer when those needs conflict with the <b>profit-making</b> motives of the corporate sponsors.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} a {{commercial}} organ trade is linked to economic reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s that saw a steep decline in government funding to the healthcare system. Healthcare moved toward a more market-driven model, and hospitals devised new ways to grow their revenue. This pattern also applies to military hospitals; since the mid-1980s, the People’s Liberation Army has engaged in commercial and <b>profit-making</b> ventures to supplement its budget.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{its release}} in July 1969, Blind Faith topped both the UK chart and Billboard's chart for Pop Album in the U.S., and peaked at No.40 on the Black Albums chart – an {{impressive}} feat for a British rock quartet. The album {{sold more than}} half million copies {{in the first month}} of its release and was a huge <b>profit-making</b> device for both Atlantic Records (on their Atco label in the US) and for Clapton and Baker (Blind Faith sales were helping to stimulate demand for Cream albums, also distributed by Atco).|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} {{cost of the}} Dubai Metro {{project has}} shot up by about 80 per cent from the original AED 15.5 billion/US$4.2 billion to AED 28 billion/US$7.8 billion. The authorities contradicted this, saying {{that the cost of}} the project did not overshoot. They attributed the increase in expenditure to the major changes in the scope and design of the project. The authorities also expect to generate AED 18 billion/US$4.9 billion in income over the next 10 years; but they speculate that the Metro would not be a <b>profit-making</b> enterprise, since the fares would be subsidised.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} war came to an end, it seemed highly likely that {{cooperation}} between the Western powers and the USSR would give way to intense rivalry or conflict. This was due primarily to the starkly contrasting economic ideologies of the two superpowers, now quite easily the strongest in the world. Whereas the USA was a liberal, two-party democracy with an advanced capitalist economy, based on free enterprise and <b>profit-making,</b> the USSR was a one-party Marxist–Leninist State with a state-controlled economy where private wealth was all but outlawed.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure of}} Lambton's project {{came to the}} {{attention}} of 30-year-old aspiring politician Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who was serving three years in jail for abducting a 15-year-old heiress. Wakefield, who had grown up in a family with roots in philanthropy and social reform, also showed an interest in proposals by Robert Wilmot-Horton, Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies for state-assisted emigration programmes that would help British paupers escape poverty by moving to any of Britain's colonies. In 1829 Wakefield began publishing pamphlets and writing newspaper articles that were reprinted in a book, promoting the concept of systematic emigration to Australasia through a commercial <b>profit-making</b> enterprise.|$|E
25|$|Third, Stevens {{argued that}} the majority's {{decision}} failed to recognize {{the dangers of the}} corporate form. Austin held that the prevention of corruption, including the distorting influence of a dominant funding source, was a sufficient reason for regulating corporate independent expenditures. In defending Austin, Stevens {{argued that the}} unique qualities of corporations and other artificial legal entities made them dangerous to democratic elections. These legal entities, he argued, have perpetual life, the ability to amass large sums of money, limited liability, no ability to vote, no morality, no purpose outside <b>profit-making,</b> and no loyalty. Therefore, he argued, the courts should permit legislatures to regulate corporate participation in the political process.|$|E
25|$|The first {{warrant for}} {{property}} in the Picture Rocks area was issued by the Province of Pennsylvania to Henry Rody on June 3, 1773. The land was used very little and passed through several hands until 1848 when it was sold to A. R. Sprout and Amos Burrows, {{who went on to}} become the founding fathers of Picture Rocks. Sprout and Burrows worked to cleared the land that was thought to be worthless of the rocks, logs and brush that covered it. They also rebuilt an abandoned sawmill and established a factory that manufactured sashes, doors, and window blinds. This factory, the first of its kind in the area, caused a stir among the local carpenters who believed that the readymade building materials would curtail their <b>profit-making</b> ability.|$|E
25|$|Domestication of moose was {{investigated}} in the Soviet Union before World War II. Early experiments were inconclusive, but {{with the creation of}} an moose-farm at Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve in 1949 a small-scale moose domestication program was started, involving attempts at selective breeding of animals {{on the basis of their}} behavioural characteristics. Since 1963, the program has continued at Kostroma Moose Farm, which had a herd of 33 tame moose as of 2003. Although at this stage the farm is not expected to be a <b>profit-making</b> enterprise, it obtains some income from the sale of moose milk and from visiting tourist groups. Its main value, however, is seen in the opportunities it offers for the research in the physiology and behavior of the moose, as well as in the insights it provides into the general principles of animal domestication.|$|E
25|$|Lockheed also {{planned a}} {{civilian}} {{version of the}} C-5 Galaxy, the L-500, the company designation also used for the C-5 itself. Both passenger and cargo versions of the L-500 were designed. The all-passenger version {{would have been able}} to carry up to 1,000 travelers, while the all-cargo version was predicted to be able to carry typical C-5 volume for as little as 2 cents per ton-mile (in 1967 dollars). Although some interest was expressed by carriers, no orders were placed for either L-500 version, due to operational costs caused by low fuel efficiency, a significant concern for a <b>profit-making</b> carrier, even before the oil crisis of the 1970s, keen competition from Boeing's 747, and high costs incurred by Lockheed in developing the C-5 and later, the L-1011 which led to the governmental rescue of the company.|$|E
25|$|The founders' {{financial}} and legal structure, {{adapted from the}} model developed for garden cemeteries in the America by City solicitor George Collison, aimed to establish a joint stock corporation managed by trustees. The trustees would be appointed by the members (those buying plots). Under the trust deed, the founders sought to preserve the park in perpetuity. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, {{but this was not}} evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model {{and the way in which}} plots were seemingly sold as freehold land, the legal arrangements were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial <b>profit-making</b> company and taxed accordingly.|$|E
25|$|State {{intervention}} in marketing peasant produce was justified in colonial times as protecting farmers against commodity price fluctuations. However, in ADMARC, development and <b>profit-making</b> were given priority of over price stabilization. At first, ADMARC accumulated substantial profits and re-invested {{them in a}} range of private companies and statutory corporations. Compared to those its neighbours Tanzania, Zambia, and later Mozambique and Zimbabwe, Malawi’s parastatal bodies were less bureaucratic and aimed to be business-like and profitable. In particular, its ADMARC was considered efficient until 1980. With an economic decline {{at the start of the}} 1980s, the flaws in its strategy became apparent. Profit accumulation had reduced the economic well-being of the peasant producers. The main beneficiaries of this strategy were the political elite who controlled organisations sponsored by ADMARC, the urban population obtaining subsidised food and the employees of ADMARC and other state bodies. Transferring resources away from smallholders to the state led to corruption and abuse of office. In 1977, a long serving ADMARC chairman was convicted for misusing corporation property in his private businesses and of making large unauthorised loans to a private company in which he and family were involved. Corruption and general inefficiency in statutory corporations including ADMARC resulted in a 1980 law limiting their holding office for a renewable two year period. This was not followed by any change in ADMARC's business activities or its conflicting roles as a marketing organization and provider of development finance.|$|E

[...] Cradock wrote to Endecott in early 1629, warning him about the issue, suggesting that he settle colonists in the claimed area and also that he treat well the Old Planters (the surviving colonists from the failed Dorchester Company settlement).

500|$|The {{fact that}} Scientologists {{have to pay}} large fees for {{auditing}} and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history, with governments classing it as a <b>profit-making</b> enterprise {{rather than as a}} religion. Critics maintain that Scientology is [...] "a business-driven, psychologically manipulative, totalitarian ideology with world-dominating aspirations", and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses. Scientology has fought innumerable lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion. These efforts have been partly successful– Scientology has gained recognition as a tax-exempt religious group in a number of countries, most notably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993, and in 2007 won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights, which censured Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion.|$|E

[...] Their migration to the New World in 1620 aboard the Mayflower was funded by the Merchant Adventurers, who sent additional settlers to engage in <b>profit-making</b> activities in the colony. [...] The settlers had intended to establish a colony near the mouth of the Hudson River, within the bounds of the London Virginia Company's territory, but conditions on the crossing led them to establish it instead on the shores of Cape Cod Bay at what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts. [...] The colonists eventually acquired a land grant from the Plymouth Council for New England in 1621, but its early governance took place {{under the terms of the}} Mayflower Compact, a document drafted by the colonists aboard the Mayflower before they landed. [...] In 1630 the colony acquired a formal charter with authority to govern from the Plymouth Council, but it was unsuccessful in attempts to acquire a royal charter that would guarantee its territory against other claimants.|$|E
500|$|German public {{discourse}} does not regard Scientology as a religion, but generally characterizes it as a Sekte (cult or sect), {{or as an}} exploitative <b>profit-making</b> venture preying on vulnerable minds. Public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults {{date back to the}} early 1970s, when widespread debate took place about [...] "youth religions" [...] such as the Unification Church, ISKCON, Children of God, and the Divine Light Mission. The most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the [...] "sect commissioners" [...] (Sektenbeauftragte) of Germany's Protestant Churches, who also actively promoted the establishment of private [...] "initiatives of parents and concerned persons". Aktion Bildungsinformation ("Educational Information Campaign") became an important organization dedicated to opposing Scientology; taking an activist stance, it warned people not to get involved with Scientology, filed successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its proselytizing in public places, and published an influential book, The Sect of Scientology and its Front Organizations. In 1981, the organization's founder, Ingo Heinemann, became the director of Aktion für geistige und psychische Freiheit ("Campaign for Intellectual and Psychic Freedom"), Germany's most prominent anti-cult organization. Warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation; as the movements were not doing anything illegal, the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious sects, the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979.|$|E
500|$|The Herald Tribune began {{a decline}} shortly after World War II that had several causes. [...] The Reid family was long {{accustomed}} to resolve shortfalls {{at the newspaper}} with subsidies from their fortune, rather than improved business practices, seeing the paper [...] "as a hereditary possession to be sustained as a public duty rather than developed as a <b>profit-making</b> opportunity". [...] With its generally marginal profitability, the Herald Tribune had few opportunities to reinvest in its operations as the Times did, and the Reids' mortgage on the newspaper {{made it difficult to}} raise outside cash for needed capital improvements. After another profitable year in 1946, Bill Robinson, the Herald Tribunes business manager, decided to reinvest the profits to make needed upgrades to the newspaper's pressroom. [...] The investment squeezed the paper's resources, and Robinson decided {{to make up the difference}} at the end of the year by raising the Tribunes price from three cents to a nickel, expecting the Times, which also needed to upgrade its facilities, to do the same. [...] However, the Times, concerned by the Tribunes performance during the war, refused to go along. [...] "We didn't want to give them any quarter," [...] Times circulation manager Nathan Goldstein said. [...] "Our numbers were on the rise, and we didn't want to do anything to jeopardize them. 'No free rides for the competition' was the way we looked at it." [...] The move proved disastrous: In 1947, the Tribunes daily circulation fell nine percent, from 348,626 to 319,867. [...] Its Sunday circulation fell four percent, from 708,754 to 680,691. [...] Although the overall percentage of advertising for the paper was higher than it was in 1947, the Times was still higher: 58 percent of the average space in the New York Times in 1947 was devoted to advertising, versus a little over 50 percent of the Tribune. [...] The Times would not raise its price until 1950.|$|E

[...] In 1955 he sold the copyright of his signature to Hulton for £7,250 (a portion {{of which was a}} loan). [...] 45% of his £5,000 per annum salary was paid to the taxman. [...] With only one other <b>profit-making</b> magazine (Farmers Weekly), Hulton sought to curb Eagles costs, complaining about the use of taxis, expensive stationery, electricity and telephone bills, restaurant bills, and staff expenses. [...] At their 1957 AGM Hulton's Chairman reported a fall in profits, from £298,000 to £36,000, blaming reduced revenue from another of their magazines, Picture Post, and increased production costs. [...] Several of Morris's friends later left the company, and following a short period of internal turmoil Morris gave up the editor's chair in 1959. [...] The following year Eagle was taken over by Odhams Press. [...] Hampson's studio (by then in Epsom) was disbanded, and following creative differences he retired from the comic. [...] His duties on Dan Dare were taken up by Frank Bellamy, described by Morris as [...] "a most fastidious artist and scrupulous draftsman, and like Hampson at his best, often consumed with anxiety." [...] With Keith Watson and Don Harley, the three worked from a studio in Fleet Street. [...] The front cover was redesigned, the Eagle name appearing {{across the top of the}} page rather than in one corner, coinciding with a new-look Dare. [...] Many readers found Bellamy's changes to Dare (made at the behest of Eagles publisher) objectionable. [...] Bellamy was succeeded by Harley, who in 1962 was followed by Watson, who had returned from a short stint working on Eagles rival, Lion. [...] Watson stopped drawing Dan Dare in 1967, and was succeeded by Bruce Cornwell. [...] Following Hampson's departure, the emphasis on Dan Dare's exploration of the Solar System had changed instead to include interstellar travel. [...] Continuity became strained, and production on Dan Dare ceased in 1967, when it was replaced by reprints from earlier editions.|$|E
