40|$|An {{anatomical}} {{study of}} secondary phloem {{of the different}} species of Gymnosperms showed that three categories could be distinguished, which may represent three evolutionary stages. These three categories were: Pseudotsuga taxifolia type, to which belong many Pinaceae (while the other Pinaceae species belong to a subtype, e. g. the Tsuga canadensis subtype); Gingko biloba type, to which belong the Cycadaceae, Araucariaceae and many Podocarpaceae and Taxaceae; Chamaecyparis pisifera type, to which belong the Cupressaceae, Taxodiaceae {{and the rest of}} the Taxaceae and Podocarpaceae. The phylogenetic sequence of the axial system and the reduction of the phloem rays starts in the Ps. taxifolia type with an almost uniform axial system and ray- albuminous cells, and a complex heterogeneous <b>phloem</b> <b>ray,</b> differentiating through the G. biloba type to the C. pisifera type, which has a highly specialized axial system with phloem-albuminous cells and a simpler, reduced homogeneous <b>phloem</b> <b>ray.</b> The reduction of the phloem rays parallels the differentiation of the axial system...|$|E

40|$|The sclerification {{process in}} bark tissues of common fir (Abies alba Mill.) has been described. The sclerification begins in 3 years old stems. Sclereids {{differentiate}} from cortical parenchyma cells and from secondary phloem parenchyma cells {{that do not}} contain phenolic deposits. The first single sclereids are formed at the interface of the cortex and nonfunctional phloem. Hereafter, a continuous layer of them is formed. Later, new sclereid layers are formed successively in nonfunctional secondary phloem and cortex. The consecutive layers are separated tangentially by phloem parenchyma cells, that accumulate large amounts of phenolic substances, and by compressed phloem cells. Laterally they are separated by phloem rays that except of some dislocations are continuous. Structural net of the cortical <b>phloem</b> <b>ray</b> cells and phloem parenchyma delineates the areas where the formations of sclereid layers occurs in nonfunctional secondary phloem. Older cortex contains more sclereid layers and the time period of their formation extends continuously...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Quercus cerris L. var. cerris has a {{conspicuous}} bark {{which is generally}} thicker than that of other Quercus L. species in Turkey. The present study aimed to provide detailed anatomical characterisation of the bark of this species, which is necessary to assess its potential. The anatomical studies were conducted on the bark samples of nine 70 - to 80 -year-old trees growing in 3 sites of Andırın district from Kahramanmaraş province in Turkey. For microscopic observation transverse and longitudinal sections were prepared and individual specimens were taken for maceration. The bark is composed of phloem, periderm, and a very substantial rhytidome. The rhytidome has sequential periderms with phloem tissue between them, and includes compact nodules of sclerified tissues. The phellem has typical cork cells arranged regularly in radial rows and showing rings. The phelloderm is poorly developed. The phloem is layered regularly from cambium until the last formed periderm in successive tangential bands of fibres and groups of sclereids alternated with axial parenchyma and sieve tubes. Uniseriate <b>phloem</b> <b>rays</b> transverse the fibre groups, and fused <b>phloem</b> <b>rays</b> originate conspicuous broad rays. The dilatation growth showed large and conspicuous sclereids. Numerous crystals and druses in axial parenchyma cells were also observed. Full illustration of this species is given...|$|R

40|$|Radiating {{plates of}} xylem are a lianas cambium variation, of which, 22 {{families}} have this feature. This study investigates 15 liana species representing nine families with radiating plates of xylem structures. The {{features of the}} transverse section and epidermis in fresh liana samples are documented, including shapes and colors of xylem and <b>phloem,</b> <b>ray</b> width and numbers, and skin morphology. Experimental {{results indicated that the}} shape of phloem fibers in Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. hancei is gradually tapered and flame-like, which is in contrast with the other characteristics of this type, including those classified as rays. Both inner and outer cylinders of vascular bundles are found in Piper kwashoense, and the irregularly inner cylinder persists yet gradually diminishes. Red crystals are numerous in the cortex of Celastrus kusanoi. Aristolochia shimadai and A. zollingeriana develop a combination of two cambium variants, radiating plates of xylem and a lobed xylem. The shape of phloem in Stauntonia obovatifoliola is square or truncate, and its rays are numerous. Meanwhile, that of Neoalsomitra integrifolia is blunt and its rays are fewer. As for the features of a stem surface within the same family, Cyclea ochiaiana is brownish in color and has a deep vertical depression with lenticels, Pericampylus glaucus is greenish in color with a vertical shallow depression. Within the same genus, Aristolochia shimadai develops lenticels, which are not in A. zollingeriana; although the periderm developed in Clematis grata is a ring bark and tears easily, that of Clematis tamura is thick and soft...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study changes in {{anatomical}} structure of phloem tissue in pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stems influenced by creeping forest fires of various rates. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} Lower Angara river region of the Angara provenance, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Central Siberia. The trees with green crowns and different fire damaged butts were chosen as models. Control (undamaged) trees were taken from stands adjacent to experimental plots. The changes of inner bark thickness, number of phloem annual layers between cambium and periderm and number of cells in conductive phloem were found in the stem side opposite to fire scars. The structure fluctuations of phloem tissue were detected: disturbances of sieve cell arrangement, <b>phloem</b> <b>ray</b> enlargements, resin canal overgrowth and formation of great resin ducts. The lignin accumulation was observed in inner bark and a large amount of callusing was detected between conductive and nonconductive phloem. Over the course of time, repairing of tissues occurred and the normal inner bark structure and chemistry (without lignin) were restored. The creeping fire of low intensity caused the maximal changes of phloem quantitative characteristics in trees with bark charring and these tendencies were stored after eight years. After creeping fire of high intensity the tendency for phloem thickening in trees with one fire scar and to thinning in strongly damaged trees were revealed. Also tendencies to decrease of the number of phloem annual layers, number of sieve cells in conductive phloem and ray frequency with increasing of stem injury degree were observed, besides axial parenchyma percentage trended to increase. Eight years after fire these tendencies were often not visible...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for wood of 42 collections of 23 species of Ephedra from North and South America; data on bark anatomy are offered {{for most of}} these. For five collections, root as well as stem wood is analyzed, and for two collections, anatomy of horizontal underground stems is {{compared to that of}} upright stems. Vessel diameter, vessel element length, fiber-tracheid length, and tracheid length increase with age. Vessels and tracheids bear helical thickenings in 10 North American species (first report); thickenings are absent in Mexican and South American species. Mean total area of perforations per mm 2 of transection is more reliable as an indicator of conductive demands than mean vessel diameter or vessel area per mm 2 of transection. Perforation area per mm 2 is greatest in lianoid shrubs and treelike shrubs, less in large shrubs, and least in small shrubs. Plant size is roughly proportional to ecology, and thus perforation area per mm 2 is indicative also of ecology. Growth rings are not marked in lianoid or tropical or subtropical species. Latewood has few or no vessels (and thus offers maximal conductive safety) in species from colder and drier habitats. The ecology of the species range from dry to extremely dry habitats. Rays are mostly wide multiseriate, but three tropical or subtropical species have uniseriate rays plus narrow multiseriate rays-possibly a primitive condition. The fiber-tracheids (parenchyma of other authors) are nucleated, and are considered a result oftracheid dimorphism phylogenetically. Tracheids are vaguely storied in a few species. Minute calcium oxalate crystals cover outer surfaces of wood ray cells, <b>phloem</b> <b>ray</b> cells, sieve cells, and phloem parenchyma abundantly in most species; the crystals are slightly less abundant on vessel, tracheid, and fiber-tracheid surfaces (first report of these crystals on these cell types). Crystals, tannins, and five types of sclerenchyma in bark are considered types of herbivore deterrents. Bark of some species is richer in these features; other species are poor in sclerenchyma or tannins or both. Independent evolution of vessels in Gnetales and angiosperms is briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{utilization}} of soft X-ray microradiogram {{for the evaluation of}} crude drugs, seven different grades of Cinnamomi veri Cortex were examined.

Moreover, comparing with the microradiogram of the stem bark of Cinnamomum verum, higher grade ones corresponded to the bark from slender parts and lower grades to thicker parts. By use of this method jointly with optical microscopic observation was found to be more useful for the histological study of crude drugs. In addition, this method might be superior to the observation of the internal structures of large sized crude drugs without any damages, and gives various interesting informations by treating the drugs beforehand with chemical reagents such as hydrochloric acid...|$|R
40|$|Sclereids in {{the roots}} ofSyzygium cumini (L.) Skeels (Myrtaceae) are polymorphic. In {{addition}} to the brachy-, osteo- and bizarre sclereids, there occur an interesting kind of sclereids—the fibre sclereids—resembling the fibres in some respects. Sclereids appear only after the onset of secondary activity and {{fall into one of}} the following categories depending on their origin: (a) a continuous strand of sclereids in the secondary cortex. This develops from parenchymatous initials that are derivatives of phellogen. Fibre sclereids occur only in this region along with ordinary sclereids and a few fibres. (b) sclereids formed through secondary sclerosis of distal mature parenchyma cells of the dilating <b>phloem</b> <b>rays.</b> (c) Sclereids formed through secondary sclerosis of mature parenchyma cells in old phloem.

The adult sclereids are devoid of nuclei, starch or crystals. Insoluble tannin is present in them except in those formed from phloem parenchyma. Ontogenetical stages of the various kinds of sclereids are similar except that fibre sclereids show a pronounced intrusive growth which although initially bipolar later becomes unipolar. Other kinds of sclereids show either a purely symplastic growth or a combination of various degrees of symplastic and intrusive growth which is either diffuse (some osteosclereids) or multipolar (bizarre sclereids).

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The balsam {{woolly aphid}} (Adelges piceae Ratz.) feeds by {{inserting}} its stylets intra- and intercellularly into the cortex or outer phloem of the true firs. While feeding, the aphid injects into the bark an unknown stimulatory substance which affects the adjacent cortical parenchyma cells, {{the activity of the}} vascular cambium and the differentiation of the xylem. This study examines non-infested, infested, and aphid-aban doned trees of grand fir (Abies grandis [Dougl. ] Lindl.) collected through the year by serial cross, radial, and tangential sections of the cortex, secondary phloem, cambium, and a portion of the xylem. The cortex of grand fir is composed mainly of parenchyma cells filled with resins, tannins, and sometimes crystals. Some of the parenchyma cells differentiate into astrosclereids. After infestation the cortex is characterized by hypertrophy of the nuclei and cortical parenchyma cells. As these cells enlarge into giant cells, there is an increase in density of the cytoplasm. Later a cork cambium is initiated around the pockets of giant cells. Reactivation and cessation of the cambium in infested, non-infested, and aphid-abandoned trees do not differ any more than the natural tree-to-tree variations that are due to location and exposure. The dormant cambium of infested trees maintains a wider radial file of cells in the cambial zone than do the cambiums of non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. The cambium of infested trees generally produces more cells per year by increases in both periclinal and pseudotransverse divisions spread more or less evenly throughout the year. Pseudotransverse divisions in the non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees are generally limited to {{the latter half of the}} growing season. The sieve cells of the non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees are longer than those of the infested trees, but those of the infested trees are larger in radial width. The tangential widths do not vary. Rays are produced by anticlinal divisions of fusiform initials and by decline of fusiform initials. More declining tiers are noted in infested trees than in non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. The fusiform initials decline to form one or more ray initials. In the latter case, the segmented initial produces two or more separate ray initials by unequal periclinal divisions and by maturation of some initials in the strand. The phloem rays usually accumulate a greater abundance of resins than do those of non-infested trees. The cambium of infested trees produces more tangential bands of phloem parenchyma cells and fiber sclereids than that of non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. Traumatic resin ducts are initiated in the differentiating xylem, especially in heavily-infested trees. In the material examined, these were initiated in the spring, but they can occur at any time during the growing season. After prolonged presence of feeding aphids, <b>phloem</b> <b>ray</b> cells develop abnormalities such as dumbbell-shaped nuclei or a binucleate condition. Astrosclereids and resin cells were noted in all categories of trees studied.

The lianoid habit is found in 125 extant plant families and is most diverse and abundant in structurally complex forests, such as tropical forests. A stem with lianoid anatomy is described from Cretaceous sediments of Hornby Island, British Columbia. Methodology. The stem segment, 2. 5 cm in diameter and 2. 8 cm long, was studied using the cellulose acetate peel technique and SEM. Anatomy was documented and compared to fossil and modern taxa. Pivotal results. The stem lacks distinct growth increments, and the fibrous wood is dissected by large (> 10 cells wide) rays. Wood is diffuse porous with mostly solitary vessels, rarely in tangential multiples (2 - 4). Vessel elements have a mean tangential diameter of 198 mm and mean length of 527 mu m, bearing medium to large, crowded, elliptical to flat-elliptical alternate pits. Axial parenchyma is diffuse and vessels are surrounded by vasicentric tracheids with alternate bordered pitting. Rays are homocellular and > 2 cm tall. <b>Phloem</b> <b>rays</b> are dilated, protruding into the xylem rays; thick-walled ray cells contain prismatic crystals. Periderm is composed of thin-walled cells interspersed with sclerotic nests. Wood anatomy of the fossil shows the most similarity to that of lianas in the Menispermaceae, Lardizabalaceae, and Ranunculaceae. Conclusions. The Hornby Island stem represents a new taxon, Atli morinii gen. et sp. nov. (Ranunculales). This liana specimen expands our knowledge of Cretaceous biodiversity and points to the presence of structurally complex forests on Hornby Island in the Campanian. Anatomy of Atli and other Cretaceous liana stems combines characteristics of several families in Ranunculales, documenting past anatomical diversity and possible stem lineage mosaicism.

30|$|The SSd in the roots, stems, {{and leaves}} of B. scorzonerifolium were {{examined}} through histochemistry and ultrastructural immunogold localization. The {{results show that}} saikosaponins distribution in the roots, stems, and leaves varied during different developmental stages. Tables  1 and 2 show the density of gold particles in selected areas of these organs. The level of saikosaponin labeling was higher in the vacuoles except the cambium and xylem cells in the stem. In addition, the density of gold particles differed significantly between the vacuoles and the protoplasm at the 0.05 significance level based on the Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. Consequently, the saikosaponins in the roots were mainly distributed in vacuoles of phloem cells. Shon et al. (1997) reported that the saikosaponins in B. falcatum are predominantly produced in phloem tissues regardless of cultivation year. Tan et al.

In mature stems, saikosaponins were mainly detected in the vacuoles of cortex cells. In mature leaves, saikosaponins were mainly found in vacuoles of palisade parenchyma cells. The results also indicate that saikosaponins mainly accumulate in the roots. Pan et al.

40|$|We {{consider}} a thermodynamic state of a solvent and solution separated with an elastic semipermeable membrane {{in a box}} with a constant volume and the relevance of this simple model for the water uptake in tall trees. Under moderate concentrations of a solute, the solution and solvent are under {{the positive and negative}} pressure, respectively. In the case of the soft membrane the pressure difference between the compartments with the solvent and solution is given by van't Hoff equation. A state of the negative pressure is not stable and after some time cavitations transform the solvent into the state of coexisting liquid and bubbles of saturated vapor. The pressure difference between the solvent and solution decreases and the membrane relaxes restoring the liquid phase in the compartment with solvent. In this way the solvent oscillates between the tensile state and the coexisting state of liquid and bubbles of saturated vapor. The xylem and phloem, the main vascular systems in trees, are coupled with ray cells. Assuming that a sap in these systems is kept under the constant volume the osmosis between the xylem and <b>phloem</b> with <b>ray</b> cells sustains the negative pressure of the xylem sap. Due to the osmosis elastic energy stored in walls of tracheary element could repair cavitations. In this way both water transport in tall trees and cavitations repair in tracheary elements are related to the osmosis under constant volume. A possible explanation of two long standing problems in tree physiology, water uptake in tall trees and cavitations repair, are offered within this model. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

Disease resistance in pines, especially the hypersensitive reaction that is successful in controlling many potential pests and pathogens, is explored. Pathologies resulting from the activities of pinewood nematode include cortical trails and cavities; formation of cambial gaps and traumatic resin cysts; browning and death of cortex, <b>phloem,</b> cambium, and <b>ray</b> tissues; granulation and shrinkage of cell cytoplasm in rays; and destruction of resin canal epithelial and ray parenchyma cells. Death of parenchyma, production of toxins, and leakage of oleoresins and other material into tracheids are typical of the hypersensitive reaction occurring in pines following migration of small numbers of pinewood nematodes. The hypothesis presented is that a spreading hypersensitive reaction results in some of the observed pathologies and symptoms and eventually causes pine death.
