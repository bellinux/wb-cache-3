50|$|In 1984 the Lyceum {{was bought}} by the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> for £320,000 {{with a view of}} turning it into Liverpool's <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> {{headquarters}} and a philatelic museum. However a major restructuring of the UK's <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> which formed private company <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Counters</b> Ltd meant the plans could no longer go ahead due to limited resources. <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Counters</b> Ltd sold the Lyceum back to the original developers who again requested consent for its demolition. With opposition from Liverpool City Council and English Heritage, a compromise with developers resulted in part of the restored building being leased back to the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> and other parts converted to retail outlets. The lower floor became a building society while the ground floor along with the <b>post</b> <b>office</b> became a changing succession of different bars/cafes under various names including 'Life Bar', 'Prohibition', 'The Bar and Grill' and the 'Lyceum Café'.|$|R

50|$|The {{collapse}} of the Liberal Party in the 1924 general election meant that Lees-Smith was able to win his seat back and he was swiftly appointed to a front-bench role. When Labour returned to office in 1929 he was made Postmaster-General where he defended the nationalised <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> and tried to smarten up the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>counters.</b> In a reshuffle in March 1931 {{he was promoted to}} President of the Board of Education and sworn of the Privy Council.

50|$|In fact, {{the term}} {{printing}} sheet refers {{only to a}} part of the actual printing sheet. This is because stamps are mostly printed in four connected sheets, to make best use of the stamp paper. At the <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>counter,</b> only the four separated printing sheets are sold. Therefore, the sheet of stamps is also called a counter sheet or pane, though improperly called a sheet of stamps.|$|E

40|$|The {{coalition}} {{has given the}} Liberal Democrats the opportunity to demonstrate their support for – or opposition to – supply-side economics.

50|$|From the 1913 to 1930, Commonwealth and State Government {{agencies}} used stamps (perfins) punctured with OS (“Official Service”). In 1931 the puncturing {{system was}} abandoned and stamps for government mail were overprinted OS. In February 1933, {{it was decided}} that government mail would no longer require postage stamps. The exception to OS stamps being restricted for the use of government agencies was the 4 November 1931 6d airmail stamp. The OS overprinted stamp was sold over <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>counters</b> to prevent speculation and was valid for all types of mail.|$|R
50|$|In October 1995 at the Conservative Party conference, {{the then}} social {{security}} minister Peter Lilley brandished a smartcard as the intended fraud-busting {{replacement for the}} benefit book, declaring that with the Benefits Agency and ICL, <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Counters</b> Ltd would install smartcard reading terminals at every branch, through a private finance initiative (PFI) to be delivered under a commercial contract.

5000|$|In 1999, {{four years}} after the {{original}} pilot scheme began, and £700m of taxpayers' money later, the by now Labour government stopped the scheme in its tracks. The Department of Social Security withdrew from the deal, leaving ICL/Fujitsu to run the system. ICL has since criticised the PFI payment criteria: the Fujitsu-owned firm would have been paid partly on how many customers <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> attracted. [...] "Looking back, I think it was over-ambitious," [...] said Stuart Sweetman in 2001, as the then group managing director of customer and banking services for Consignia, the then-current name for <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Counters</b> Ltd.
