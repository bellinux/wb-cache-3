5|$|On {{the second}} afternoon, Bradman delayed {{the taking of}} the second new ball until after tea so that Lindwall and Johnston could have an extra period of {{recuperation}} before a new attack. This proved dividends as the bowlers took a wicket apiece within three overs of the new ball being taken, leaving England at 6/134. England were bowled out for 215 on the third morning, as Lindwall took 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> notice Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall was {{subjected}} to a thorough fitness test {{on the morning of}} the Second Test at Lord's two weeks later, the home of cricket. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations was sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. Lindwall contributed 15 to Australia's total of 350. He then took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. He had Washbrook caught behind in his fourth over and then clean bowled Edrich and Tom Dollery in the space of three balls. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control. He later returned to bowl English captain Norman Yardley after an 87 run stand with Compton, before finishing with 5/70 as Australia took a 135 first innings lead. Lindwall then contributed 25 as Australia declared at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world-record 596 for victory. Lindwall removed Hutton with the new ball and later returned to remove Dollery and Jim Laker without the addition of a single run to take 3/61 as Australia took a 409 run victory. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> notice Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bedser inside-edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135 first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> notice Lindwall's pain. Lindwall {{was worried that}} Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax. The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings. Barnes survived a missed stumping {{opportunity}} when he was 18 and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122. Morris was then bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket. Barnes started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Once he reached his century, Barnes became particularly aggressive. He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, included two successive blows over the boundary for six. He was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary from Yardley. He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings. The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296/2 after 277 minutes when he departed. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 296/3 to face Yardley's hat-trick ball. Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball. Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century in his last Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich at slip. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 and Australia reached stumps at 343, without further loss, with Miller having struck one six into the grandstand.|$|E

40|$|Recent neuroimaging {{studies have}} shown the {{importance}} of the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in deception. However, {{little is known about the}} role of each of these regions during deception. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we mea-sured brain activation while participants told truths or lies about two types of real-world events: experienced and unexperienced. The imaging data revealed that activity of the dorsolateral, ventrolateral and medial prefrontal cortices was commonly asso-ciated with both types of deception (pretending <b>to</b> know and <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know), whereas activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was only associated with <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increase in the ACC was positively correlated with that in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex only during <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know. These results suggest that the lateral and medial prefrontal cortices have general roles in deception, whereas the ACC contributes specifically <b>to</b> <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know...|$|R

Appearing as an old crone (in other stories a nurse), Hera befriended Semele, who confided in her that Zeus was the actual father of the baby in her womb. Hera <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> believe her, and planted seeds of doubt in Semele's mind. Curious, Semele demanded of Zeus that he reveal himself in all his glory as proof of his godhood.|$|E

25|$|Horseshoes {{have long}} been {{considered}} lucky. They were originally made of iron, a material which was believed to ward off evil spirits, and traditionally were held in place with seven nails, seven being the luckiest number. The superstition acquired a further Christian twist due to a legend surrounding the 10th century saint Dunstan, {{who worked as a}} blacksmith before becoming Archbishop of Canterbury. The legend recounts that, one day, the Devil walked into Dunstan's shop and asked him to shoe his horse. Dunstan <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> recognize him, and agreed to the request; but rather than nailing the shoe to the horse's hoof, he nailed it to the Devil's own foot, causing him great pain. Dunstan eventually agreed to remove the shoe, but only after extracting a promise that the Devil would never enter a household with a horseshoe nailed to the door.|$|E

500|$|Lindwall {{returned}} on {{the final}} morning with the score at 6/141. Dollery, who had been batting with assurance, shaped to duck under a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Later in the same over, Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck to leave England at 8/141. The match ended when Doug Wright hit Ernie Toshack to Lindwall and was caught for four. Lindwall ended with 3/61 as Australia took a 409-run victory. Arlott said that while Toshack (5/40) had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure. He said that when Lindwall [...] "so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at {{the morale of the}} English batting that was never overcome." [...] In later years, Bradman told Lindwall he <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> notice the bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried Bradman had noticed his injury and would be disappointed, but the Australian captain later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax and focus on his bowling.|$|E

500|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bedser and Wright survived for 20 minutes, and Lindwall {{tried to break}} their {{resistance}} by aiming a few bouncers at the former. Bedser eventually inside edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135-run first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70, while Johnson took 3/72 and Johnston 2/43. Toshack was the other bowler used, sending down 18 overs {{for the loss of}} 23 runs. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> notice his bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried his captain had noticed the injury, but Bradman later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow his paceman to relax. O'Reilly said Lindwall [...] "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler." [...] Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.|$|E
500|$|Princess Caroline's {{unconventional}} behaviour led, in 1807, to {{accusations that}} she had had sexual relations with other men since the separation. [...] Caroline was caring for a young child, William Austin, who was alleged to be her child by another man. [...] The Prince of Wales hoped that what was termed [...] "the Delicate Investigation" [...] would turn up evidence of adultery that would permit him to get a divorce, and forbade Charlotte to see her mother. Charlotte was aware of the investigation. [...] The ten-year-old was deeply hurt when mother and daughter caught sight of each other in the park, and Caroline, obedient to the Prince's command to have no contact with Charlotte, <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see her. [...] To George's bitter disappointment, the investigating committee found no evidence Caroline had had a second child, though it noted that the Princess's behaviour was very much open to misconstruction. [...] The King, who was fond of Caroline, had refused to see her during the investigation, but began to receive her again afterwards. [...] After the conclusion of the Delicate Investigation, the Prince reluctantly allowed Charlotte to see her mother again, with the condition that William Austin not be a playmate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{point of}} land on which Fort Caroline was {{situated}} is separated from the seacoast by an extensive swamp through which flows Pablo Creek, which rises {{a few miles from}} the head of North River. It was necessary for the Spaniards to go around this, for all of the creeks and rivers were full and the lowlands flooded owing to the continued rains. At no time was the water lower than up to their knees. No boats were taken along, so the soldiers swam the various creeks and streams, Menéndez taking the lead with a pike in his hand at the very first one they encountered. Those who could not swim were carried across on the pikes. It was extremely fatiguing work, for [...] "the rains continued as constant and heavy as if the world was again to be overwhelmed with a flood." [...] Their clothes became soaked and heavy with water, their food as well, the powder wet, and the cords of the arquebuses worthless, and some of the men began to grumble, but Menéndez <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hear. The vanguard selected the place for the night encampment, but it was difficult to find high ground on account of the flood. During their halts fires were built, but when within a day's march of Fort Caroline, even this was forbidden, for fear it would betray their approach to the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|When the new Reichstag first assembled, Papen {{hoped to}} use the {{opportunity}} to drop all pretense of democracy. [...] He obtained in advance from Hindenburg a decree to dissolve it, then secured another decree to suspend elections for the time being. When the Reichstag met on 12 September 1932, it managed to elect Hermann Göring as its speaker, which {{was followed by a}} Communist motion of no confidence in the Papen government. Papen had anticipated this gambit, however. He knew that the Communist no-confidence motion would only be entertained if the other parties all agreed to a last-minute change in the Reichstags agenda. Alfred Hugenberg had promised Papen that the DNVP would object to the Communist motion. Hearing reports that the NSDAP and the Zentrum were in talks about forming a new government, Hugenberg ordered the DNVP not to object to the change in agenda without telling Papen {{as part of an effort}} to save his government as he believed the Nazis would have to vote against the Communist no-confidence motion to avoid a new election. However, when no one objected, Papen ordered one of his messengers to fetch the dissolution decree. Göring phoned Hitler in Munich, asking him whether the Nazis should vote for the Communist no-confidence motion, and was ordered to vote ja (yes). Papen demanded the floor in order to read the dissolution decree, but Göring <b>pretended</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see him. The motion carried by 512 votes to 42-a result that German historian Eberhard Kolb described as a defeat [...] "such as had never been known in German parliamentary history." [...] Angry and red-faced as Göring ignored him, Papen threw the decree dissolving the Reichstag at him and stormed out. [...] Realizing that he did not have nearly enough support to go through with his plan to subvert the republic from within, Papen decided to call another election to punish the Reichstag for voting against his government. Papen had planned not to call another election after dissolving the Reichstag, but he changed his mind after the NSDAP and the Zentrum threatened to use Article 59 of the constitution, which allowed for impeachment of the president if he violated the constitution, and after Hindenburg's lawyers informed him that dissolving the Reichstag without scheduling new elections was an impeachable offense.|$|E
