Nay, such are in kings' palaces, {{and in the}} palaces of prefects who would needs be emperors, and cast away the Lord's bonds from them--of whom it is written, that He that sitteth in the heavens laugheth them to scorn, and taketh the wicked in their own snare, and maketh the devices of princes of none effect. Ay, in king's palaces, and in theatres too, where the rich of this world, poor in faith, deny their covenant, and defile their baptismal robes that they may do honour to the devourers of the earth. Woe to them who think that they may partake of the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils. Woe to them who will praise with the same mouth Aphrodite the fiend, and her of whom it is written that He was born of a pure Virgin. Let such be excommunicate from the cup of the Lord, and from the {{congregation}} of the Lord, till they have purged away their sins by penance and by almsgiving. But for you, ye poor of this world, rich in faith, you whom the rich despise, hale before the judgment seats, and blaspheme that holy name whereby ye are called--what went ye out into the wilderness to see? A prophet?--Ay, {{and more than a}} prophet--a martyr! More than a prophet, more than a king, more than a prefect whose theatre was the sands of the desert, whose throne was the cross, whose crown was bestowed, not by heathen philosophers and daughters of Satan, deceiving men with the works of their fathers, but by angels and archangels; a crown of glory, the victor's laurel, which grows for ever in the paradise of the highest heaven. Call him no more Ammonius, call him Thaumasius, wonderful! Wonderful in his poverty, wonderful in his zeal, wonderful in his faith, wonderful in his fortitude, wonderful in his death, most wonderful in the manner of that death. Oh thrice blessed, who has merited the honour of the cross itself! What can follow, but that one so honoured in the flesh should also be honoured in the life which he now lives, and that from the virtue of these thrice-holy limbs the leper should be cleansed, the dumb should speak, the very dead be raised? Yes; it were impiety to doubt it. Consecrated by the cross, this flesh shall not only rest in hope but work in <b>power.</b> <b>Approach,</b> and be healed! Approach, and see the glory of the saints, the glory of the poor. Approach, and learn that that which man despises, God hath highly esteemed; that that which man rejects, God accepts; that that which man punishes, God rewards. Approach, and see how God hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise, and the weak things of this world to confound the strong. Man abhors the cross: The Son of God condescended to endure it! Man tramples on the poor: The Son of God hath not where to lay His head. Man passes by the sick as useless: The Son of God chooses them to be partakers of His sufferings, that the glory of God may be made manifest in them. Man curses the publican, while he employs him to fill his coffers with the plunder of the poor: The Son of God calls him from the receipt of custom to be an apostle, higher than the kings of the earth. Man casts away the harlot like a faded flower, when he has tempted her to become the slave of sin for a season; and the Son of God calls her, the defiled, the despised, the forsaken, to Himself, accepts her tears, blesses her offering, and declares that her sins are forgiven, for she hath loved much; while to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little....' ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the voting <b>power</b> <b>approach</b> is much more general than is portrayed by Albert (“The Voting Power Approach: Measurement without Theory”, European Union Politics, 4 : 3, 2003) and is {{therefore}} capable of generating important insights about voting systems, such as qualified majority voting in the EU Council. The voting <b>power</b> <b>approach</b> focuses on understanding the properties of voting systems by analysing outcomes and thereby is able to generate empirical facts that are not otherwise obvious. That the approach is so general has not previously been {{pointed out in the}} relevant literature; it has usually been taken as coinciding with power indices. Albert’s criticism is directed at one aspect of the theory of voting power indices: the assumption of probabilistic voting that underlies conventional power indices. It is argued that he fails to take account of the different uses of power indices and that the probabilistic voting assumptions he derides {{may or may not be}} useful depending on this. It is necessary to emphasise the key distinction between a priori power indices and measure of empirical voting power. Albert misrepresents the voting <b>power</b> <b>approach</b> and is not willing to allow that it encompasses a diversity of methods as well as a research agenda. ...|$|E
40|$|The Gaussian {{integration}} of moments is systematically discussed. It is {{shown that the}} well-known diffusivityfactor approximation is equivalent to a one-node Gaussian quadrature.

The errors due to the diffusivity-factor approximation are analyzed in a one-dimensional radiative transfer model. Generally, the results cannot be improved by using other one-node Gaussian quadrature schemes with different moments. More accurate results can be obtained by using higher-node Gaussian quadratures. It is found that the limit as the moment <b>power</b> <b>approaches</b> infinity always produces the best results. The computational advantage of the diffusivity-factor approximation is kept in the higher-node Gaussian quadratures. It is, therefore, feasible to implement the higher-node Gaussian quadratures in climate models. 1...|$|R
