40|$|There {{exists a}} long time debate over the {{rational}} state of the evacuees in the evacuation simulation. Sime et al. insisted that the evacuees behave rationally in most cases. Following this argument Arthur and Passini concluded that if a setting works well under normal conditions, {{it will have a}} better chance of working well in emergency conditions.
