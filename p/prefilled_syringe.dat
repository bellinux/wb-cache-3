In 1975, BD Pharmaceutical Systems Europe acquired an important patent for a <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> injecting heparin. In 1980, BD developed its first automated system for mycobacteria testing—the BD BACTEC 460TB System. The next year brought significant signs of the company’s development as sales surpassed the $1 billion milestone and a new plant in Plymouth, England was constructed to serve the European markets. Five years later BD moved its corporate headquarters to Franklin Lakes, New Jersey (current HQ location.) Also in 1986, BD acquired Fabersanitas Industrial, a major Spanish syringe manufacturer as well as Deseret Medical, a vascular access devices manufacturer. The last {{three years of the}} 1980s also showed growth in Asia (manufacturing facilities in Singapore and Japan.) Furthermore, BD became the first company to introduce a safety-engineered syringe—BD Safety-Lok (1988) and acquired the Beaver Blade Company, a manufacturer of high-quality surgical blades. The first half of the next decade was very important to BD’s development. The company opened a central distribution center in Temse, Belgium (1992) and entered India and China (1995.) BD also introduced a device that offered needle stick protection following blood-drawing procedures—BD Vacutainer Safety-Lok Blood Collection Set.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} for the thesis {{is to develop a}} {{recommendation}} for Amgen's future <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> strategy related to its drug process development, supplier relationship management plan, supply and sourcing, and procurement. The goal is achieved 1) by analyzing the historic growth drivers in the market and current market trends including changes and challenges, 2) by developing an analytical tool to understand complicated market dynamics between suppliers and buyers, 3) by developing a few future scenarios on how the market will evolve based on former analyses and models and 4) by developing and finalizing a recommendation for Amgen's future strategy. The <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> market is uniquely interesting for several reasons: 1) the <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> is an important primary drug container to both biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, 2) there has been only one dominant supplier in the US, 3) biotech has been challenged with quality issues related to prefilled syringes and required the highest quality standards of syringe suppliers, 4) biotech's stringent quality standards and relatively low volume, compared with other big therapeutic classes such as anti-coagulants (heparins) and vaccines, can make it less attractive for the suppliers to align to biotech's needs, 5) new launch of advanced auto-injection device requires even higher <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> quality standards, and 6) the market is reshaping rapidly these days. First, the thesis analyzes the <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> market's history, major growth drivers, key suppliers and buyers, and market dynamics featuring key players.

The analysis of two open-label Phase I trials evaluated the pharmacokinetics, successful administration, and tolerability of peginterferon alfa- 2 a when using the autoinjector. The studies were performed to support the filing and registration of the autoinjector device. Methods: In trial 1, 50 healthy adult subjects received one 180 &micro;g dose of peginterferon alfa- 2 a via the autoinjector. Serial blood samples were collected predose, up to 336 hours following drug administration, and at follow-up (28 &plusmn; 3 days post-dosing) for noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. Trial 2 randomized 60 adult patients with chronic hepatitis C to 180 &micro;g peginterferon alfa- 2 a once weekly by the autoinjector or <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> for 3 weeks followed by the alternative device (<b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> or autoinjector, respectively) for 3 weeks. Patients also received ribavirin. Administration by the devices was evaluated under direct observation by a study staff member and by patient subjective assessment. Results: In trial 1, following a single dose of peginterferon alfa- 2 a, the maximum plasma concentration was 16. 1 &plusmn; 5. 3 ng/mL (mean &plusmn; standard deviation), and area under the concentration time curve (0 &ndash; 168 hours) was 1996 &plusmn; 613 ng&nbsp;&middot; hour/mL, similar to that reported using a vial/syringe or <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe.</b> In trial 2, few patients showed handling difficulties with either device.

40|$|Background : Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at {{increased}} risk of HIV and HCV infection through the use of blood contaminated syringes and paraphernalia. Obtaining illicit drugs in prefilled syringes might appeal to some PWID for convenience or necessity, yet this practice could lead to infections and drug overdose since syringe hygiene and drug concentrations cannot be known. Objectives : This dissertation research sought to characterize <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> use, estimate their prevalence and incidence, and identify factors associated with their use. It also sought to elucidate practices and motivations behind <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> use among PWID in San Diego, California. Methods : This dissertation is comprised of three studies assessing different aspects of <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> use among PWID enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study. Study one was a cross-sectional logistic regression analysis of baseline data from 574 PWID to determine the prevalence and correlates of ever using prefilled syringes. Study two was a qualitative study of 25 PWID, 10 of whom reported using prefilled syringes to describe contextual factors that influence their use. Study three included data from three study visits and used GEE to determine factors associated with <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> use in the last 6 months. Results : For Study one, participants were predominately white (50. 9 %) males (73. 9 %) {{with a mean age of}} 43. 4 years (range 18 - 80); 33. 3 % reported ever using prefilled syringes. PFSU was independently associated with ever having a rushed injection due to police presence, ever being in prison, injecting most often in public versus private places, ever overdosing on opioids, and injecting drugs in Mexico. A number of themes emerged during the interviews conducted for study two, including: 1) unknown contents; 2) trust; 3) pressure to inject quickly; and 4) disease transmission risk. Study three found participants who reported PFSU in the last 6 months were more likely to report an overdose, sharing other injection paraphernalia, being homeless, and to report using the syringe exchange program, all in the last 6 months.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} self-inject in {{patients}} with multiple sclerosis (MS) {{has been associated with}} a reduced risk of missed injections and drug discontinuation, and a beneficial effect on patients' independence. However, injection anxiety, needle phobia and disease-related disability are major barriers to a patient's ability to self-administer treatment. Use of an autoinjector may improve patients' ability to self-inject. This study evaluated the safe and effective use of Avonex Pen™ (prefilled pen), a single use autoinjector, for intramuscular delivery of interferon beta- 1 a (IM IFNβ- 1 a, Avonex) in MS patients. Methods This was a Phase IIIb, open-label, single-country, multicenter trial in MS patients currently using IM IFNβ- 1 a prefilled syringes. Patients received weekly 30 mcg IM IFNβ- 1 a treatment over 4 weeks. On Day 1, patients self-administered IM IFNβ- 1 a using a <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> at the clinic. On Day 8, patients received training on the prefilled pen and self-administered IM IFNβ- 1 a using the device. On Day 15, patients self-administered IM IFNβ- 1 a at home using the prefilled pen. A final injection occurred at the clinic on Day 22 when patients self-administered IM IFNβ- 1 a using the prefilled pen while clinic staff observed and completed a detailed questionnaire documenting patients' ability to self-inject with the device. Serum neopterin levels were evaluated pre and post-injection on Days 1 and 8. Adverse events were monitored throughout. Results Seventy-one (96 %) patients completed the study. The overall success rate in safely and effectively using the prefilled pen was 89 %. No device malfunctions occurred. One unsuccessful administration occurred at Day 22 due to patient error; no patient injury resulted. Patients gave the prefilled pen high ratings (8. 7 - 9. 3) on a 10 -point scale for ease of use (0 = extremely difficult, 10 = extremely easy). Ninety-four percent of patients preferred the prefilled pen over the <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe.</b> Induction of serum neopterin levels, serving as a biomarker for type 1 interferon action, was {{similar to that of the}} <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe.</b> The prefilled pen demonstrated a safety profile comparable to the <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe.</b> Conclusions The prefilled pen is a safe and effective device for administration of IM IFNβ- 1 a and represents an alternative method for self-injection for MS patients using this therapy.

40|$|Protein {{drugs such}} as insulin are almost universally {{delivered}} via glass syringes lubricated with silicone oil. It {{is not uncommon for}} <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringes</b> (PFS) to become cloudy, which may affect bioavailability or total drug dose. To examine the role, if any, of the silicone oil lubricant in this process, a systematic evaluation of the degree of insulin denaturation and aggregation as a function of silicone oils of different molecular weights was undertaken. The former was measured using fluorescence changes of aqueous insulin/silicone dispersions, while the latter examined changes in turbidity as a function of mixing and silicone oil type; the results were confirmed at two different insulin concentrations and agitation speeds. Lower molecular weight silicones led to the most rapid denaturation and aggregation, and when examined in blends of silicones at a fixed viscosity of 1000 cSt, commonly used for syringe lubrication, more rapid denaturation/aggregation was noted in blends of silicones containing the largest fractions of low molecular weight materials.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{incidence of}} pure red cell aplasia with an Eprex formulation in uncoated rubber stopper syringes. BackgroundThe incidence of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in {{chronic kidney disease}} patients treated with epoetins increased substantially in 1998, was shown to be antibody mediated, and was associated predominantly with subcutaneous administration of Eprex®. A technical investigation identified organic compounds leached from uncoated rubber stoppers in <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringes</b> containing polysorbate 80 as the most probable cause of the increased immunogenicity. MethodsThis study investigated whether the incidence of PRCA was higher for exposure to the product form containing leachates than for leachate-free product forms. Antibody-mediated PRCA cases were classified according to indication, product form, and route of administration. Exposure estimates were obtained by country, indication, route of administration, and product form. ResultsFor 2001 to 2003, the PRCA incidence rate for patients with subcutaneous exposure to Eprex in <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringes</b> with polysorbate 80 and uncoated rubber stoppers (leachates present) was 4. 61 / 10, 000 patient years (95 % CI 3. 88 – 5. 43) versus 0. 26 / 10, 000 patient years (95 % CI 0. 007 – 1. 44) for syringes with coated stoppers (leachates absent). The rate difference was 4. 35 / 10, 000 patient years (95 % CI 3. 44 – 5. 26; P < 0. 0001); the rate ratio was 17 (95 % CI 3. 14 – 707). A substantial rate difference remained in sensitivity analyses that adjusted for exposure to multiple product forms. ConclusionThe epidemiologic data, together with the chemical and immunologic data, {{support the hypothesis that}} leachates from uncoated rubber syringe stoppers caused the increased incidence of PRCA associated with Eprex. Currently, all Eprex <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringes</b> contain fluoro-resin coated stoppers, which has contributed to decreased incidence of PRCA with continued surveillance...|$|R

Patients and methods: The study (ClinicalTrials. gov number NCT 01793259) enrolled 120 patients requiring initiation or intensification of MTX therapy for RA. Patients were randomized to receive the test drug, a prefilled pen (Metex® PEN/Metoject® PEN), or the reference drug, a <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> (Metex®/Metoject®), at doses of 15, 17. 5, or 20 mg MTX SC once a week for  3  weeks. This was followed by receipt of the reference drug (<b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe)</b> or the test drug (prefilled pen) in a crossover design, with each patient serving as his/her own control. Questionnaires regarding patient preference, the Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ), and diaries regarding local tolerability were used to document outcomes. Results: Overall patient preference for the MTX prefilled pen was 75 % (P< 0. 0001). In a six-item questionnaire, 73 % to 76 % of the patients preferred the prefilled pen in relation to use, acceptability, and satisfaction, and 67 % of the patients confirmed {{that it did not}} take much effort to overcome SC self-injection with the pen. The SIAQ showed no clinical differences, in any domain scores, between both devices. Overall patient attitude towards self-injection at baseline was positive, as was patient experience with both devices during the study. As well, 92 % of physicians and study nurses indicated that they would recommend the MTX prefilled pen to patients for future MTX treatment. The formulations were generally well tolerated. Conclusion: SC self-injection of MTX with a prefilled pen was generally preferred, by patients with RA, over a <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> with regard to use, acceptability, and satisfaction.

We aimed to generate a comprehensive analytical data package from stability testing of key quality attributes, consistent with regulatory requirements, {{to determine whether the}} product profile of etanercept is maintained at ambient temperature. Methods: Test methods assessing key attributes of purity, quality, potency, and safety were performed over time, following storage of etanercept DP presentations under a range of conditions. Results: Results and statistical analysis from stability testing (based on size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Coomassie) across all etanercept presentations (10 and 25 mg/vial Lyo DP; 25 and 50 mg <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> DP; 50 mg prefilled pen DP) showed key stability-indicating parameters were within acceptable limits through the alternative storage condition of 25 °C± 2 °C for 1 month. Conclusion: Stability testing performed in line with regulatory requirements supports a single period of storage for etanercept DP at an alternative storage condition of 25 °C± 2 °C for up to 1 month within the approved expiry of the product. This alternative storage condition represents further innovation in the etanercept product lifecycle, providing greater flexibility and enhanced overall convenience for patients.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{current study}} was {{performed}} to assess the precision of the principal subvisible particle measurement methods available today. Special attention was given to identifying the sources of error and the factors governing analytical performance. METHODS: The performance of individual techniques was evaluated using a commercial biologic drug product in a <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> container. In control experiments, latex spheres were used as standards and instrument calibration suspensions. RESULTS: The results reported in this manuscript clearly demonstrated that the particle measurement techniques operating in the submicrometer range have much lower precision than the micrometer size-range methods. It was established that the main factor governing the relatively poor precision of submicrometer methods in general and inherently, is their low sampling volume and the corresponding large extrapolation factors for calculating final results. CONCLUSIONS: The variety of new methods for submicrometer particle analysis may in the future support product characterization; however, {{the performance of the}} existing methods does not yet allow for their use in routine practice and quality control...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Optimization of intratracheal {{instillation}} is neces-sary {{to establish an}} ideal animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) {{in order to further}} reveal the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of ALI. It is possible that instilling air from a <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringe</b> may promote the delivery of reagents into the alveolar spaces, resulting in different pulmonary responses. In the present study, the influence of instilling air by trans-tracheal {{intratracheal instillation}} in a lipopolysac-charide (LPS) -induced mouse model of ALI was investigated. The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid biochemical index, BAL fluid differential cell counts, lung wet/dry weight ratio, lung histology and BAL fluid interleukin‑ 8 (IL‑ 8) levels were assessed 24 h subsequent to intratracheal instillation. Instilled air promoted LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by the severity of acute pulmonary inflammation and increased IL‑ 8 release. In conclusion, this study indicates that instilled air may be used to improve the intratracheal instillation procedure and to establish a more reliable animal model of ALI...|$|E
40|$|KineretÒ (anakinra) is a recombinant, nonglycosylated form of {{the human}} interleukin- 1 {{receptor}} antagonist (IL- 1 Ra). KineretÒ differs from native human IL- 1 Ra in that it has {{the addition of a}} single methionine residue at its amino terminus. KineretÒ consists of 153 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 17. 3 kilodaltons. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology using an E coli bacterial expression system.

40|$|Aim Caspofungin {{is used as}} the echinocandin {{of choice}} when {{treating}} Candida infections on NICU within our Trust. This study reviewed the effect of caspofungin on liver function tests (LFTs) in babies receiving doses of 25 – 50 mg/m 2 daily. The manufacturers of caspofungin currently state that there is limited safety data for its use in this patient group at a dose of 25 mg/m 2. 1 Method A retrospective review using data accessed via the Trust’s blood results database included a review of LFTs for all babies who had received treatment with intravenous caspofungin on NICU over a three year period. Babies were identified using data supplied by the pharmacy production unit who manu-facture caspofungin <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringes</b> {{for use in the}} Trust and from the pharmacy dispensing database. All data sets were ana-lysed using patients notes to determine doses, duration and indi...|$|R
40|$|Silicone oil is a {{lubricant}} used for plunger depression in <b>prefilled</b> glass <b>syringes.</b> Many therapeutic protein products {{are stored in}} <b>prefilled</b> <b>syringes</b> and may {{be exposed to the}} silicone oil-water interface for up to 18 - 24 months. At the present, our understanding of how proteins interact with this interface remains poorly understood. In this work, the interaction of three humanized monoclonal antibodies (humAbs) with silicone oil emulsion was assessed in presence of sodium chloride, sucrose, Tween® 20, Tween® 80, and poloxamer 188. It was found that the amount of humAb adsorbed was antibody- and excipient-dependent. Once adsorbed, the tryptophan exposure to solvent resembled that of unfolded protein and was independent of the identity of different excipients present in the formulation buffer. Protein aggregation was not detected in solution. But, colloidal destabilization of silicone oil emulsion resulting from protein adsorption lowered the activation energy barrier to flocculation thereby enabling heterogeneous aggregates comprised of protein-coated silicone oil microdroplets to form. The size of these flocs was dependent on the solution ionic strength. Flocculation occurred in the presence of all excipients examined except in the presence of surfactant. In formulations containing surfactant, there was competition between humAb and surfactant molecules for adsorption sites at the silicone oil-water interface. The results suggest that the kinetics of humAb displacement from the silicone oil interface was surfactant-dependent. Whether the mechanism of this replacement involved the formation of protein-surfactant complex remains uncertain...|$|R
