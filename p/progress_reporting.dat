2500|$|Though he {{had only}} played rugby {{football}} before coming to Michigan, Wieman played on Michigan's freshman football team. [...] Wieman's hometown newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, followed his <b>progress,</b> <b>reporting</b> in October 1915 that he was [...] "making quite a reputation for himself as tackle on the freshman eleven" [...] and noting that [...] "Coach Yost seems to be quite pleased with his work." [...] As Wieman progressed, the Times ran a feature story reporting that [...] "the big, raw-boned freshman from Southern California" [...] was stopping Michigan's top varsity players, including All-American John Maulbetsch, and leaving them piled up [...] "in a squirming heap." [...] Coach Yost {{was reported to have}} bawled many varsity players for their inability to get past Wieman, with Maulbetsch complaining, [...] "It can't be done, coach." [...] Each night, the varsity players reportedly swore to get Wieman, but never did. [...] Wieman reportedly took the punishment and came up from under the pile each time smiling. [...] Wieman also demonstrated his talent on offense:"He is used by the freshmen on end-around plays. He has a peculiar way of running with a loose hitch in his hips that shakes off tacklers. [...] He also handles the ball well and is the best man at catching forward passes among the freshmen. [...] Wieman gives Rugby (the English game he played in California) and basketball the credit for his ability to catch the ball. [...] On punts he is generally waiting for his man to catch the ball."If {{it were not for the}} ban on freshmen play, the Times concluded there was no doubt that he would be playing on the varsity team.|$|E
