50|$|A major {{consequence}} of CI is the delayed entry into mitosis {{of the male}} <b>pronucleus.</b> As a secondary consequence, stemming from this asynchrony, the paternal chromosomes do not properly condense and align on the metaphase plate during the first mitosis. As a consequence, only the maternal chromosome segregate normally, producing haploid embryos. The rescue of CI by infected eggs leads to the restoration of synchrony between the female and the male <b>pronucleus.</b>|$|E

40|$|Following {{fertilization}} {{of the egg}} of {{the sand}} dollar Echinarachnius parma, tritiated thymidine (H 3 TDR) was taken up independently by {{the male and female}} <b>pronuclei</b> beginning within about 15 to 20 minutes, and the labeled <b>pronuclei</b> fused at about 30 to 40 minutes. At cleavage 90 minutes later the labeled nuclear material was distributed to both daughter cells. Unfertilized eggs and sperm exposed to H 3 TDR did not show nuclear localization of thymidine. DNA replication, thus, is initiated in the haploid <b>pronuclei</b> shortly after fertilization and prior to fusion. The major portion of DNA synthesis, as evidenced by thymidine uptake, appears to be during a 20 to 30 minute period after fertilization. Fertilization is associated with the activation of a mechanism which initiates early and independent replication of DNA in both the male and female <b>pronuclei...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of karyogamy is fusion of the two haploid nuclei. The first step in this process is {{the movement of the}} two pronuclei toward each other, which occurs directly after plasmogamy. Each <b>pronucleus</b> has a spindle pole body that is embedded in the nuclear envelope and serves as an attachment point for microtubules. Microtubules, an important fiber-like component of the cytoskeleton, emerge at the spindle pole body. The attachment point to the spindle pole body marks the minus end, and the plus end extends into the cytoplasm. The plus end has normal roles in mitotic division, but during nuclear congression, the plus ends are redirected. The microtubule plus ends attach to the opposite <b>pronucleus,</b> resulting in the pulling of the two pronuclei toward each other.|$|E
50|$|The sperm's {{tail and}} {{mitochondria}} degenerate with {{the formation of}} the male <b>pronucleus.</b> This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin. Still, a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring.|$|E
50|$|Microtubule {{movement}} is mediated {{by a family}} of motor proteins known as kinesins, such as Kar3 in yeast. Accessory proteins, such as Spc72 in yeast, act as a glue, connecting the motor protein, spindle pole body and microtubule in a structure known as the half-bridge. Other proteins, such as Kar9 and Bim1 in yeast, attach to the plus end of the microtubules. They are activated by pheromone signals to attach to the shmoo tip. A shmoo is a projection of the cellular membrane which is the site of initial cell fusion in plasmogamy. After plasmogamy, the microtubule plus ends continue to grow towards the opposite <b>pronucleus.</b> It is thought that the growing plus end of the microtubule attaches directly to the motor protein of the opposite <b>pronucleus,</b> triggering a reorganization of the proteins at the half-bridge. The force necessary for migration occurs directly in response to this interaction.|$|E

40|$|Mouse zygotes do not {{activate}} apoptosis {{in response}} to DNA damage. We previously reported a unique form of inducible sperm DNA damage termed sperm chromatin fragmentation (SCF). SCF mirrors some aspects of somatic cell apoptosis in that the DNA degradation is mediated by reversible double strand breaks caused by topoisomerase 2 B (TOP 2 B) followed by irreversible DNA degradation by a nuclease(s). Here, we created zygotes using spermatozoa induced to undergo SCF (SCF zygotes) and tested how they responded to moderate and severe paternal DNA damage during the first cell cycle. We found that the TUNEL assay was not sensitive enough to identify the breaks caused by SCF in zygotes in either case. However, paternal <b>pronuclei</b> in both groups stained positively for cH 2 AX, a marker for DNA damage, at 5 hrs after fertilization, just before DNA synthesis, while the maternal <b>pronuclei</b> were negative. We also found that both <b>pronuclei</b> in SCF zygotes with moderate DNA damage replicated normally, but paternal <b>pronuclei</b> in the SCF zygotes with severe DNA damage delayed the initiation of DNA replication by up to 12 hrs even though the maternal <b>pronuclei</b> had no discernable delay. Chromosomal analysis of both groups confirmed that the paternal DNA was degraded after S-phase while the maternal <b>pronuclei</b> formed normal chromosomes. The DNA replication delay caused a marked retardation in progression to the 2 -cell stage, and {{a large portion of}} the embryos arrested at the G 2 /M border, suggesting that this is an important checkpoint in zygotic development.

In some species, the spermatozoon will also contribute a centriole, which will help make up the zygotic centrosome required for the first division.

Currently under investigation is the possibility of other cytoplasmic contributions made to the embryo by the spermatozoon.|$|E
40|$|Telomeres are {{chromosome}} ends {{that control}} functions related to cell division. Short telomeres are proposed to underlie infertility, female reproductive ageing and abnormal embryogenesis, {{but there is}} little direct evidence on telomere length in gametes and embryos. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure telomere lengths in individual human oocytes, spermatozoa, male and female <b>pronuclei,</b> in order to compare parental contributions to telomere lengths in the human zygote. Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to measure average telomere length in <b>pronuclei</b> of oocytes fertilized for research using a known fertile sperm sample. <b>Pronuclei</b> derived from male and female gametes were distinguished by 5 -methylcytosine staining. Results were compared with those for unfertilized mature and immature oocytes and individual spermatozoa decondensed in vitro. Fifty unselected men and one sperm donor provided semen samples and 32 women donated oocytes surplus to IVF treatment. Telomeres in mature oocytes and female <b>pronuclei</b> were significantly longer than those in individual spermatozoa and male <b>pronuclei</b> (P < 0. 0001). Telomeres were longer in immature oocytes than in mature oocytes (P < 0. 04). Sperm telomere length increased with male age (P < 0. 05). Neither sperm nor oocyte telomere lengths were significantly associated with clinical parameters or outcome of treatment. In conclusion, telomere length measurements directly comparing human <b>pronuclei</b> under identical conditions show that male-derived telomeres are shorter on average than female-derived telomeres at fertilization. We propose that from this starting point, telomere lengths are probably modified by recombination events in the oocyte until telomerase increases at the blastocyst stage. Our findings do not support the use of gamete telomere lengths as a fertility diagnostic tool...|$|R

50|$|A <b>pronucleus</b> (plural: pronuclei) is {{the nucleus}} of a sperm or an egg cell {{during the process of}} fertilization, after the sperm enters the ovum, but before the genetic {{material}} of the sperm and egg fuse. Sperm and egg cells are haploid, meaning they carry half the number of chromosomes of somatic cells. The male and female pronuclei don't fuse, although their genetic material does. Instead, their membranes dissolve, leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes. Their chromosomes can then combine and become part of a single diploid nucleus in the resulting embryo, containing a full set of chromosomes.|$|E

The oocytes from virgin female mice, morulae and blastocytes from mated females, and gametes {{from the sea}} urchin Lytechnius variegatis are studied using mouse monoclonal antibodies to nuclear lamin A/C, monoclonal antibody to P 1, human autoimmune antibodies to lamin A/C, and to lamin B. The mouse fertilization data reveal no lamins on the oocyte; however, lamins are present on the <b>pronuclei,</b> and chromosomes are found on the oocytes and <b>pronuclei.</b> It is detected that on the sea urchin sperm the lamins are reduced to acrosomal and centriolar fossae and peripheral antigens are around the sperm nucleus. The mouse sperm bind lamin antibodies regionally and do not contain antigens. Lamins and antigens are observed on both <b>pronuclei</b> and chromosomes during sea urchin fertilization. Mouse embryogenesis reveals that lamin A/C is not recognized at morula and blastocyst stages; however, lamin B stains are retained. In sea urchin embryogenesis lamin recognition is lost at the blastrula, gastrula, and plutei stages. It is noted that nuclear lamins lost during spermatogenesis are restored at fertilization and peripheral antigens {{are associated with the}} surface of chromosomes during meiosis and mitosis and with the periphery of the <b>pronuclei</b> and nuclei during interphase...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{published}} experimental data, Newton’s laws, and Coulomb’s law, {{we investigate}} natural and normal pronuclear movements in wild types of eggs and develop physics models {{to fit the}} experimental data quantitatively. The difference between our modeling calculated results and the experimental data is less than 20 %. Our models explain why and how <b>pronuclei</b> move in even or in variant velocities. We hypothesize: During the migration, positively charged asters (or self assembled microtubules) drive two negatively charged sperm and egg <b>pronuclei</b> to move towards each other. The driving force comes from a spontaneous and strong Electromagnetic Field (EMF). Hamilton’s principle determines the path of these movements. A natural and normal EMF inside or around the <b>pronuclei</b> can be alternated environmentally. An abnormal EMF could induce aberrant embryos that cause life disease.

50|$|In human fertilization, {{a release}} ovum (a haploid {{secondary}} oocyte with replicate chromosome copies) and a haploid sperm cell (male gamete)—combine {{to form a}} single 2n diploid cell called the zygote. Once the single sperm enters the oocyte, it completes {{the division of the}} second meiosis forming a haploid daughter with only 23 chromosomes, almost all of the cytoplasm, and the sperm in its own <b>pronucleus.</b> The other product of meiosis is the second polar body with only chromosomes but no ability to replicate or survive. In the fertilized daughter, DNA is then replicated in the two separate pronuclei derived from the sperm and ovum, making the zygote's chromosome number temporarily 4n diploid. After approximately 30 hours from the time of fertilization, fusion of the pronuclei and immediate mitotic division produce two 2n diploid daughter cells called blastomeres.|$|E
50|$|A {{chromosome}} in a diploid organism is hemizygous {{when only}} one copy is present. The cell or organism {{is called a}} hemizygote. Hemizygosity is also observed when one copy of a gene is deleted, or in the heterogametic sex when a gene is located on a sex chromosome. Hemizygosity must {{not be confused with}} haploinsufficiency, which describes a mechanism for producing a phenotype. For organisms in which the male is heterogametic, such as humans, almost all X-linked genes are hemizygous in males with normal chromosomes because they have only one X chromosome and few of the same genes are on the Y chromosome. Transgenic mice generated through exogenous DNA microinjection of an embryo's <b>pronucleus</b> are also considered to be hemizygous because the introduced allele is expected to be incorporated into only one copy of any locus. A transgenic can later be bred to homozygosity and maintained as an inbred line to reduce the need to confirm the genotypes of each litter.|$|E
50|$|The sperm {{contributes}} a <b>pronucleus</b> and a centriole to the egg. Most {{other components}} and organelles are rapidly degraded. Mitochondria are rapidly ubiquinated and destroyed. Oxidative stress theory is a hypothesis {{that it is}} evolutionarily favourable for mitochondria from the father to be destroyed, as it {{there is a greater}} possibility that the mitochondrial DNA has become mutated or damaged. This is because mtDNA is not protected by histones and has poor repair mechanisms. Due to the increased metabolic activity of the sperm compared to the egg, due to its motility, there is greater production of reactive oxygen species and therefore greater chance of mutation. Furthermore, sperm are exposed to reactive oxygen species from leukocytes in the epididymis during transit. Additionally, quality control of spermatozoa is much worse than for the ovum, as many sperm are released whereas only one dominant follicle is released per cycle. This competitive selection helps to ensure the most 'fit' ova are selected for fertilisation.|$|E
40|$|Microtubules forming {{within the}} mouse egg during {{fertilization}} {{are required for}} the movements leading to the union of the sperm and egg nuclei (male and female <b>pronuclei,</b> respectively). In the unfertilized oocyte, microtubules are predominantly found in the arrested meiotic spindle. At the time for sperm incorporation, a dozen cytoplasmic asters assemble, often associated with the <b>pronuclei.</b> As the <b>pronuclei</b> move to the egg center, these asters enlarge into a dense array. At the end of first interphase, the dense array disassembles and is replaced by sheaths of microtubules surrounding the adjacent <b>pronuclei.</b> Syngamy (pronuclear fusion) is not observed; rather the adjacent paternal and maternal chromosome sets first meet at metaphase. The mitotic apparatus emerges from these perinuclear microtubules and is barrel-shaped and anastral, reminiscent of plant cell spindles; the sperm centriole does not nucleate mitotic microtubules. After cleavage, monasters extend from each blastomere nucleus. The second division mitotic spindles also have broad poles, though by third and later divisions the spindles are typical for higher animals, with narrow mitotic poles and fusiform shapes. Colcemid, griseofulvin, and nocodazole inhibit the microtubule formation and prevent the movements leading to pronuclear union; the meiotic spindle is disassembled, and the maternal chromosomes are scattered throughout the oocyte cortex. These results indicate that microtubules forming within fertilized mouse oocytes are required for the union of the sperm and egg nuclei and {{raise questions about the}} paternal inheritance of centrioles in mammals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{ability to}} analyze {{individual}} cells rather than averaged properties over {{a population is}} a major step towards understanding the fundamental elements of biological systems. Recent advances in microbiology such as cloning demonstrate that increasingly complex micromanipulation strategies for manipulating individual biological cells are required.

50|$|In C. elegans, {{a series}} of {{asymmetric}} cell divisions in the early embryo are critical in setting up the anterior/posterior, dorsal/ventral, and left/right axes of the body plan. After fertilization, events are already occurring in the one cell stage embryo {{to allow for the}} first asymmetric cell division. This first division produces two distinctly different blastomeres, termed AB and P1. When the sperm fertilizes the egg, the sperm nucleus and centrosomes are deposited within the egg, which causes a cytoplasmic flux resulting in the movement of the sperm <b>pronucleus</b> and centrosomes towards one pole. The centrosomes deposited by the sperm seem to be responsible for the establishment of the posterior pole within the one cell embryo. Studies have shown that the pole in which the sperm-derived centrosomes reside always becomes the posterior pole. Furthermore, sperm with mutant or absent centrosomes fail to establish a posterior pole, while enucleated sperm with intact centrosomes successfully fertilize the egg and set up the posterior pole. The establishment of this polarity initiates the polarized distribution of a group of proteins present in the zygote called the PAR proteins (partitioning-defective), which are a conserved group of proteins that function in establishing cell polarity during development. These proteins are initially distributed uniformly throughout the zygote and then become polarized with the creation of the posterior pole. This series of events allows the single celled zygote to obtain polarity through an unequal distribution of multiple factors.|$|E
40|$|SummaryA male <b>pronucleus</b> migrates {{toward the}} center of an egg to reach the female <b>pronucleus</b> for zygote formation. This {{migration}} depends on microtubules growing from two centrosomes associated with the male <b>pronucleus.</b> Two mechanisms were previously proposed for this migration: a “pushing mechanism,” which uses the pushing force resulting from microtubule polymerization, and a “pulling mechanism,” which uses the length-dependent pulling force generated by minus-end-directed motors anchored throughout the cytoplasm. We combined two computer-assisted analyses to examine the relative contribution of these mechanisms to male pronuclear migration. Computer simulation revealed an intrinsic difference in migration behavior of the male <b>pronucleus</b> between the pushing and pulling mechanisms. In vivo measurements using image processing showed that the actual migration behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans confirms the pulling mechanism. A male <b>pronucleus</b> having a single centrosome migrated toward the single aster. We propose that the pulling mechanism is the primary mechanism for male pronuclear migration...|$|E
40|$|Both pronuclei of the zygote undergo {{epigenetic}} changes after fertilization, which {{determines the}} quality of the zygote and successful early mammalian embryonic development. Shortly after fertilization epigenetic asymmetry among the pronuclei of the zygote is evident, while the paternal <b>pronucleus</b> undergoes active DNA demethylation, the DNA of the maternal <b>pronucleus</b> remains methylated. The male <b>pronucleus</b> in addition undergoes histone acetylation, whereas the histones of the female <b>pronucleus</b> remain methylated. Asymmetry of pronuclei and their epigenetic status predicts successful reprogramming of the genome, and thus the success of embryonic development. For the successful development of the embryo is therefore required correct formation of both of these pronuclei of the zygote and this formation of pronuclei is regulated by post-translational histone modifications called histone code. It was hypothesized that the histone code is regulated by the activity of NADP+ - dependent histone deacetylases, sirtuins. In the experiment were used fully grown in vitro maturated pig oocytes that were fertilized with pig spermatozoa in vitro. After isolation of zygotes cultured with addition of the activator sirtuin resveratrol was performed immunofluorescence analysis of acetylated and methylated histone H 3 at lysine K 9 of pronuclei of the zygotes. From the results of control group asymmetry between the pronuclei of the zygote is evident; wherein the male <b>pronucleus</b> exhibits higher acetylation intensity contrast female <b>pronucleus</b> exhibits higher methylation intensity. After adding resveratrol to all experimental groups female <b>pronucleus</b> showed a significant increase of the methylated histone H 3 at lysine K 9, and contrary to the male <b>pronucleus</b> significant decrease of acetylated histone H 3 at lysine K 9. Sirtuins are involved in the regulation of histone code in porcine zygote and it can be assumed that they also play a role during subsequent embryonic development, which is the subject of further study...|$|E

Each female was mated with one male and killed at 6, 8, 10, or 12 h postcoitus (p. c.).

In the AGX group, although the percentage of embryos with I or 2 <b>pronuclei</b> in S-phase was not significantly {{different from that of the}} SH group, the percentage of 8 -h embryos with 2 <b>pronuclei</b> in S-phase was 51. 6 ± 2. 8, significantly lower than in the SH control (68. 1 ± 6. 0, p < 0. 05). When the embryos were labeled with BrdU for 6 h, the percentages of embryos with 1 or 2 <b>pronuclei</b> in S-phase were not different among the 4 groups.
