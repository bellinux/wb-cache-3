40|$|Much of {{research}} and development work has been dedicated to implement the heat and mass transfer using microchannel technology; however, it is not yet cost effective and is limited to higher end applications such as electronics cooling and selected applications in automotive and aircraft heat exchangers. The work on mass transfer application of micro channels also has been very limited, despite the very high potential contribution of micro channels for mass transfer enhancement. Scaling up of microchannel equipment presents several manufacturing and process organization challenges such as flow distribution inside microchannels, cost, fouling, high pressure drops etc. This thesis presents the development of a cost effective and compact tubular manifold microchannel heat and mass exchanger (MMHX) for industrial applications. A novel design for the flow distribution manifolds has been proposed. The proposed manifold helps in the enhancement of heat and mass transfer by creating better flow mixing. The MMHX is designed {{in such a way that}} the manifold causes the flow to break into multiple passes of very short flow lengths in the microchannels. These flow lengths are short enough such that the flow in the channels is always into entry zone (developing laminar zone) both hydrodynamically as well as thermally, resulting in higher heat transfer than that in the fully developed laminar flow in conventional microchannel heat exchangers. The pressure drop in the device is low as the fluid flow length into the microchannels is very short. While the manifold design helps in flow distribution, very short flow length inside the microchannels mitigates the problems of flow instability of two-phase heat transfer applications such as that in evaporators and condensers. The mass transfer in gas liquid reaction applications is enhanced due to the multiple passes where continuous breaking of the gas liquid interface as well as mixing of the bulk liquid occurs. A multi-pass microchannel heat and mass exchanger prototype was designed, fabricated and was experimentally tested for the performance as liquid-liquid heat exchanger, evaporator, condenser and gas- liquid absorber. Experiments were carried out by changing the liquid and gas flow rates, geometry of the microchannels and the size of the manifold. Flow visualization studies were also performed to study two phase flow distribution and flow pattern in the manifold. Experimental results have shown that the mass transfer coefficient (using CO 2 and DEA-water solution) for the microchannel absorber is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the conventional absorber. This increase in mass transfer is mainly attributed to high interfacial area to volume ratio of microchannels and good mixing in the manifold. Similarly, heat transfer coefficient for the single phase heat transfer as well as for two phase heat transfer (evaporator and condenser) is about 3 to 8 times higher than the conventional heat exchangers such as shell and tube or <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> High transfer rates enable us to design compact heat and mass transfer devices for the industrial applications. Industrial processes, such as carbon capture, which are not economically viable due to their high cost, can be feasible with the development of these next generation heat and mass transfer equipment. Due to the simplicity of the component design and the assembly, cost of the industrial scale equipment can be substantially lower as compared other compact heat exchangers.

40|$|Fouling of heat {{treatment}} {{equipment in the}} dairy processing industry is an expensive and persistent problem. The objective of this work {{was to develop a}} better understanding of the mechanisms of dairy fouling in heat exchangers and identify methods to control this build-up. This was part of a larger project investigating the interaction between spore-forming thermophilic bacilli (thermophiles) contamination and fouling deposits on internal surfaces of equipment. Two systems were developed to monitor the onset and build-up of fouling on the internal surfaces of two research heat exchangers. The first used a commercial sensor to measure the local heat flux and the temperature on the hot side of a <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The heat transfer coefficient was calculated and normalised with its value at the start of the run to reflect the contribution of fouling deposits to the thermal resistance, thus giving a real-time estimate of the rate of fouling. The second system used an energy balance over a tubular type heat exchanger and measured inlet and outlet temperatures to estimate the overall heat transfer coefficient thus giving a global measurement of fouling over the tubular heat exchanger. In both systems the plot of normalised heat transfer coefficient over time often stayed constant over an induction period, which was followed by a falling period indicative of growth in the fouling layer thickness and/or mass. Each system was validated by comparing the final value of the normalised heat transfer coefficient with direct measurements of fouling made at the end of a run namely: fouling deposit height for the local measurement and fouling deposit mass for the global measurement. The normalised heat transfer coefficient reported by each system correlated well with the corresponding direct measurement of the fouling layer. An important factor identified in this study was the effect of air bubble nucleation on fouling deposits. It was shown that bubbles that formed on the heated surface greatly reduced the length of the induction period to a matter of seconds rather than hours, as found in previous studies of fouling in the absence of surface bubbles. The rate of fouling was also enhanced while the bubbles remained at the surface. The structure of bubble type fouling layers was linked to the behaviour of the bubbles at the heated surface. Visual observations of these bubbles showed evidence of growth, vibration and coalescence during their period of attachment to the heated surface. Deposits from bubble type fouling consisted of all solid components found in the original milk solution, except lactose, in approximately the same ratio. By contrast fouling deposits reported in the literature with systems operating under the traditional protein denaturation mechanism were reported to consist mainly of whey proteins. Bubble induced fouling can be limited in a number of ways, the most effective being to maintain a high operating pressure in the equipment to ensure nucleation does not occur. Experiments conducted in this study showed that a pressure of 130 kPa. g was sufficient to suppress all bubble nucleation at the heated surface at a temperature of 90 Â°C. Another method identified was the use of high linear fluid velocities to entrain any surface bubbles into the processing stream immediately upon nucleation. Linear velocities above 1. 0 m/s were shown to achieve this goal in the miniature plate heat exchanger tested. However, this method is only partially successful because the local linear velocity varies with position in heat exchange equipment of complex geometries and can drop below the mainstream average velocity causing surface bubbles to form, especially in recirculation regions behind flow obstacles. A more reliable method, in situations where high operating pressures could not be used, involved conditioning the heated surface with a thin protein layer during the first few minutes of a run. Conditioning the surface resulted in bubble suppression even at high temperatures and low pressures, thus greatly extending the length of the induction period. Trials performed in this study showed that the addition of a proteolytic enzyme produced by psychrotrophic microbes greatly increased fouling. The enzyme destabilised the caseins which could attach directly to the heat exchange surface independently from the bubble fouling mechanism. Thus the quality of the milk is another important factor to consider. However, the addition of enzymes produced by thermophilic bacilli isolated from milk powder plants did not increase fouling. A theory describing the air bubble induced fouling mechanism is presented along with recommendations on how to reduce this fouling contamination in processing equipment...|$|E
