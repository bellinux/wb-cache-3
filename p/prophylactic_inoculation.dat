6000|$|The trouble {{does not}} end with the matter to be inoculated. There is the {{question}} of the condition of the patient. The discoveries of Sir Almroth Wright have shown that the appalling results which led to the hasty dropping in 1894 of Koch's tuberculin were not accidents, but perfectly orderly and inevitable phenomena following the injection of dangerously strong [...] "vaccines" [...] at the wrong moment, and reinforcing the disease instead of stimulating the resistance to it. To ascertain the right moment a laboratory and a staff of experts are needed. The general practitioner, having no such laboratory and no such experience, has always chanced it, and insisted, when he was unlucky, that the results were not due to the inoculation, but to some other cause: a favorite and not very tactful one being the drunkenness or licentiousness of the patient. But though a few doctors have now learnt the danger of inoculating without any reference to the patient's [...] "opsonic index" [...] at the moment of inoculation, and though those other doctors who are denouncing the danger as imaginary and opsonin as a craze or a fad, obviously do so because it involves an operation which they have neither the means nor the knowledge to perform, there is still no grasp of the economic change in the situation. They have never been warned that the practicability of any method of extirpating disease depends not only on its efficacy, but on its cost. For example, just at present the world has run raving mad on the subject of radium, which has excited our credulity precisely as the apparitions at Lourdes excited the credulity of Roman Catholics. Suppose it were ascertained that every child in the world could be rendered absolutely immune from all disease during its entire life by taking half an ounce of radium to every pint of its milk. The world would be none the healthier, because not even a Crown Prince--no, not even the son of a Chicago Meat King, could afford the treatment. Yet it is doubtful whether doctors would refrain from prescribing it on that ground. The recklessness with which they now recommend wintering in Egypt or at Davos to people who cannot afford to go to Cornwall, and the orders given for champagne jelly and old port in households where such luxuries must obviously be acquired at the cost of stinting necessaries, often make one wonder whether it is possible for a man to go through a medical training and retain a spark of common sense. This sort of inconsiderateness gets cured only in the classes where poverty, pretentious as it is even at its worst, cannot pitch its pretences high enough {{to make it possible for}} the doctor (himself often no better off than the patient) to assume that the average income of an English family is about 2,000 pounds a year, and that it is quite easy to break up a home, sell an old family seat at a sacrifice, and retire into a foreign sanatorium devoted to some [...] "treatment" [...] that did not exist two years ago and probably will not exist (except as a pretext for keeping an ordinary hotel) two years hence. In a poor practice the doctor must find cheap treatments for cheap people, or humiliate and lose his patients either by prescribing beyond their means or sending them to the public hospitals. When it comes to <b>prophylactic</b> <b>inoculation,</b> the alternative lies between the complete scientific process, which can only be brought down to a reasonable cost by being very highly organized as a public service in a public institution, and such cheap, nasty, dangerous and scientifically spurious imitations as ordinary vaccination, which seems not unlikely to be ended, like its equally vaunted forerunner, XVIII. century inoculation, by a purely reactionary law making all sorts of vaccination, scientific or not, criminal offences. Naturally, the poor doctor (that is, the average doctor) defends ordinary vaccination frantically, as it means to him the bread of his children. To secure the vehement and practically unanimous support of the rank and file of the medical profession for any sort of treatment or operation, all that is necessary is that it can be easily practised by a rather shabbily dressed man in a surgically dirty room in a surgically dirty house without any assistance, and that the materials for it shall cost, say, a penny, and the charge for it to a patient with 100 pounds a year be half-a-crown. And, on the other hand, a hygienic measure has only to be one of such refinement, difficulty, precision and costliness as to be quite beyond the resources of private practice, to be ignored or angrily denounced as a fad.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} manifestations {{and course}} of rheu-matic fever {{have been studied}} mainly in children. Recently {{a number of studies}} of this disease in military personnel have been reported (Gray, 1949; Carmichael, 1956; Bates, 1958; Slater and Rosen-baum, 1959). In these series, patients with a past history of rheumatic fever were included, which may have modified both the clinical manifestations and subsequent progress. The present paper deals with the characteristic features of rheumatic fever occurring {{for the first time in}} young adults. Material A series of 27 patients diagnosed as having rheumatic fever on the criteria of Duckett Jones (1944) were amongst more than one hundred admissions for acute arthropathy to a Service Hospital between 1956 and 1959. 26 of the patients were male and one female. Their ages varied between 15 and 23, the majority being in their late 'teens. Care was taken that no patients were included in this series who had a past history of rheumatic fever, chorea, or arthropathy of unknown cause. Because of the difficulty in differentiating between rheumatic fever and other allergic arthropathies, patients who had had <b>prophylactic</b> <b>inoculations</b> or symptoms suggestive of dysentery in the 8 weeks before admission were also excluded from this series. Clinical and Pathological Findings The family history of five patients (20 per cent.) indicated that one or both parents had suffered from rheumatic fever.

40|$|The {{principles}} {{upon which}} <b>prophylactic</b> <b>inoculation</b> against typhoid fever is based are unquestionably sound, and {{there can be}} no doubt of the fact that the procedure has considerably diminished the incidence of the disease during the last thirty years. The instances of the failure of antityphoid vaccine to protect against infection are, however, not so rare as to preclude the possibility that some of the vaccines now in use are not as efficient as they should be. Practically all the vaccine used in this country is made from the Rawlins strain of Bacterium typhosum [...] a culture isolated by Sir Almroth Wright in 1903 [...] although our knowledge of bacterial dissociation strongly suggests that such an old culture would by now have become considerably altered in antigenic composition.

40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} effects of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>inoculation</b> of {{optimized}} hα-synuclein(hα-syn) DNA vaccine on the dopaminergic neurons suffering from acute neurotoxin injury. Methods The optimized DNA vaccine,designated as pVAX 1 -IL- 4 /SYN-B,was prepared. The C 57 BL mice were grouped as pVAX 1 -IL- 4 /SYN-B group,pVAX 1 group and PBS group. Animals in each group received 3 times of 50 μl injection of plasmid pVAX 1 -IL- 4 /SYN-B,plasmid pVAX 1 or PBS,respectively,in the anterior tibial muscle of either posterior limb. Two weeks after the last injection,all the mice were then given intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg MPTP with an attempt to reproduce the model of Parkinson’s disease(PD) 4 times with a 2 h interval. The changes in behavior of mice were observed when the model was being reproduced to verify if the model was reproduced. Mice were sacrificed at 1 st, 3 rd and 7 th day(6 each) after the last injection of MPTP. The expression of COX- 2 mRNA {{at each time point}} was detected by RT-PCR,and the expressive changes in COX- 2 and CD 11 b(representing the activated state of microglia) were detected with immunohistochemistry assay. Results The PD mouse model was successfully reproduced. The number of positive COX- 2 and CD 11 b cells was remarkably decreased in pVAX 1 -IL- 4 /SYN-B group than in pVAX 1 group and PBS group,while no significant difference was found between the latter 2 groups(P > 0. 05). The results of RT-PCR showed that COX- 2 mRNA expression in all the 3 groups at the 1 st, 3 rd and 7 th day after last injection of MPTP was slight on the 1 st day,peak value appeared on the 3 rd day,and it then declined on the 7 th day. At each time point,the COX- 2 mRNA expression in pVAX 1 -IL- 4 /SYN-B group(0. 28 ± 0. 07, 0. 59 ± 0. 07 and 0. 45 ± 0. 05 at day 1, 3 and 7) was significantly lower(P 0. 05).

40|$|Before the {{consolidation}} of the germ theory of human diseases {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, medical explanations about disease causation were dominated by the environmental notions of medical geography. This dissertation explores how nineteenth-century Colombian physicians transformed the medical geographical approach using the early concepts and technologies of the emerging Pasteurian germ theory. I follow this transformation in the cases of periodic fevers (yellow fever and malaria), continuous fevers (typhoid fever and typhus) and leprosy. The analysis reveals that by mid century physicians had incorporated neo-Hippocratic versions of disease causation and French medical geographical ideas in order to make sense of disease of the warm, temperate and cold lands. Their conceptual network revolved around the specific, predisposing and occasional causes in which climate and geography played a determinant role. Evidence indicates that this was the case of periodic fevers of the warm lands (yellow fever and malaria). I argue that the “parasitic” hypothesis of yellow fever was accepted during the controversy around the <b>prophylactic</b> <b>inoculations</b> inspired by Pasteurism that were applied in Colombia in 1887. However, doctors struggled to reconcile the medical geographical and the bacteriological perspective of both yellow fever and malaria. Continuous fevers, on the other hand, were also framed within the medical geography scheme of disease causation. I show how during the debates about typhoid fever and typhus happening in the Colombian highlands during the 70 s, 80 s and 90 s, doctors used medical geographical notions and developed anti-pasteurian arguments, while the international scientific community had identified the specific bacilli for typhoid fever. Finally, I argue that the strong interest of Colombian doctors on leprosy –also understood in neo-Hippocratic terms- that foster the search for local treatments based on Pasteurism (antiseptics in the 1880 s and serotherapy in the 1890 s) also prompted the extension of the bacteriological model and techniques to other diseases in those decades.

Clinical, virologic, immunologic, and hemostatic parameters were monitored. Five daily inocula-tions of 5 x 105 units of either interferon product per kilogram of body weight, initiated 24 hours before or 6 hours after RVFV infection, prevented or greatly suppressed viremia. No clinical signs of disease or laboratory evidence of impaired hemostasis was observed.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of rabbits vaccinated with living {{tubercle}} bacilli of human type and subsequently exposed to tuberculosis under conditions simulating the natural modes of human contagion. In view of the present world-wide study of the <b>prophylactic</b> <b>inoculation</b> of human beings with BCG and other vaccines, the desirability of a method by which the safety and efficacy of a given procedure can be tested in small laboratory animals is obvious. The method employed in the present experiments can be used to throw light upon this and other problems in tuberculosis. That conclusions drawn from inoculation experiments are not directly applicable to infection under natural conditions has been shown in the extensive experience of the last two decades with the vaccination of cattle. Although cattle treated with the bovovaccine of yon Behring resisted for several months fatal doses of tubercle bacilli of bovine type introduced artificially, these animals nevertheless acquired tuberculosis when stabled {{for a year or more}} with cattle scattering tubercle bacilli (1). On the other hand it has been shown (2) that the laborious process of exposing experimental animals to tuberculosis by contact presents a much closer analogy to the disease as it occurs naturally in man. The original observations of Robert Koch, showing that guinea pigs and rabbits acquire tuberculosis by contact with tuberculous animals, has found wide confirmafion (3) in recent years. In the laboratory of The Phipps Institute, investigations on contact tuberculosis in the guinea pig (2) have clearly distinguished infection acquired by way of the alimentary, and by way of the respiratory tract, and showed that the route of infection depended on the relative intensity of exposure by one or the other channel (2). 1 As in man, the engrafting of tuberculosi...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores German efforts during 1754 - 1800 to {{curb the}} {{suffering}} and death from smallpox, known as the Würgengel (murdering angel) for carrying so many innocent young children to Heaven. It focusses on the period immediately before {{the introduction of the}} safer cowpox vaccination, when the highly controversial <b>prophylactic,</b> <b>inoculation,</b> was used in Germany. Inoculation entailed the insertion of a small amount of human smallpox matter into the skin to produce a usually mild smallpox disease that prevented more severe smallpox in future. As the epitome of the rationalist ideology that man should take control of his own destiny and as a novel example of disease prophylaxis, inoculation was closely aligned with the Enlightenment. This thesis shows that enlightened German princes, nobles, and high-profile women encouraged inoculation, yet the princes’ deliberate initiatives to spread inoculation in their territories generally failed and the university-educated cohort of German society drove the efforts to promote the advantages of inoculation and encourage its use, in the face of many obstacles. The intelligentsia which sought to promote behaviours consistent with enlightenment ideology played a prominent role in that regard. Not only as commentators and public officials but also as owners and editors of the new kinds of general journals, and as reviewers, they encouraged a positive public attitude to inoculation. Poets and writers played their part by turning fictional as well as real women who chose inoculation to save their beauty or children from smallpox into ‘inoculation heroines’. Like-minded university professors taught their students about inoculation, and doctors encouraged the practice by reporting inoculation successes and by teaching surgeons the procedures. Many pastors promoted inoculation in their sermons and in articles in various kinds of general journals, in some cases engaging in inoculation themselves. Yet, despite the encouragement to adopt inoculation and concerted efforts to dispel the doubts about it, for myriad different reasons inoculation failed to gain popularity, particularly among the non-elite. Reminders that isolation measures had banished bubonic plague in earlier times fuelled a wave of utopian optimism in the 1790 s that a reintroduction of such measures and a united effort could actually eradicate smallpox in the coming century which was being spruiked as a new age of peace and prosperity. The unrealistic goal of eradicating smallpox, considering the lack of new tools, was largely inspired by the revolutionaries in France casting aside the aristocratic governing class in 1789, demonstrating that seemingly impossible dreams could be achieved by a unity of purpose. This thesis shows the various ways in which the Enlightenment and other social, cultural, and political influences which pervaded Germany during the 1754 - 1800 period jointly shaped the approaches to combating smallpox by inoculation and other measures at that time...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Delivery of type I IFN transgenes by naked DNA {{immunization}} {{can protect}} against cytomegalovirus infection and myocarditis. Here, we investigate IFN transgene expression, antiviral efficacy, and immunomodulation of myocarditis using various treatment regimes in a mouse CMV model. In vivo {{expression of the}} IFN transgene was observed in the sera for 35 days post-DNA <b>inoculation.</b> <b>Prophylactic</b> IFN-A 6 and IFN-B DNA treatment for 14 days prior to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection was more efficacious in significantly reducing viral titres, than 2 days prior to or 2 days post-virus infection. Similarly, IFN-A 6 DNA treatment commencing 14 days prior to virus infection was superior in suppressing both acute and chronic myocarditis. Furthermore, reduction of autoantibody titres was more pronounced when IFN was administered 14 days prior to viral infection. Combinational IFN gene therapy was assessed for synergy between IFN subtypes. Combination treatment with either IFN-A 6 /A 9 or IFN-A 6 /B greatly reduced spleen viral titres while IFN-A 6 /B and IFN-A 9 /B reduced virus replication in the liver. Only IFN-A 6 /A 9 and IFN-A 9 /B reduced acute viral myocarditis, whereas IFNA 6 /B treatment was most efficacious for autoimmune chronic myocarditis. Finally, treatment with IFN-A 6 DNA 2 weeks post-MCMV infection proved effective at inhibiting the development of chronic autoimmune myocarditis.

Treatment of discitis is not always successful and the key to management is prevention. Intradiscal prophylaxis with antibiotic is routinely used in spinal surgery, but there is a limited understanding of how well antibiotics can enter the avascular disc after intravenous injection. An in vivo ovine study to optimise prophylactic and parenteral treatment of discitis is described to assess the effectiveness of cephazolin in preventing and treating infection. The concentration of cephazolin was measured in disc tissue from normal and degenerate sheep discs to determine if cephazolin can enter the disc and if disc degeneration affects antibiotic uptake. Fourteen sheep were deliberately inoculated with bacteria to induce discitis. Eight sheep ("prophylaxis" group) were given either a 0, 1, 2 or 3 g dose of <b>prophylactic</b> cephazolin before <b>inoculation</b> while the remaining sheep ("treatment" group) were treated with cephazolin commencing 7 days after inoculation for 21 days at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. Histopathology and radiography were used to assess the effect of the different treatments. Cephazolin was given 30 min prior to sacrifice and the intradiscal concentration was measured by biochemistry. In the "prophylaxis" group all doses of antibiotic provided some protection against infection, although it was not dose dependent. In the "treatment" group discitis was confirmed radiologically and histologically in all animals from 2 weeks onwards. Biochemical assay confirmed that antibiotic is distributed throughout the disc but was present in higher concentration in the anulus fibrosus than the nucleus pulposus. This study demonstrated that whilst the incidence of iatrogenic discitis can be reduced by antibiotic prophylaxis, it could not be abolished in all incidences with a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as cephazolin. Furthermore, antibiotics were ineffective at preventing endplate destruction once an intradiscal inoculum was established. Walters, Rebecca; Rahmat, Razmi; Fraser, Robert; Moore, Rober...|$|R
6000|$|After all, the {{progress}} illusion {{is not so}} very subtle. We begin by reading the satires of our fathers' contemporaries; and we conclude (usually quite ignorantly) that the abuses exposed by them are things of the past. We see also that reforms of crying evils are frequently produced by the sectional shifting of political power from oppressors to oppressed. The poor man is given a vote by the Liberals {{in the hope that}} he will cast it for his emancipators. The hope is not fulfilled; but the lifelong imprisonment of penniless men for debt ceases; Factory Acts are passed to mitigate sweating; schooling is made free and compulsory; sanitary by-laws are multiplied; public steps are taken to house the masses decently; the bare-footed get boots; rags become rare; and bathrooms and pianos, smart tweeds and starched collars, reach numbers of people who once, as [...] "the unsoaped," [...] played the Jew's harp or the accordion in moleskins and belchers. Some of these changes are gains: some of them are losses. Some of them are not changes at all: all of them are merely the changes that money makes. Still, they produce an illusion of bustling progress; and the reading class infers from them that the abuses of the early Victorian period no longer exist except as amusing pages in the novels of Dickens. But the moment we look for a reform due to character and not to money, to statesmanship and not to interest or mutiny, we are disillusioned. For example, we remembered the maladministration and incompetence revealed by the Crimean War as part of a bygone state of things until the South African war shewed that the nation and the War Office, like those poor Bourbons who have been so impudently blamed for a universal characteristic, had learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. We had hardly recovered from the fruitless irritation of this discovery when it transpired that the officers' mess of our most select regiment included a flogging club presided over by the senior subaltern. The disclosure provoked some disgust at the details of this schoolboyish debauchery, but no surprise at the apparent absence of any conception of manly honor and virtue, of personal courage and self-respect, in the front rank of our chivalry. In civil affairs we had assumed that the sycophancy and idolatry which encouraged Charles I. to undervalue the Puritan revolt of the XVII century had been long outgrown; but it has needed nothing but favorable circumstances to revive, with added abjectness to compensate for its lost piety. We have relapsed into disputes about transubstantiation at the very moment when the discovery of the wide prevalence of theophagy as a tribal custom has deprived us of the last excuse for believing that our official religious rites differ in essentials from those of barbarians. The Christian doctrine of the uselessness of punishment and the wickedness of revenge has not, in spite of its simple common sense, found a single convert among the nations: Christianity means nothing to the masses but a sensational public execution which is made an excuse for other executions. In its name we take ten years of a thief's life minute by minute in the slow misery and degradation of modern reformed imprisonment with as little remorse as Laud and his Star Chamber clipped the ears of Bastwick and Burton. We dug up and mutilated the remains of the Mahdi the other day exactly as we dug up and mutilated the remains of Cromwell two centuries ago. We have demanded the decapitation of the Chinese Boxer princes as any Tartar would have done; and our military and naval expeditions to kill, burn, and destroy tribes and villages for knocking an Englishman on the head are so common a part of our Imperial routine that the last dozen of them has not called forth as much pity as can be counted on by any lady criminal. The judicial use of torture to extort confession {{is supposed to be a}} relic of darker ages; but whilst these pages are being written an English judge has sentenced a forger to twenty years penal servitude with an open declaration that the sentence will be carried out in full unless he confesses where he has hidden the notes he forged. And no comment whatever is made, either on this or on a telegram from the seat of war in Somaliland mentioning that certain information has been given by a prisoner of war [...] "under punishment." [...] Even if these reports are false, the fact that they are accepted without protest as indicating a natural and proper course of public conduct shews that we are still as ready to resort to torture as Bacon was. As to vindictive cruelty, an incident in the South African war, when the relatives and friends of a prisoner were forced to witness his execution, betrayed a baseness of temper and character which hardly leaves us the right to plume ourselves on our superiority to Edward III. at the surrender of Calais. And the democratic American officer indulges in torture in the Philippines just as the aristocratic English officer did in South Africa. The incidents of the white invasion of Africa in search of ivory, gold, diamonds, and sport, have proved that the modern European is the same beast of prey that formerly marched to the conquest of new worlds under Alexander, Antony, and Pizarro. Parliaments and vestries are just what they were when Cromwell suppressed them and Dickens derided them. The democratic politician remains exactly as Plato described him; the physician is still the credulous impostor and petulant scientific coxcomb whom Molière ridiculed; the schoolmaster remains at best a pedantic child farmer and at worst a flagellomaniac; arbitrations are more dreaded by honest men than lawsuits; the philanthropist is still a parasite on misery as the doctor is on disease; the miracles of priestcraft are none the less fraudulent and mischievous because they are now called scientific experiments and conducted by professors; witchcraft, in the modern form of patent medicines and <b>prophylactic</b> <b>inoculations,</b> is rampant; the landowner who is no longer powerful enough to; set the mantrap of Rhampsinitis improves on it by barbed wire; the modern gentleman who is too lazy to daub his face with vermilion as a symbol of bravery employs a laundress to daub his shirt with starch as a symbol of cleanliness; we shake our heads at the dirt of the middle ages in cities made grimy with soot and foul and disgusting with shameless tobacco smoking; holy water, in its latest form of disinfectant fluid, is more widely used and believed in than ever; public health authorities deliberately go through incantations with burning sulphur (which they know to be useless) because the people believe in it as devoutly as the Italian peasant believes in the liquefaction of the blood of St Januarius; and straightforward public lying has reached gigantic developments, there being nothing to choose in this respect between the pickpocket at the police station and the minister on the treasury bench, the editor in the newspaper office, the city magnate advertizing bicycle tires that do not side-slip, the clergyman subscribing the thirty-nine articles, and the vivisector who pledges his knightly honor that no animal operated on in the physiological laboratory suffers the slightest pain. Hypocrisy is at its worst; for we not only persecute bigotedly but sincerely in the name of the cure-mongering witchcraft we do believe in, but callously and hypocritically in the name of the Evangelical creed that our rulers privately smile at as the Italian patricians of the fifth century smiled at Jupiter and Venus. Sport is, as it has always been, murderous excitement; the impulse to slaughter is universal; and museums are set up throughout the country to encourage little children and elderly gentlemen to make collections of corpses preserved in alcohol, and to steal birds' eggs and keep them as the red Indian used to keep scalps. Coercion with the lash is as natural to an Englishman as it was to Solomon spoiling Rehoboam: indeed, the comparison is unfair to the Jews in view of the facts that the Mosaic law forbade more than forty lashes in the name of humanity, and that floggings of a thousand lashes were inflicted on English soldiers in the XVIII and XIX centuries, and would be inflicted still but for the change in the balance of political power between the military caste and the commercial classes and the proletariat. In spite of that change, flogging is still an institution in the public school, in the military prison, on the training ship, and in that school of littleness called the home. The lascivious clamor of the flagellomaniac for more of it, constant as the clamor for more insolence, more war, and lower rates, is tolerated and even gratified because, having no moral ends in view, we have sense enough to see that nothing but brute coercion can impose our selfish will on others. Cowardice is universal; patriotism, public opinion, parental duty, discipline, religion, morality, are only fine names for intimidation; and cruelty, gluttony, and credulity keep cowardice in countenance. We cut the throat of a calf and hang it up by the heels to bleed to death so that our veal cutlet may be white; we nail geese to a board and cram them with food because we like the taste of liver disease; we tear birds to pieces to decorate our women's hats; we mutilate domestic animals for no reason at all except to follow an instinctively cruel fashion; and we connive at the most abominable tortures in the hope of discovering some magical cure for our own diseases by them.|$|R
