5|$|The final <b>prosthetic</b> can {{be either}} fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the <b>prosthetic.</b> In each case an {{abutment}} {{is attached to the}} implant fixture. Where the <b>prosthetic</b> is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with lag screws or with dental cement. Where the <b>prosthetic</b> is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the <b>prosthetic</b> so that the two pieces can be secured together.|$|E
5|$|Rick Baker {{designed}} the Rondo Hatton-inspired <b>prosthetic</b> makeup {{designs for the}} Lothar character, portrayed by Tiny Ron Taylor.|$|E
5|$|To create Edward's scissor hands, Burton {{employed}} Stan Winston, {{who would}} later design the Penguin's <b>prosthetic</b> makeup in Batman Returns. Depp's wardrobe and <b>prosthetic</b> makeup took one hour and 45 minutes to apply. The giant topiaries that Edward creates in the film were made by wrapping metal skeletons in chicken wire, then weaving in thousands of small plastic plant sprigs. Rick Heinrichs worked {{as one of the}} art directors.|$|E
5|$|Mills booked {{herself into}} the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, which put her on a raw food vegan diet, using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound. After an operation, Mills {{discovered}} {{that she had been}} previously identified as having an O rhesus negative blood type, when in fact she was A rhesus negative, which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so-called blood type diet. As her <b>prosthetic</b> leg had to be replaced on a regular basis, because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed, she had the idea to collect thousands of discarded <b>prosthetic</b> limbs for amputees in Croatia. Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the <b>prosthetic</b> limbs before being transported, which resulted in 22,000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with <b>prosthetic</b> limbs by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients. The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994 and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the Good Morning with Anne and Nick daytime TV show. She received an award in 2001 from Croatia's prime minister, Ivica Račan for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines.|$|E
5|$|Petry's wounds {{resulted}} {{in his right}} arm having to be amputated below the elbow. He was evacuated to an American hospital in Germany, where he spent several weeks in recovery before being transferred to Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood, Texas. He now uses an advanced <b>prosthetic</b> in place of his right hand. On the <b>prosthetic</b> is a small plaque listing {{the names of the}} fallen Rangers of his regiment. After recovering, Petry did not seek a medical discharge; instead, he deployed to Afghanistan between recovering and receiving the Medal of Honor. He was later promoted to the rank of sergeant first class.|$|E
5|$|Some enzymes do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or <b>prosthetic</b> groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic <b>prosthetic</b> groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} three Emmy nominations in 2011, for Outstanding <b>Prosthetic</b> Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie or a Special; Outstanding Hairstyling for a Single-Camera Series; and Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.|$|E
5|$|The <b>prosthetic</b> phase begins {{once the}} implant is well {{integrated}} (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The <b>prosthetic</b> phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{went back}} to work for the WWF in 1992 and was given a new fan {{favorite}} character of an easygoing surfing Hawaiian who wore bright neon tights and utilized a new two-handed skull vice finisher called the Cranium Crunch. Crush made his televised debut in WWF under his new character on May 9, 1992 episode of Superstars, defeating Kato. Crush made his first pay-per-view appearance under the gimmick with a win over Repo Man at SummerSlam. Crush then engaged in a feud with Doink the Clown, after he was attacked with a loaded <b>prosthetic</b> arm while confronting the clown about his cruel pranks on children at ringside, which caused Crush to miss the 1993 Royal Rumble. The feud culminated at WrestleMania IX, where Crush lost after a second, identical Doink appeared from underneath the ring and struck Crush with the <b>prosthetic</b> arm. At the first King of the Ring pay-per-view, Crush challenged Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship, but lost the match after a distraction by Doink.|$|E
5|$|Caglione and Drexler were {{recommended}} for the <b>prosthetic</b> makeup designs by Canonero, {{with whom they}} had worked on The Cotton Club (1984). The rogues gallery makeup designs were directly taken from Gould's drawings, {{with the exception of}} Al Pacino (Big Boy Caprice), who improvised his own designs, ignoring the rather overweight character of the strip. His makeup took 3.5 hours to apply.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attestations}} of {{the name}} in Basque include Errama-itçéla, Erroumancel, later errumanzel and erremaitzela. The initial E- is the Basque <b>prosthetic</b> vowel, added because no Basque word may begin with an R-, and the final -a is the absolutive case suffix, used when citing a name. If this etymology is correct, it is a rare case of a native Romani name for themselves (an endonym) being borrowed by another language.|$|E
5|$|Ebert {{underwent}} further {{surgery in}} January 2008 to hopefully restore {{his voice and}} address the complications from his previous surgeries. On April 1, Ebert announced his speech had not been restored. A further surgery was performed in April 2008 after Ebert fractured his hip in a fall. By 2011, Ebert was using a <b>prosthetic</b> chin to hide some of {{the damage done by}} his many chin, mouth, and throat surgeries.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} three seasons, Paul Engelen was Game of Thrones main makeup {{designer}} and <b>prosthetic</b> makeup artist with Melissa Lackersteen, Conor O'Sullivan and Rob Trenton. At {{the beginning of the}} fourth season Engelen's team was replaced by Jane Walker and her crew, composed of Ann McEwan and Barrie and Sarah Gower.|$|E
5|$|In Zloda, Belarus, Amador {{uses the}} {{diamonds}} as payment for a proxcard {{to access the}} Todorov Building in Minsk. The team tracks her there, but Amador escapes. Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover {{to be coming from}} a camera in her eye, the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing the name of the hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her <b>prosthetic</b> eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through the eye, can kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the <b>prosthetic</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|Lea Thompson {{was cast}} as Lorraine McFly {{because she had}} acted {{opposite}} Stoltz in The Wild Life; the producers noticed her as they had watched the film while casting Stoltz. Her <b>prosthetic</b> makeup for scenes {{at the beginning of}} the film, set in 1985, took three and a half hours to apply.|$|E
5|$|Leiter puts Bond and Solitaire {{on a train}} {{leaving the}} country. Tee Hee sneaks aboard and {{attempts}} to kill Bond, but Bond cuts the wires of his <b>prosthetic</b> arm and throws him out the window. As the film ends, a laughing Samedi is revealed to be perched {{on the front of}} the speeding train.|$|E
5|$|Mills came {{to public}} {{attention}} {{when she was}} a model in 1993 and was involved a collision with a police motorcycle in London. The accident resulted in the amputation of her left leg below the knee, but she continued to model by using a <b>prosthetic</b> limb and sold her story to a tabloid newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Paul Giamatti as LimboA comical {{orangutan}} {{who works}} in the trade business of human slaves. Limbo is caught in the conflict between humans and apes and tries his best to simply survive. Giamatti drew inspiration from W. C. Fields for his performance. While his <b>prosthetic</b> makeup was being applied, Giamatti watched episodes of Ultraman and various Japanese Godzilla films.|$|E
5|$|Pinon and Ron Perlman {{were cast}} by Alien: Resurrection {{director}} Jean-Pierre Jeunet {{largely due to}} the director's practice of casting recurring collaborators in unconventional, marginal roles. In Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction, Teresa Rizzo explores Alien: Resurrection hybridization theme; the dynamic between Vriess and his wheelchair share a synergy of flesh and <b>prosthetic</b> with Number 8 and her Alien composition.|$|E
5|$|Primary implant {{stability}} {{refers to}} the stability of a dental implant immediately after implantation. The stability of the titanium screw implant in the patient's bone tissue post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using resonance frequency analysis. Sufficient initial stability may allow immediate loading with <b>prosthetic</b> reconstruction, though early loading poses {{a higher risk of}} implant failure than conventional loading.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{attempted to}} limit the use of digital effects. However, {{because he wanted to}} evoke a Southern Gothic fantasy tone for Big Fish, color grading techniques were applied by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Stan Winston Studios, with whom Burton worked with on Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Batman Returns (1992), designed Helena Bonham Carter's <b>prosthetic</b> makeup and created the animatronics. Scenes with Karl the Giant were commissioned using forced perspective filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} three Creative Arts Emmy Award {{nominations for}} the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series, and won for Outstanding <b>Prosthetic</b> Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special.|$|E
5|$|This episode saw the {{introduction}} of the redesigned Romulans, with <b>prosthetic</b> forehead pieces designed by makeup supervisor Michael Westmore, and the first appearance of the Romulan Warbird which was designer Andrew Probert's final work for the Star Trek franchise. The episode was mildly received by critics who viewed it {{after the end of the}} season, who criticised the two-plot nature of the episode and the general lack of excitement.|$|E
5|$|Ward {{eventually}} finds Amador's goal: {{a mysterious}} diagram {{in a room}} of the Todorov Building. Coulson tracks down Amador's handler, but he is killed instantly by his own <b>prosthetic</b> eye. Amador is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, and though Coulson promises to testify for her, she is {{just happy to be}} free.|$|E
5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A <b>prosthetic</b> Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial <b>prosthetic</b> was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|A set {{of three}} {{animated}} videos, titled Tales from Dunwall, serving as a prequel to Dishonored, were released in September 2012. The videos show the discovery of whale-oil fuel, the Outsider granting his mark to a small boy in search of revenge, and Piero creating Corvo's mask. All three videos were created by animation studio Psyop and marketing firm Rokkan, narrated by Chloë Grace Moretz, and scored by Daniel Licht. Each Tales from Dunwall episode received a gold Clio Award for achievement in advertising. In the same month, the game was used as inspiration for <b>prosthetic</b> makeup effects on the television reality show Face Off.|$|E
5|$|After being {{stalled in}} the {{development}} phase for nearly a decade, the film's principal photography began in 2008 and lasted two years. The film marked the debut of Legacy Effects studio (which {{was responsible for the}} film's <b>prosthetic</b> make-up and animatronics) in Indian cinema. Enthiran was released worldwide on 1October2010, along with its dubbed versions: Robot in Hindi and Robo in Telugu. Produced by Kalanithi Maran, it was India's most expensive film up to that point.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the <b>prosthetic</b> for various removable alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber <b>prosthetic,</b> that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E
5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for the finished film. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team and his decision to mimic the strip's limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the <b>prosthetic</b> makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E
5|$|American actor Stuart Milligan {{was cast}} as President Nixon, {{which he said}} he found exciting, having played other presidents in the past, {{including}} Dwight D. Eisenhower. <b>Prosthetic</b> pieces were applied on Milligan's cheeks, nose, and ears to make him resemble Nixon as much as possible. He also practiced how Nixon would speak, but initially found it difficult since he had to wear fake teeth. Milligan previously appeared in the animated Tenth Doctor special Dreamland {{as the voice of}} Colonel Stark. Chuk Iwuji, who played Carl, previously appeared in the Seventh Doctor audio drama A Thousand Tiny Wings, where he played Joshua Sembeke.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{shooting}} of the film began, Vidya started to use a <b>prosthetic</b> belly to look as close to authentically pregnant as possible. According to news reports, she met doctors and pregnant women {{to learn about the}} typical lifestyle and nuances of a pregnant woman, and also made lists of rules and superstitions followed by pregnant women. Vidya said that during her college days she often used to imitate pregnant ladies during stand-up acting among friends, an experience that helped her during {{the shooting}}.|$|E
5|$|Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf and Matthew Mungle, the show's make-up effect producers, used several unorthodox {{ingredients}} {{to create the}} effect of melted flesh; {{in addition to the}} use of normal <b>prosthetic</b> make-up, the two also used a combination of figs and Fruit Roll-Ups. Several of the characters in the episode were named after real-life individuals. The characters of Hellura Lyle and Kai Bowe were named after two Writers Guild trainees on The X-Files staff who served during {{the first part of the}} eighth season. Furthermore, the character Steven Melnick is named after the Vice President of Media Relations for 20th Century Fox Television. Melnick had formerly served as the publicist for the series.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 1993 at Paramount Pictures with Kevin Yagher {{originally}} set to direct Andrew Kevin Walker's script as a low-budget slasher film. Disagreements with Paramount resulted in Yagher being demoted to <b>prosthetic</b> makeup designer, and Burton {{was hired to}} direct in June 1998. Filming took place from November 1998 to May 1999, and the film was released to generally favorable reviews from critics, and grossed approximately $206 million worldwide. Sleepy Hollow won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by <b>prosthetic</b> makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} {{to make it look like}} tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E
