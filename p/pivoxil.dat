40|$|Aims: To systemically {{investigate}} the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> tablet. In addition, acute toxicity of this preparation was also studied. Methods: In vitro, {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) or minimal inhibitory concentration (MBC) were determined by using the serial 2 -fold broth or agar dilution methods. Further, cumulative MIC inhibition curves were then made to assess the antibacterial effects of the drug at various concentrations. In vivo, minimum lethal dose (MLD) in combination with maximum tolerance dose (MTD) {{was used to measure}} the acute toxicity of the tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> tablet in mice. After that, sepsis mouse models challenged with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, were established to evaluate the anti-infective effect of this preparation. Results: The MIC 90 values of tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Pyogenic streptococcus, and Enterococcus faecalis were ≤ 0. 125, 16, 0. 5, 8, ≤ 0. 125, and 32 μg/mL, respectively. Correspondingly, the MIC 90 values of tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii were 1, 0. 5, ≤ 0. 125, 0. 25, 64, 64 μg/mL, respectively. The MBC values of tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0. 016 – 2, 0. 063 – 32, 0. 031 – 32 μg/mL, respectively. The acute toxicity study showed that the MLD of the tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> tablet was 4. 00 g/kg and the MTD was 3. 40 g/kg in mice. In all the sepsis mouse models, the simultaneous administration of the tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> tablets significantly reduced mortality of the sepsis-model mice as compared with the control. Furthermore, the survival rate in the tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> tablet group was remarkably higher than that in the meropenem group in all the sepsis mouse models tested. In the sepsis model challenged with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strain, respectively, tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> tablet (100 mg/kg) displayed a better protective effect than tebipenem <b>pivoxil</b> granules (100 mg/kg).

40|$|Background: Uncomplicated {{skin and}} skin {{structure}} infections (uSSSI) are commonly encountered community-acquired infections and are typically {{confined to the}} superficial layers of the skin. Hence, they seldom lead {{to the destruction of}} skin structures. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of cefditoren <b>pivoxil</b> in uSSSI in Indian patients. Methods: One hundred and seventy-eight patients diagnosed with uncomplicated SSSI were enrolled in this randomized, comparative, multicentric study. Patients received either cefditoren <b>pivoxil</b> or cefdinir for ten days. Efficacy was assessed both clinically and microbiologically. Safety evaluation consisted of reporting of type, frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events. Results: One hundred and fifty-one patients completed the study. Clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefditoren <b>pivoxil</b> was comparable to that of cefdinir in the treatment of uSSSI.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to assess the influence that treatment with antacid and ranitidine had on the pharmacokinetics of oral cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> in 18 healthy male volunteers. Each subject received, in an open-labeled, randomized, three-way crossover design, a single oral dose of 1, 000 mg (two tablets) of cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> 10 min after a standard breakfast during each of the following treatments: treatment A, control period; treatment B, antacid (80 ml of suspension; Maalox 70) administered on the evening before cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> dosing (- 12. 5 h) and again 2 h before and 2 h after a standard breakfast; treatment C, ranitidine (150 mg) administered twice a day for 4 days and again 1 h and 10 min prior to cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> dosing. Plasma and urine samples were collected over a 24 -h period following cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> administration. Cefetamet was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Oral bioavailability parameters (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h, area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity, time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma, and maximum concentration of drug in plasma) were obtained by noncompartmental techniques. The results showed that none of these bioavailability parameters was significantly (P greater than 0. 05) affected by antacid or rantidine coadministration. A compartmental analysis showed no significant differences. In addition, the terminal elimination half-life and the fraction of cefetamet excreted unchanged in the urine was also not significantly (P greater than 0. 05) affected by antacid or ranitidine exposure. Relatively wide intrasubject variability was observed for time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma and terminal elimination half-life in several of the 18 subjects studied. Although these irregularities {{did not appear to be}} strongly associated with a particular treatment, they increased in subjects in both the antacid and H 2 -receptor antagonist treatment groups compared with those in subjects in the control treatment group.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate the effect of advanced age on the pharmacokinetics of cefetamet and its prodrug, cefetamet <b>pivoxil.</b> A secondary objective {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of food on the absorption of cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> in the elderly. Twenty-four healthy subjects (twelve young and twelve elderly) received (in a Latin square design) a single-dose, 515 -mg infusion of cefetamet, a single 1, 000 -mg oral dose of cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> during fasted conditions, and a single 1, 000 -mg oral dose of cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> 10 min after a standardized low-fat breakfast. Serial blood and urine samples were collected over a 36 -h period and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Intravenous and oral pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by using model-independent techniques. The systemic clearance and renal clearance of cefetamet were significantly lower (P less than 0. 05) in elderly subjects compared with in young controls after intravenous administration. No significant difference was observed in the apparent volumes of distribution at steady state between the two groups. Consequently, half-life and mean residence time were prolonged. A trend toward a lower renal clearance/creatinine clearance ratio was observed in our elderly population. Oral clearance of cefetamet was only slightly reduced in our elderly subjects, consistent with an increase in plasma half-life. Otherwise, oral pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable between elderly and young subjects. Additionally, the same effects of food were observed on the absorption characteristics of cefetamet (no change in maximum concentration of drug in plasma and an increase in both time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma and bioavailability) in our elderly subjects as in our young volunteers. Age did not appear to alter the deesterification and bioavailability of cefetamet <b>pivoxil.</b> We conclude that the small reduction in the elimination of cefetamet in the elderly would not require dose adjustment for this population...|$|E

For the treatment of infections caused by the penicillin-susceptible strain the antibiotics were administered orally at 0. 4, 2, and 10 mg/kg of body weight twice daily for 2 days beginning at 24 h after bacterial inoculation, and for the treatment of infections caused by a penicillin-resistant strain the antibiotics were administered at 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg twice daily for 2 days beginning at 24 h after bacterial inoculation. Among the antibiotics tested, CS- 834 exhibited the most potent efficacy against both types of strains. Against infections caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae, CS- 834 at all doses significantly reduced the numbers of viable cells in both the lungs and blood. Cefpodoxime proxetil at all doses and cefteram <b>pivoxil</b> and cefditoren <b>pivoxil</b> at doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg showed comparable efficacies.

After an overnight fast, the drug was administered 10 min after a standard breakfast. It was found that both the rate and extent of prodrug absorption, measured as cefetamet adsorption, were reduced with increasing doses. The time to maximum concentration of cefetamet in serum was delayed from 4. 00 +/- 0. 81 to 4. 88 +/- 0. 96 h (P less than 0. 05) when the dose of cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> was increased from 500 to 2, 000 mg.

40|$|Newly {{developed}} {{coated wire}} electrodes {{have been developed}} for determination of cefditoren <b>pivoxil</b> (CTP) in pure form, pharmaceutical preparations and in biological fluids. The selective electrodes were fabricated based on the incorporation of cefditoren <b>pivoxil</b> with the ion exchangers, phosphomolybdic acid (CTP-PMA), phosphotungstic acid (CTP-PTA) and a mixture of both (CTP-PMA/PTA). The potential responses of the electrodes were influenced by the pH of tested solution. Under the condition of pH 5 - 10, the electrodes exhibit linear response over concentration range 1. 0 × 10 - 7 - 1. 0 × 10 - 2 mol/L with Nernstian slopes (56. 29 ± 0. 09, 54. 60 ± 0. 09 and 58. 17 ± 0. 28 mV / decade at 25 °C) for the three electrodes, respectively. The influence of possible interfering species such as common inorganic cations, amino acids and different pharmacological related compounds was studied. The electrodes were successfully applied to determination of the drug in tablets by direct and standard addition potentiometry. Statistical student's t-test and F-test showed insignificant systematic error between proposed and reported methods...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{effectiveness}} of antiviral acyclic nucleoside phosphonate adefo vir, 9 -[2 -(phosphonomethoxy) ethy]ade nine (PMEA) and its more lipophilic (bis) pivaloyloxymethyl ester prodrug adefovir dipivoxil (bis-POM-PMEA) were compared under in vitro conditions in mammalian cell systems. Proliferation of murine splenocytes was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, the bis-POM-PMEA being {{more effective than}} PMEA. In contrast to PMEA, bis-POM-PMEA inhibited production of nitric oxide (NO) in macrophages activated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Viability of both splenocytes and macrophages remained uninfluenced by PMEA, whereas pronounced cytocidal effects were exhibited by bis-POM-PMEA. The IC 50 s reached the values of 15 µM and 30 µM in cultures of macrophages and splenocytes, respectively (assayed at the interval of 24 hrs). The effects could partly be mimicked by formaldehyde, a decomposition product of the <b>pivoxil</b> moiety of bis-POM-PMEA. The other possible product, pivalic acid, was ineffective in this respect. The present data {{are consistent with the}} view that <b>pivoxil</b> prodrug of PMEA, bis-POM-PMEA possesses enhanced but also broader spectrum of biological effects than the parent compound...|$|E
40|$|Simple, {{rapid and}} {{specific}} liquid chromatographyâmass spectrometry (LCâMS) {{methods have been}} developed and validated for the quantification of cefcapene acid in human plasma and urine. Plasma samples were simply pretreated with methanol for deproteinization. Urine samples were briefly diluted with methanolâwater (50 : 50, v/v), and centrifuged to remove large particles. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Hedera ODS- 2 column. For the plasma assay, the isocratic mobile phase consisted of 35 % solvent A (Methanol) and 65 % solvent B (10 Â mM ammonium acetate buffer solution containing 0. 2 % folic acid) with a flow rate of 0. 3 Â mL/min. For the urine assay, the isocratic mobile phase consisted of 30 % solvent A (Methanol) and 70 % solvent B (10 Â mM ammonium acetate buffer solution containing 0. 2 % folic acid) with a flow rate of 0. 3 Â mL/min. The assays were linear over the concentration ranges of 0. 03 â 5 Â Î¼g/mL in plasma and 0. 1 â 400 Â Î¼g/mL in urine, and were successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study after single and multiple oral administrations of cefcapene <b>pivoxil</b> hydrochloride tablets in healthy Chinese volunteers.

40|$|Cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> (1, 000 mg orally) {{absorption}} {{was evaluated}} in 16 male subjects (age, 23. 4 +/- 1. 7 years; weight, 73. 9 +/- 7. 0 kg) 1 h before (BE), with (WI), and 1 h after (AF) a standard breakfast. The time to peak concentration of cefetamet in plasma (Tmax) was increased from 3. 25 +/- 1. 44 h in the BE group to 4. 31 +/- 1. 54 and 4. 13 +/- 1. 54 h in the WI and AF groups, respectively (P less than 0. 05). The maximum cefetamet concentration in plasma (Cmax) {{and the area}} under the plasma cefetamet concentration-time profiles (AUC) in the BE, WI, and AF groups were 5. 50 +/- 1. 06, 5. 47 +/- 1. 4, and 6. 57 +/- 0. 93 micrograms/ml and 38. 2 +/- 10. 1, 35. 7 +/- 11. 9, and 42. 8 +/- 6. 8 micrograms. h/ml, respectively. The Cmax and AUC values were not different between the BE and WI groups (P greater than 0. 05). However, differences in these values {{were found between the}} WI and AF groups (P less than 0. 05). The effect of fluid volume intake on cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> (1, 000 mg orally) absorption was evaluated in 12 male subjects (age, 23. 8 +/- 2. 3 years; weight, 74. 9 +/- 9. 0 kg) under fasted and WI conditions. Increasing fluid volume intake from 250 to 450 ml under the fasted condition had no effect on the absorption of the prodrug (Tmax, 2. 50 +/- 0. 52 versus 2. 83 +/- 0. 94 h; Cmax, 4. 89 +/- 1. 04 versus 4. 84 +/- 0. 89 micrograms/ml; AUC, 29. 6 +/- 5. 1 versus 30. 7 +/- 7. 1 micrograms. h/ml; P greater than 0. 05. Thus, independent of fluid volume intake, cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> absorption is enhanced when it is given within 1 h of a meal, and it is recommended that the prodrug should be taken during this period of increased bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of cefetamet {{were determined}} after intravenous (i. v.) administration of cefetamet and oral administration of cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> syrup to patients {{between the ages}} of 3 and 12 years. The patients were hospitalized for reconstructive urological surgery; to prevent infection, prophylactic i. v. cefetamet was administered on the day of surgery and oral cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> was administered 2 days later. After i. v. administration, the mean (+/- standard deviation) half-life of cefetamet was 1. 97 +/- 0. 60 h (n = 18), which was different from the 2. 46 +/- 0. 33 h reported for nine adults (22 to 68 years old) in a previous study. The average values for the mean residence times were 2. 35 +/- 0. 94 and 2. 83 +/- 0. 34 h and the average values for the fraction of the dose eliminated unchanged in the urine were 79. 9 % +/- 8. 99 % and 80 % +/- 11 % in children and adults, respectively. Plots of mean systemic clearance and steady-state volume of distribution versus body weight for the children and comparative adults were linear on log-log coordinates, and the slopes of the plots were 0. 661 and 0. 880, respectively. These slope values suggested that mean systemic clearance values per unit of body surface area were similar in children and adults and that maintenance doses for children should be the adult maintenance dose multiplied by the child's surface area divided by 1. 73 m 2. The mean (+/- standard deviation) oral bioavailabilities of cefetamet <b>pivoxil</b> were 49. 3 % +/- 15. 7 % in 3 - to 7 -year-old children who received a 500 -mg dose and 37. 9 % +/- 10. 0 % in 8 - to 12 -year-old children who received a 1, 000 -mg dose. These values were not different from that observed in the adult group after two 500 -mg tablets. Likewise, the peak concentration of cefetamet in plasma and its time of occurrence in children were in line with the values which have been observed for adults...|$|E
