In {{the winter of}} 1705, 275 British soldiers {{under the command of}} Colonel Winthrop Hilton were dispatched to seize Rale and sack the village. The priest was warned in time, however, and escaped into the woods with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon had <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>on</b> Federico Pistrucci's head, {{as he had}} prosecuted Bonapartist rebels, so {{the family}} fled Rome when the French {{advanced}} towards it, stopping in Frosinone, where the boys were again put into an academic school. Filippo satisfied his father with enough academic achievement that {{he was allowed to}} take a job with a painter named Mango. Deprived of his brother, Benedetto became despondent and was eventually allowed to work at Mango's. There, he quickly displayed his artistic talent. Mango told Benedetto of his brother Giuseppe Mango, a cameo engraver in Rome. With the Pope and the French having made peace, the family was able to return there, and Benedetto Pistrucci began his training as a cameo carver. He advanced quickly, also taking lessons from Stefano Tofanelli, and soon Giuseppe Mango was selling Pistrucci's carvings as his own. Realising that his works were being sold as counterfeit antiques, Pistrucci began placing a secret mark, the Greek letter λ (lambda) on his creations.|$|E

5|$|Eddy {{believed}} that with military {{assistance from the}} Thirteen Colonies, {{he might be able}} to bring down the strongly Loyalist administration of Nova Scotia. Early in 1776, Eddy went to Massachusetts in an attempt to interest political and military leaders there in supporting action in Nova Scotia, while Allan worked to raise interest in Nova Scotia. Allan's work was made more difficult by the arrival of Colonel Goreham and his troops to refortify Fort Cumberland, and by the activities of Michael Francklin, a former Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia and a vocal Loyalist. Eddy returned empty-handed to Nova Scotia in June 1776, only to learn that Goreham had <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>on</b> his head. The activities of Goreham's Fencibles in the Cumberland area were successful enough that Patriot activities there were effectively forced underground; the center of these activities was shifted to Maugerville in part as a consequence of this. Goreham, a veteran of the French and Indian War, was also able to blunt Patriot inroads in the native communities, where the Mi'kmaq refused to take sides, and the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy, at first supportive of the Patriots, ultimately did not turn out in the numbers Eddy had hoped for or been promised.|$|E

25|$|An early {{influence}} of the War on artists in the United Kingdom was the recruiting campaign of 1914-1915. Around a hundred posters were commissioned from artists by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee of which {{two and a half}} million copies were distributed across the country. Private companies also sponsored recruitment posters: Remember Belgium, by the Belgian-born Frank Brangwyn and The Only Road for an Englishman by Gerald Spencer Pryse were two notable examples produced on behalf of the London Electric Railways. Although Brangwyn produced over 80 poster designs during the War, he was not an official war artist. His grim poster of a Tommy bayoneting an enemy soldier (“Put Strength in the Final Blow: Buy War Bonds”) caused deep offence in both Britain and Germany. The Kaiser himself is said to have <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>on</b> Brangwyn’s head after seeing the image.|$|E
25|$|During the night, {{the captains}} of the French fireships did they best {{to fill their}} vessels with gunpowder, and on 6 July, under the escort of 5 sailing ships {{commanded}} by Duquesne, they went to {{set fire to the}} remaining Spanish galleys.

Frustrated by their defeat, the Spaniards even <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>on</b> Sourdis' head. The Duke of Fernandina managed to escape with the galleys which had failed to break the French blockade, claiming to have won the battle for having introduced some relief into Tarragona. Some Spanish historians give credit to this claim, but other, like the Catalan Víctor Balaguer, said that the 11 ships which entered the port were not full of supplies but full of men, which worsened the situation in the city and made a second relief necessary.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2006 Liberal {{leadership}} race, Ignatieff {{advocated for}} measures to address climate change, including a carbon tax.

In a speech to the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce in February 2009, he said; [...] "You can't win elections if you're adding to the input costs of a farmer putting diesel into his tractor, or you're adding to the input costs of a fisherman putting diesel into his fishing boat, or a trucker transporting goods". He went onto say that; [...] "You've got to work with the grain of Canadians and not against them. I think we learned a lesson in the last election."
