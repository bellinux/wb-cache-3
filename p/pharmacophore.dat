The <b>pharmacophore</b> has four features; one aromatic ring, two hydrophobic features and one positive ionizable feature. Figure 4 shows an example of a compound that fits the agonist <b>pharmacophore</b> perfectly. The nitrogen atom of piperazine fits the positive ionizable feature, the benzofuran part fits the aromatic ring and one hydrophobic, and the trifluoromethane part fits another hydrophobic feature of the <b>pharmacophore.</b>|$|E

25|$|Most CB1 antagonists {{reported}} so far {{are close}} analogs or isosteres of rimonabant. A general CB1 inverse agonist <b>pharmacophore</b> model can be extracted from the common features of these analogs, diarylpyrazoles (Figure 4). This <b>pharmacophore</b> contains a cyclic core, C, (e.g. pyrazole in rimonabant) substituted by two aromatic moieties, A and B. A hydrogen bond acceptor unit, D, connects C with a cyclic lipophilic part, E. In some cases unit E directly connects to C. In Figure 4 rimonabant is used as an example. Unit A represents a 4-chlorophenyl group and unit B a 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring. Unit C is the central pyrazole ring and unit D represents the carbonyl group which serves as the hydrogen bond acceptor. Unit E represents a lipophilic aminopiperidinyl moiety.|$|E
25|$|Most of the ARBs {{have the}} same <b>pharmacophore</b> so the {{difference}} in their biochemical and physiological effects is mostly due to different substituents. Activity of a drug is dependent of its affinity for the substrate site {{and the length of}} time it binds to the site.|$|E

25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to increase the affinity of the diarylpyrazole derivatives by rigidifying the structure of rimonabant. In terms of the general <b>pharmacophore</b> model the units A, B and/or C are connected by additional bonds leading to rigid molecules. For example, the condensed polycyclic pyrazole NESS-0327 showed 5000 times more affinity for the CB1 receptor than rimonabant. However, this compound possesses a poor central bioavailability.|$|E

Both structure- and conformation-activity studies were performed. Results demonstrated that dimerization did not modify the pharmacological activity of both peptide and non-peptide <b>pharmacophores.</b> Moreover, when dimeric compounds were obtained with low potency peptide <b>pharmacophores,</b> dimerization recovered ligand potency.

40|$|As {{metabolism}} {{is considered}} a main cause for adverse drug reactions and failures of new drug candidates, {{our goal is to}} establish an in silico method to efficiently pre-dict phase II metabolism – in particular sulfotransferase (SULT) activity. Since sulfotransferases exhibit low sub-strate specificities caused by their high degree of confor-mational freedom [1], activity prediction is a challenging task. We therefore established a workflow based on mole-cular dynamics (MD) simulations to cover the whole spectrum of structural flexibility and incorporated it into multiple <b>pharmacophores</b> that represent specific modes of action. Using an ensemble of <b>pharmacophores</b> for virtual screening ensures accurate categorization of potential SULT ligands (e. g. substrates, inhibitors). Recent advances in MD technology [2] allowed for refinement of these <b>pharmacophores</b> by high-throughput MD simulations of ligand-target complexes. In addition, the initial binding process of a soluble ligand to the sub-strate-binding site of SULT was captured in unbiased 100 ns simulations using the software Desmond [3]...|$|R
5000|$|In modern {{computational}} chemistry, <b>pharmacophores</b> {{are used}} to define the essential features {{of one or more}} molecules with the same biological activity.

25|$|A {{new study}} using {{comparative}} molecular field analysis (CoMFA) to establish three-dimensional {{quantitative structure-activity relationship}} (3D QSAR), while searching for novel active pharmacophores as potentially potent HGMR inhibitors, was recently published. Using this novel technique researchers were able to screen for compounds with high screening scores. In addition to the conventional statin-like compounds with HMG-like moiety, eight additional compounds with completely different <b>pharmacophore</b> structure were found. This structure-based virtual screening procedure is considered promising for rational quest and optimization of potential novel HGMR inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|On the phenyl ring, a 3,4-dialkoxyphenyl moiety (Figure 6) is a known <b>pharmacophore</b> in PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram. Optimal {{activity}} is achieved with a methoxy {{group at the}} 4-position (X2) and a bigger group, such as cyclopentoxy at the 3-position carbon (X3). However the thalidomide PDE4 inhibitory analogs do not follow the SAR of rolipram analogs directly. For thalidomide analogs, an ethoxy group at X3 and a methoxy group at X2, with X1 being just a hydrogen, gave the highest PDE4 and TNF-α inhibition. Substitutes larger than diethoxy at the X2–X3 position had decreased activity. The effects of these substitutions seem to be mediated by steric effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{it was noted}} that a series of imidazole-5-acetic acid {{derivatives}} diminished blood pressure responses to Ang II in rats. Two compounds, S-8307 and S-8308, were later found to be highly specific and promising non-peptide Ang II receptor antagonists but using molecular modeling it was seen that their structures would have to mimic more closely the <b>pharmacophore</b> of Ang II. Structural modifications were made and the orally active, potent and selective nonpeptide AT1 receptor blocker losartan was developed. In 1995 losartan was approved for clinical use in the United States and since then six additional ARBs have been approved. These drugs are known for their excellent side-effects profiles, which clinical trials have shown to be similar to those of placebos.|$|E
40|$|In Chapter 1 {{a review}} of the 5 -HT 1 B {{receptor}} is conducted, describing physiological and pathological roles as well as known ligands. The structural biology of Family A GPCRs is reviewed to provide insights into the behaviour of 5 -HT 1 B itself. In Chapter 2, a multiple sequence alignment is used to study residue conservation in human monoamine GPCRs and to elucidate areas of functional and structural significance. Patterns are identified that are consistent with current knowledge of GPCR function while also producing novel insights into 5 -HT 1 B receptor structure. In Chapter 3, homology modelling based upon both bovine rhodopsin and the human β 2 -adrenergic receptor is employed to construct models of 5 -HT 1 B. In Chapter 4, molecular dynamics is then used to refine these structures, verify the intramolecular interactions identified in Chapter 2 and investigate conformation changes during receptor activation. In Chapter 5, existing ligands are studied and novel <b>pharmacophores</b> for the receptor are derived. Higher ligand recall with tighter constraints is achieved by introducing virtual sits into the <b>pharmacophores.</b> These <b>pharmacophores</b> are then integrated into the receptor models to compare them, to identify binding interactions and to investigate the dynamic behaviour of <b>pharmacophores.</b> From the conjunction of ligand and receptor-derived information a model for ligand efficacy is derived.

25|$|All statins {{have the}} same <b>pharmacophore</b> so the {{difference}} in their pharmacodynamic effect is mostly based on the substituents. The activity of each statin {{is dependent on the}} binding affinity of the compound for the substrate site and the length of time it binds to the site. Type 2 statins havejk unique fluorophenyl group that causes additional polar interaction between the enzyme and the statins, which results in a tighter binding to the enzyme. The newest statin, rosuvastatin has a unique polar methane sulfonamide group, which is quite hydrophilic and confers low lipophilicity. The sulfonamide group forms a unique polar interaction with the enzyme. As a result, rosuvastatin has superior binding affinity to the HMGR enzyme compared to the other statins, which is directly related to its efficiency to lower LDL cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Ligand-based drug design (or {{indirect}} drug design) {{relies on}} knowledge of other molecules that bind to the biological target of interest. These other molecules {{may be used}} to derive a <b>pharmacophore</b> model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target. In other words, a model of the biological target may be built based on the knowledge of what binds to it, and this model in turn {{may be used to}} design new molecular entities that interact with the target. Alternatively, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), in which a correlation between calculated properties of molecules and their experimentally determined biological activity, may be derived. These QSAR relationships in turn may be used to predict the activity of new analogs.|$|E
25|$|After {{finding a}} novel set of analogs of thalidomide, namely 3-(1,3-dioxo-1,3 dihydroisoindol-2-yl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) propionic acid (not shown), which had PDE4 {{inhibition}} activity the work began {{to optimize the}} activity. For that purpose the researchers used a known structure moiety, 3,4-dialkoxyphenyl, that is a recognized <b>pharmacophore</b> in PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram (Figure 6) and roflumilast and added it onto {{the structure of the}} previously mentioned analog series. After tweaking the structure and testing different substitution at the 4-position of the phthaloyl ring and at the carboxyl acid the researchers finally landed at a molecule that potently inhibits PDE4 and TNF-α, which they later named apremilast (Figure 4). The S-enantiomer of apremilast was chosen since it was the more active enantiomer. Since the structure of apremilast lacks the acidic chiral hydrogen it should not racemize in vivo, unlike thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe sperm protein fertilinβ, {{a member}} of the ADAM family of proteins, is implicated in sperm-egg binding in all mammals studied to date. Multivalent inhibitors {{containing}} the three amino acid binding sequence of fertilinβ, ECD, have been shown previously to be more effective inhibitors of fertilization than their monovalent counterparts. Here, we probed sperm-egg interactions with ruthenium-catalyzed ring-opening metathesis polymers that contained from 3 to 70 ECD <b>pharmacophores</b> in densities ranging from 10 % to 100 %. Evaluation of the polymer potencies, and synthesis of a triblock copolymer from two building blocks, revealed that two multivalent contacts are sufficient for maximal inhibition, and that the distance between ECD <b>pharmacophores</b> required is 7 – 9 monomers spanning 4 – 5 nm. We conclude that inhibition requires recruitment of two receptors on the egg surface into an inhibitory complex...|$|R
25|$|Geometric matching/ shape {{complementarity}} methods {{describe the}} protein and ligand {{as a set}} of features that make them dockable. These features may include molecular surface / complementary surface descriptors. In this case, the receptor’s molecular surface is described in terms of its solvent-accessible surface area and the ligand’s molecular surface is described in terms of its matching surface description. The complementarity between the two surfaces amounts to the shape matching description that may help finding the complementary pose of docking the target and the ligand molecules. Another approach is to describe the hydrophobic features of the protein using turns in the main-chain atoms. Yet another approach is to use a Fourier shape descriptor technique. Whereas the shape complementarity based approaches are typically fast and robust, they cannot usually model the movements or dynamic changes in the ligand/ protein conformations accurately, although recent developments allow these methods to investigate ligand flexibility. Shape complementarity methods can quickly scan through several thousand ligands {{in a matter of seconds}} and actually figure out whether they can bind at the protein’s active site, and are usually scalable to even protein-protein interactions. They are also much more amenable to <b>pharmacophore</b> based approaches, since they use geometric descriptions of the ligands to find optimal binding.|$|E
