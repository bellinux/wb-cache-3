40|$|John Gardner’s Grendel explores how space, time, and monstrosity {{mutually}} constitute each other, demonstrated through Grendel’s {{movement from}} liminal individual monster {{to a complex}} hybridity of the space of individuality and community. I read monstrosity in Grendel as a showing forth of the interactions of hæcceity and alterity through the space and time of developing civilization, using DuBois’s “double consciousness, ” Nancy’s shared spatiality in Being Singular Plural, and Deleuze and Guattari’s “stratigraphic time ” to consider the interpenetrations of identity, space, and temporality. Using the two “horrible and holy propositions ” articulated by the priest—that “things fade ” and “alternatives exclude”—to launch my investigation {{of the necessity of}} alterity in the formation and continuance of civilizations, I find that the role Grendel simultaneously plays and resists is one that is necessary for a community’s self-identification. As community inclusion is made meaningful through a coincident exclusion, the origin and continuance of civilization is dependent upon designating elements that divide and define, and in so doing, are set outside the space of community while still being included in the total defining structure of that community. Grendel, however, questions both the validity of this exclusion as well as his subjection to it, while he simultaneously and paradoxically accepts the inherent truth of his defining difference. I consider this paradox through the way Grendel examines the validity of the space of possessed land and borders while also approaching his relationship with human civilization as a continual violation of their space, thereby granting authority to those <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy.</b> In doing so, he accepts an inherent and violent duality within his own conception of his identity: from this “double-consciousness ” stems the violence of Grendel’s life and death and his resultant manifest monstrosity...|$|R

Of course, the common law presumption as to paternity is only {{the flip side of}} the legitimacy presumption, and it has been the latter that, in the past, attracted greater legal notice. The <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> arising from marriage brought with it considerable advantage for the child concerned and certainty for the father, at least in regard to the disposition of his assets. With the modern erosion of the significance of legitimacy, and the redefinition, and greater enforcement, of obligations of parents to support their children, it is now paternity, rather than legitimacy, which is of paramount legal significance. One complex legal question which has arisen in recent years in relation to paternity is whether a man can use the tort of deceit to sue the mother of a child who has misled him as to paternity, where paternity is later disestablished...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the legal and}} cultural attitudes towards the family revealed in two “narratives” of disputed paternity: Guy de Maupassant's short story Monsieur Parent (1885) and the US Supreme Court case Michael H. v. Gerald D. (1989). Though separated by a century, these texts both relate to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy,</b> that legal principle that has made fathers of husbands since the Roman era; both, moreover, suggest that the principle is unfair. Yet while Maupassant's tale reflects and adapts common 19 th-century anxieties surrounding the (near-absolute) uncertainty of paternity, anxieties according to which {{the worst thing that}} might befall a husband was to be legally burdened with another man's child, Michael H. v. Gerald D. involved an opposite claim: that the presumption unconstitutionally deprived biological fathers of a legal relationship with their offspring. The Supreme Court's rationale in rejecting this claim appealed to “tradition” and “history,” yet this article suggests that consideration of historical understandings of the presumption reveals instead that entirely incommensurable assumptions, values and purposes have underpinned it in different historical eras. Yet despite these differences, I argue, Monsieur Parent already reveals the cultural shift upon which Michael H. v. Gerald D. would depend: the evolution of a familialist ideology that identifies family life as the only real source of human happiness, and that necessitates the ruthless exclusion, through a rhetoric of abjection and perversity, of all unwelcome outsiders...|$|E

It is argued that the essential meaning <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is best understood when approached from what is referred to as its counterfactual status. As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R
