40|$|Summary Reforestation with provenances from {{locations}} {{remote from}} the planting site (transferred provenances) or the progeny of trees of local provenances selected for superior form and vigor (plus trees) offer alternative means to increase yield over that obtained {{by the use of}} seed from unselected trees of the local provenance. Under Swedish conditions, Nor-way spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) of certain transferred provenances generally has an advantage in productivity rela-tive to the local provenance comparable to that of progeny of plus trees. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the extent to which productivity gains achieved by provenance transfer or the use of <b>plus</b> <b>tree</b> progeny are associated with reductions in autumn frost hardiness, relative to that of trees of the local provenance. In a field trial with 19 -year-old trees in central Sweden, bud hardiness was tested on four occasions during the autumn of 2002. Trees of the local provenance were compared with trees of a south Swedish provenance originating 3 ° of lati-tude to the south, a Belarusian provenance and the progeny of plus trees of local origin. The Belarusian provenance was the least hardy and the local provenance the most hardy, with <b>plus</b> <b>tree</b> progeny and the south Swedish provenance being interme-diate in hardiness. Both the Belarusian provenance and the <b>plus</b> <b>tree</b> progeny were significantly taller than trees of the other populations. Within provenances, tree height was negatively correlated with autumn frost hardiness. Among the <b>plus</b> <b>tree</b> progeny, however, no such correlation between tree height and autumn frost hardiness was found. It is concluded that although the gain in productivity achieved by provenance transfer from Belarus was comparable to that achieved by using the progeny of plus trees of the local provenance, the use of trees of the Belarus provenance involved an increased risk of autumn frost damage because of later hardening...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} genotype 131 accessions of Prunus avium <b>plus</b> <b>trees,</b> included in the breeding program. Area of study: The Prunus avium <b>plus</b> <b>trees</b> are located in the North, Northwest and Central Spain. Material and Methods: The Prunus avium <b>plus</b> <b>trees</b> were genotyped with nine microsatellites. Several genetic parameters were calculated. Genetic data were analyzed with STRUCTURE and the genetic distance between the <b>plus</b> <b>trees</b> were calculated. Main results: A total of 122 multilocus genotypes were detected. Several accessions with the same genotype were identified, which could be due to clonality or to labelling errors. The nine microsatellites are useful for identifying individuals because the combined probability of identity was low (PI = 5. 19 X 10 - 9). Bayesian methods detected two genetic clusters in the sampled <b>plus</b> <b>trees.</b> Research highlights: The unique genotypes identified in this work are suitable for being included in the elite breeding population for economic traits.

However, the effect of inoculation with ECM fungi on the performance of these plants has not been studied. We compared the performance of P. pinaster plants obtained from seeds of <b>plus</b> and non-plus <b>trees</b> to inoculation with different selected ECM fungi under conventional forest nursery conditions. In plants obtained from seeds of non-plus trees only those inoculated with Suillus bovinus + Laccaria laccata + Lactarius deterrimus had a significantly greater biomass and needles nitrogen concentration, while in plants obtained from seeds of <b>plus</b> <b>trees</b> this effect was seen not only in those receiving that same ECM inoculation, but also in those inoculated with Rhizopogon roseolus or Pisolithus tinctorius + Scleroderma citrinum.

It consists of 20 species with a wide and discontinuous distribution in the Northern Hemisphere. In the present study, three species, namely C. torulosa Don., C. arizonica Greene and C. glabra Sudw., growing in the western Himalayan region of India {{at an altitude of}} 1760 m. have been studied. This is a preliminary attempt where embryology is used in estimating seed quality and in seed testing. Seed quality was analysed according to five (0 –IV) seed classes based on the presence of the embryo and endosperm and their nature of development in the seed-cut-ting test. Seeds having neither embryo nor endosperm belong to class ‘ 0 ’. In class ‘I ’ seeds contain the endo-sperm but a shrivelled embryo or sometimes no embryo. Class ‘II ’ contains seeds with an embryo of half-length of the embryo cavity and class ‘III ’ seeds containing an embryo of at least three-quarter length of the embryo cavity. Seeds with completely developed full embryo were assigned to class ‘IV’. However a high percentage of seeds of classes 0 –III present in seed lots from particular trees of a species decrease the quality of seeds.

40|$|Three progeny {{tests with}} Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) {{including}} progenies from phenotypical plus and minus trees growing at different latitudes and altitudes were analysed. The progenies {{were obtained from}} crosses between the various tree types in a stand, between trees of different provenances, and after wind pollination and selfing. The characteristics analysed were total height, yearly height growth, branch length and branch angle, number of branches per whorl, length of apical bud, and length and number of lateral buds. The variation among the progenies seemed to be genetically controlled {{to a large extent}} but the varying environmental factors exerted a strong influence {{on the development of the}} young trees as well. No regular trend in the range among the plus and minus tree progenies in height growth was established when all progenies in each individual experiment were compared. <b>Plus</b> <b>tree</b> progenies were superior in height growth when compared to minus tree progenies of the same provenance. In two cases, <b>plus</b> <b>tree</b> progenies were inferior in growth rate. This was explained by an incorrect classification of the parent trees. In two out of three reciprocal crosses, significant differences in height between the reciprocal pairs were reported. Different combining ability or maternal influence are discussed as possible reasons for the differences. Four progenies obtained from the same mother tree after crosses with two plus trees, one minus tree, and after open pollination differed significantly in height. A great part of the variation between progenies is ascribed to the diversity of the male plus trees, in addition to the differences between plus and minus trees. One provenance cross between two plus trees of widely differing origin was superior in height growth to the open-pollinated progenies of the female as well as of the male parent tree. Four other provenance hybrids obtained from crosses between various minus trees did not exceed the open-pollinated progenies from the northernmost female parents in height. It is shown that the growth capacity of the parent trees used in provenance crosses is of great importance. A combination of two plus trees should result in better growing offspring than a cross between two minus trees. There was a strong correlation between the length of the terminal shoot in 1960 and the increase in height in 1961 - 1964. This indicates the possibility of selecting the best growing progeny at an early age. Significallt differences between progenies were established in most of the branch and bud characteristics analysed, indicating genetical control of these properties. The differences increased with increasing age of the progenies. There was a tendency for the <b>plus</b> <b>tree</b> progenies to have more slender crowns and fewer branches per whorl in the lower whorls as compared with minus tree progenies. The effect of inbreeding was manifested in slow height growth and poor vitality of the plants. No grouping by provenances was reported in the range of the progenies as regards branch and bud characteristics except in one experiment, where minus tree progenies of northern origin had narrower crowns than minus tree progenies from the southern provenance. On the whole, the phenotypes of the 20 selected plus and minus trees used as parents appeared to be closely related to the performance of their offspring as regards height grorth ability. The relationship between parent trees and offspring with respect to branching characteristics seemed to be less well defined. Correlations between parents and offspring in these characteristics cannot be estimated with the methods available at present...|$|E

Results: The results revealed, higher values for phenotype coefficient of variation as compared to genotypic coefficient of variation in corresponding germination and seedling growth characters, indicating that the characters are greatly influenced by the field environment. The heritability and expected genetic gain were also observed to be high to moderate for these characters. There is wide scope for early screening of the genotypes because of the positive and significant correlation at 5 % level of significance among germination and seedling growth characters with each other except for few characters times with each other such as internodal length with number of leaves per seedling, number of leaves with dry weight of shoot, fresh weight of root and total biomass of seedling. Conclusion: Respectively as such genotypes S 20, S 9, S 12 and S 19 showed better performance as compared to other genotypes and are recommended for further genetic improvement programme in this species...|$|E

30|$|Most pines show low-value density {{near the}} tree center, with an {{increase}} toward the bark [18]. Norway spruce (Picea abies), however, demonstrated the same radial variations of density as hinoki [19]. In conifers, MFA varies from pith to bark, with the largest angles occurring {{in the first five}} to ten growth rings from the pith [20]. In hinoki, MFA showed the largest angle in juvenile wood near the pith and decreased gradually toward the bark, becoming constant at ring number 10 – 15 [16]. Hinoki <b>plus</b> <b>tree</b> families had larger ring width and slightly lower density and stiffness of logs than local families [21]. Densely planted hinoki produces a higher percentage of latewood, with higher density and mechanical properties [22]. In our previous studies, we reported significant differences in MFA, density, color of heartwood, and termite resistance among hinoki families [23, 24]. Larger diameter of trees decreased wood properties for structural use in many hinoki families. We also reported the significant positive effects of tree height to diameter ratio (H/D) on stem stiffness in sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) trees [10]. However, very few studies of hinoki trees have examined the effects of tree height on wood properties, especially on juvenile wood properties.|$|E

In the present study, no significant correlation was observed between growth characteristics and SWV in both sites (Table  6), suggesting that SWV of teak is also independent of growth characteristics. Thus, {{it can be}} said that mechanical properties are also important criteria for selecting the <b>plus</b> <b>trees</b> in tree breeding programs.|$|R

The growth and stem quality of silver birch (Betula pendula), downy birch (B. pubescens) and paper birch (B. papyrifera) were compared in a 32 -year-old field trial in southern Finland. The material consisted of different unselected stand origins and progenies of phenotypically selected <b>plus</b> <b>trees</b> {{of silver and}} downy birch from southern Finland and differing stand origins of paper birch from the North-West Territories, Canada. Growth, yield {{and a number of}} stem quality traits, including taper, sweep, stem defects, heights of different crown limits and length of the veneer timber part of the stem were measured or observed. The native Finnish silver and downy birches were superior to paper birch in terms of both yield and stem quality, silver birch being the best. Progenies of silver birch <b>plus</b> <b>trees</b> were better than the stand origin, indicating that the former are able to reach high quality veneer log size in a shorter time than unselected material. The cultivation of paper birch can not be considered viable in Finland...|$|R

A perfect (no missing leaves) weak heap with 2n elements is exactly isomorphic to a binomial heap of the same size, but the two algorithms handle sizes which are not a power of 2 differently: a binomial heap uses multiple perfect trees, while a weak heap uses a single imperfect tree.|$|R
