40|$|Abstract—Roller {{conveyor}} {{chains are}} commonly used to transport goods in production lines or assembly lines, such as pallets, cars or steel coils. They are sometimes used in severe environments, soiled with water, foreign particles, chemicals or other contaminants. Normal use will result in wear {{of the components of}} the chain which can lead to unexpected failure and costly production downtime. Today, few literatures on the wear of conveyor chain are available and there are almost no reliable test-rigs to generate and measure chain wear in a reproducible manner. In this paper the different components of roller conveyor chains are designed for sugar bucket elevator used in sugar industries for 20 tonnes per hour capacity and the loading conditions are described. Additionally, the advantages of chain drive as compared with other drives are discussed. The chain wear mechanisms found in literature are listed. Abrasive and adhesive wear between <b>pin,</b> <b>bushing,</b> and roller are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|PubMed ID: 25212118 Background The aim of {{this paper}} was to design a finite element model for a hinged PROSPON oncological knee {{endoprosthesis}} and to verify the model by comparison with ankle flexion angle using knee-bending experimental data obtained previously. Method Visible Human Project CT scans were used to create a general lower extremity bones model and to compose a 3 D CAD knee joint model to which muscles and ligaments were added. Into the assembly the designed finite element PROSPON prosthesis model was integrated and an analysis focused on the PEEK-OPTIMA® hinge <b>pin</b> <b>bushing</b> stress state was carried out. To confirm the stress state analysis results, contact pressure was investigated. The analysis was performed in the knee-bending position within 15. 4 – 69. 4 ° hip joint flexion range. Results The results showed that the maximum stress achieved during the analysis (46. 6 MPa) did not exceed the yield strength of the material (90 MPa); the condition of plastic stability was therefore met. The stress state analysis results were confirmed by the distribution of contact pressure during knee-bending. Conclusion The applicability of our designed finite element model for the real implant behaviour prediction was proven on the basis of good correlation of the analytical and experimental ankle flexion angle data.

50|$|A {{conveyor}} chain is chain {{that has been}} designed specifically for chain conveyor systems. It consists {{of a series of}} journal bearings that are held together by constraining link plates. Each bearing consists of a <b>pin</b> and a <b>bush</b> on which the chain roller revolves.|$|R
50|$|As with {{standard}} roller chains, self-lubricating roller chains consist of five basic parts: inner plates, outer plates, <b>pins,</b> <b>bushes,</b> and rollers. However, the bushes for self-lubricating chains are sintered metal bushes. Sintered-metal self-lubricating bearings {{are based on}} powder-metallurgy technology. They are economical, suitable for high production rates and can be manufactured to precision tolerances.Specifically, alloyed powdered metal is mixed, then compacted to form the bushing. The initial compaction {{to a large degree}} dictates the density, shape, dimensions, and mechanical properties of the finished part.The bushings are then sintered.Sintered materials have inherent porosity and the presence of pores have both beneficial and detrimental role on the part performance. The pores act as stress concentration zones and reduce the mechanical strength and ductility. However, the presence of pores acts also contribute to the reduction in noise and vibration also serve as lubricant pockets in lubricated contacts. Sintered bearings and gears are also used in many applications where the external lubrication is not possible or not preferred.It is essential that the pores form an interconnected system of controlled size and volume, so that oil is supplied to the entire bearing surface. The rate of oil supply automatically increases with temperature and, therefore, with increasing speeds of rotation, to achieve optimum working conditions.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{statistical}} methodology of estimating wear coefficient and predicting wear volume in a revolute joint using in-situ measurement data is presented. An instrumented slider-crank mechanism is built, which can measure the joint {{force and the}} relative motion between the <b>pin</b> and <b>bushing</b> during operation. The former is measured using a load cell built onto a necked portion of the hollow steel pin, while the latter is measured using a capacitance probe. In order to isolate the effect of friction in other joints, a porous carbon air bearing for the revolute joint between the follower link and the slide stage, {{as well as a}} prismatic joint for the linear slide, are used. Based on the relative motion between the centers of <b>pin</b> and <b>bushing,</b> the wear volumes are estimated at six different operating cycles. The Bayesian inference technique is used to update the distribution of wear coefficient, which incorporates in-situ measurement data to obtain the posterior distribution. In order to obtain the posterior distribution, Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is employed, which effectively draws samples of the given distribution. The results show {{that it is possible to}} narrow the distribution of wear coefficient and to predict the future wear volume with reasonable confidences.

40|$|Pin joints {{are found}} in many large {{articulating}} structures. They tend to be under high load and articulate slowly; so, the joints typically operate in the boundary or mixed lubrication regimes. This means that the operating torque depends on the respective proportions of liquid and solid contact between the joint mating faces. In this article, a mixed lubrication model of a grease-lubricated landing gear joint is established to determine a theoretical Stribeck curve, frictional torque and lubricant film thickness under different loads. Parameters describing pin joint working conditions, geometry, lubricant properties and pin/bush texture are used. The model can also predict {{the proportion of the}} load that is supported by contacting asperities and lubricant film. The changing proportions of these two parts indicate transformations between different lubrication regimes. Experiments on an instrumented pin joint have been carried out to compare with the predicted friction and torque performance.

But under low load, the real friction between <b>pin</b> and <b>bush</b> is significantly lower than theoretical predictions. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for modeling and simulating roller-chain drives using multibody formulations. The presented approach models the chain links as spatial decoupled dynamic bodies. The chain links are modeled using two different dynamic representations for the pin-link and the bushing-link. The bushing-link is modeled with two descendent dynamic bodies to represent the rollers. The adjacent <b>pin</b> and <b>bushing</b> links are connected by compliant bushing force elements. An efficient search algorithm is used to detect the contact between the roller and the sprocket teeth while a nonlinear force module is used to predict the contact force. A generalized sprocket representation is used to model the sprocket. The spatial motion of the chain links allows the out-of-plane vibrational motion of the links as well as simulating sprockets misalignment. Using the compliant connection between links avoids using the iterative calculation needed to satisfy the joint constraint equations leading to more efficient calculation scheme. The nonlinear dynamic equations of motion are solved using recursive approach. Complex roller chains drives, bicycle chain and conveyance systems can be easily modeled and analyzed using the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, <b>bush,</b> <b>pin</b> and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are press fitted with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an offset plate as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an offset plate, the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an offset plate. The holes in the offset plate are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape chain plate. A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the chain plate as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations.
