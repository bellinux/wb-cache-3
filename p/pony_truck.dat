25|$|In 1936–39 Palestinian Arabs {{opposed to}} Jewish mass {{immigration}} revolted against British rule. Railways were a particular target for sabotage. The British built blockhouses to protect bridges and regular military patrols of railway lines. Patrols were initially on foot, then in armoured freight vans propelled by locomotives with armoured cabs, and finally {{with dozens of}} rail-mounted armoured cars built at Qishon works. After one was blown up by a mine, killing a soldier, the front of each armoured car was fitted with a long bar propelling a <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> intended to detonate any mine safely without injuring any of the armoured car's occupants. British soldiers made Arab hostages ride on the <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> so that any mine {{would be likely to}} kill them.|$|E
25|$|K 177: Hamilton, Victoria. Following {{withdrawal}} from service, this locomotive {{was sold to}} the Langhi Morgala Museum in Ararat and placed on display. It was subsequently acquired by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society and transferred to Moorooduc. Further inspection revealed a number of parts beyond restoration, so a complex deal was worked out with other organisations over the late 1990s. The end result was that the frame of K 177 was placed at Hamilton, Victoria, along with its own coupled wheels, motion gear and smoke deflectors. K 159 donated the tender body, frame and bogies, and K 174 provided the boiler, smokebox, funnel and <b>pony</b> <b>truck.</b> The engine is currently un-numbered, but during the transition process it was alternately known as the Hamilton Exchange Locomotive or K 193.|$|E
25|$|K 174: Moorooduc, {{with the}} Mornington Railway. This engine had been plinthed at the Edinburgh Gardens in Fitzroy (near the former Fitzroy Railway Station) until 18 May 1997, {{when it was}} {{acquired}} by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society and transferred to Moorooduc by road. The engine was in generally terrible condition, with most fittings missing and the remainder of parts damaged, except the engine frames which were in surprisingly good condition by comparison. The tender tank had fittings removed and was scrapped at Moorooduc, being beyond repair, and the tender frame and the brake gear for the locomotive demonstrated significant collision damage. The rest of the parts were placed in a pool {{to be used to}} reassemble a future engine; {{at the end of the}} project, the pool consisted of the boiler, smokebox, funnel and <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> from 159 and 177; the loco frames, coupled wheels, axle boxes, motion gear and smoke deflectors from 159 and 174; the tender frame and bogies from 174 and 177, and the tender tank from 177 only. In 2000, the coupled wheels and motion gear from 174 was swapped with that from 176 at Seymour as the tyres from 174 required replacement, while 176's tyres were almost new; though both locomotives had poor condition axle boxes and crankpins. A few years later, the tender bogies from 174 were swapped with those from 191. When completed, the locomotive using K 174's frame is to be numbered K 177 and named City of Ararat, as part of the deal for parts acquisition.|$|E
50|$|On a steam locomotive, {{the leading}} and {{trailing}} wheels may be mounted on bogies like <b>pony</b> <b>trucks</b> or Bissel bogies. Articulated locomotives (e.g. Fairlie, Garratt or Mallet locomotives) have power bogies {{similar to those}} on diesel and electric locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Linda was loaned to {{the nearby}} Ffestiniog Railway in July 1962. For the 1963 season the {{locomotive}} was regauged to the Ffestiniog's [...] and purchased, along with Blanche {{at the end of}} the year. Both have since received extensive modifications including tenders, <b>pony</b> <b>trucks</b> and superheating.|$|R
50|$|Even the {{electric}} locomotives of Reichsbahn classes E 04, E 17, E 18 and E 19 were fitted with comparable <b>pony</b> <b>trucks,</b> known as AEG frames (AEG-Gestell). Because the axles had external bearings, the lever linkage {{also had to}} be on the outside, a characteristic detail of these locomotives.|$|R
500|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks appearing near the spring brackets of the Britannias and Clans, a substantial rearrangement {{took place in}} this area {{that resulted in the}} locomotive riding on three cast steel [...] "sub-frames" [...] carrying the ten front-most spring brackets and lengthened spring brackets behind the rear driven axle. (Perhaps remarkably, these were not integrated into a cast combined sub-frame/pony truck pivot stretcher, the <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> pivot stretcher being a fabrication.) Had the planned batch of further smaller Pacifics been built, they would have been fitted with this arrangement.|$|E
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve rods with extension levers, which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front <b>pony</b> <b>truck,</b> leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|E
500|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks {{appearing in the}} frame plates near the spring brackets, had the second batch of Class 6 Standard Pacifics been built, the chassis would have been rearranged {{to be similar to}} that used on the solitary Class 8 Pacific. This would have resulted in the locomotive riding on three cast steel Combined Frame Stretcher & Spring Brackets carrying the 10 front-most spring brackets and lengthened spring brackets behind the rear driven axle. These Combined Frame Stretcher & Spring Brackets are often referred to as [...] "sub-frames". (Perhaps remarkably, the rearmost spring brackets were not to be integrated into a single cast combined sub-frame/pony truck pivot stretcher. The <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> pivot stretcher being a separate fabrication).|$|E
50|$|Conservative {{locomotive}} builders in Bissell's native United States did {{not take}} to the design, {{and it was not}} implemented until the Eastern Counties Railway in the United Kingdom fitted one to their No. 248 in 1859. <b>Pony</b> <b>trucks</b> of similar design became very popular on British locomotives thereafter.|$|R
50|$|Both {{versions}} ran on {{the same}} 1Co' bogies, three-axle Co' bogies with additional integral single axle <b>pony</b> <b>trucks</b> which was designed and produced by General Steel Castings. The fourth axle reduced the maximum axle loading sufficiently to enable these relatively heavy locomotives to operate on the very light rail which was used throughout South West Africa at the time.|$|R
50|$|In 1902 and 1903, the CGR and CSAR {{placed a}} number of Cape 8th Class 4-8-0 {{locomotives}} in service. Initially designed in 1901 as a 2-8-0 Consolidation by H.M. Beatty, some trouble had been experienced with the leading <b>pony</b> <b>trucks</b> of the first locomotives and it was dropped in favour of a four-wheeled bogie in later orders for more locomotives.|$|R
2500|$|Second of the {{original}} batch of locomotives delivered to the railway, No. 2 was named after the Earls of Derby who owned the Isle of Man before it was sold to the British monarch and is often seen in early photographs without her back cab sheet (No. 1 also appears in this form on a famous photograph of opening day. [...] No 2 Set the precedent for Steam On The Electric being used in construction by the Isle of Man Tramways & Electric Power Co. (there are two photographs illustrating this). No. 2 is the only locomotive on the railway to have been lost to the pages of history, only a <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> survives today, {{and it is difficult}} to surmise if this was originally No. 2's as so many parts were interchanged on the locomotives. [...] She was withdrawn in 1951 and dismantled at the time for use as spare parts for the other smaller class locomotives. [...] The Frames having survived in store for many years were scrapped in 1980 by [...] "Pat the Rat" [...] (a local scrapman) at the behest of the then manager Bill Jackson. The surviving <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> was for many years at the end of Birkenhead Siding at Port Erin with No. 4 Try These chalked on it, and is currently in store as a final reminder of the only engine to not exist in one form or another.|$|E
50|$|In the US, these {{trucks were}} known as lead trucks. A <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> was the lead truck on a horse drawn rail car or trolley. A <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> {{required}} a hitch to attach horses. The term applied to US Steam Locomotives after 1900 is considered archaic.|$|E
50|$|Partly because load was not {{equalized}} {{between the}} Bissell <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> and the leading drivers, the <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> {{did not become}} instantly popular in the US. Locomotives in the UK were generally not equalized, {{so it was not}} considered a problem there. John P. Laird was the first to attempt to equalize the <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> with the drivers in 1857; he received a patent on the concept in 1866. Laird's design was complex and did not find favor, although he incorporated it on some locomotives he built or rebuilt, particularly on the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad and later the Pennsylvania Railroad.|$|E
50|$|The {{class was}} a {{development}} of Drummond's earlier 279 Class 0-6-0, fitted with superheating, <b>pony</b> <b>trucks</b> {{and numerous other}} improvements. They were far more successful than the 279s, being free running and remarkably economical in coal and water. However there were some reliability problems, notably with {{the design of the}} big ends and they were not considered suitable for passenger duties except in emergencies at reduced speed.|$|R
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 15 lt t and a water {{capacity of}} 7250 imp gal, {{with a maximum}} axle load of 14 lt 18 lcwt kg. An unusual characteristic of the tender was its six axles in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and trailing wheels in Bissel <b>pony</b> <b>trucks</b> {{and the rest of}} the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase.|$|R
5000|$|The Corris Railway was a [...] gauge tramway {{built in}} 1859, which ran from Machynlleth north to Corris {{and on to}} Aberllefenni to serve local slate quarries. Originally, the line was horse-drawn, but three {{identical}} [...] locomotives, numbered 1 to 3, were ordered from Hughes' in 1878. Between 1883 and 1900, the locos were fitted with trailing <b>pony</b> <b>trucks,</b> converting each of them into an 0-4-2 ST.|$|R
50|$|While {{these first}} Schenectady- and ALCO-built 2-8-0 {{locomotives}} were {{being subjected to}} exhaustive testing on all types of traffic and under varying conditions, some trouble was experienced with the leading two-wheeled <b>pony</b> <b>truck.</b> When designs were prepared at Salt River for a later order for more locomotives, the <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> was replaced with a four-wheeled bogie.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pony</b> <b>truck,</b> in railway terminology, is {{a leading}} truck with only two wheels.|$|E

5000|$|The {{locomotives}} had weights attached {{between the}} frames to increase adhesion. Over time, {{most of the}} Class 14C family of locomotives were [...] "rebalanced" [...] by having these weights increased or reduced to redistribute, increase or reduce the axle loading and adhesive weight by altering the loads on the individual coupled wheels, leading bogies and trailing <b>pony</b> <b>trucks.</b> Coupled wheel axle loading adjustment was achieved by attaching steel boxes filled with an appropriate amount of lead over each axle between the frames.|$|R
5000|$|The NSWGR {{wanted to}} {{extensively}} test the first locomotive, {{so the next}} member did not appear for a further two years. Meanwhile, the contract {{had been reduced to}} just 120 locomotives. All were in service by March 1925 and were fitted with large capacity [...] "Wampu" [...] tenders. The last 30 were fitted with self-cleaning smokeboxes and outside bearings on the lead <b>pony</b> <b>trucks.</b> [...] During W.W.II, the 55 Class were seriously considered for use as War Department Locomotives in Iran and Iraq.|$|R
25|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was greatly}} improved from the Class NG G11, with trailing wheels added to each engine unit, outside bar frames instead of plate frames, round-topped fireboxes instead of Belpaire fireboxes, and larger dimensions in most respects except the grate area. They were superheated and sported an extremely compact arrangement of Walschaerts valve gear and outside bar frames. The leading wheels were arranged as conventional <b>pony</b> <b>trucks,</b> while the inner carrying wheels were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|R
50|$|While {{these first}} Schenectady and ALCO-built 2-8-0 {{locomotives}} were {{being subjected to}} exhaustive testing on all types of traffic and under varying conditions, some trouble was experienced with the leading two-wheeled <b>pony</b> <b>truck.</b> When designs were prepared at Salt River for a later order for more locomotives, the <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> was replaced with a four-wheeled bogie and the coupled wheelbase was shortened from 14 ft to 13 ft.|$|E
50|$|Between 1904 and 1908, Webb's {{successor}} George Whale added {{a leading}} <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> to 26 engines, making them 2-8-0s and taking them into Class E (again from 1911).|$|E
50|$|A Victorian Railways K class steam {{locomotive}} is plinthed {{in a nearby}} park: it {{is made up of}} K177's frames and coupled wheels, K174's <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> and boiler, and K159's tender.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the Winans engines were burden (freight) as opposed to passenger type. Engines delivered after June 1848 are {{almost all of the}} Camel 0-8-0 type, favored by Winans. The early models are sometimes referred to as the [...] "Baltimore engines". The [...] "Camel" [...] name derives from the first of class of that name, delivered to the B. & O. in 1848. All [...] "Camel" [...] engines were of the 0-8-0 wheel arrangement. Winans did not believe in the use of leading (<b>pony)</b> <b>trucks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Type FT tender was {{an unusual}} type which used six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and {{trailing}} wheels in Bissel-type <b>pony</b> <b>trucks</b> {{and the rest of}} the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. Like the leading and trailing wheels of the engine, all tender wheels were fitted with roller bearings. The rationale behind the design was that if the tender frame could be carried on more points represented by the rigid and Bissel wheels instead of on only two bogie pivot centres, the frame could be made lighter.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive’s Type FT tender was {{an unusual}} {{experimental}} type using six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and trailing wheels in bissel type <b>pony</b> <b>trucks</b> {{and the rest of}} the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. A similar Type JV tender had been built in the Salt River shops in Cape Town in 1936 for test purposes and as a prototype to the Type FT. The tender’s wheel arrangement did not prove to be very successful, however, and was not used again.|$|R
50|$|The first 8th Class {{locomotive}} of the Cape Government Railways (CGR) was a 2-8-0 Consolidation type {{designed by}} H.M. Beatty, the CGR’s Chief Locomotive Superintendent from 1896 to 1910. It was later {{to become the}} Class 8X on the South African Railways (SAR). While these first Schenectady- and ALCO-built 2-8-0 locomotives were being subjected to exhaustive testing on all types of traffic and under varying conditions, some trouble was experienced with the leading two-wheeled <b>pony</b> <b>truck.</b> When designs were prepared at Salt River for a later order for more locomotives, the <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> was replaced with a four-wheeled bogie.|$|E
50|$|Between 1906 and 1908, Whale also rebuilt 10 {{with larger}} Experiment-type boiler to Class F, again adding a leading <b>pony</b> <b>truck.</b> (Two more of Class B were also {{converted}} to Class F via Class E).|$|E
50|$|On {{small scale}} models the {{trailing}} wheels of Cartazzi-axled locomotives are often flangeless to allow negotiation of tighter, non-prototypical curves, or the Cartazzi axle {{has been replaced}} with a <b>pony</b> <b>truck</b> for the same reason.|$|E
50|$|This {{reconstruction}} {{should not}} to be confused with the general repair of a number of locomotives which was also carried out in the Stendal Reichsbahn repair shop (Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk or RAW) from 1959 onwards. Under that programme only the refinements omitted during wartime were added back, and worn out components - or those which were too small (again for wartime austerity reasons) - were replaced. Usually only the firebox and <b>pony</b> <b>trucks</b> were replaced. These refurbished engines retained their original numbers, however the Rekoloks were reorganised, irrespective of their original numbers, into sub-class 52.80.|$|R

50|$|The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company {{also ordered}} {{three of those}} locomotives, numbers 6, 7, and 8, {{at a cost of}} about £6000 each (equivalent to about $1 million in 2011). They were fitted with an ornate Rogers-styled wooden cab with Gothic windows, and an {{extended}} smokebox crowned with a copper-capped funnel. They could be fired with any light fuel including wood, and were very slightly heavier than the NZR version. They had inside frames and journals on both <b>pony</b> <b>trucks.</b> When the WMR was taken over by the NZR in 1908, they were included in the V class.|$|R
