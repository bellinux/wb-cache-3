The lighting system in the Wii version is more advanced than that in the PS2 version, which Krome also built; the PS2 includes more graphic details than their PSP version.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team began {{development}} on Sonic the Hedgehog in 2004, {{after the completion}} of Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003). The team was considering working on an original non-Sonic project, with a realistic look and feel and an advanced <b>physics</b> <b>engine.</b> When they were reassigned to work on the new Sonic game, they decided to retain the realistic approach for the new game. Series co-creator and team lead Yuji Naka envisioned the next-generation Sonic game as a reboot of the franchise, and wanted to mimic the success of superhero films such as Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Batman Begins (2005). It was decided to use the same title as the original 1991 game that had launched the franchise to indicate {{that it would be a}} major advance from the previous games. The Havok <b>physics</b> <b>engine,</b> previously used in their PlayStation 2 game Astro Boy (2004), allowed them to create expansive levels previously impossible on earlier sixth generation consoles, and experiment with multiple play-styles. Game director Shun Nakamura demonstrated the engine during their stage shows at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires III {{builds on}} and {{introduces}} new features to the Age of Mythology engine, called Bang! Engine. One new {{feature is the}} inclusion of the Havok physics simulation middleware engine on the Windows version and the similar PhysX engine on Mac OS X. This means that many events such as building destruction and tree falls will not be pre-created animations, but will be calculated according to the <b>physics</b> <b>engine,</b> in an innovation for the series. Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E

5|$|Game {{development}} {{began by}} late 2008. There was high staff turnover {{from the previous}} Saints Row team with one-fifth of the final 100-person staff having worked on a previous title in the series. They aimed to improve on the series by giving the game a coherent tone, and found it in films such as Hot Fuzz and the game's signature sex toy bat. Saints Row: The Third was built using the Havok <b>physics</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is {{also one}} of the first games that uses the Havok's HydraCore <b>physics</b> <b>engine,</b> which was {{specifically}} designed for multi-core video game systems such as the Xbox 360. The game's renderer engine employs more advanced graphic technologies than was possible in the previous console generation, including parallax mapping, ambient occlusion, subsurface scattering, and high dynamic range. The soundtrack of the game was primarily composed by David Clynick, who worked with Grant Kirkhope on the original Nintendo 64 game's score. New York based group MorissonPoe contributed two songs to the score, while DJs Kepi and Kat composed the game's nightclub theme.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok <b>physics</b> <b>engine),</b> and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E

Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E
5|$|While it {{contains}} some small role-playing elements, Dawn of Mana diverges from the prior two-dimensional action role-playing game titles {{of the series}} to focus directly on action-adventure gameplay in a full 3D world. Incorporating the Havok <b>physics</b> <b>engine,</b> the gameplay focuses on the player grabbing and throwing objects and monsters in order to startle enemies before attacking them with a sword and magic. Keldric grows more powerful as the player journeys through an area, only to reset to his base abilities with each new zone unless difficult extra challenges are met. Unlike many of its predecessors, the game does not feature any cooperative multiplayer component.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} pre-visualized rough drafts to sketch ideas {{for others to}} advance. For example, the introductory airplane level was pre-visualized two years prior to its creation as a demonstration for the development team and publisher. Levels were built in Volition's Core Technology Group (CTG) editor, which was continually built {{in the four years}} preceding release. Like the other two titles, Saints Row: The Third was built in the Havok <b>physics</b> <b>engine</b> with customizations. The engine let the team build vehicle drifting physics and the VTOL aircraft. The studio considered the Red Faction series' Geo-Mod 2 engine but chose against it due to the implementation's difficulty and not wanting that degree of destruction. Phillips gave a game development postmortem at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, where he advised studios to let development team members run with their ideas. Volition began to add modding support to the title and series in mid 2013.|$|E

40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) {{applications}} {{are employed in}} engineering situation to simulate real and artificial situations where the user can interact with 3 D models in real time. Within these applications the virtual environment must emulate real world physics such that the system behaviour and interaction are as natural as possible and to support realistic manufacturing applications. As a consequence of this focus, several simulation engines {{have been developed for}} various digital applications, including VR, to compute the physical response and body dynamics of objects. However, the performance of these <b>physics</b> <b>engines</b> within haptic-enabled VR applications varies considerably. In this study two third party <b>physics</b> <b>engines</b> - Bullet and PhysXtm- are evaluated to establish their appropriateness for haptic virtual assembly applications. With this objective in mind five assembly tasks were created with increasing assembly and geometry complexity. Each of these was carried out using the two different <b>physics</b> <b>engines</b> which had been implemented in a haptic-enabled virtual assembly platform specifically developed for this purpose. Several physics-performance parameters were also defined to aid the comparison. This approach and the subsequent results successfully demonstrated the key strengths, limitations, and weaknesses of the <b>physics</b> <b>engines</b> in haptic virtual assembly environments...|$|R
5|$|To {{experience}} {{firsthand the}} processes mod-makers {{would have to}} go through with the new engine, Valve ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine. Half-Life: Source is a straight port, lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack. However, it does take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic <b>physics</b> <b>engine.</b> They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2s Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a field of view options, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements. Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.|$|E
25|$|The game simulates trajectories and orbits using patched conic {{approximation}} {{instead of}} a full n-body simulation; thus, it does not support Lagrange points, perturbations, Lissajous orbits, halo orbits or tidal forces.

Additionally, each player's avatar is treated as a physical object so that it may interact with physical objects in the world. , Second Life simulators use the Havok 2011.2 <b>physics</b> <b>engine</b> for all in-world dynamics. This engine is capable of simulating thousands of physical objects at once.|$|E
25|$|Collision {{detection}} typically {{refers to}} the computational problem of detecting the intersection {{of two or more}} objects. While the topic is most often associated with its use in video games and other physical simulations, it also has applications in robotics. In addition to determining whether two objects have collided, collision detection systems may also calculate time of impact (TOI), and report a contact manifold (the set of intersecting points). Collision response deals with simulating what happens when a collision is detected (see <b>physics</b> <b>engine,</b> ragdoll physics). Solving collision detection problems requires extensive use of concepts from linear algebra and computational geometry.|$|E
25|$|The second version {{made its}} debut in 2002 with America's Army, a free {{multiplayer}} shooter created by the US Army. While {{the basic structure of}} the engine was used, this generation saw the renderer completely re-written, and integrated a number of features, such as the Matinee cinematic editing tool, export plug-ins for 3D Studio Max and Maya, and the Karma <b>physics</b> <b>engine,</b> a tool by Math Engine that powered the ragdoll physics in Unreal Tournament 2003. In addition, it featured UnrealEd 2, which debuted with the previous generation of the engine and was shortly followed later by UnrealEd 3.

This is also true of dwarfs' molotov cocktails. As such, friendly fire is an important aspect of the game. The weather is also something the player must always bear in mind. For example, rain or snow can put out explosive-based attacks. It is also much easier for projectile units to hit enemies below them rather than above them, and as such, positioning of the player's units is an important aspect of the game.|$|E

25|$|For several years, Valve {{secretly}} {{worked on}} the sequel to the original Half-Life, titled Half-Life 2.
