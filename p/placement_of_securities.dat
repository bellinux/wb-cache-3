40|$|Traditional {{explanations}} of market crashes {{rely on the}} collapse of an asset price bubble or the exacerbation of an information asymmetry sufficient to cause less-informed participants {{to withdraw from the}} market. We show that markets can crash even though asset prices have not deviated from fundamental values and information is shared symmetrically among all market participants. We present a model in which markets crash when investors shift their beliefs about the liquidity of the secondary market. While such shifts in liquidity may be a factor in explaining many market crashes, the collapse of the market for perpetual floating-rate notes (perps) provides an especially clear illustration of the theory because a shift in liquidity beliefs appears to have been the sole determinant of the market crash. Such a shift can be precipitated by a systemic liquidity shock that is transitory or permanent. The latter proved to be the case with perps because perceptions of the liquidity of the secondary market were permanently altered. In addition to providing new insights into why markets crash, our findings are particularly relevant for unseasoned financial products that are often priced and marketed on the assumption that liquid secondary markets will develop. The perp episode also highlights the importance of broad <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities.</b> Since market liquidity arises endogenously from the diversity of liquidity needs across the investor base, the broader the investor base, the lower the probability of a systemic liquidity shock. We also show how simple modifications in security design can mitigate the impact of such a shock should it occur. ...|$|E

Firstly, the size and direction of {{the share price}} response is examined. Secondly, the determinants of the share price response are examined. Where possible, comparisons are made to evidence from international markets. The sample of data tested consists of 43 announcements of convertible debt issues, 39 announcements of preference share issues and 19 announcements of option issues made between 1983 and 2000 by Australian firms. The analysis of the share price impact in response to the announcements is conducted using Maynes and Rumsey (1993) event study methodology that adjusts for thin trading. The determinants of the share price response are examined using model specifications that are derived from the theoretical literature. The analysis of the announcement effect <b>of</b> private <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> hybrid <b>securities</b> finds significant negative abnormal returns for convertible debt issues, insignificant negative abnormal returns for preference share issues and significant positive abnormal returns for option issues. In comparison to international studies, the convertible debt results are similar to public and rights issues, the insignificant preference share results are similar to other findings and the option results are similar to private <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> equity and rights issues of options. The results of the investigation of the determinants of the announcement effect <b>of</b> private <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> hybrid <b>securities</b> finds that convertible debt issues are best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry - external monitors hypothesis, the information asymmetry - dynamic hypothesis and the agency cost hypothesis.

Recent work in {{use at the}} Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and in progress with the United States Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) has applied game-theoretic analysis to the problem by modeling it as a Stackelberg game wherein security forces are the leaders that commit to a strategy that is observed and countered by attackers. In this work, we explore efficient techniques for performing the same analysis on games with a graph structure, wherein an attacker must follow a path from an entry point to a target. If we frame these problems in the straightforward manner with leader actions being sets of edges that can be guarded and follower actions being paths from entry to targets, {{the size of the}} game increases exponentially, quickly reaching memory limitations when using general Stackelberg solvers. In this work, we propose a novel linear program that is able to solve this type of problem efficiently.

Finally, we compare the performance of this and other methods by generating optimal policies for the Seoul Metropolitan Subway in Seoul, South Korea. ...|$|R

The drawbacks depicted for currently used systems form the motivation behind this work. The analysis of the FCNS follows, which is composed of three parts. In the first part, the FCNS communication layers are examined, with respect to the mechanisms used to establish, maintain and tear down a connection between peer entities. In the second part, the <b>security</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> the proposed reference architecture are given, including details on the FCNS keystream generator used for the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the internal FCNS messages. Finally, the FCNS Error Protocol is depicted, illustrating the modes of operation and advantages it exhibits over currently used systems. The work then moves into presenting details of the software FCNS implementation, followed by the presentation of the results and measurements obtained by the case studies created. Comparisons are given in relation to the TCP/IP suite, to provide the means of identifying the FCNS applicability in various network environments. The work is concluded by presenting the FCNS functionality in delivering information for the UMTS, together with further work that may enhance the flexibility and use of the proposed architecture.
