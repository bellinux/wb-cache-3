50|$|Up {{until the}} 1990s, SLR {{was the most}} {{advanced}} photographic preview system available, but the recent development and refinement of digital imaging technology with an on-camera live LCD <b>preview</b> <b>screen</b> has overshadowed SLR's popularity. Nearly all inexpensive compact digital cameras now include an LCD <b>preview</b> <b>screen</b> allowing the photographer {{to see what the}} CCD is capturing. However, SLR is still popular in high-end and professional cameras because they are system cameras with interchangeable parts, allowing customization. They also have far less shutter lag, allowing photographs to be timed more precisely. Also the pixel resolution, contrast ratio, refresh rate, and color gamut of an LCD <b>preview</b> <b>screen</b> cannot compete with the clarity and shadow detail of a direct-viewed optical SLR viewfinder.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the live}} <b>preview</b> <b>screen,</b> {{electronic}} viewfinders can show additional information, {{such as an}} image histogram, focal ratio, camera settings, battery charge, and remaining storage space. Some have a focus peaking feature that highlights areas of the frame that are in focus. They are also in several ways more accurate than an optical viewfinder (OVF): ...|$|E
50|$|An {{electronic}} viewfinder (EVF) is a camera viewfinder where the image {{captured by the}} lens is projected electronically onto a miniature display. The image on this display is used to assist in aiming the camera at the scene to be photographed. It differs from a live <b>preview</b> <b>screen</b> in being smaller and shaded from ambient light.|$|E

50|$|Once on the timeline, {{the tools}} in MoviePlus {{can be used}} to non-destructively edit, {{manipulate}} and re-arrange these source. All actions can be previewed using the Video <b>Preview</b> <b>screen.</b> The Properties panel displays detailed information about any selected source and permits detailed adjustments. There are two audio level indicators for the left and right audio channels. The positions and sizes of these panel can be changed and while using multiple computer monitors, the different panels can be moved onto different monitors.|$|E
40|$|A new {{efficient}} {{method was}} developed for editing (LA) TEX source files. It uses the combination of an Emacs-type editor and a special version of xdvi. Source files may be edited whle browsing through the dvi <b>preview</b> <b>screen</b> simultaneously on the X window screen. Whenever a position is selected by cliclung the mouse on a page of the document on display on the screen, the corresponding location of the particular (LA) TEX source file {{is shown in the}} editor's buffer window, ready for inspection or for alteration. One may also compile and preview (and obviously edit as well) any part of the entire document, typically one of its constituent files, for efficiency's sake. Fundamental characteristics of the document, shaped by the specification of the document style and various defimtions found mostly at its root file, are retained even under partial compilation. The Editor for TEX Since {{it is not easy to}} grasp what a document looks like by simply reading the TEX source files...|$|E
40|$|Instant Preview {{is a new}} package, for {{use with}} Emacs and xdvi, that allows the user to preview {{instantly}} the file being edited. At normal typing speed, and on a 225 MHz machine, it refreshes the <b>preview</b> <b>screen</b> with every keystroke. Instant Preview uses a new program, dvichop, that allows TEX to process small files over 20 times quicker than usual. It avoids the overhead of starting TEX. This combination of TEX and dvichop is the TEX daemon. One instance of the TEX daemon can serve many programs. It can make TEX available as a callable function. It {{can be used as}} the formatting engine of a WYSIWYG editor. This paper will demonstrate Instant Preview, describe its implementation, discuss its use with LATEX, sketch the architecture of a WYSIWYG TEX, and call for volunteers to take the project forward. Instant Preview at present is known to run only under GNU/Linux, and is released under the GPL. It is available at...|$|E
