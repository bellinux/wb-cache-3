40|$|Background and aims: New dentin {{bonding agents}} and {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to reduce microleakage and create higher bond strength. This in-vitro study compared the microleakage of three resin-based adhesives versus a GIC-based adhesive on class V composite restorations.  Materials and Methods: Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surfaces of 72 sound premolars, randomly assigned to six groups (n= 12) and treated as follows: without any treatment (negative control group); total-etch (OptiBond Solo Plus); two-step self-etch (OptiBond XTR); one-step self-etch (OptiBond All-in-One) and GIC-based adhesive (Fuji bond LC) with <b>pre-cure</b> and co-cure techniques. The treated cavities were filled with a micro-hybrid resin composite (Point 4, Kerr). Following finishing and polishing procedures, the specimens were placed in 100 % humidity, stored in distilled water, thermocycled and then immersed in a methylene blue, sectioned, evaluated for microleakage and scored on a 0 to 3 ordinal scale.  Results: None of the adhesives tested were capable of completely eliminating marginal microleakage. There were statistically significant differences among the test groups at occlusal margins; but at cervical margins were not. The Fuji Bond LC with co-cure and control groups had significantly greater microleakage scores at the occlusal margins. At the cervical margins, the bonded restorations with OptiBond XTR and OptiBond All-in-One adhesives presented significantly lower microleakage scores. Also, {{there were no significant differences}} between the resin adhesive groups both at occlusal and cervical margins. The microleakage scores at the cervical margins were markedly higher than the occlusal margins in the groups bonded with OptiBond Solo Plus and Fuji Bond LC with <b>pre-cure.</b> The differences between Fuji Bond LC adhesive with <b>pre-cure</b> and co-cure techniques were significant.

The influence of these parameters on the mechanical properties of epoxy/nanoclay/MWNT has been investigated using Taguchi's experimental design. The output measured responses are the tensile properties (tensile modulus, tensile strength and strain at break), impact strength and fracture toughness. From the Analysis of Mean (ANOM) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), MWNT content, <b>pre-cure</b> temperature and cure temperature had the most significant effects for the impact strength with contribution percentages of 38 %, 28 % and 23 % respectively. However, for the fracture toughness and strain at break, the enhancements of properties come from the nanoclay content (59 %), MWNT content (18 %) and <b>pre-cure</b> temperature (23 %). While the improvement in tensile strength was influenced by nanoclay and MWNT content, the cure temperature has a stronger effect on the tensile modulus.

Cytec FM® 94 adhesive film (0. 25 mm nominal thickness) was used for all joints to bond two 2 mm-thickness carbon fibre polymer composite laminates manufactured from unidirectional Hexcel M 21 /T 800 S pre-pregs. Peel-ply surface treatment was used for all joints. The bonds were deteriorated via five methods: <b>pre-curing</b> the centre of bond area prior to the cure of the bond edges, increasing the curing temperature rate, reducing the curing time, and embedding PTFE films over the centre of the bond. For the last method, the studies were carried out by embedding PTFE films on one and two sides of the adhesive film.

The demonstrator featured flat, double-curvature, joggles, abrupt geometry changes, and honeycomb inserts. The {{scientific literature}} {{was used to}} assess and mitigate the processing risks for this demonstrator. Low through-thickness gas permeability and ply-bridging in small radii corners were thought to be the most significant risks. The through-thickness permeability of the target material was undetectable, therefore spiking was used to increase gas evacuation. Unfortunately, the available mould had small radii that could not be increased, as a result ply bridging was observed in these corners. Miniature pressure sensors were successfully embedded in the demonstrator to monitor the honeycomb core pressure throughout the lay-up, including intermittent de-bulking, the <b>pre-cure</b> vacuum hold, and the elevated temperature cure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} pre-heating of high-viscosity bulk-fill composite materials on their degree of conversion and shrinkage force formation. METHODS Four bulk-fill composite materials (Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill-TECBF, x-tra fil-XF, QuixFil-QF, SonicFill-SF) and one conventional nano-hybrid resin composite (Tetric EvoCeram-TEC) were used. The test materials were either kept at room temperature or pre-heated to 68 °C {{by means of a}} commercial heating device, before being photoactivated with a LED curing unit for 20 s at 1170 mW/cm(2). Shrinkage forces (n= 5) of 1. 5 -mm-thick specimens were recorded in real-time for 15 min inside a temperature-controlled chamber at 25 °C (simulating intraoral temperature after rubber dam application) with a custom-made stress analyzer. Degree of conversion (n= 5) was determined at the bottom of equally thick (1. 5 mm) specimens using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Data were analyzed with Student's t-test, ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test (α= 0. 05). RESULTS Composite pre-heating significantly increased the degree of conversion of TECBF, but had no effect on monomer conversion of the other materials investigated. For each of the test materials, pre-heated composite generated significantly lower shrinkage forces than room-temperature composite. At both temperature levels, TECBF created the significantly highest shrinkage forces, and QF caused significantly higher shrinkage forces than both XF and TEC.

One type of multifunctional composite is a structural capacitor that uses car-bon fiber cloth as electrodes separated by glass-fiber cloth.

In the present study, we investigate the mechanism of electrical shorting in such capacitors, which allows us to propose an improved fabrication process to prevent electrical shorting between the carbon-cloth electrodes. Infrared thermography reveals that electrical shorting between the elec-trodes is caused by contact between the carbon-fiber electrodes.

40|$|For many joining applications, {{adhesive}} bonding is the favoured method. It provides {{the ability to}} join dissimilar materials such as metals and plastics. Adhesive bonds can be formed over large flange areas subsequently increasing the overall stiffness of the assembly. In some cases, however, the bonding process can lead to distortions, i. e. unwanted visible deformations, especially if thin-walled structures such as car body panels are involved. These deviations from the intent shape might not affect the structural integrity of a part, but, if visible to customers on a product’s surface, they can be considered an aesthetic flaw. Distortions can be divided in local ones, which occur close to the bond line, and global ones, which affect the geometry of the entire assembly. In this thesis, the development of local panel distortions that occur in a hot-cure cycle of an adhesive is studied. A laboratory sample is exposed to temperature cycles with different heating rates and cure temperatures; the displacement of a steel strip is monitored. The panel curvatures are measured after cure cycles with and without a dwelling step at elevated temperature before the cure temperature is reached. A simulationmodel is developed that takes thermal and chemical volume changes, the cure evolution, the liquid-solid transition and stress relaxation of the adhesive into account. Mechanical properties and expansion coefficients were measured and integrated in the simulation model. Simulation results are compared with data from the experiments. The sensitivity of the predictions of distortions to changingmaterial properties is investigated. Distortions can arise early in the cure cycle. Even during the heating phase, panels can start to deform. The model predicts well the development of distortions. The influence of the temperature cycle on distortions is also reproduced by the model due to the hypo-elastic formulation of the stress-strain relation during cure. A <b>pre-cure</b> step {{can be used to}} reduce distortions. The model can reproduce that. Improvements, however, might be in a range in which also other effects play a role, such as deviations of adherends from an intended shape before the bonding process. Predictions showed different sensitivities to changing material constants. In a set-up where the adhesive is not confined, the bulk modulus did not show any significant influence on the predictions of distortions, so that an estimate for it may suffice. Chemical shrinkage, however, needs to be measured in-situ or should be corrected from measurements at roomtemperature to fit the real behaviour at elevated temperatures, since the influence on distortions is strong.

40|$|By {{translating}} bioanalytical testing {{from the}} laboratory into the clinic or at home, point-of-care (POC) diagnostics enables timely diagnosis, monitoring, {{and treatment of}} patients. Fundamental {{to the development of}} POC diagnostics has been the use of microfluidics, which offers small sample volume consumption and can combine multiple sample-processing steps into a single device. However, microfluidics has provided a limited throughput due to the multiple microvalve switching of samples, slow mixing, sample dispersion and band-broadening in microfluidic channels which result in decreasing the temporal resolution of the system. Droplet-based microfluidics has emerged as an alternative technique to manipulate and analyse sample droplets in a high-throughput format. Samples are compartmentalized in nanolitre sized droplets which eliminate dispersion or band-broadening and hence increase the temporal resolution of the system. The development of high-throughput, quantitative and rapid microfluidic-based separations has been a long-sought goal for applications in proteomics, genomics, biomarker discovery and clinical diagnostics. Using droplet-interfaced microchip electrophoresis (MCE) techniques, a novel parallel MCE platform, based on the concept of Slipchip and a newly developed ‘Gelchip’ has been presented in this Thesis. The platform consisted of two “slipping” plastic plates, with droplet wells on one plate and separation channels with preloaded/cured gel on the other. A single relative slipping of the plates enabled generation and then injection of multiple droplets in parallel into the separation channels, allowing to analyse sample droplets in parallel and in a high-throughput format. As proof-of-concept applications, the separation of 30 sub-nanolitre sample droplets containing fluorescent dyes was performed. Theoretical plates were calculated to be 7560 /s at a distance of 3. 5 cm. We further determined the effect of droplet sizes on the separation efficiency and found that theoretical plates were higher (2220 /s) for smallest droplets (320 picolitres) and lower (1480 /s) for largest droplets (1750 picolitres) at a distance of 8 mm. For the quantitative determination of fluorescent molecules, the change in peak areas of different concentrations of the fluorescent molecule (Fluorescein-isothiocyanate) was found to be linear with a small error of 3. 6 % RSD. Furthermore, separation of DNA step ladder at a distance of 1. 3 cm was also achieved with theoretical plates of 79800 /s which is one order of magnitude higher than our previously reported droplet-interfaced platform (Niu et al. 2013). To facilitate ‘non-microfluidic users’, new protocols were also developed to <b>pre-cure</b> separation gels (e. g. agarose and polyacrylamide) in open channels forming a ‘Gelchip’ that can be prepared in batch and used off-the-shelf. Droplet-based microfluidics is ideally suited to continuous biochemical analysis, requiring small sample volumes and offering a high temporal resolution. Many biochemical assays are based on enzymatic reactions, the kinetics of which can be obtained by probing droplets at multiple points over time. Real-time and continuous chemical monitoring of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or liver transplant in intensive care unit (ICU) could be life-saving and protect from further damage to the tissue. Current systems to monitor these patients are bulky and are placed at a distance from the patient (typically 30 - 40 cm) which introduces sample dispersion and limits the temporal resolution of the system. A droplet-based portable continuous chemical sensing device capable of generating droplets-on-demand and analysing glucose or lactate from near patient has been developed. The primary task of the project was to calibrate the performance of the device by generating droplets by a novel screw-driven pump, calibrating droplet sizes and detecting different droplet concentrations in an absorbance based flow cell. To measure the reactions in droplets calorimetrically, a miniaturised 7 -detector flow cell to analyse enzyme kinetics, with an example application of continuous glucose assay in droplets has been developed. Reaction rates and Michaelis-Menten kinetics were quantified for each individual droplet, and unknown glucose concentrations were accurately determined (errors < 5 %) with the lowest quantified concentration of 0. 5 mM. Droplets can be probed continuously giving short sample-to-result time (~ 30 s) measurement. In contrast to previous reports of multipoint droplet analysis (all of which used bulky microscope-based setups) the flow cell presented here has a small footprint (45 by 10 by 15 mm) and uses low-powered, low-cost components, making it ideally suited for use in field-deployable devices. The flow cell was further upgraded via fabrication of precise micromilling of the cartridge and successfully applied for detection of glucose and lactate droplets (lowest quantified concentrations of 0. 175 mM and 0. 1 mM respectively) for clinical applications. Another significant development of the optical flow cell is dual light paths for accurately quantifying the size and velocity of the continuously flowing droplets, as well as quantifying the composition of the droplet. The flow cell was capable of measuring droplet lengths with errors of < 5 %. With all these features, a fully functional optical flow cell is built that can be readily used in wearable/portable microfluidic devices...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{ultrasound}} is recognised as a {{means to}} obtain information about concrete with non-destructive testing. Various aspects of the material can be characterised. However, the scientific literature in this area is quite sparse. The present paper therefore addresses the issue of moisture content, and related compressive strength, in a systematic experimental manner. The moisture content profiles of 24 concrete cubes under constant simulated precipitation over 24 h were investigated using ultrasonic methods. Different values of water/cement ratio, duration of <b>pre-curing</b> vibration and curing regime were used. The propagation time of ultrasonic compression wave pulses gave a good correlation with gravimetric moisture content and {{it was found that the}} type of curing and the amount of vibration had the greatest impact on the propagation time of the ultrasonic wave. The moisture diffusion coefficient was estimated using a simple finite difference model and good agreement was achieved with experimental measurements...|$|R
5000|$|The smoking of food likely {{dates back}} to the time of {{primitive}} cavemen. As caves or simple huts lacked chimneys, these dwellings would probably have become very smoky. It is supposed that early men would hang meat up to dry and {{out of the way of}} pests, thus accidentally becoming aware that meat that was stored in smoky areas acquired a different flavor, and was better preserved than meat that simply dried out. This process was later combined with <b>pre-curing</b> the food in salt or salty brines, resulting in a remarkably effective preservation process that was adapted and developed by numerous cultures around the world. Until the modern era, smoking was of a more [...] "heavy duty" [...] nature as the main goal was to preserve the food. Large quantities of salt were used in the curing process and smoking times were quite long, sometimes involving days of exposure.|$|R
40|$|The WKI (Wilhelm-Klauditz-Institut) is {{developing}} a gluing system using the end part of the channel dryer as a glue adding zone. A patenthas already been applied for this method. This system replaces blow line gluing, a generally applied and recommended method, which has several shortcomings. This is new: glues will be added in the final section of the dryer where the fibres are already dry and rather cool. <b>Pre-curing</b> of the binding agent as well as hydrolytic decompositon of the binding agent in the dryer well therefore be matter of the past. The glued fibres are separated by the transport air in a cyclone added to the dryer. This cyclone can be installed {{right at the end}} of the glue adding zone. First tests have revealed that the gluing quality comes up to usual standards for MDF, though clearly less binding agents have to be used (3 % of solid resin maximum/absolutely dry fibre mass).

40|$|Hybrid IR/convective {{oven baking}} {{of high quality}} {{industrial}} powder coatings {{is one of the}} most attractive method to achieve significant economic and process time savings. This method is based on two curing steps: at first, a pigmented decorative basecoat is electrostatically sprayed and, then, pre-cured with IR-radiation, secondly, a transparent protective topcoat is sprayed on the basecoat and the resulting bilayer coating is oven baked. The optimization of the IR <b>pre-curing</b> conditions and the correlation between the effect of polymerization degree of the basecoat and the wear resistance of the whole coating system are investigated. In particular, an experimental study in which the degree of chemical conversion of the pigmented basecoat, the overall coating morphology and its thermal, mechanical and tribological properties are analyzed in the light of IR-radiation time and power, has been carried out. Experimental results show that the intermediate range of curing time and IR power investigated leads to properly cured basecoats and subsequently to better morphological, mechanical and tribological behavior of the whole coating system. These results were also validated by comparison with the coatings cross-linked by the traditional two-step oven baking process. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
