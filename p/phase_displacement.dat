50|$|Some sensors {{now offer}} an {{integrated}} signal processor {{that attempts to}} correct the offset and amplitude of the Hall sensor signals. This correction enables a larger maximum permissible air gap at the speed sensor. On a module m = 1 target wheel these new sensors can tolerate an air gap of 1.4 mm, which is wider than that for conventional speed sensors on module m = 2 target wheels. On a module m = 2 target wheel the new speed sensors can tolerate gap {{of as much as}} 2.2 mm. It has also been possible to markedly increase the signal quality. Both the duty cycle and the <b>phase</b> <b>displacement</b> between the two channels is at least three times as stable in the face of fluctuating air gap and temperature drift.
