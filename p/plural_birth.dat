50|$|A 1999 {{scientific}} paper {{published by}} Jacobsen reported the sex ratio for 815,891 children born in Denmark between 1980-1993. They studied the birth records {{to identify the}} effects of multiple birth, birth order, age of parents and the sexes of preceding siblings on the proportion of males using contingency tables, chi-squared tests and regression analysis. The secondary sex ratio decreased with increased number of children per <b>plural</b> <b>birth</b> and with paternal age, whereas no significant independent effect was observed for maternal age, birth order, or other natural factors.|$|E
50|$|The {{natural factors}} that affect the human sex ratio are an active area of {{scientific}} research. Over 1000 articles {{have been published in}} various journals. Two of the often cited reviews of scientific studies on human sex ratio are by W. H. James. The scientific studies are based on extensive birth and death records in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe. A few of these studies extend to over 100 years of yearly human sex ratio data for some countries. These studies suggest that the human sex ratio, both at birth and as a population matures, can vary significantly according to a large number of factors, such as paternal age, maternal age, <b>plural</b> <b>birth,</b> birth order, gestation weeks, race, parent's health history, and parent's psychological stress. Remarkably, the trends in human sex ratio are not consistent across countries at a given time, or over time for a given country. In economically developed countries, as well as developing countries, these scientific studies have found that the human sex ratio at birth has historically varied between 0.94 and 1.15 for natural reasons.|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is a lack}} of {{population-based}} {{studies on}} multiple births and maternal mental health. Having a high-risk pregnancy by bearing two or more children is a stressful life event, and the challenges of parenting two or more children probably also lead to a high level of parental stress. There are a few results on multiple births and maternal mental health from studies on in vitro fertilization samples. The only previous cohort study on multiple birth and maternal mental health included a single measure of depressive symptoms at 9 months postpartum. We aim to estimate the relative risk for depression and anxiety after multiple birth in a population-based prospective cohort study while adjusting for factors prior and subsequent to fertilization. Methods : We used data from 87, 807 pregnancies included in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study. Information on multiple birth was retrieved from the Norwegian Medical Birth Registry, and maternal mental health was assessed at 17 th and 30 th week of gestation and 0. 5, 1. 5, 3, and 5 years postpartum. There were 1, 842 plural births included in the study (i. e. 1, 821 twin births and 21 higher order births). We predicted maternal mental health at each time point, subsequently adjusting for 1) factors prior to fertilization (e. g. maternal age and in vitro fertilization); 2) factors during pregnancy (e. g. hypertensive states); 3) factors at delivery (e. g. cesarean section); 4) child-related postnatal complications (e. g. intracranial hemorrhage); and 5) concurrent depression or anxiety after pregnancy. Results : Adjusted for antecedents of <b>plural</b> <b>birth,</b> mothers expecting a <b>plural</b> <b>birth</b> had a normal risk for anxiety (RR= 1. 05; 95 % CI 0. 92 - 1. 20) and depression (RR= 1. 02; 95 % CI 0. 89 - 1. 16) at 17 th week of gestation. However, <b>plural</b> <b>birth</b> was associated with maternal depression at 1. 5, 3, and 5 years postpartum and maternal anxiety at 3 years postpartum. The trend was for the association to increase across time, and mothers of multiplets had a significant higher risk for depression at 5 years (RR= 1. 77; 95 % CI 1. 33 - 2. 35). Fully adjusted the RR for depression was 1. 51 (95 % CI 1. 10 - 2. 08). By adjusting depression for concurrent anxiety, and vice versa we found the effect of multiple pregnancy to be specific to depression and not anxiety. Conclusions: Mothers expecting multiplets have normal mental health during pregnancy. After birth there is an increasing risk for depression up to 5 years of age. Our findings indicate that more is simply more, and mothers of multiplets have need for additional support several years postpartum</p...|$|E
40|$|Background We {{examined}} {{the association of}} maternal obesity with risk of stillbirth, focusing on whether the pattern of results varied by gestational age or maternal race-ethnicity or parity. Methods Analyses included 4, 012 stillbirths and 1, 121, 234 liveborn infants delivered in California from 2007 – 2010. We excluded stillbirths due to congenital anomalies, women with hypertensive disorders or diabetes, and <b>plural</b> <b>births,</b> to focus on fetuses and women without these known contributing conditions. We used Poisson regression to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Separate models were run for stillbirths delivered at 20 – 23, 24 – 27, 28 – 31, 32 – 36, 37 – 41 weeks, relative to liveborn deliveries at 37 – 41 weeks. Results For stillbirth at 20 – 23 weeks, RRs were elevated for all race-ethnicity and parity groups. The RR for a 20 -unit change in BMI (which reflects the approximate BMI difference between a normal weight and an Obese III woman) was 3. 5 (95 % CI 2. 2, 5. 6) for nulliparous whit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Neonatal {{anxiety and}} {{depression}} and breastfeeding cessation are significant public health problems. There is an association between maternal symptoms of {{anxiety and depression}} and early breastfeeding cessation. In earlier studies, the causality of this association was interpreted both ways; symptoms of anxiety and depression prepartum significantly impacts breastfeeding, and breastfeeding cessation significantly impacts symptoms of anxiety and depression. First, we aimed to investigate whether breastfeeding cessation is related {{to an increase in}} symptoms of anxiety and depression from pregnancy to six months postpartum. Second, we also investigated whether the proposed symptom increase after breastfeeding cessation was disproportionately high for those women already suffering from high levels of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. Methods To answer these objectives, we examined data from 42 225 women in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Subjects were recruited in relation to a routine ultra-sound examination, and all pregnant women in Norway were eligible. We used data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and questionnaires both pre and post partum. Symptoms of anxiety and depression at six months postpartum were predicted in a linear regression analysis by WHO-categories of breastfeeding, symptoms of anxiety and depression prepartum (standardized score), and interaction terms between breastfeeding categories and prepartum symptoms of anxiety and depression. The results were adjusted for cesarean sections, primiparity, <b>plural</b> <b>births,</b> preterm births, and maternal smoking. Results First, prepartum levels of anxiety and depression were related to breastfeeding cessation (β 0. 24; 95 % CI 0. 21 - 0. 28), and breastfeeding cessation was predictive of an increase in postpartum anxiety and depression (β 0. 11; 95 %CI 0. 09 - 0. 14). Second, prepartum anxiety and depression interacted with the relation between breastfeeding cessation and postpartum anxiety and depression (β 0. 04; 95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 06). The associations could not be accounted for by the adjusting variables. Conclusions Breastfeeding cessation is a risk factor for increased anxiety and depression. Women with high levels of anxiety and depression during pregnancy who stop breastfeeding early are at an additional multiplicative risk for postpartum anxiety and depression. </p...|$|R

For stillbirth at 20 - 23 weeks, RRs were elevated for all race-ethnicity and parity groups. The RR for a 20 -unit change in BMI (which reflects the approximate BMI difference between a normal weight and an Obese III woman) was 3. 5 (95 % CI 2. 2, 5. 6) for nulliparous white women and ranged from 1. 8 to 5. 0 for other sub-groups. At 24 - 27 weeks, the association was significant (p< 0. 05) only for multiparous non-Hispanic whites; at 28 - 31 weeks, for multiparous whites and nulliparous whites and blacks; at 32 - 36 weeks, for multiparous whites and nulliparous blacks; and at 37 - 41 weeks, for all groups except nulliparous blacks. The pattern of results was similar when restricted to stillbirths due to unknown causes and somewhat stronger when restricted to stillbirths attributable to obstetric causes. Increased risks were observed across all gestational ages, and some evidence of heterogeneity of the associations was observed by race-ethnicity and parity...|$|R
