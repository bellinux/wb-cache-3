40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study {{of the formation of}} lamellar-eutectic grains in directional solidification of thin hypereutectic samples of the transparent nonfaceted alloy CBr 4 -C 2 Cl 6. We start solidification from a partly stabilized solid residue. This solid is in a single phase (beta phase) along the solid-liquid interface. The successive stages of the transient leading to the final lamellar structure are (1) the solute redistribution transient of the beta -liquid front; (2) the appearance, without nucleation, of seeds of the other solid phase (alpha phase) onto the front; (3) the growth of the alpha phase along the beta liquid front (primary invasion); (4) the secondary invasion of the newly formed alpha -liquid front by the beta phase; and (5) the oscillatory instability, called periodic lamellar branching, occurring during the secondary invasion. We study stages (2) through (5) in detail. Stages (2) through (4) are similar to those leading to banded microstructures in <b>peritectics.</b> Stage (5) is specifically responsible for the onset of two-phase growth and the formation of eutectic grain...|$|R

50|$|Unlike pure metals, most alloys do {{not have}} a single melting point, but a melting range during which the {{material}} is a mixture of solid and liquid phases (a slush). The temperature at which melting begins is called the solidus, and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the liquidus. For many alloys there is a particular alloy proportion (in some cases more than one), called either a eutectic mixture or a <b>peritectic</b> composition, which gives the alloy a unique and low melting point, and no liquid/solid slush transition.|$|E

Another type of binary phase diagram is a boiling-point diagram for a mixture of two components, i. e. chemical compounds. For two particular volatile components at a certain pressure such as atmospheric pressure, a boiling-point diagram shows what vapor (gas) compositions are in equilibrium with given liquid compositions depending on temperature.

40|$|Thermodynamic {{modeling}} of the Mg-Al-Sb system {{is carried out}} {{as a part of}} thermodynamic database construction for Mg-Al based alloys. This system was modeled by combining the thermodynamic descriptions of the constituent binaries Mg-Al, Al-Sb, and Mg-Sb. The Mg-Al system has been already studied thoroughly and its database is readily available. Hence, only Al-Sb and Mg-Sb were modeled in the present work considering all available experimental phase diagrams and thermodynamic data in the literature. Liquid phases in both systems were described by the Redlich-Kister polynomial model. High temperature modification of the Mg 3 Sb 2 compound in the Mg-Sb system was described by the sublattice model. The constructed database provides a basis to understand the alloys in the Mg-Al-Sb system. It was used to calculate and predict thermodynamic properties, binary phase diagrams of Al-Sb and Mg-Sb, and liquidus projections of the ternary Mg-Al-Sb. The calculated phase diagrams, the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of mixing, and activity of liquid Al-Sb and Mg-Sb alloys were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data reported in the literature. Moreover, isothermal sections, vertical sections, and phase assemblage diagrams were calculated for the Mg-Al-Sb ternary system, and the invariant reaction points were predicted. The predicted critical points in the Mg-Al-Sb system were 6 ternary eutectics, 2 ternary <b>peritectics,</b> one saddle point and 4 plait points.

The platinum atoms are in square, trigonal-prismatic, or capped trigonal-prismatic coordination by bismuth atoms. Additional covalent bonding between platinum atoms defines flat stripes of five atoms width inside the intermetallic layer. Bi 16 Pt 11 I 6 crystallizes in the acentric tetragonal space group P 42 (1) 2 with a = 1386. 6 (1) pm and c = 924. 5 (1) pm.

The node connectivity in the network is three or four; the total coordination number of all platinum atoms is ten. Single layers of iodide ions separate the intermetallic layers. Two-thirds of the iodide ions are coordinating bismuth atoms that protrude from the intermetallic layer, forming [BiI 4] squares. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements on polycrystalline powders indicate that Bi 8 Pt 5 I 3 and Bi 16 Pt 11 I 6 are diamagnetic metals.

The two stages of <b>peritectic</b> phase transformation, the <b>peritectic</b> reaction and the <b>peritectic</b> transformation, were investigated numerically utilizing this phase-field approach.

An assessment of the behavior of the concentration gradient in the γ-phase (the <b>peritectic</b> phase) through time was also carried out and a mathematical function which describes the γ-phase thickness evolution was defined. Finally, 2 -D simulations were performed to clearly identify the two stages of the <b>peritectic</b> phase transformation.

The model defines three stages for thin-arm dissolution (or thick-arm coarsening), i. e. the initial, intermediate and final stages: The initial thin-arm dissolution through the primary phase is sustained solely by the Gibbs-Thomson effect; the intermediate thin-arm dissolution through the <b>peritectic</b> phase is driven by Gibbs-Thomson effect but retarded by the <b>peritectic</b> reaction and transformation; the final dissolution through the primary and <b>peritectic</b> phases is enhanced by the Gibbs-Thomson effect and the phase transformation.

Identifying such <b>peritectic</b> crystals is important for constraining the components and textures of igneous rocks and the underlying processes of magmatic evolution. In this study we demonstrate that <b>peritectic</b> olivine formed in melting experiments crystallizes as clusters of euhedral to subhedral crystals. Olivine replacing orthopyroxene, amphibole, and phlogopite forms crystal clusters with distinct crystal to melt ratios, 2 D surface area, grain boundary segmentation, and inclusion relations. In our experiments the textures of <b>peritectic</b> crystals are primarily controlled by the stability temperature and decomposition rate of reactive minerals. High-temperature minerals such as orthopyroxene slowly decompose to form high-density clusters of large crystals with long grain boundary segments. The SiO 2 -rich <b>peritectic</b> melt produced favours formation of melt inclusions. Low-temperature minerals such as amphibole and phlogopite rapidly decompose to form low-density clusters of small crystals with short grain boundary segments. The relatively SiO 2 -poor <b>peritectic</b> melt produced results {{in the formation of}} fewer melt inclusions. Host melt composition has a minor effect on the textures of <b>peritectic</b> olivine formed in the melting experiments of this study and previous contamination experiments, but affects the assemblages of the <b>peritectic</b> crystal clusters. Cluster density and 2 D surface area of <b>peritectic</b> olivine tend to decrease, whereas grain boundary segment length increases with increasing experimental temperature and H 2 O content. Using textural criteria that distinguish olivine formed after different minerals in our melting experiments, we hypothesize that two olivine populations from a basaltic-andesitic lava flow of the Tatara-San Pedro volcanic complex, Chile, may be <b>peritectic</b> crystals formed after amphibole and orthopyroxene. Both amphibole and orthopyroxene are common in xenoliths preserved in some Tatara-San Pedro lava flows. One notable difference between the experimental and natural olivine crystals is that the natural olivine crystals have 2 D surface areas and 2 D grain boundary segments up to ∼ 1000 and ∼ 100 times larger, respectively, than those produced in our experiments.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a study of two aspects of <b>peritectic</b> alloy solidification: L an experimental and theoretical study of the phenomenon of banding (alternate deposition of layers of primary (a) and <b>peritectic</b> (/ 1) phases) during plane front solidification and 2. a theoretical study of microsegregation during the non-isothermal diffusion controlleG <b>peritectic</b> transformation in an alloy system where the solute diffusivities differ greatly, ie. Fe-C-Mn. Plane front solidification experiments using Sn-Cd alloys produced specimens which solidified as metastable a phase. The ~ phase was observed in only those specimens which were purposely disturbed during solidification: the a phase did not re-nucleate at the interface once ~ phase solidification was established. Banding was observed in one o...|$|E
