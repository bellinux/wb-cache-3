[...] Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)) produced by cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver. In normal circumstances, this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction. In an overdose, a large amount of NAPQI is generated, which overwhelms the detoxification process and leads to liver cell damage. [...] Nitric oxide also plays a role in inducing toxicity. The risk of liver injury is influenced by several factors including the dose ingested, concurrent alcohol or other drug intake, interval between ingestion and antidote, etc. The dose toxic to the liver is quite variable from person to person and is often thought to be lower in chronic alcoholics Measurement of blood level is important in assessing prognosis, higher levels predicting a worse prognosis. Administration of Acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. Those that develop acute liver failure can still recover spontaneously, [...] but may require transplantation if poor prognostic signs such as encephalopathy or coagulopathy is present (see King's College Criteria).|$|E

40|$|Paracetamol is {{a widely}} used non-prescription {{analgesic}} and antipyretic medicine. The {{study was conducted to}} assess the comparative in-vitro quality control parameters through the evaluation of weight variation, hardness, friability, disintegration time and dissolution profile between the commercially available tablet brands of paracetamol. Tablets of two manufacturers of the formulation were evaluated in two groups A and B. The similarities were found between both the groups. Both tablet brands of paracetamol (1. 0 to 1. 6 %) showed acceptable weight variation and friability (below 1 %). Both tablet brands were somewhat different in their hardness, disintegration time and dissolution profile. It can be concluded that standard quality control parameters always should be maintained not for paracetamol but also for all kinds of medicine for getting better drug products.
