25|$|Linked to this {{category}} {{is the problem}} of unincorporated associations. Unincorporated associations cannot hold rights (chattels or land) on their own account. When they dissolve, the question is then what to do with property that has been transferred to the association. The traditional view, as laid out in Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, is that the members of the association hold these rights on <b>purpose</b> <b>trust.</b> Where the money was raised from identified individuals, the property should be held on resulting trust for donors upon the failure of the <b>purpose</b> <b>trust.</b> Where it is impossible or impractical, the property should be passed to the Crown as bona vacantia. The more modern view developed from Walton J's judgment in Re Bucks Constabulary Benevolent Fund. This is that dissolving a society and distributing property to its members is a matter of contract, not trusts law. As such, the contract between the association's members should be the deciding factor in how the property is to be distributed, and {{there is no need to}} involve resulting trusts. If the contractual provisions identify how to distribute property, they will be followed; if not, the property will be distributed according to an implied term, usually in equal shares.|$|E
25|$|A <b>purpose</b> <b>trust</b> in English {{law is a}} trust {{created for}} the {{fulfillment}} of a purpose, not {{for the benefit of}} a person. These are normally considered invalid by the courts because they have no legally recognized beneficiaries, therefore nobody to enforce the trust, with the exception of charitable trusts, which are enforceable by Attorney General as they represent public interest. As well as charitable trusts, there are several exceptions to the rules against purpose trusts. If the requirement to fulfill a purpose is a request, rather than an obligation, the trust is valid; a trust will also be found valid if, while being for a purpose, it involves beneficiaries in some respect. Purpose trusts can also be valid if they are for the erection or maintenance of tombs and memorials (assuming such memorials are not overly grandiose), the maintenance of animals, and arguably the saying of masses, although these must all obey the rule against perpetuities and not continue for more than 21 years after the testator's death.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>purpose</b> <b>trust</b> is a trust {{created for}} the {{fulfilment}} of a purpose, not {{for the benefit of}} a person. While charitable trusts are also for the benefit of an abstract purpose, charitable purposes for the public benefit are an exception to the standard rule regarding purpose trusts, which is that they are void. The invalidity of purpose trusts is commonly said to have been set in Morice v Bishop of Durham. In Leahy v Attorney-General for New South Wales, Lord Simonds set the principle that: ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to evade the rules against purpose trusts. In Re Denley, land was given in trust to provide a sports ground [...] "primarily {{for the benefit of the}} {{employees}} of [...] company and secondarily for the benefit of such other persons as the trustees shall allow to use the same". Although for the benefit of a purpose, the wording identified a class of beneficiaries, which allowed the courts to find it valid. One way to evade the rule, therefore, is to create a trust that benefits a group of people but is confined to a purpose. The judgment of Lloyd LJ, given in R v District Auditor, ex parte West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council, seems to indicate that the test of certainty for Denley trusts is the same as for discretionary trusts. A second way of evading the rules is found in Re Tyler, where money was donated to a charity, with a request to maintain the donor's family vault; if this vault was not maintained, the money would go elsewhere. Because there was no obligation to maintain the vault, it was not considered a <b>purpose</b> <b>trust.</b> The existence of the Denley exception has enabled the <b>purpose</b> <b>trust</b> to be proposed as one way of holding rights associated with an unincorporated association.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{commonly}} {{said to be}} three (or maybe four) small exceptions to the rule against enforcing non-charitable purpose trusts, and there is one certain and major loophole. First, trusts can be created for building and maintaining graves and funeral monuments. Second, trusts have been allowed for the saying of private masses. Third, it was (long before the Hunting Act 2004) said to lawful to have a trust promoting fox hunting. These [...] "exceptions" [...] {{were said to be}} fixed in Re Endacott, where a minor businessman in who lived in Devon wanted to entrust money [...] "for the purpose of providing some useful memorial to myself". Lord Evershed MR held this invalid because it was not a grave, let alone charitable. It has, however, been questioned whether the existing categories are in fact true exceptions given that graves and masses could be construed as trusts which ultimately benefit the landowner, or the relevant church. In any case the major exception to the no <b>purpose</b> <b>trust</b> rule is that in many other common law countries, particularly the United States and a number of Caribbean states, they can be valid. If capital is entrusted under the rules of other jurisdictions the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 Schedule 1, articles 6 and 18 requires that the trusts are recognised. This follows the Hague Trust Convention of 1985, which was ratified by 12 countries. The UK recognises any offshore trusts unless they are [...] "manifestly incompatible with public policy". Even trusts in countries that are [...] "offshore financial centres" [...] (typically described as [...] "tax havens" [...] because wealthy individuals or corporations shift their assets there to avoid paying taxes in the UK), purpose trusts can be created which serve no charitable function, or any function related to the good of society, so long as the trust document specifies someone to be an [...] "enforcer" [...] of the trust document. These include Jersey, the Isle of Mann, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. It is argued, for example by David Hayton, a former UK academic trust lawyer who was recruited to serve on the Caribbean Court of Justice, that having an enforcer resolves any problem of ensuring that the trust is run accountably. This substitutes for the oversight that beneficiaries would exercise. The result, it is argued, is that English law's continued prohibition on non-charitable purpose trusts is antiquated and ineffective, and is better removed so that money remains [...] "onshore". This would also have the consequence, like in the US or the tax haven jurisdictions, that public money would be used to enforce trusts over vast sums of wealth which might never do anything for a living person.|$|E

40|$|The Uniform Trustee Act {{provides}} for the enforcement of certain non-charitable <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts.</b> This paper draws on that concept but extends it by recommending {{an expansion of the}} range of potential enforcement methods for all types of express trusts whether they are for non-charitable purposes, charitable purposes or for persons. In particular, it recommends that, for all types of express trusts, settlors be allowed to indicate possible enforcers. It also recommends that courts be allowed, unless the settlor indicates otherwise, to grant standing to persons to enforce express trusts whether for persons, non-charitable purposes or charitable purposes. It further recommends allowing for Crown enforcement of all types of express trusts (not just charitable <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts)</b> in statutorily specified situations and it recommends extending the availability of cyprès and administrative scheme orders to statutorily-identified non-charitable <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts.</b> The paper also argues that with Crown enforcement of all types of express trusts in statutorily specified situations, it is no longer necessary to retain several of the distinct features of charitable <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts,</b> such as exclusivity, public benefit and the invalidity of political <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts.</b> * Mark Gillen (B.

50|$|There are, nonetheless, several well {{recognised}} exceptions at {{common law}} where non-charitable <b>purposes</b> <b>trusts</b> will be upheld.|$|R
2500|$|People have {{a general}} freedom, subject to {{statutory}} requirements and basic fiduciary duties, to design {{the terms of a}} trust in the way a settlor deems fit. However English courts have long refused to enforce trusts that only serve an abstract purpose, and are not for the benefit of people. Only trusts charitable trusts, defined by the Charities Act 2011, and about four other small exceptions will be enforced. The main reason for this judicial policy is to prevent, as Roxburgh J said in Re Astor's Settlement Trusts, [...] "the creation of large funds devoted to non-charitable purposes which no court and no department of state can control". This followed a similar policy to the rule against perpetuities, which rendered void any trust that would only be transferred to (or [...] "vest") in someone in the distant future (currently 125 years under the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 2009). In both ways, the view has remained strong that the wishes of the dead should not, so to speak, rule the living from the grave. It would mean that society's resources and wealth would be tied into uses that (because they were not charitable) failed to serve contemporary needs, and therefore made everyone poorer. Re Astor's ST itself concerned the wish of the Viscount Waldorf Astor, who had owned The Observer newspaper, to maintain [...] "good understanding... between nations" [...] and [...] "the independence and integrity of newspapers". While perhaps laudable, it was not within the tightly defined categories of a charity, and so was not valid. An example of a much less laudable aim in Brown v Burdett was an old lady's demand in her will that her house be boarded up for 20 years with [...] "good long nails to be bent down on the inside", but for some reason with her clock remaining inside. Bacon VC cancelled the trust altogether. But while there is a policy against enforcing trusts for abstract and non-charitable purposes, if possible the courts will construe a trust as being for people where they can. For example, in Re Bowes an aristocrat named John Bowes left £5000 in his will for [...] "planting trees for shelter on the Wemmergill estate", in County Durham. This was an extravagantly large sum of money for trees. But rather than holding it void (since planting trees on private land was a non-charitable purpose) North J construed the trust to mean that the money was really intended for the estate owners. Similarly in Re Osoba, the Court of Appeal held that a trust of a Nigerian man, Patrick Osoba, said to be for the purpose of [...] "training of my daughter" [...] was not an invalid <b>purpose</b> <b>trust.</b> Instead it was in substance intended that the money be for the daughter. Buckley LJ said the court would treat [...] "the reference to the purpose as merely a statement of the testator's motive in making the gift".|$|E

5000|$|If the <b>purpose</b> <b>trust</b> {{construction}} is preferred, then {{the dissolution of}} the association will not necessarily {{bring an end to the}} <b>purpose</b> <b>trust,</b> dependent upon whether the association is the [...] "essential mechanism" [...] of the purpose. If the <b>purpose</b> <b>trust</b> survives the winding up of the association, then new trustees may need to be appointed. The West Sussex case considered the effect of the association's dissolution on the rights held by the trust where the trust did indeed fail. In such a case, the monies paid to the association will ordinarily be held on resulting trust for the contributors. However, there may be situations (including money collected through collection boxes) where the contributor can be said to have [...] "disclaimed" [...] the resulting trust and it will be considered bona vacantia.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{the courts}} have {{recognised}} exceptions to the rules against <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts.</b> The erection and maintenance of tombs and monuments is a valid trust, as in Musset v Bingle; {{this will not be}} held valid if the gift violates the perpetuity rule, or if the scale of the monument is [...] "capricious and wasteful". Trusts to maintain animals may also be valid, as in Pettingall v Pettingall. Again, this is limited to the 21 years after the donor's death permitted by trusts law. Historically, religious masses have been considered an exception to the rules against <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts,</b> but in Re Hetherington, the saying of a public mass was recognised as a valid charitable cause.

2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{objections}} to the idea of <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts</b> being valid. Firstly, English trusts law requires there be certainty of what the trust's goal is; most <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts</b> are for vaguely worded requests, such as the [...] "maintenance of good relations between nations [...] the preservation of the independence of newspapers" [...] found in Re Astor. Secondly, there is a general principle that there must be ascertainable beneficiaries. This is because, as said in Morice, [...] "Every trust (other than a charitable one) must have a definite object. There must be somebody, in whose favour the court can decree performance". If there are no beneficiaries, nobody can enforce the trust in the event that the trustees fail to carry out their duties. The third objection is that of perpetuity; a trust cannot exist for all time. The standard rule is that no trust can be drafted so that any interest lasts for longer than the life of the beneficiary, plus 21 years. In addition, no trust can be found valid if its interests last longer than this period. <b>Purpose</b> <b>trusts,</b> without beneficiaries, would cause unnecessary confusion if found valid because there is no marker by which to measure its existence. <b>Purpose</b> <b>trusts</b> may also be held to be invalid as a matter of public policy, where the courts conclude that the purpose is [...] "eccentric or capricious and the court regards it as useless".|$|R
