25|$|The major {{commercial}} {{source of}} natural rubber latex is the <b>Pará</b> <b>rubber</b> tree (Hevea brasiliensis), {{a member of}} the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. This species is preferred because it grows well under cultivation. A properly managed tree responds to wounding by producing more latex for several years.|$|E
25|$|South America {{remained}} {{the main source}} of the limited amounts of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The trade was heavily protected and exporting seeds from Brazil was a capital offense, although no law prohibited it. Nevertheless, in 1876, Henry Wickham smuggled 70,000 <b>Pará</b> <b>rubber</b> tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them to Kew Gardens, England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then sent to India, British Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), Singapore, and British Malaya. Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber. In the early 1900s, the Congo Free State in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by forced labor. Liberia and Nigeria started production.|$|E
500|$|Latex is {{a sticky}} {{defensive}} secretion that protects plants against herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured {{but the main}} source of the latex used to make natural rubber is the <b>Pará</b> <b>rubber</b> tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for which synthetic materials have proved less durable. The latex exuded by the balatá tree (Manilkara bidentata) is used to make golf balls and is similar to gutta-percha, made from the latex of the [...] "getah perca" [...] tree Palaquium. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely been replaced by synthetic materials.|$|E

50|$|Pará is {{the most}} populous state of the {{northern}} region, {{with a population of}} over 7.5 million, being the ninth-most populous state in Brazil. It is the second-largest state of Brazil in area, with 1.2 million km² (460,000 square miles), second only to Amazonas upriver. Its most famous icons are the Amazon River and the Amazon Rainforest. <b>Pará</b> produces <b>rubber</b> (extracted from natural rubber tree groves), tropical hardwoods such as mahogany, and minerals such as iron ore and bauxite.

25|$|At first, angry locals stoned the Paras whilst being {{encouraged}} by anti-British rhetoric being chanted from microphones on minarets in the town. The <b>Paras</b> used <b>rubber</b> bullets {{to try and}} bring the situation under control; this led to street battles, rifle fire and the cornering of six Royal Military Policemen (RMPs) in the police station at Majar al-Kabir. The six RMPs were killed by an angry mob of up to 600 people whilst maintaining a defensive position within the police station. Four Iraqi civilians were killed and at least eleven more were injured during the riot {{that led to the}} RMPs being cornered. The number of British troops injured numbered eight, though only one was injured through being in a firefight in the town.|$|R
500|$|Included in {{the charter}} of these gardens was the {{investigation}} of the local flora for its economic potential to both the colonists and the local people. Many crop plants were introduced by or through these gardensoften in association with European botanical gardens such as Kew or Amsterdamand included cloves, tea, coffee, breadfruit, cinchona, sugar, cotton, palm oil and Theobroma cacao (for chocolate). During these times, the rubber plant was introduced to Singapore. Especially in the tropics, the larger gardens were frequently associated with a herbarium and museum of economy. The Botanical Garden of Peradeniya had considerable influence on the development of agriculture in Ceylon where the <b>Para</b> <b>rubber</b> tree (...) was introduced from Kew, which had itself imported the plant from South America. Other examples include cotton from the Chelsea Physic Garden to the Province of Georgia in 1732 and tea into India by Calcutta Botanic Garden. The transfer of germplasm between the temperate and tropical botanical gardens was undoubtedly responsible for the range of agricultural crops currently used in several regions of the tropics.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Pará</b> <b>rubber</b> tree is {{indigenous}} to South America. Charles Marie de La Condamine {{is credited with}} introducing samples of rubber to the Académie Royale des Sciences of France in 1736. In 1751, he presented a paper by François Fresneau to the Académie (published in 1755) that described many of rubber's properties. This {{has been referred to}} as the first scientific paper on rubber. In England, Joseph Priestley, in 1770, observed that a piece of the material was extremely good for rubbing off pencil marks on paper, hence the name [...] "rubber". It slowly made its way around England. In 1764 François Fresnau discovered that turpentine was a rubber solvent. Giovanni Fabbroni is credited with the discovery of naphtha as a rubber solvent in 1779.|$|E
2500|$|The {{revenue of}} Perak in 1874 {{amounted}} to $226,333. [...] That for 1905 amounted to $12,242,897. Of this latter sum $4,876,400 {{was derived from}} duty on exported tin, $2,489,300 from railway receipts, $505,300 from land revenue and $142,800 from postal and telegraphic revenue. [...] The remainder is mainly derived from the revenue farms, which are leased for a short term of years, conveying to the lessee the right to collect import duties upon opium, wine and spirits, to keep pawnbroking shops, and to keep public licensed gambling-houses {{for the use of}} non-Malay only. [...] The expenditure for 1905 amounted to $10,141,980. Of this sum $4,236,000 was expended upon railway upkeep and construction and $2,176,100 upon public works. [...] The value of the imports into Perak during 1905 was over $20,000,000, and that of the exports exceeded $40,000,000, making a total of over $60,000,000, equivalent to about seven million sterling. The output of tin from Perak ranged between 18,960 tons, valued at $23,099,506 in 1899, and 26,600 tons, valued at $35,500,000, in 1905. [...] The fluctuating character of the output was due to the uncertainty of the labour supply. The mining population was recruited exclusively from the districts of southern China, and during certain years an increased demand for labourers in China itself, in French Indo-China, in the Dutch colonies, and in South Africa temporarily and adversely affected immigration to the Straits of Malacca. [...] The output had, moreover, been affected from time to time by the price of tin, which was $32.20 per pikul in 1896, rose to $42.96 in 1898, to $74.15 in 1900, and averaged $80.60 in 1905. [...] Exclusive of tin, the principal exports were $108,000 worth of <b>Para</b> <b>rubber,</b> $181,000 of copra, $54,000 of hides, $48,000 of patchouli, and considerable quantities of timber, rattans and other jungle produce.|$|E

Much of the book deals with the Arab's attempts to eat John Dough, for the elixir, which he had intended to drink to become immortal, was accidentally mixed into the batter that made him.

There, he befriends Chick the Cherub, the world's first incubator baby, whose gender is never specified.
