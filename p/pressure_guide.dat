We investigated {{the effect of the}} severity of an epicardial stenosis on microvascular resistance in 27 patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina. All patients had an angiographically normal coronary artery, an artery with an intermediate lesion, and an artery with a severe lesion; the latter was treated with angioplasty. In each patient, distal blood flow velocity and pressure were measured during baseline and maximal hyperemia (induced by intracoronary adenosine) using a Doppler and <b>pressure</b> <b>guide</b> wire, respectively. The ratio of mean distal pressure to average peak blood flow velocity was used as an index for the microvascular resistance (MRv). Within patients, the hyperemic MRv was higher in arteries with more severe stenosis (P = 0. 021). After percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), the hyperemic MRv decreased (pre-PTCA, 2. 6 vs. post-PTCA, 1. 9 mmHg. cm(- 1) s(- 1), P < 0. 01) toward the value of the reference artery (1. 7 mmHg. cm(- 1) s(- 1); P < 0. 67).

BackgroundCoronary flow reserve {{has been reported to}} have important clinical implications for the evaluation and treatment of coronary artery disease. MethodsUsing a <b>pressure</b> <b>guide</b> wire, coronary pressure distal to the stenosis was measured at rest and during hyperemia in seven dogs with various degrees of stenosis and in 30 patients with angina (29 and 34 stenoses in total, respectively). Pressure {{at the tip of the}} guiding catheter was also recorded with a fluid-filled transducer system. Pressure-derived CFR was calculated by the square root of the pressure gradient across the stenosis (ΔP) during hyperemia divided by ΔP at rest, using a proprietary software system. At the same time, coronary flow was monitored proximal to the stenosis with a flow meter in the experimental dogs, and coronary flow velocity distal to the stenosis was assessed using a Doppler guide wire in patients with angina. Flow-derived (or velocity-derived) CFR was compared with pressure-derived CFR. ResultsExcept for one stenosis that showed no ΔP at rest, a significant correlation was obtained between pressure- and flow-derived CFR in the animal study (y = 1. 05 x − 0. 03, r = 0. 92, p = 0. 0001). A significant correlation was also seen between pressure- and velocity-derived CFR in the human study, except in three stenoses with no resting ΔP (y = 0. 70 x + 0. 37, r = 0. 85, p = 0. 0001).

Due to its multifactorial nature, dialysis-induced hypotension cannot be reliably prevented by conventional profiling of ultrafiltration in open-loop systems since they are unable to adapt themselves to actual decreases in blood pressure. A blood <b>pressure</b> <b>guided</b> closed-loop system for prevention of dialysis-induced hypotension by biofeedback-controlled profiling of ultrafiltration was clinically tested in 94 HD treatments of four patients prone to hypotension. Automatic profiling of ultrafiltration was based on frequent measurements of blood pressure at intervals of five minutes. Proper adaptation of control features to patients&#x 2032; conditions was provided by the lower limit of systolic pressure which was individually set by the physician {{at the beginning of each}} treatment. During the initial and medium phases of the HD sessions, ultrafiltration rates up to 200 &#x 0025; of the average rates were applied as long as this was tolerated. The additional ultrafiltrate volume was used for blood pressure stabilization by lowering the ultrafiltration rates in the final phase of HD session. Biofeedback-controlled profiling of ultrafiltration provides reliable blood pressure stabilization in all phases of HD. During the first half of treatment, the frequency of hypotensive episodes remained below that with conventional therapy although ultrafiltration rates up to 200 &#x 0025; were used.

The plot of <b>pressure</b> in <b>guides</b> is limited to straight or plane. There are three options: 1) diagram of uneven pressure distribution along the non-full length of guides; 2) diagram of uneven pressure distribution along the full length of guides; 3) diagram of even pressure distribution along the full length of guides. For optimizing the processing accuracy of a positioning system should be determined coordinates of the cutting zone, at which the <b>pressure</b> in <b>guides</b> must be as even as possible. The study was based on mathematical modeling and optimization of the cutting zone coordinates. We found the formula to determine the <b>pressure</b> in <b>guides</b> surface.

BackgroundContrast intensity (CI) during MCE with intravenous microbubble infusion is dependent on the myocardial blood flow velocity (MBFV) and pulsing interval (PI). MethodsBased on an in vitro experiment, we devised the MBFV index calculated as the reciprocal of the magnitude of CI decay produced by abrupt PI shortening during intermittent imaging. In 68 coronary artery territories from 49 patients, myocardial HPD images were acquired during intravenous infusion of Levovist, while the long PI with 1 : 10 electrocardiographic gating was shortened to 1 : 1, both at baseline and during adenosine triphosphate infusion. The MBFV index in each coronary territory and MBFV reserve as the ratio between hyperemia and baseline were compared with the severity of corresponding coronary artery stenosis assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) or by <b>pressure</b> <b>guide</b> wire as the fractional flow reserve (FFR). ResultsBoth the MCE-derived MBFV index during hyperemia and MBFV reserve exhibited significant negative correlations with the QCA-derived stenosis severity (r = − 0. 56 and r = − 0. 64, respectively). The MBFV reserve positively correlated with FFR (r = 0. 89). By combining the cutoff values of the MBFV index during hyperemia and MBFV reserve, ≥ 75 % of stenoses defined by QCA were determined, with a sensitivity of 77. 3 %, specificity of 93. 4 %, and accuracy of 88. 3 %.

ResultsThere are {{no significant differences between}} the early and late studies in resting mean aortic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, and percentage diameter stenosis of the recipient left anterior descending coronary artery. There was no stenosis in the anastomosis site of the left internal thoracic artery graft and the distal left anterior descending coronary artery, as determined by means of angiography, in the early and late studies. The mean diameter of the distal left internal thoracic artery graft was significantly increased in the late study (1. 6 ± 0. 2 vs. 1. 8 ± 0. 2 mm, P =. 011). There was a significant difference between the early and late studies in the pressure gradient through the graft (15 ± 4 vs 13 ± 3 mm Hg, P =. 036).

Materials and Methods. Patients with severe ARDS and hypercapnia were studied. Esophageal balloon was inserted and mechanical ventilation was guided by assessment of transpulmonary pressures. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and inspiratory driving pressures were adjusted {{with the aim of}} achieving tidal volume of 6 to 8 [*]mL/kg based on ideal body weight (IBW), while not exceeding end inspiratory transpulmonary (EITP) pressure of 25 [*]cm H 2 O. Results. Six patients with severe ARDS and hypercapnia were studied. Mean PaCO 2 on enrollment was 108. 33 ± 25. 65 [*]mmHg. One hour after adjustment of PEEP and inspiratory driving <b>pressure</b> <b>guided</b> by transpulmonary <b>pressure,</b> PaCO 2 decreased to 64. 5 ± 16. 89 [*]mmHg (P< 0. 01). Tidal volume was 3. 96 ± 0. 92 [*]mL/kg IBW before and increased to 7. 07 ± 1. 21 [*]mL/kg IBW after intervention (P< 0. 01).

This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{autonomously}} allocating {{a large number of}} independent, equal sized tasks on a distributed heterogeneous grid-like platform, using only local information. We propose A-FAST (Autonomous Flow Approach to Scheduling Tasks), an efficient, scalable, dynamic and generic (imposing no restrictions on the topology) protocol for this purpose. Motivated by the idea of <b>pressure</b> <b>guiding</b> the flow in fluid networks, A-FAST only uses parameters available locally to a node to guide scheduling decisions. Simulations show that the protocol performs well over a variety of networks, averaging more than 99. 5 % of the optimal performance and outperforms related techniques like RID (Receiver Initiated Diffusion). We also show how a modified use of local information can improve the performance of an unreliable system. Preliminary results from implementing A-FAST on a small but real-life distributed system show the performance of our protocol to be near the maximum throughput of the system. Such a protocol has the potential to aid the efficient deployment of large, data intensive applications on very large or dynamically changing heterogeneous peerto-peer computing platforms...|$|R

However, unroll-and-jam increases register pressure, potentially resulting in performance degradation when the increase in register pressure causes register spilling. In this paper, we present a low cost method to predict the register pressure of a loop before applying unroll-and-jam on high-level source code with the consideration of the collaborative effects of scalar replacement, general scalar optimizations, software pipelining and register allocation. We also describe a performance model that utilizes prediction results to determine automatically the unroll vector, from a given unroll space, that achieves the best run-time performance.

BackgroundPatients at moderate or high risk for CIN should receive sufficient hydration before contrast application. MethodsThis prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative clinical trial enrolled 264 consecutive patients with CKD and CHF undergoing coronary procedures. These patients were randomly assigned to either central venous pressure (CVP) -guided hydration group (n = 132) or the standard hydration group (n = 132). In the CVP-guided group, the hydration infusion rate was dynamically adjusted according to CVP level every hour. CIN was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine (SCr) > 0. 5 mg/dl (44. 2 μmol/l) or a relative increase > 25 % compared with baseline SCr. ResultsBaseline characteristics were well-matched between the 2 groups. The total mean volume of isotonic saline administered in the CVP-guided hydration group was significantly higher than the control group (1, 827 ± 497 ml vs. 1, 202 ± 247 ml; p < 0. 001). CIN occurred less frequently in CVP-guided hydration group than the control group (15. 9 % vs. 29. 5 %; p = 0. 006).

We hypothesised that aspiration and replacement of dead space during expiration (ASPIDS) allows normocapnic ventilation at higher end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and reduced tidal volume (V(T)), peak and plateau pressures (Paw(peak), Paw(plat)), thus avoiding lung damage. SETTING: University Hospital. PATIENTS: Seven consecutive sedated and paralysed ALI patients were studied. Interventions and measurements: Single breath test for CO(2) and multiple elastic pressure volume (Pel/V) curves recorded from different end-expiratory <b>pressures</b> <b>guided</b> ventilatory setting at ASPIDS. ASPIDS was studied at respiratory rate (RR) of 14 min(- 1) and then 20 min(- 1) with minute ventilation maintaining stable CO(2) elimination. RESULTS: Alveolar and airway dead spaces were 24. 3 % and 31. 3 % of V(T), respectively. Multiple Pel/V curves showed a shift towards lower volume at decreasing PEEP, thus indicating that patients required a higher PEEP. At ASPIDS, PEEP was increased from 8. 9 cmH(2) O to 12. 6 cmH(2) O and VT reduced from 11 ml/kg to 8. 9 ml/kg at RR 14 min(- 1) and to 6. 9 ml/kg at RR 20 min(- 1). A {{significant decrease in}} Paw(peak) (36. 7 vs 32 at RR 14 min(- 1) and 28. 7 at RR 20 min(- 1)) and Paw(plat) (29. 9 vs 27. 3 at RR 14 min- 1 and 24. 1 at RR 20 min- 1) were observed.

Gas <b>pressure,</b> gas temperature, cooling air pressure was kept constant and the cooling air temperature was varied as a ratio of gas temperature to cooling air temperature and its effect on metal temperature studied. It was seen that, over the range of cooling air temperature tested, cooling effectiveness remained sensibly constant. Such tests also assist in estimating the surface metal temperature of the nozzle guide vane in the engine...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} 3 D {{numerical}} simulations of turbulent incompressible flows are validated against experimental {{data from the}} linear low <b>pressure</b> turbine/outlet <b>guide</b> vane (LPT/OGV) cascade at Chalmers in Sweden. The validation focuses on the secondary flow-fields and loss developments downstream of a highly loaded OGV. The numerical simulations are performed for the same inlet conditions as in the test-facility with engine-like properties in terms of Reynolds number, boundary-layer thickness and inlet flow angles with the goal to validate how accurately and reliably the secondary flow fields and losses for both on- and off-design conditions can be predicted for OGV’s. Results from three different turbulence models as implemented in FLUENT, k-epsilon Realizable, k-omega-SST and the RSM are validated against detailed measurements. From these results {{it can be concluded}} that the RSM model predicts both the secondary flow field and the losses most accurately...|$|R
40|$|Survival of {{patients}} with acute lung injury or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been improved by ventilation with small tidal volumes {{and the use of}} positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); the optimal level of PEEP has been difficult to determine. In this pilot study, we estimated transpulmonary pressure with the use of esophageal balloon catheters. We reasoned that the use of pleural-pressure measurements, despite the technical limitations to the accuracy of such measurements, would enable us to find a PEEP value that could maintain oxygenation while preventing lung injury due to repeated alveolar collapse or overdistention. Methods Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of using an esopha geal balloon catheter to measure pleural <b>pressure</b> and <b>guide</b> PEEP titration to achieve normal physiologic parameters in individual patients. Design: Single center, randomized-controlled pilot trial. Setting: Medical and surgical ICUs at Beth Israe...|$|R
