There is also a procedural scripting language, Linden Scripting Language, {{which can be used}} to add interactivity to objects. Sculpted <b>prims</b> (sculpties), mesh, textures for clothing or other objects, animations, and gestures can be created using external software and imported. The Second Life terms of service provide that users retain copyright for any content they create, and the server and client provide simple digital rights management (DRM) functions. However, Linden Lab changed their terms of service in August 2013, {{to be able to use}} user-generated content for any purpose. The new terms of service prevent users from using textures from 3rd-party texture services, as some of them pointed out explicitly.|$|E

40|$|AbstractScenario {{discovery}} is a model-based approach to scenario development under deep uncertainty. Scenario discovery {{relies on the}} use of statistical machine learning algorithms. The most frequently used algorithm is the Patient Rule Induction Method (<b>PRIM).</b> This algorithm identifies regions in an uncertain model input space that are highly predictive of model outcomes that are of interest. To identify these regions, <b>PRIM</b> uses a hill-climbing optimization procedure. This suggests that <b>PRIM</b> can suffer from the usual defects of hill climbing optimization algorithms, including local optima, plateaus, and ridges and valleys. In case of <b>PRIM,</b> these problems are even more pronounced when dealing with heterogeneously typed data. Drawing inspiration from machine learning research on random forests, we present an improved version of <b>PRIM.</b> This improved version is based on the idea of performing multiple <b>PRIM</b> analyses based on randomly selected features and combining these results using a bagging technique. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated using three cases. Each of the cases has been published before and used <b>PRIM.</b> We compare the results found using <b>PRIM</b> with the results found using the improved version of <b>PRIM.</b> We find that the improved version is more robust to new data, can better cope with heterogeneously typed data, and is less prone to overfitting...|$|R

5000|$|The Colonel enters in a Quaker's outfit as Lovely and Mrs. <b>Prim</b> re-enters {{to greet}} the [...] "guest".

Lovely does not recognise Fainwell in his Quaker disguise and shrieks when he approaches her initially, but Fainwell reveals his identity to calm her down. Due to the shriek, <b>Prim</b> investigates, but Lovely explains she shrieked because of Fainwell's non-stop blabber about converting into a Quaker. Convinced with the situation, <b>Prim</b> exits once again to leave Fainwell and Lovely alone together. Fainwell explains to Lovely that he has the consent of the other three guardians and only needs <b>Prim's</b> to marry her. Lovely understands the situation and plays along with Fainwell, faking that she has indeed converted to being a Quaker. <b>Prim</b> is convinced that Lovely is converted as a servant enters and informs that the real Simon Pure has arrived.|$|R
