5|$|High-speed USB2.0 hubs contain devices called {{transaction}} translators that convert between high-speed USB2.0 {{buses and}} full and low speed buses. When a high-speed USB2.0 hub is <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> a high-speed USB host or hub, it operates in high-speed mode. The USB hub then uses either one transaction translator per hub {{to create a}} full/low-speed bus routed to all full and low speed devices on the hub, or uses one transaction translator per port to create an isolated full/low-speed bus per port on the hub.|$|E

5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A computer is <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> the dock using a Thunderbolt port {{in order to}} gain access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E

5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. As {{he stood in the}} circle, he had two thoughts: that people would be talking about this in 100 years, {{and that it would be}} over when it rained. His body shook as though <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E

Borislow's most successful horse yet has been Toccet, who won four graded stakes, among which are the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. After selling most of his horses in 2004, Borislow set forth {{plans for a new}} voice-over-IP business which became the magicJack. Invented in 2007, the magicJack is a small product which can be <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> a computer's USB port and allows for unlimited calling from regular telephones.

When the Rumble Pak is installed, the Nintendo DS shakes whenever the pinball in the game hits an object. This {{was the first time}} that the Nintendo DS version of the Rumble Pak was introduced.

5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E
