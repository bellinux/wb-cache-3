A {{well-known}} {{generalization of}} Shannon’s sampling theorem states that a bandlimited function can be reconstructed from its <b>periodic</b> nonuniformly spaced <b>samples</b> if the effective sampling rate {{is at least}} the Nyquist rate.

40|$|High Harmonic Generation is {{a highly}} {{nonlinear}} process {{that can be used}} to generate a high flux, low divergence, coherent beam in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) wavelength range. It is proposed that this radiation source could be implemented for microscopy using coherent diffractive imaging, with potential measurements including the shape characterisation of single proteins and other biological samples. This thesis documents the development of the diffraction beam line at the University of Southampton, and presents experimental results that show progress towards this goal. A spherical multilayer mirror and a tapered hollow fiber have been used to focus the XUV beam. The mirror produced an astigmatic focus as a result of the off-axis geometry. Analysis of the surface quality of the mirror enabled an explanation for the observed interference peak splitting. The fiber was found to produce a smaller focus, but suffered from a degraded beam quality due to multiple reflections inside the optic. Using a phase retrieval algorithm, an experimental XUV diffraction pattern has been used to determine the shape of a micron-sized sample. Fresnel diffraction from an array of micron-sized apertures has been simulated and experimentally verified.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the early pre main {{sequence}} stellar rotational evolution picture has been constrained by studies targeting different young regions {{at a variety}} of ages. Observational studies suggest a mass-rotation dependence, and for some mass ranges a connection between rotation and the presence of a circumstellar disk. Not still fully explored, though, is the role of environmental conditions on the rotational regulation. We investigate the rotational properties of candidate members of the young massive association Cygnus OB 2. The Stetson variability index, Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Saunders statistics, string/rope length method, and visual verification of folded light curves were applied to select 1224 periodic variable stars. Completeness and contamination of the <b>periodic</b> <b>sample</b> was derived from Monte Carlo simulations, out of which 894 periods were considered reliable. Our study was considered reasonably complete for periods from 2 to 30 days. The general rotational scenario seen in other young regions is confirmed by Cygnus OB 2 period distributions, with disked stars rotating on average slower than non-disked stars. A mass-rotation dependence was also verified, but as in NGC 6530, lower mass stars are rotating on average slower than higher mass stars, with an excess of slow rotators among the lower mass population. The effect of the environment on the rotational properties of the association was investigated by re-analysing the results while taking into account the incident UV radiation arising from O stars in the association. Results compatible with the disk-locking scenario were verified for stars with low UV incidence, but no statistical significant relation between rotation and disk presence was verified for stars with high UV incidence suggesting that massive stars can have an important role on regulating the rotation of nearby low mass stars.

40|$|Thin film {{arrays of}} {{molecules}} or supramolecules are active subjects of investigation {{because of their}} potential value in electronics, chemical sensing, catalysis, and other areas. Scanning probe microscopes (SPMs), including scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) and atomic force microscopes (AFMs) are commonly used for the characterization and metrology of thin film arrays. As opposed to transmission electron microscopy (TEM), SPMs have the advantage that they can often make observations of thin films in air or liquid, while TEM requires highly specialized techniques if the sample {{is to be in}} anything but vacuum. SPM is a surface imaging technique, while TEM typically images a 2 D projection of a thin 3 D sample. Additionally, variants of SPM can make observations of more than just topography; for instance, magnetic force microscopy measures nanoscale magnetic properties. Thin film arrays are typically two-dimensionally periodic. A perfect, infinite two-dimensionally periodic array is mathematically constrained to belong to one of only 17 possible 2 D plane symmetry groups. Any real image is both finite and imperfect. Crystallographic Image Processing (CIP) is an algorithm that Fourier transforms a real image into a 2 D array of complex numbers, the Fourier coefficients of the image intensity, and then uses the relationship between those coefficients to first ascertain the 2 D plane symmetry group that the imperfect, finite image is most likely to possess, and then adjust those coefficients that are symmetry-related so as to perfect the symmetry. A Fourier synthesis of the symmetrized coefficients leads to a perfectly symmetric image in direct space (when accumulated rounding and calculation errors are ignored). The technique is, thus, an averaging technique over the direct space experimental data that were selected from the thin film array. The image must have periodicity in two dimensions in order for this technique to be applicable. CIP has been developed over the past 40 years by the electron crystallography community, which works with 2 D projections from 3 D samples. Any <b>periodic</b> <b>sample,</b> whether it is 2 D or 3 D has an 2 ̆ 2 ideal structure 2 ̆ 2 which is the structure absent any crystal defects. The ideal structure can be considered one average unit cell, propagated by translation into the whole sample. The 2 ̆ 2 real structure 2 ̆ 2 is an actual sample containing vacancies, dislocations, and other defects. Typically the goal of electron and other types of microscopy is examination of the real structure, as the ideal structure of a crystal is already known from X-ray crystallography. High resolution transmission electron microscope image based electron crystallography, on the other hand, reveals the ideal crystal structure by crystallographic averaging. The ideal structure of a 2 D thin film cannot be easily in a spatially selective fashion examined by grazing incidence X-ray or low energy electron diffraction based crystallography. SPMs straightforwardly observe thin films in direct space, but SPM accuracy is hampered by blunt or multiple tips and other unavoidable instrument errors. Especially since the film is often of a supramolecular system whose molecules are weakly bonded (via pi bonds, hydrogen bonds, etc.) both to the substrate and to each other, it is relatively easy for a molecule from the film to adhere to the scanning tip during the scan and become part of the tip during subsequent observation. If the thin film array has two-dimensional periodicity, CIP is a unique and effective tool both for image enhancement (determination of ideal structure) and for the quantification of overall instrument error. In addition, if a sample of known 2 D periodicity is scanned, CIP can return information about the contribution of the instrument itself to the image. In this thesis we show how the technique is applied to images of two dimensionally periodic samples taken by SPMs. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been done before. Since 2 D periodic thin film arrays have an ideal structure that is mathematically constrained to belong to one of the 17 plane symmetry groups, we can use CIP to determine that group and use it for a particularly effective averaging algorithm. We demonstrate that the use of this averaging algorithm removes noise and random error from images more effectively than translational averaging, also known as 2 ̆ 2 lattice averaging 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Fourier filtering 2 ̆ 2. We also demonstrate the ability to correct systematic errors caused by hysteresis in the scanning process. These results have the effect of obtaining the ideal structure of the sample, averaging out the defects crystallographically, by providing an average unit cell which, when translated, represents the ideal structure. In addition, if one has recorded a scanning probe image of a 2 D <b>periodic</b> <b>sample</b> of known symmetry, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} use the Fourier coefficients of the image transform to solve the inverse problem and calculate the point spread function (PSF) of the instrument. Any real scanning probe instrument departs from the ideal PSF of a Dirac delta function, and CIP allows us to quantify this departure as far as point symmetries are concerned. The result is a deconvolution of the 2 ̆ 2 effective tip 2 ̆ 2, which includes any blunt or multiple tip effects, as well as the effects caused by adhesion of a sample molecule to the scanning tip, or scanning irregularities unrelated to the physical tip. We also demonstrate that the PSF, once known, can be used on a second image taken by the same instrument under approximately the same experimental conditions to remove errors introduced during that second imaging process. The preponderance of two-dimensionally periodic samples as subjects of SPM observation makes the application of CIP to SPM images a valuable technique to extract a maximum amount of information from these images. The improved resolution of current SPMs creates images with more higher-order Fourier coefficients than earlier, 2 ̆ 2 softer 2 ̆ 2 images; these higher-order coefficients are especially amenable to CIP, which can then effectively magnify the resolution improvement created by better hardware. The improved resolution combined with the current interest in supramolecular structures (which although 3 D usually start building on a 2 D periodic surface) appears to provide an opportunity for CIP to significantly contribute to SPM image processing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Event {{triggering}} is {{a sampling}} method where sampling occurs only if data ’novelty’ exceeds a threshold. Prior work has demonstrated that event triggered systems have longer average <b>sampling</b> periods than <b>periodic</b> <b>sampled</b> systems with comparable system performance. Based on this fact, it is claimed that event triggered systems make more efficient use of communication resources than <b>periodic</b> <b>sampled</b> systems. If, however, we account {{for the number of}} bits in each sample and the maximum acceptable delay of this sample, {{it is possible that the}} bit-rates generated by event triggered systems are greater than that of <b>periodic</b> <b>sampled</b> systems. Our prior work in Li et al. [2012] has established, in noise-free cases, the condition under which the stabilizing bit-rates for quantized event-triggered systems converge asymptotically to a finite rate as the system approaches its equilibrium point. In some cases, it was shown that this limiting bit rate may actually be zero. This paper extends that earlier work to quantized event-triggered systems with essentially bounded disturbances. Conditions on triggering event, quantization error and maximum delay are established to assure the input-to-state stability (ISS). The stabilizing bit-rate is, then, shown to be always bounded by a continuous, positive definite, increasing function with respect to the norm of the state. Since the system is ISS, the stabilizing bit-rate can be bounded from above by a function of time. This result provides a guide on how to assign communication resource to the control system. If we set external disturbance to be 0, the results in Li et al. [2012] are recovered. 1...|$|R
