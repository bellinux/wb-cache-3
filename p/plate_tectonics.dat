5|$|The early Earth {{during the}} Hadean eon is {{believed}} by most scientists {{to have had}} a Venus-like atmosphere, with roughly 100 bar of CO2 and a surface temperature of 230°C, and possibly even sulfuric acid clouds, until about 4.0billion years ago, by which time <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics</b> were in full force and together with the early water oceans, removed the CO2 and sulfur from the atmosphere. Early Venus would thus most likely have had water oceans like the Earth, but any <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics</b> would have ended when Venus lost its oceans. Its surface is estimated to be about 500million years old, so it would not be expected to show evidence of <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics.</b>|$|E

5|$|There have {{probably}} been many such eruptions during Earth's history beyond those shown in these lists. However erosion and <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics</b> have taken their toll, and many eruptions have not left enough evidence for geologists to establish their size.

5|$|Two 20th century {{developments}} in geology {{had a big}} effect on paleontology. The first was the development of radiometric dating, which allowed absolute dates to be assigned to the geologic timescale. The second was the theory of <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics,</b> which helped {{make sense of the}} geographical distribution of ancient life.|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>plate</b> <b>tectonic</b> theory a {{framework}} has become available in which many observed features {{of the structure of}} the Earth can be understood. The theory can explain the geological processes that have resulted in terranes as diverse as oceans, mid-oceanic ridges, mountain belts, and intracontinental basins. However, despite its explanatory power <b>plate</b> <b>tectonic</b> theory is rarely used for its predictive properties, which should after all be an important aim of any scientific theory. In this research I will address some implications of the <b>plate</b> <b>tectonic</b> concepts, by using <b>plate</b> <b>tectonic</b> theory, to predict thermal and elastic properties of the interior of the Earth which were not used to formulate the theory. This prediction is made by forward numerical modelling of lithosphere scale tectonic processes. The work will focus on the Alpine-Mediterranean region, but the method described is applicable to any part of the Earth where Mesozoic or later plate collision processes can be reconstructed with sufficient detail from geological observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{roles of}} <b>plate</b> <b>tectonic</b> or mantle dynamic forces in rupturing {{continental}} lithosphere remain controversial. Particularly enigmatic is the rifting of microcontinents from mature continental rifted margins, with plume-driven thermal weakening commonly inferred to facilitate calving. However, {{a role for}} <b>plate</b> <b>tectonic</b> reorganisations has also been suggested. Here, we show {{that a combination of}} <b>plate</b> <b>tectonic</b> reorganisation and plume-driven thermal weakening were required to calve the Batavia and Gulden Draak microcontinents in the Cretaceous Indian Ocean. We reconstruct the evolution of these two microcontinents using constraints from new paleontological samples, ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar ages, and geophysical data. Calving from India occurred at 101 – 104 Ma, coinciding with the onset of a dramatic change in Indian plate motion. Critically, Kerguelen plume volcanism {{does not appear to have}} directly triggered calving. Rather, it is likely that plume-related thermal weakening of the Indian passive margin preconditioned it for microcontinent formation but calving was triggered by changes in <b>plate</b> <b>tectonic</b> boundary forces. 10 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being {{found in the}} largely iron-silicon-nickel core. Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per billion of the crust whereas its concentration in the core {{is thought to be}} nearly 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the core may generate a substantial amount of the heat that drives <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics</b> and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Io's {{main source}} of {{internal}} heat comes from the tidal forces generated by Jupiter's gravitational pull. This external heating differs from the internal heat source for volcanism on Earth, which {{is a result of}} radioactive isotope decay and residual heat from accretion. In the Earth, these internal heat sources drive mantle convection, which in turn causes volcanism through <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large {{deposits}} {{of fossil fuels}} are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production.

The application of the new paleogeographic maps increases the information value of biogeographic data.

5|$|Models of the {{evolution}} of the planet's orbit over time suggest that heating resulting from this tidal locking may {{play a major role in}} the planet's geology. Models proposed by scientists predict that tidal heating could yield a surface heat flux about three times greater than the Jupiter's moon Io's, which could result in major geological activity such as volcanoes and <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics.</b>|$|E
5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics),</b> then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics</b> active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E
5|$|While {{predictions}} of the future can never be absolutely certain, present understanding in various fields allows for the prediction of far-future events, if only in the broadest outline.

His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called.

5|$|In 1977, Jack Souther {{produced}} {{a synthesis of}} volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera and delineated several Neogene to Quaternary volcanic belts throughout British Columbia. One of these was the linear Anahim Volcanic Belt, which included the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field at its eastern end. However, its origin {{had not yet been}} understood. In 1979, two volcano tectonic models had been proposed by Jack Souther, Mary Bevier and Richard Armstrong. This included a hotspot and a propagating crack controlled by stress fields related to large-scale <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics</b> of western North America.|$|E
5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the seabed was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge {{areas where the}} ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics,</b> {{which he did not}} anticipate.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics</b> {{demonstrates}} that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E

The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives <b>plate</b> <b>tectonics.</b>|$|E
