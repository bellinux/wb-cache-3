25|$|When {{electricity}} {{was first}} introduced into houses, it was primarily used for lighting. At that time, many electricity companies operated a split-tariff system where the cost of electricity for lighting was lower than that for other purposes.

25|$|These wet cells used liquid electrolytes, {{which were}} prone to leakage and {{spillage}} if not handled correctly. Many used glass jars {{to hold their}} components, which made them fragile and potentially dangerous.

25|$|The 15ampere (A) sockets were {{generally}} given a dedicated 15A circuit. Multiple 5A sockets {{might be on}} a 15A circuit, or each on a dedicated 5A circuit. Lighting circuits fused at 5A {{were generally}} used to feed the 2A sockets. Adaptors were available from 15A down to 5A and from 5A down to 2A so in practice {{it was possible for}} an appliance with the smallest size of flex to be protected only by a 15A fuse. This is a similar level of protection to that seen for <b>portable</b> <b>appliances</b> in other countries, but less than the protection offered by the BS1363 fused plug.|$|E

25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of <b>portable</b> <b>appliances</b> and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E
25|$|Plugs and sockets for <b>portable</b> <b>appliances</b> started {{becoming}} {{available in}} the 1880s, to replace connections to light sockets with easier to use wall-mounted outlets. A proliferation of types developed to address the issues of convenience and protection from electric shock. Today there are approximately 20 types in common use around the world, and many obsolete socket types are still found in older buildings. Co-ordination of technical standards has allowed some types of plugs to be used over wide regions to facilitate trade in electrical appliances, and {{for the convenience of}} travellers and consumers of imported electrical goods. Some multi-standard sockets allow use of several different types of plugs; improvised or unapproved adaptors between incompatible sockets and plugs may not provide the full safety and performance of an approved socket and plug combination.|$|E

50|$|Dual purpose check boxes (which are {{essentially}} known resistances {{either side of}} the test limits)have also been introduced which are capable of validating the accuracy of both electrical installation testers and <b>portable</b> <b>appliance</b> testers in the field, reducing the risk of a tester being used when not operating correctly - this also allows the re-calibration interval to be increased.|$|R

50|$|Some {{examples}} of battery eliminators include the nine volt mains power supply, {{the size and}} shape of a PP9 battery, originally intended to replace the battery in portable radios in the 1960s.

40|$|Abstract:- Power {{consumption}} {{is the most}} critical design issue in a <b>portable</b> <b>appliance.</b> For a batteryoperated mobile device to support high-complexity multimedia functions, low- power and poweraware techniques {{are the key to}} a successful design. This article reviews typical techniques for a lowpower video IC design, and introduces emerging power-aware concepts toward a more power-efficient video codec. obile multimedia devices such as smart phones are energy-constrained, so reducing their power is critical for extending video playback times. The goal of this thesis is to explore different power saving techniques for video decoders and demonstrate them on a hardware application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) architecture.

5000|$|In North American and European practice, small {{portable}} equipment {{connected by a}} cord set is permitted under certain conditions to have merely two conductors in the attachment plug. A polarized plug {{can be used to}} maintain the identity of the neutral conductor into the appliance but neutral is never used as a chassis/case ground. The small cords to lamps, etc., often have one or more molded ridges or embedded strings to identify the neutral conductor, or may be identified by colour. <b>Portable</b> <b>appliances</b> never use the neutral conductor for case grounding, and often feature [...] "double-insulated" [...] construction.|$|E
50|$|Grounding (earthing) of {{distribution}} circuits is a notable difference in practice between wiring {{systems of the}} United States {{and those of other}} regions. Since the early 1960s, wiring in new construction has required a separate grounding conductor used to bond (electrically connect) all normally non-current carrying parts of an electrical installation. <b>Portable</b> <b>appliances</b> with metal cases also have a bonding conductor in the flexible cable and plug connecting them to the distribution system. The circuit return conductor (neutral) is also connected to ground at the service entrance panel only; no other connections from neutral to ground are allowed, unlike regulations {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|E

50|$|The two {{principle}} {{properties of}} the electric power supply, voltage and frequency, differ between regions. A voltage of (nominally) 230 V and a frequency of 50 Hz is used in Europe, most of Africa, most of Asia, much of South America and Australia. In North America, the most common combination is 120 V and a frequency of 60 Hz. Other voltages exist, and some countries may have, for example, 230 V but 60 Hz. This is a concern to travelers, since <b>portable</b> <b>appliances</b> designed for one voltage and frequency combination may not operate with, or may even be destroyed by another. The use of different and incompatible plugs and sockets in different regions and countries provides some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible voltage and frequency requirements.|$|E
