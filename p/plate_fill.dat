50|$|AMIC {{is based}} on microfracturing which relies on the body’s own healing potential. Blood and bone marrow which are {{released}} through tiny holes in the subchondral bone <b>plate,</b> <b>fill</b> the damaged cartilage area with a so-called super-clot. This blood clot contains all the elements (e.g. progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), cytokines and growth factors) necessary to form new cartilage repair tissue as response to the encountered injury. Adding a collagen membrane to the forming super clot secures it and improves overall clot stability. It also enhances the primary defect fill which is an important parameter for good outcome. Furthermore, {{the application of a}} collagen membrane provides an environment where cells can adhere, proliferate and produce repair tissue in a protected setting. The originally proposed collagen membrane for AMIC (Chondro-Gide, Geistlich Pharma AG, Switzerland) consists of two sides, two layers (bi-layer design), one dense, compact side and a loose side.|$|E

50|$|However, if {{one or both}} of the {{capacitor}} plates is a semiconductor, then {{galvani potential}} is not necessarily the only important contribution to capacitance. As the capacitor charge increases, the negative <b>plate</b> <b>fills</b> up with electrons, which occupy higher-energy states in the band structure, while the positive plate loses electrons, leaving behind electrons with lower-energy states in the band structure. Therefore, as the capacitor charges or discharges, the voltage changes at a different rate than the galvani potential difference.|$|R

In this test 2 g dry matter soil for each concentration was mixed with 200 mL of ultra-high-quality water and homogenised for 3 min at 9, 600 rpm with a homogeniser. Buffer solutions of 2 -(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer with a pH of 6.1 and Tris buffer with a pH of 7.8 were prepared freshly before each use. Two substrates per nutrient cycle (C, N, P) with a concentration of 0.1 mmol/L were tested. As standards, 4 -methylumbelliferone (MUF) and aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) were used. Tests were performed in 96 -well microtiter <b>plates</b> <b>filled</b> with 50 μL of soil suspension, 50 μL of buffer and 100 μL of substrate. Fluorescence of the standards was measured in <b>plates</b> <b>filled</b> with 50 μL of soil suspension, 110 μL of buffer and 40 μL of MUF or AMC. After the preparation of the microtiter plates, the fluorescence was measured with a Synergy MX spectrophotometer (BioTek Germany, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm.|$|R
