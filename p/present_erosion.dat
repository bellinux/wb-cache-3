6000|$|This gentleman believes, that {{subsequently}} to the subsidence {{by which}} the atolls in the Low Archipelago were produced, the whole area has been elevated {{to the amount of}} a few feet; this would indeed be a remarkable fact; but as far as I am able to judge, the grounds of his conclusion are not sufficiently strong. He states that he found in almost every atoll which he visited, the shores of the lagoon raised from eighteen to thirty inches above the sea-level, and containing imbedded Tridacnae and corals standing as they grew; some of the corals were dead in their upper parts, but below a certain line they continued to flourish. In the lagoons, also, he frequently met with clusters of Madrepore, with their extremities standing from one inch to a foot above the surface of the water. Now, these appearances are exactly what I should have expected, without any subsequent elevation having taken place; and I think Mr. Couthouy has not borne in mind the indisputable fact, that corals, when constantly bathed by the surf, can exist at a higher level than in quite tranquil water, as in a lagoon. As long, therefore, as the waves continued at low water to break entirely over parts of the annular reef of an atoll, submerged to a small depth, the corals and shells attached on these parts might continue living at a level above the smooth surface of the lagoon, into which the waves rolled; {{but as soon as the}} outer edge of the reef grew up to its utmost possible height, or if the reef were very broad nearly to that height, the force of the breakers would be checked, and the corals and shells on the inner parts near the lagoon would occasionally be left dry, and thus be partially or wholly destroyed. Even in atolls, which have not lately subsided, if the outer margin of the reef continued to increase in breadth seaward (each fresh zone of corals rising to the same vertical height as at Keeling atoll), the line where the waves broke most heavily would advance outwards, and therefore the corals, which when living near the margin, were washed by the breaking waves during the whole of each tide, would cease being so, and would therefore be left on the backward part of the reef standing exposed and dead. The case of the madrepores in the lagoons with the tops of their branches exposed, seems to be an analogous fact, to the great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon of Keeling atoll; a condition of things which I have endeavoured to show, has resulted from the lagoon having become more and more enclosed and choked up with reefs, so that during high winds, the rising of the tide (as observed by the inhabitants) is checked, and the corals, which had formerly grown to the greatest possible height, are occasionally exposed, and thus are killed: and this is a condition of things, towards which almost every atoll in the intervals of its subsidence must be tending. Or if we look to the state of an atoll directly after a subsidence of some fathoms, the waves would roll heavily over the entire circumference of the reef, and the surface of the lagoon would, like the ocean, never be quite at rest, and therefore the corals in the lagoon, from being constantly laved by the rippling water, might extend their branches to a little greater height than they could, when the lagoon became enclosed and protected. Christmas atoll (2 deg N. latitude) which has a very shallow lagoon, and differs in several respects from most atolls, possibly may have been elevated recently; but its highest part appears (Couthouy, page 46) to be only ten feet above the sea-level. The facts of a second class, adduced by Mr. Couthouy, in support of the alleged recent elevation of the Low Archipelago, are not all (especially those referring to a shelf of rock) quite intelligible to me; he believes that certain enormous fragments of rock on the reef, must have been moved into their present position, when the reef was at a lower level; but here again the force of the breakers on any inner point of the reef being diminished by its outward growth without any change in its level, has not, I think, been borne in mind. We should, also, not overlook the occasional agency of waves caused by earthquakes and hurricanes. Mr. Couthouy further argues, that since these great fragments were deposited and fixed on the reef, they have been elevated; he infers this from the greatest amount of erosion not being near their bases, where they are unceasingly washed by the reflux of the tides, but at some height on their sides, near the line of high-water mark, as shown in an accompanying diagram. My former remark again applies here, with this further observation, that as the waves have to roll over a wide space of reef before they reach the fragments, their force must be greatly increased with the increasing depth of water as the tide rises, and therefore I should have expected that the chief line of <b>present</b> <b>erosion</b> would have coincided with the line of high-water mark; and if the reef had grown outwards, that there would have been lines of erosion at greater heights. The conclusion, to which I am finally led by the interesting observations of Mr. Couthouy is, that the atolls in the Low Archipelago have, like the Society Islands, remained at a stationary level for a long period: and this probably is the ordinary course of events, subsidence supervening after long intervals of rest.) ...|$|E

50|$|Relatively {{thin and}} complicated, the Pieniny Klippen Belt creates a boundary, a tectonic suture, between the Outer and Central Western Carpathians. Only rock {{younger than the}} Triassic is known in this zone. Exclusively nonmetamorphic {{sedimentary}} successions are composed especially of limestones and marls. In the Jurassic period, the ocean that opened {{in the area of}} the Pieniny Klippen Belt is called the Vahic Ocean (or the South Penninic). Its preserved sedimentary successions are in the <b>present</b> <b>erosion</b> cut known only from the Vahic unit. The Vahic domain was bounded from the North by the slopes of the Oravic, and from the South by the Tatric unit. The subsiding part of the Oravic unit formed the Kysuca Basin. The most shallow part of the Oravic unit was characterized by deposition of shallow water limestones of Czorsztyn unit. To the South, closer to the deep water Kysuca Basin, other transitional units were deposited. In the deepest part of the Kysuca Basin, sediments of Kysuca-Pieniny unit were deposited. The Vahic domain had extended and deepened during its history. In the Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene, the thrusting of the southern units of Tatric caused inversion or subduction of the Vahic Ocean that was followed by collision of the Oravic and Tatric units. As a result of these processes, deformation and North vergent thrusting of the Oravic units in the form of nappes occurred. After the end of compression, marly and flysch-like sedimentation (so-called klippe envelope sediments) continued on the top of the nappe stack. Later in the Paleogene, another phase of orogeny affected the Pieniny Klippen Belt. It squeezed the former nappe stack and the rocks of different rheology (competent limestones, soft flysch, and marls) were deformed in different ways, which caused the rupture of more dense rock and ductile deformation of the less dense rock. Complicated arrangement of particular tectonic units was later affected by strike-slip motion {{in the area of the}} Peri-Pieniny Lineament in the Miocene. Consequent erosion dissected the rigid limestone tectonic lenses to the shape of protruding klippes (e.g. Vršatské bradlá in Western Slovakia). The zone of klippes stretches almost uninterrupted from the Podbranč in Western Slovakia to the Poiana Botizei in Northeastern Romanian.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Present</b> <b>erosion</b> and {{sediment}} flux in the semiarid intramontane Santa Maria Basin, NW Argentina, are compared with conditions {{during a period}} of wetter and more variable climate at about 30, 000 14 C yr ago. The results suggest that the influence of climate change on the overall erosional sediment budget is significant, mainly because of a change in the erosion regime coupled with an increase in mass movements. The most effective mechanism to increase landslide activity in this environment is a highly variable climate on interannual timescales. In contrast, Quaternary changes in erosional budgets due to variations in moisture regimes is small in the Santa Maria Basin. Because the magnitude of a potential increase in background erosion as well as enhanced landsliding is smaller than typical levels of uncertainty of erosional budgets for such large basins, it is not likely that climate-driven erosional unloading can influence tectonic style and rates in this semiarid environment on time scales of several thousands to a few tens of thousands of years...|$|E

40|$|A {{review is}} given of {{recently}} published and new data on Avalonia {{east of the}} Midlands Microcraton. The three megasequences from Cambrian to mid Devonian described in Wales and Welsh Borderland are also present east of the Midlands Microcraton (Brabant Massif, Condroz, Ardennes, Remscheid and Ebbe inliers, Krefeld high). The three mega-sequences are caused by a tectonic driving mechanism and are explained by three different geodynamic contexts: an earlier phase with extensional basins or rifting and rather thick sequences, when Avalonia was still attached to Gondwana; a second phase with a shelf basin with moderately thin sequences when Avalonia was a separate continent and a later phase with a shelf or foreland basin development and thick sequences. Deformation of the megasequences 1 and 2 or 1 to 3 varies between areas. In Wales and the Lake District the Acadian phase is long-lived and active from early to mid Devonian. In the Ardennes inliers a deformation is active between the late Ordovician and the Silurian (Ardennian Phase), with a similar intensity as {{the core of the}} Brabant Massif, when <b>present</b> <b>erosion</b> levels are compared. The Brabant Massif is partly deformed by the long-lived Brabantian Phase from late Silurian till early mid Devonian. Both the Ardennes inliers and the Brabant Massif are not classic orogenic belts, only slate belts where no more than the epizone is reached at <b>present</b> <b>erosion</b> levels. Areas supposedly close to the microcraton or basement are nearly undeformed (SW Brabant Massif and central Condroz). A model of anticlockwise rotation of Avalonia of about 55 ° from Caradoc to Emsian is proposed to explain the deposition setting of megasequence 3 and the subsequent Acadian and Brabantian deformation. Immediately after the Avalonian microcontinent touched Baltica in Caradoc times it created a short-lived subduction magmatic event from The Wash to the Brabant Massif and soon after the magmatism ended a foreland basin developed. Possibly during and after that development a long-lived and slow compressional event occurred, leading to the deformation of the Anglo-Brabant Deformation Belt. In the early Devonian, contemporaneous with the shortening of the Anglo-Brabant Deformation Belt, extension occurred in the Rheno-Hercynian Zone, possibly caused by the same slow rotation of Avalonia. More evidence emerges that Avalonia cast of the Midlands Microcraton comprises not one but probably two terranes: the remnant of the palaeocontinent Avalonia, and what is called the palaeocontinent Far Eastern Avalonia; the latter is only occasionally observed in the few deep boreholes into the Heligoland-Pomerania Deformation Belt, in southern Denmark, NE Germany and NW Poland, with scant available indirect data in between indicating only Proterozoic basement and no Caledonian deformation. For Far Eastern Avalonia a similar palaeogeographical history is postulated as Avalonia, with rifting from Gondwana in Arenig or earlier times, collision with Baltica before the mid-Ashgill and deformation between the late Ordovician and latest Silurian. The Avalonia concept might need to be expanded to an 'Avalonian Terrane Assemblage' with cratonic cores and small short-lived oceans as in the Armorican Terrane Assemblage.

Analytical {{results show that the}} cosmogenic nuclide concentration of a surface experiencing regular detachment of a grain or block may be considered to be in steady state, and in-situ erosion rates estimated, when an appropriate number of spatially independent samples are amalgamated.

The effect of different heat transfer models and forces (e. g. drags, thermophoretic, Brownian, Saffman’s lift force etc.) are investigated. Models to simulate droplet breakup and coalescence are incorporated {{to take into consideration}} the effect of local acceleration and deceleration on water droplet dynamics. Analysis on droplet history (trajectory and size) with stochastic tracking is employed to interpret the mechanism of droplet dynamics under influence of local turbulence, acceleration, diffusion, and body forces. An erosion model is also included. The results show that droplet local slip velocity is noticeably affected by local acceleration and deceleration of the compressor blade, and in turn, the heat transfer and water evaporation rate are affected. Due to the short droplet residence time in the compressor stage, local thermal equilibrium is not always achieved, and the air may not always reach saturation even sufficient amount of liquid mass is in the air. The results also show erosion occurs near the rotor fore-body on the suction side with the <b>present</b> <b>erosion</b> model, which is subject to continuous improvement and further verification. The transient results of different rotor/stator relative positions show low air-flow blockage produces more effective compression and higher temperature rise. Different types of droplet boundary conditions show the effect is negligible...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} {{affected by}} dental erosion due to bulimia is generally very young. This population group {{has a high}} aesthetic requirement; the dentition in these patients is severely damaged, especially in the anterior maxillary quadrant. In terms of treatment, it is still controversial whether an adhesive rehabilitation is preferable to a longer-lasting but more aggressive conventional treatment, such as full-crown coverage {{of the majority of}} teeth. This case report describes the prosthetic rehabilitation of a young female patient previously affected by bulimia nervosa and <b>presenting</b> <b>erosion</b> of the maxillary teeth. The prosthetic rehabilitation was performed through indirect adhesive restorations of the anterior teeth and direct restorations of the posterior teeth. A clinical follow-up after 4 years showed that the occlusion remained satisfactorily restored. Posterior direct composite resin restorations and anterior indirect adhesive composite restorations proved to be an effective time and money-saving procedure to rehabilitate patients affected by dental erosion. Adhesive rehabilitation provides a functional and good aesthetic result while preserving tooth structure...|$|R
40|$|A 41 -year old {{unmarried}} man <b>presented</b> with <b>erosions,</b> ulcers and keratosis of tendoachilles. He {{was short}} statured and had features of premature aging, sclerosis {{of the skin}} of the limbs and hypogonadism. The head was small with a beak-like nose. Investigations revealed diabetes mellitus, generalised osteoporosis, calcification of blood vessel walls and microsplanchia of kidneys. All the features suggested a diagnosis of Werners&#x 2032;s syndrome...|$|R
50|$|While {{the island}} has {{continually}} faced shifting coastlines due to ocean currents, storm surges, and astronomical tides, the 21st century has <b>presented</b> new <b>erosion</b> challenges, particularly to Wasque Point which, during the Patriots' Day Storm of 2007, was battered severely. Between 2007 and 2013, approximately 40 {{acres of land}} were lost at Wasque, where currents eroded bluffs, swallowed Swan Pond, damaged shoreline trails, and threatened a residence.|$|R
