5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of <b>physical</b> <b>injury</b> or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to <b>physical</b> <b>injury</b> as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} adolescents, {{hypothesized}} causes generally fall {{into one of}} either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or <b>physical</b> <b>injury</b> (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.|$|E

5|$|During June, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Miller's squadron would be deployed to Burma {{to fight against}} Japan. In the meantime, the airmen continued to practice their flying, Miller earning Reeves' ire by making unauthorised leisure flights. Later, {{he was ordered to}} fly tour flights over Germany. Not wanting to do so, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, Reeves ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire in mid-flight. With one functional engine and no navigator to assist him, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded. The fuselage and one of the wings was broken off and the plane became engulfed in flames. Miller escaped <b>physical</b> <b>injury,</b> but was shaken by the accident. Again Miller escaped disciplinary action, and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E

5|$|Following the reconciliation, a USA Today story {{detailed}} White's situation. Although White endured 20 flights {{for travel}} during his season at Iowa State, the Rockets' NBA schedule called for 98 flights. White {{had attempted to}} cope with travel in college through use of Benadryl and Xanax, but found both reduced his energy level, although it never showed in his statistical output. White cited that his concern for the increased number of flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence and addiction (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines in the medical community. White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day <b>physical</b> <b>injury</b> in which symptoms can be dynamic and unclear, but support and policy should be adequately proactive).|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} HD. Full-time care is {{required}} in the later stages of the disease. Treatments can relieve some symptoms and in some improve quality of life. The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with tetrabenazine. HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent. It is rare among Japanese, while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown. The disease affects men and women equally. Complications such as pneumonia, heart disease, and <b>physical</b> <b>injury</b> from falls reduce life expectancy. Suicide {{is the cause of}} death in about 9% of cases. Death typically occurs fifteen to twenty years from when the disease was first detected.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to <b>physical</b> <b>injury,</b> act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, <b>physical</b> <b>injury</b> from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E

40|$|Prison Officers (POs) {{involved}} in high need offender management frequently face risks {{that could affect}} their health, safety and wellbeing. Several {{studies have shown that}} direct client centred violence, inadequate management systems and the general nature of prison environments are major factors impacting on the well being of POs (Fisher 2 ̆ 6 Gunnison, 2001; Kiekbusch, Price, 2 ̆ 6 Theis, 2003; Mitchell, Mackenzie, Styve, 2 ̆ 6 Gover, 2000). There is limited literature on causes and effects of <b>physical</b> <b>injuries</b> on this group of law enforcements officers. This is the first study conducted in Western Australia (WA) that investigated the causes and effects of <b>physical</b> <b>injuries</b> to POs and the impacts thereof on these individuals and the Department of Corrective Services (DCS) as an organisation. The study aimed to provide a recent credible data source which may influence policy decisions and procedures in WA corrective institutions. The study cohort of 146 POs completed a questionnaire that included variables, such as health and fitness, job demands, support and constraints to ascertain the causes and effects of <b>physical</b> <b>injuries</b> among this high risk cohort of workers. The age range of POs included in the study cohort (N = 146) was 21 - 71 years. In addition, all Department of Correctional Services (DCS) <b>physical</b> <b>injuries</b> databases from 2008 to 2010 were analysed and managers and employee welfare services staff completed a questionnaire. The results indicated that there is a positive relationship between current employment status and work related <b>physical</b> <b>injuries</b> as measured over the last two years. The major causes of <b>physical</b> <b>injuries</b> were from slips trips and falls and hitting objects with part of the body or against objects during the process of managing non compliant prisoners. Variables such as physical fitness, job demands, lack of recognition by society, and fear of blood borne infections were significant predictors of <b>physical</b> <b>injuries</b> amongst POs. However, a number of other risk factors, including age and body mass index (BMI), were not related to the prevalence of <b>physical</b> <b>injuries.</b> There are a number of recommendations from the study that can be implemented. These include formation of accident/incident investigation work groups to conduct and analyse incidents and propose long term preventive and corrective measures. In order to improve ways of dealing with mentally ill prisoners and the training curriculum of POs should include management of mentally ill prisoners in a prison setting. In dealing with the aging population affecting the Australian workforce, DCS should develop plans to attract young POs for succession planning. Comprehensive safe physical training and maintenance programs in prisons may benefit the POs in dealing with prisoners. Areas for future research may include; the role of mental health services in reducing physical harm in prisons and minimising the causes and effects of <b>physical</b> <b>injuries</b> to the prison frontline workforce...|$|R
