40|$|Irradiation of {{packaging}} materials-in most cases, plastic-generally {{leads to}} the formation of free radicals and ions, which eventually result either in cross-linking or in chain scission. The latter {{leads to the}} release of volatile radiolysis products that may induce off-odors in the polymers, thereby altering the migration characteristics of packaging materials. Irradiation also affects polymer additives, which change the specific migration behavior of polymer additives and additive-related decomposition products. Both migration and sensory changes of presterilized packaging materials strongly affect the quality of packaged goods and consumer safety. Radiation processing is widely used for medical product sterilization and food irradiation. Moreover, the use of irradiation has become a standard treatment to sterilize packages in aseptic processing of foods and pharmaceuticals. Nowadays, packaging consists of natural or synthetic plastics; therefore, the effect of irradiation on these materials is crucial for packaging engineering. The effect of ionizing radiation on polymeric materials has been found to manifest itself in two ways: (i) as a molecular weight increase (cross-linking); and (ii) as a molecular weight decrease (chain scission degradation). The ability of radiation to process the <b>packaged</b> <b>material,</b> compared to the ineffectiveness of chemical treatments, is a critical advantage over the others. The most important applications of polymer irradiation are: (i) sterilization of medical disposables, syringes, and tubing; and (ii) food and food packaging irradiation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Fluor {{engineers}} {{developed a}} Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) technique and parameters, demonstrated requisite weld quality and successfully closure-welded packaged {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) overpacks at the Hanford Site. This paper reviews weld development and qualification activities associated with the overpack closure-welding and provides {{a summary of the}} production campaign. The primary requirement of the closure weld is to provide leaktight confinement of the <b>packaged</b> <b>material</b> against release to the environment during interim storage (40 -year design term). Required weld quality, in this case, was established through up-front development and qualification, and then verification of parameter compliance during production welding. This approach was implemented to allow for a simpler overpack design and more efficient production operations than possible with approaches using routine post-weld testing and nondestructive examination (NDE).. A series of welding trials were conducted to establish the desired welding technique and parameters. Qualification of the process included statistical evaluation and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section IX testing. In addition, pull testing with a weighted mockup, and thermal calculation/physical testing to identify the maximum temperature the packaged contents would be subject to during welding, was performed. Thirteen overpacks were successfully packaged and placed into interim storage. The closure-welding development activities (including pull testing and thermal analysis) provided the needed confidence that the packaged SNF overpacks could be safely handled and placed into interim storage, and remain leaktight {{for the duration of the}} storage term...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a bacteriocin-activated polythene film on resting and growing populations of Listeria monocytogenes. Methods and Results: The active polythene films were industrially obtained by coating a solution of bacteriocin 32 Y from Lactobacillus curvatus upon the surface of the film to be in contact with the <b>packaged</b> <b>material.</b> The behaviour of live Listeria populations was examined in liquid suspensions directly in contact with the bacteriocin-activated film, packed in antimicrobial film, and in a challenge test of storage of frankfurters superficially contaminated by L. monocytogenes and packed in antimicrobial film. In all the experiments, live and dead cells of L. monocytogenes were counted in epifluorescence microscopy after viable staining, which proved to be a suitable method to {{evaluate the}} action of bacteriocins on populations of L. monocytogenes. The results showed that the direct contact between active film surface and L. monocytogenes cells is effective for a fast and irreversible inactivation of the population by determining a direct cell disruption. This was confirmed by the results of the challenge test indicating that the antimicrobial package was effective in inhibiting the growth and survival of the pathogen on the surface of frankfurters during storage. Conclusions: The use of the antimicrobial film is encouraged especially for solid food products where the superficial contaminants come immediately in contact with the antimicrobial film. Significance and Impact of the Study: A fast inactivation of the bacterial population, coupled with appropriate conditions of storage, can improve the quality and safety and prolong the shelf-life of the food products packed in antimicrobial films...|$|E

40|$|Packaging waste forms a {{significant}} part of municipal solid waste and as such has caused increasing environmental concerns, resulting in strengthening of EU Regulations in order to reduce amounts of packaging waste. Among other materials, a huge range of oil-based polymers is currently used in packaging applications. They are largely non-biodegradable and particularly difficult to recycle or reuse due to mixed levels of contamination and complex composites. In recent years, the development of biodegradable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> from renewable natural resources (e. g. crops) has received increasing attention, particularly in EU countries. Significant progress has been made to produce biodegradable materials with similar functionality to that of the oil-based synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that, as the materials are from renewable resources and biodegradable, they would contribute to sustainable development and if properly managed would reduce their environmental impact upon disposal. This paper discusses the potential impact of biodegradable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> on waste management in terms of landfill, incineration, recycle/reuse and composting. A comparison is also drawn to the oil-based polymer <b>packaging</b> <b>materials.</b> It is the view of the authors that biodegradable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> are most suitable for single use disposable packaging applications where the post-consumer use packaging can be locally composted as a means of recycling the materials.
