40|$|Networked {{embedded}} systems typically leverage {{a collection of}} low-power {{embedded systems}} (nodes) to collaboratively execute applications spanning diverse application domains (e. g., video, image processing, communication, etc.) with diverse application requirements. The individual networked nodes must operate under stringent constraints (e. g., energy, memory, etc.) and should be specialized to meet varying application requirements in order to adhere to these constraints. Phase-based tuning specializes system tunable parameters to the varying runtime requirements of different execution phases to meet optimization goals. Since the design space for tunable systems can be very large, {{one of the major}} challenges in phase-based tuning is determining the best configuration for each phase without incurring significant tuning overhead (e. g., energy and/or performance) during design space exploration. In this paper, we propose <b>phase</b> <b>distance</b> mapping, which directly determines the best configuration for a phase, thereby eliminating design space exploration. <b>Phase</b> <b>distance</b> mapping applies the correlation between the characteristics and best configuration of a known phase to determine the best configuration of a new phase. Experimental results verify that our <b>phase</b> <b>distance</b> mapping approach, when applied to cache tuning, determines cache configurations within 1 % of the optimal configurations on average and yields an energy delay product savings of 27 % on average.

40|$|I {{present the}} <b>Phase</b> <b>Distance</b> Correlation (PDC) {{periodogram}} [...] a new periodicity metric, {{based on the}} Distance Correlation concept of Gábor Székely. For each trial period PDC calculates the distance correlation between the data samples and their phases. PDC requires adaptation of the Székely's distance correlation to circular variables (phases). The resulting periodicity metric is best suited to sparse datasets, and it performs better than other methods for sawtooth-like periodicities. These include Cepheid and RR-Lyrae light curves, as well as radial velocity curves of eccentric spectroscopic binaries. The performance of the PDC periodogram in other contexts is {{almost as good as}} that of the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram.

40|$|A simple {{mathematical}} model was presented to simulate {{the motion of the}} center of gravity of a human body throughout the three flight phases of the triple jump. Equations of the three phases were used in one chain equation in which the independent input variable was the initial touchdown velocity to the hop phase. The final equation of motion was manipulated {{as a function of the}} three support times. The path of the center of gravity during the support and flight of an elite triple jumper was superimposed against the path generated from the model. Finally, the optimization routine was formulated. The results of the optimization of a particular subject indicated that increasing the hop <b>phase</b> <b>distance</b> ratio by 1. 8 % and decreasing the step <b>phase</b> <b>distance</b> ratio by 4. 4 % would allow the jumper to increase the jump <b>phase</b> <b>distance</b> ratio by 2. 6 %. This could be done by using the same amount of energy as in the original jump. By using this distribution of the three phases, the subject would gain about 0. 56 m compared to the original total distance. The results of optimization were found to be similar to actual changes made by athletes in performing over time in different competitions. Estimates of possible error indicate a high sensitivity to the force generated by the subject at takeoff from each phase and the vertical position of the center of gravity at takeoff of each phase. Further study and validation of the results are recommended. ...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{reports the}} results of {{comprehensive}} studies carried out to explore the impact of midpoint FACTS Controllers (STATCOM and SVC) on the generator <b>distance</b> <b>phase</b> backup protection {{in order to identify}} important issues that protection engineers need to consider when designing and setting a generator protection system. In addition, practical, feasible and simple solutions to mitigate the adverse impact of midpoint FACTS Controllers on the generator <b>distance</b> <b>phase</b> backup protection are explored. 	The results of these studies show that midpoint FACTS Controllers have an adverse effect on the generator <b>distance</b> <b>phase</b> backup protection. This adverse effect, which can be in the form of underreach, overreach or a time delay, varies according to the fault type, fault location and generator loading. Moreover, it has been found that the adverse effect of the midpoint FACTS Controllers extends to affect the coordination between the generator <b>distance</b> <b>phase</b> backup protection and the generator steady-state overexcited capability limit. 	The Support Vector Machines classification technique is proposed as a replacement for the existing generator <b>distance</b> <b>phase</b> backup protection relay in order to alleviate potential problems. It has been demonstrated that this technique is a very promising solution, as it is fast, reliable and has a high performance efficiency. This will result in enhancing the coordination between the generator phase backup protection and the generator steady-state overexcited capability limit in the presence of midpoint FACTS Controllers. 	The thesis also presents {{the results of}} investigations carried out to explore the impact of the generator <b>distance</b> <b>phase</b> backup protection relay on the generator overexcitation thermal capability. The results of these investigations reveal that with the relay settings according to the current standards, the generator is over-protected and the generator <b>distance</b> <b>phase</b> backup protection relay restricts the generator overexcitation thermal capability during system disturbances. This restriction does not allow the supply of the maximum reactive power of the generating unit during such events. The restriction on the generator overexcitation thermal capability caused by the generator <b>distance</b> <b>phase</b> backup protection relay highlights the necessity to revise the relay settings. The proposed solution in this thesis is to reduce the generator <b>distance</b> <b>phase</b> backup protection relay reach in order to provide secure performance during system disturbances...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{directional}} analysis tool for On-line signatures that decomposes the given input signature into directional bands {{on the basis}} of relative angles.

We have used both user-dependent and user-independent thresholds for selecting an optimal number of partitions for each signer. By decomposing signature trajectories based upon relative angles of an individual’s signature, the resulting process {{can be thought of as}} one that exploits inter-feature dependencies.

30|$|While CEP {{provides}} several {{benefits for}} data stream processing, such as continuous query, pattern detection, and temporal windows, {{it is difficult}} to express iterative controls, e.g., while and for repetition structures, using its primitives. Typically, CEP-based applications follow a pipeline stage topology, with data flow in a given direction from one stage to one or more stages, but without returning to previous stages. This can be troublesome when describing iterative algorithms, such as K-means, which require iterations to converge. To overcome this problem, we simulated the loop check by using two EPL rules. If the loop check is false, i.e., if evidence has not change its centroid, we push the event to the next processing stages. However, if the loop check is true, i.e., evidence has changed its centroid, we reinsert these events into the initial loop stage, which recomputes the centroid distance.

Interesting connection are highlighted with contractions and fractals. Then, we develop a bang-bang controller to achieve a balanced circular formation.

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} composite {{nature of}} human teeth guarantees their function for decades under high mechanical loads and adverse chemical conditions. Even more so since only marginal remodelling and repair mechanisms take place in adult teeth. While the macroscopical anatomy of the tooth has been well understood, long range ordering of the tooth’s micro and nano components is still matter of research. Tooth micro- and nanostructure has been extensively studied, mainly with two-dimensional approaches as, for example, electron microscopy. The ultrastructural organization over a whole tooth is, however, not readily accessible with these approaches, because they only permit a very localized observation and often even remove the investigated structures from their natural three-dimensional organization. The high degree of anisotropy in both dentin and enamel on the micro- and nanometer scale has a strong impact on the tooth’s mechanical properties. For example, the Young’s modulus and crack resistance of dentin are different parallel and perpendicular to the dentin tubules. Synchrotron radiation-based micro computed tomography with pixel sizes in the sub-micrometer range allows to three-dimensionally image dentin tubules, however only over restricted specimen sizes below one millimetre in diameter. To map the tubular network over an entire tooth, multiple scans are necessary. Given the generally limited beamtime available at synchrotron sources, a method has to be identified that allows for the visualization of dentin tubules with high accuracy and within reasonable time.
