This problem, which has been well studied in nuclear magnetic resonance, can be addressed by replacing single operations with composite sequences of <b>pulsed</b> <b>operations,</b> which cause errors to cancel by symmetry.

40|$|We report our {{development}} of terahertz (THz) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), {{in which the}} depopulation of the lower radiative level is achieved through resonant longitudinal optical (LO) phonon scattering. This depopulation mechanism, sim-ilar to that implemented in all the QCLs operating at mid-infrared frequencies, is robust at high temperatures and high injection levels. The unique feature of resonant LO-phonon scattering in our THz QCL structures allows a highly selective depopu-lation of the lower radiative level with a sub-picosecond lifetime, while maintaining a relatively long upper level lifetime (more than 5 ps) that is due to upper-to-ground-state scattering. The first QCL based on this mechanism achieved lasing at 3. 4 THz (λ ≈ 87 µm) up to 87 K for <b>pulsed</b> <b>operations,</b> with peak power levels exceeding 10 mW at ca. 40 K.

50|$|Drivers {{for this}} type of {{electric}} load are power HF-generators that in many cases contain a transformer for high voltage generation. They resemble the control gear used to operate compact fluorescent lamps or cold cathode fluorescent lamps. The operation mode and the topologies of circuits to operate DBD lamps with continuous sine or square waves are similar to those standard drivers. In these cases, the energy that is stored in the DBD's capacitance {{does not have to be}} recovered to the intermediate supply after each ignition. Instead, it stays within the circuit (oscillates between the DBD's capacitance and at least one inductive component of the circuit) and only the real power, that is consumed by the lamp, has to be provided by the power supply. Differently, drivers for <b>pulsed</b> <b>operation</b> suffer from rather low power factor and in many cases must fully recover the DBD's energy. Since <b>pulsed</b> <b>operation</b> of DBD lamps can lead to increased lamp efficiency, international research led to suiting circuit concepts.

A flexible circuit, that combines the two topologies is given in and and may be used to adaptively drive DBDs with varying capacitance.|$|E

B-64 included straight sections in the curved ends which gave it a squared-off appearance. This led to experiments in 1956 where the machine was re-assembled without the twist in the tubes, allowing the particles to travel without rotation.|$|E
