5|$|The astrological symbol <b>Pisces</b> {{is based}} on a {{constellation}} of the same name, {{but there is also a}} second fish constellation in the night sky, Piscis Austrinus.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{features}} an enthroned sun, with the Zodiac signs dancing around it. The signs of Leo, Virgo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus and Aries {{dance on the}} right, and Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and <b>Pisces</b> are dancing on the left.|$|E
5|$|These signs {{give us some}} of the {{terminology}} used today. The first point of Aries was named when the vernal equinox was actually in the constellation Aries; it has since moved into <b>Pisces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Manga artist Natsumi Ando enjoyed astrology in her {{childhood}} {{and had a}} fondness for stars and Greek mythology. For File 2, which deals with a mystery in a piano school, Ando researched a local music school. The design for the Libra astral spirit originated from {{the winner of the}} Astral Spirit Design Contest; many of the design submissions were for the Libra, <b>Pisces,</b> and Cancer spirits.|$|E
5|$|The uranography of Andromeda has {{its roots}} most firmly in the Greek tradition, though a female figure in Andromeda's {{location}} had appeared earlier in Babylonian astronomy. The stars that make up <b>Pisces</b> and the middle portion of modern Andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess, sometimes named as Anunitum or the Lady of the Heavens.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{inclination}} of its orbit, Eris only passes through a few constellations of the traditional Zodiac; it {{is now in the}} constellation Cetus. It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 it will enter <b>Pisces</b> and stay there until 2065, when it will enter Aries. It will then move into the northern sky, entering Perseus in 2128 and Camelopardalis (where it will reach its northernmost declination) in 2173.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Virgin {{released}} the B-sides/rarities compilation <b>Pisces</b> Iscariot which charted higher than Siamese Dream by reaching number four on the Billboard 200. Also released was a VHS cassette titled Vieuphoria featuring {{a mix of}} live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. Following relentless touring to support the recordings, including headline slots on the 1994 Lollapalooza tour and at Reading Festival in 1995, the band took time off to write the follow-up album.|$|E
5|$|However, Sitchin, {{who died}} in 2010, denied any {{connection}} between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set {{the time for the}} last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of <b>Pisces</b> to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E
5|$|The First Point of Aries, the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the First Point of Aries has since moved into <b>Pisces</b> and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E
5|$|In 1614, German {{astronomer}} Johannes Kepler {{determined that}} {{a series of three}} conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn occurred in the year 7 BC. He argued (incorrectly) that a planetary conjunction could create a nova, which he linked to the Star of Bethlehem. Modern calculations show that there was a gap of nearly a degree (approximately twice a diameter of the moon) between the planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient almanac has been found in Babylon which covers the events of this period, but does not indicate that the conjunctions were of any special interest. In the 20th century, Prof. Karlis Kaufmanis, an astronomer, argued that this was an astronomical event where Jupiter and Saturn were in a triple conjunction in the constellation <b>Pisces.</b> Archaeologist and Assyriologist Simo Parpola has also suggested this explanation.|$|E
5|$|The Triangulum Galaxy, {{also known}} as Messier 33, was {{discovered}} by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in the 17th century. A distant member of the Local Group, it is about 2.3 million light-years away, and at magnitude 5.8 it is bright enough {{to be seen by}} the naked eye under the darkest skies. Under light-polluted skies, it is challenging or invisible even in a small telescope or binoculars. Because of its low surface brightness, low power is required. It is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 46,000 light-years and is thus smaller than both the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way. A distance of less than 300 kiloparsecs between it and Andromeda supports the hypothesis that it is a satellite of the larger galaxy. Within the constellation, it lies near the border of <b>Pisces,</b> 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees southwest of Beta Andromedae. Within the galaxy, NGC 604 is an H II region where star formation takes place.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{may affect}} {{specific}} sounds or the entire phonological system. Sound change can consist of {{the replacement of}} one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, {{the complete loss of}} the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant * became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous * in turn became /p/, and the previous * became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and <b>pisces,</b> whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.|$|E

Her works {{can be found}} around the world: Childhood Dream (1992) at the Uchinomi-cho Town Hall Garden {{on the island of}} Shōdoshima in Kagawa Prefecture, Japan; <b>Pisces</b> (1993) at the Yashiro Hoshi-no Choukoku Centre Park in Osaka, Japan; Spirit of Nature III (1990) at the Kuching Waterfront Development in Sarawak, Malaysia; Towards Peace (1987) in the Kuala Lumpur Lake Gardens, Malaysia; and Cactus, Tropical Leaves (both 1994) and The Wave of Life at the Embassy of Singapore in Washington, D.C. In Singapore, sculptures commissioned from her can be seen at Capital Tower (Shimmering Pearls I, 1999), the Defence Science Organisation National Laboratories (Tropical Brain Forest, 2003), the Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay (Seed Series, 1998), the National Museum of Singapore (20 Tonnes, 2002; and Seeds, 2006), One Marina Boulevard (Progressive Flows, 2004), Orchard MRT Station (Goddess of Happiness, 1985), Revenue House (Spring, 1996), Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 3 (Flora Inspiration, 2007), Singapore Changi Airport VIP Complex (Singapore – A Garden City, 2004), Suntec City Mall (Chinese Zodiac Medallions, 1995), UOB Plaza (Two Figures, 1993), and Woodlands Regional Library (Rain Forest).|$|E
25|$|At 2 A.M. on Friday 31 August the Vickers Voyager {{had reached}} the scene and {{launched}} <b>Pisces</b> II with a polypropylene rope attached. However, the lifting rope broke free of the manipulator arm and the submersible {{had to return to}} the surface for repairs. An attempt made by <b>Pisces</b> V failed to find the crashed <b>Pisces</b> III and returned to the surface after it ran out of power. Relaunching <b>Pisces</b> V had more success and found the crew at 12:44 P.M. However, an attempt to attach a rope failed. <b>Pisces</b> V now remained with the stricken <b>Pisces</b> III. An attempt to send <b>Pisces</b> II down again had to be called off when it suffered a leak.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pisces</b> V is a deep-submergence vehicle (DSV) of the <b>Pisces</b> class {{built in}} 1973.|$|E
25|$|On Thursday 30 August the Vickers Voyager {{arrived in}} Cork at 8:15 and loaded the submersibles <b>Pisces</b> II and <b>Pisces</b> V, {{which had been}} flown in overnight. The ship left Cork at 10:30.|$|E
25|$|Divine {{associations}} with <b>Pisces</b> include Poseidon/Neptune, Christ, Aphrodite, Eros, Typhon and Vishnu.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday 1 September, at 4:02 A.M., <b>Pisces</b> II was {{launched}} once more. At 5:05 A.M. it managed {{to attach a}} specially designed toggle and polypropylene tow rope to the rear sphere of <b>Pisces</b> III. At 10:35 A.M. the CURV-III managed to fix another rope to the submersible. It {{was at this point}} that the crew ate and drank the only sustenance aboard.|$|E
25|$|The {{stars of}} <b>Pisces</b> were {{incorporated}} into several constellations in Chinese astronomy. Wai-ping ("Outer Enclosure") was a fence that kept a pig farmer from falling into the marshes and kept the pigs where they belonged. It was represented by Alpha, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Mu, Nu, and Xi Piscium. The marshes were represented by the four stars designated Phi Ceti. The northern fish of <b>Pisces</b> {{was a part of}} the House of the Sandal, Koui-siou.|$|E
25|$|A mock-up of {{the control}} panel of <b>Pisces</b> V can be visited by the public at the Mokupāpapa Discovery Center in Hilo, Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the list}} of the proper names for the stars in the {{constellation}} <b>Pisces.</b> (Used modern western astronomy and uranography only).|$|E
25|$|By current {{standards}} <b>Pisces</b> and Vermes are informal groupings, Insecta {{also contained}} arachnids and crustaceans, and one order of Amphibia comprised sharks, lampreys, and sturgeons.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{tropical}} astrologers, {{the current}} astrological age is the Age of <b>Pisces,</b> while others maintain {{that it is}} the Age of Aquarius.|$|E
25|$|The {{vernal equinox}} is {{currently}} located in <b>Pisces,</b> due south of ω Psc, and, due to precession, slowly drifting below the western fish towards Aquarius.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pisces</b> is {{classified}} as a short ascension sign; one which takes a shorter {{amount of time to}} ascend over the horizon than the other signs. It {{is also one of the}} six southern signs, because it is south of the celestial equator when the sun is in it (no longer true). This results in it being seen in the winter sky in the northern hemisphere. <b>Pisces</b> is also considered a bicorporeal or double-bodied sign, as the astrological sign is composed of two fishes.|$|E
25|$|Just {{south of}} Pegasus, the western fish of <b>Pisces</b> {{is home to}} the Circlet formed from Gamma, Kappa, Lambda, TX, Iota, and Theta Piscium.|$|E

25|$|While the astrological sign <b>Pisces</b> per {{definition}} {{runs from}} ecliptical longitude 330° to 0, {{this position is}} now mostly covered by the constellation of Aquarius, due to the precession from when the constellation and the sign coincided.|$|E
25|$|After {{recovering}} the Webware from <b>Pisces,</b> Aquarius, and Cancer, Spider-Man {{gives the}} status of the mission to Mockingbird and Nick Fury Jr. Mockingbird tells Spider-Man that Leo is still being interrogated and has not snitched yet.|$|E
25|$|Bassist John Paul Jones' symbol, {{which he}} chose from Rudolf Koch's Book of Signs, {{is a single}} circle {{intersecting}} three vesica <b>pisces</b> (a triquetra). It is intended to symbolise a person who possesses both confidence and competence.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Pisces</b> III {{submersible}} was crewed by 28-year-old pilot Roger Chapman, {{a former}} Royal Navy submariner, and 35-year-old engineer and senior pilot Roger Mallinson. Chapman had been invalided {{out of the}} Royal Navy due to less-than-perfect eyesight. Both men were married.|$|E
25|$|As {{seen from}} the orange grid, 5,000 years ago, the vernal equinox {{was close to the}} star Aldebaran of Taurus. Now, as {{seen from the}} yellow grid, it has shifted (indicated by the red arrow) to somewhere in the {{constellation}} of <b>Pisces.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Pisces</b> III {{had sunk}} once before, during trials in Vancouver Bay in 1971. Peter Messervy of Vickers Oceanics, who {{would lead the}} rescue team after the 1973 accident, {{was one of the}} pilots who were rescued by the Canadian Defense Ministry {{submersible}} SDL-1.|$|E
25|$|Feminine (Earth and Water signs): The {{feminine}} {{signs are}} Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and <b>Pisces.</b> A native with these signs predominating will tend towards introversion, shyness and passivity, {{and have the}} ability to nurture, conserve and solve problems by intuitive means.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pisces</b> Austrinus {{originated}} with the Babylonian constellation simply {{known as the}} Fish (MUL.KU). Professor of astronomy Bradley Schaefer has proposed that ancient observers must {{have been able to}} see as far south as Mu Piscis Austrini to define a pattern that looked like an fish.|$|E
25|$|The Delta Aquariids is {{a double}} radiant meteor shower that peaks first on 29 July and second on 6 August. The first radiant {{is located in the}} south of the constellation, while the second radiant is located in the {{northern}} circlet of <b>Pisces</b> asterism. The southern radiant's peak rate is about 20 meteors per hour, while the northern radiant's peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour.|$|E
