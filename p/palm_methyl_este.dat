The Government of Thailand recently {{has set up a}} production target of 8. 5 Â million liters per day of palm oil-based biodiesel by 2011. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the energy consumption of <b>palm</b> <b>methyl</b> ester (PME) production in Thailand using a life cycle approach compared to other possible oil crops for biodiesel production including jatropha and coconut. The main contributors to the energy use are cultivation, oil production, transesterification and transportation.

The net energy balance (NEB) and net energy ratio (NER) of PME and co-products are 100. 84 Â GJ/ha and 3. 58, respectively. The NER of PME without co-products is 2. 42, which is still higher than one indicating a favourable result.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{examination of the}} solution behaviour and crystallisation kinetics of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) is presented. The systems studied are: methyl palmitate, methyl stearate and their binary mixtures in dodecane and methyl oleate solvents. Fractionation behaviour in <b>palm</b> <b>methyl</b> ester, soybean methyl ester and rapeseed methyl ester fuel is also studied. Two principal techniques are employed in this work, i. e. turbidometric analysis of solutions during polythermal cycles and the gas chromatography analysis of solution supernatants {{as a function of}} temperature. The foundations of these two studied have been laid via the x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the solid-state forms of methyl palmitate and methyl stearate crystallised from solution. No evidence is found to suggest that the methyl stearate and methyl palmitate binary mixtures crystallise from methyl oleate solvent as a solid solution and no shift in the XRD patterns generated, i. e. no transition in solid state form crystallised is observed for the conditions under which solutions are crystallised. It is found that solution behaviour for methyl palmitate, methyl stearate and their binary mixtures in both solvents is in negative deviation to ideality, with the pure solutes being the more deviated in comparison to the binary mixtures. Eutectic points are discovered at a composition of 75 mol% C 16 : 0 in the C 16 : 0 I C 18 : 0 binary mixture crystallisation from both solvents. Metastable zone widths (MSZW) are larger for both solutes in the methyl oleate solvent (6 - 9. 50 C) as compared to dodecane (3 - 6. 5 oC) and MSZWs are significantly smaller at the 100 mI scale, being about half those at the 1 ml scale. Nucleation rates for both solutes and their binary mixtures are about 2 - 13 k gilimin over a 100 - 250 g/l concentration range in both solvents.

From the engine experimental work, neat and blended fuels behaved comparably to diesel (D 2) in terms of fuel consumption, thermal efficiency and rate of heat released. Smoke density showed better results than that emitted by D 2, operating under similar conditions due to the presence of inherited oxygen and lower sulphur content in the biofuel and its blends. The emissions of CO, CO 2, and HC were also lower using blended mixtures and in its neat form.

40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} is usually an assessment tool, which only considers steady-state processes, as the {{temporal and spatial}} dimensions are lost during the life cycle inventory (LCI). This approach therefore reduces the environmental relevance of certain results, {{as it has been}} underlined in the case of climate change studies. Given that the development of dynamic impact methods is based on dynamic inventory data, it seems essential to develop a general methodology to achieve a temporal LCI. This study presents a method for selecting the steps, within the whole process network, for which dynamics need to be considered while others can be approximated by steady-state representation. The selection procedure is based on the sensitivity of the impacts on the variation of environmental and economic flows. Once these flows have been identified, their respective timescales are compared to the inherent timescales of the impact categories affected by the flows. The timescales of the impacts are divided into three categories (days, months, years) based on a literature review of the ReCiPe method. The introduction of a temporal dynamic depends on the relationship between the timescale of the environmental and economic flows {{on the one hand and}} that of the concerned impact on the other hand. This approach is illustrated by the life cycle assessment of <b>palm</b> <b>methyl</b> ester and ethanol from sugarcane.

Flame temperature along the centerline pool fire from flame base to flame tip were measured. Flame temperature shows that the temperature at flame base is higher than that the flames tip. This {{is due to the}} complete burning occurs near flame base and at flame tip incomplete burning exists. Incomplete burning produces yellow flame appearance. Moreover, the mass burn rate varies linearly with pan size. Small diameter pan produces low mass burn rate compared to the large diameter pan. Low and high mass burn rate contributes to the flame height. Flame with higher mass burn rate is longer than that the low mass burn rate. Thus, the characteristic of the biodiesel <b>palm</b> oil <b>methyl</b> ester is successfully studied in the present study...|$|R

However, water emulsion of biodiesel was not properly explored in diesel engine. In this work, the effect of water concentration in palm oil diesel emulsions (POD) [POD is <b>palm</b> oil <b>Methyl</b> ester] on exhaust emissions of a four-cylinder diesel engine was investigated.

40|$|Palm oil {{has been}} {{accepted}} {{to be used as}} fuel with the introduction of petroleum diesel and <b>Palm</b> <b>Methyl</b> Ester (PME) in 2014. The high cost is the major drawback of PME. Not only PME is derived from an expensive low Free Fatty Acid (FFA) feedstock, the cost to convert FFA to PME through the process of trans esterification and purification of palm oil fatty acid is also expensive. Alternative feedstock of FFA is palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). PFAD is a by-product of crude palm oil (CPO) refining. It is inedible and a low price palm oil product making it attractive as a feedstock for biofuel. The high viscosity of PFAD can be reduced by blending it with diesel fuel. Five blends of PFAD and diesel blends with 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 % volumetric ratio were produced in this study. The physical properties of the blends such as density, viscosity, surface tension and flash point were determined and the results were compared to the Malaysian Standard for Diesel Fuel (MS 123 : 2014). The results show that all properties of the blends are within the acceptable value for diesel fuel...|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{engine is}} known as the most {{efficient}} engine with high efficiency and power but always reported as high fuel emission. Malaysia National Automotive Policy (NAP) was targeting to improve competitive regional focusing on green technology development in reducing the emission of the engine. Therefore, ethanol was introduced to reduce the emission of the engine and while increasing its performance, <b>Palm</b> <b>methyl</b> ester was introduced as blend enhancer to improve engine performance and improve diesel-ethanol blends stability. This paper aimed to study the characteristics of the blends and to prove the ability of palm-methyl-ester as co-solvent in ethanol-diesel blends. Stability and thermophysical test were carried out for different fuel compositions. The stability of diesel-ethanol blended was proved to be improved with the addition of PME at the longer period and the stability of the blends changed depending on temperature and ethanol content. Density and viscosity of diesel-ethanol-PME blends also give higher result than diesel-ethanol blends and it's proved that PME is able to increase density and viscosity of blends. Besides, heating value of the blends also increases with the increasing PME in diesel-ethanol blends...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1982, Malaysia {{developed}} a comprehensive biofuels programme where <b>palm</b> <b>methyl</b> esthers and a 5% blend of processed palm oil {{were the primary}} additives to 95% petroleum diesel as transport fuels. At present, Pusat Tenaga Malaysia Energy Centre forecasted that for the next 25 years the country’s energy requirements would be tripled from its present consumption levels and expand at a 5.2% annual rate. According to Malaysia’s national oil company Petronas, the country’s reserves of 5.2 billion barrels of crude oil may only last for another 20 years at the present rate of extraction unless new oil fields are explored or new sources of energy emerge. In pursuit of energy security through diversification, Malaysia passed the Five Fuel Diversification Strategy. Under this strategy, the Malaysian government enacted the National Biofuel Policy (NBP) in August 2005 to develop a framework for biofuels. The NBP aims to supplement the diminishing supply of fossil fuels with renewable resources and has mobilized local resources for biofuel production. This effort involves the exploitation of local technology to generate energy for the transportation and industrial sectors and {{to pave the way}} for the export of biofuels. The NBP operates through five strategic objectives: ...|$|R

40|$|In vivo {{study of}} radiprotective effect of NO-synthase inhibitors and acetyl-L-carnitine This study {{investigated}} the protective effect of two nitric oxide synthase inhibitors N(omega) -Nitro-Larginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 mg/kg i. p.) and aminoguanidine (AG, 400 mg/kg i. p.), and an antioxidant acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC, 250 mg/kg i. p., once daily for five days) against radiation-induced damage in Wistar rats. Blood samples were collected 6 hrs after whole-body irradiation with 8 Gy. Plasma concentrations of nitrite+nitrate (NOx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by highperformance liquid chromatography. A single injection of L-NAME one hour before exposure effectively prevented the radiation-induced elevation of plasma NOx and it reduced 2. 6 -fold the risk for death during the subsequent 30 -day period. Pretreatment with ALC prevented the radiation-induced increase in plasma MDA and it had similar effect on mortality as L-NAME did. Presumably due to its short half-life, the partially iNOS-selective inhibitor and antioxidant AG given in a single dose before exposure did not attenuate MDA and NOx and it failed to significantly improve the 30 -day survival. In conclusion, pretreatment with both the nonspecific NOS inhibitor L-NAME and the antioxidant ALC markedly reduce mortality to radiation sickness in rats. The radioprotective effect may be directly related to effective attenuation of the radiation-induced elevation of NO production by L-NAME and of oxidative stress by ALC.
