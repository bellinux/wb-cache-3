5|$|By 9 July, {{his ground}} forces had made {{significant}} gains in cutting off a vital road that connected Kaunas to Daugavpils. Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders {{to attack the}} rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance. At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless. He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia {{by the time of}} the offensive. He attempted to convince them otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of Šiauliai to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July.|$|E

[...] (United Artists was revamped as a joint venture with Scientologist Tom Cruise, his business associate Paula Wagner, who is chief executive of the company, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.) Marina Hyde of The Guardian called Beghe a Scientology celebrity whistleblower.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and {{was intended as a}} morality tale. Spotnitz made sure that the episode had an explicit purpose and reason, and he noted, [...] "If you're going to depart from literal reality as most of us know—if you're going to go into supernatural—as a writer {{you have to ask yourself}} 'Why? ... And if you don't really have a point or reason, your story's <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be very good." [...] Despite largely being concerned with a [...] "Monster-of-the-Week", [...] "The Gift" [...] also fits in the series' overarching mythology. The Complete X-Files book, released in 2008, considers the episode part of the overall myth arc, however, it was not included on the 2005 DVD release The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers.|$|E

5000|$|He didn't {{care about}} himself. I hope that {{audience}} would get that {{he cares about}} his son, but that doesn't mean I expected the audience to have sympathy for him. If they believe that he knows he made a mistake, that's good enough. I didn't want the audiences to say, [...] "What an asshole!" [...] I don't know if women in the audience care about Cary Elwes from the first Saw film. I think they still {{thought he was a}} bastard even if he didn't sleep with that woman. His mistake put him in that predicament and in real, if you mess around on your wife, you're <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end up chained up in the bathroom somewhere with a saw, but you can still make a mess out of things. What I kept zeroing in on with my character and his son is when I talk to my son, I tell him I love him every time I hang up the phone. I say, [...] "I love you," [...] when I drop him off at school, only because I {{want to make sure that}} the last things I say to him is something wonderful. That's one of the things we added to the script. That was one of the best moments for my character, to see what was the last thing he said to his son. When Jigsaw asks him that, that was something I had to have in that scene. If you are a parent, you will probably say to yourself, [...] "That's not good." [...] That's the thing that you have to live with.|$|R

Since the Bowl Championship Series was formed in 1998, 9of the 14teams were unbeaten going into the championship game. [...] The only time {{the national}} champion has not been unbeaten during that stretch was in 2003 when LSU and USC claimed a share of the title as each finished with one loss. [...] Ohio State tackle Kirk Barton would later say [...] "There’ll probably be two undefeated teams at the end of the road and if you’re not one of them you’re <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be playing for the championship.

[...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized this was our chance," [...] Tracy later said.

500|$|According to Cohen, {{the writing}} team's {{approach}} when using pop culture references as an episode's main subject is to modify them into futuristic versions {{to avoid being}} dated, noting that being a science fiction show, [...] "some topics are <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be around {{by the time the}} show airs." [...] In particular, with [...] "Proposition Infinity", they paid specific attention to developing the plot {{in a way that would}} [...] "history-proof" [...] the episode and avoid being over-politicized or [...] "preachy." [...] When taking on [...] "real" [...] social issues in the show, Cohen stated that one of their methods of keeping controversy from overwhelming the episode is to [...] "futurize" [...] issues until the audience is unlikely to have developed a strong opinion one way or another about the presented conflict. [...] This was the method used for [...] "Proposition Infinity", as the team felt that most viewers would not have a strong opinion for or against robot and human intermarriage, thus lightening the potentially polarizing nature of the source material.|$|E

500|$|U2 manager Paul McGuinness confessed {{anxiety over}} initial ticket sales taking {{place during the}} late 2000s recession. Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "Will we sell it out? Who knows? Will the {{economic}} situation have an impact? <b>Probably.</b> But that's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop us." [...] Bono said, [...] "I want to put on an extraordinary show, but I’d like to own my house when it's over." [...] The tour featured a tiered pricing system for tickets; the most expensive ticket being slightly higher in price than the last tour, but the cheapest tickets, the general admission tickets, being lower. Playing larger capacity venues allowed the band to price tickets more conservatively and subsidise less expensive tickets with costlier ones. In the US, field level tickets were priced at $55, and approximately 10,000 tickets per show were priced at $30. The price points were $30, $55, and depending on the market, $90–95 and $250. McGuinness said, [...] "We have {{worked very hard to}} ensure that U2 fans can purchase a great-priced ticket with a guaranteed great view." ...|$|R
40|$|Wacquant’s book {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} bertween street culture {{and the world of}} the gym. Wacquant’s goal is to avoid the exotic insight often adopted in representing the environment of boxing, in order to focus on the gym space and on the daily life practices by a group of pugilists who are <b>not</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be professionals. The gym turns into a a window allowing to observe the migratory flows towards U. S., since boxers belong mostly to the working class. The Author analyzes deeply the connection between pugilists and the coach, often similar to a father-son connection. The main issue of the book, however, is the teaching and learning dynamic through which they learn how to become pugilists. The training method of the “noble art”, indeed, shows the paradox of an individual discipline that implies a collective training. It’s impossible to learn boxing through a theoretical pathway. To learn a punch requests to repeat it thousands of times. Teaching a physical practices involves a lot of theoretical issues – this should be taken into careful consideration by social science when attempting to give a theoretical account of processes that happen mostly at an unconsciouos level. Il saggio di Loic Wacquant tratta di un gruppo di pugili immigrati, delle loro pratiche di vita e della palestra che frequentano quotidianamente in un ghetto nero di Chicago. E’ una riflessione sulla boxe e sulla sua funzione pedagogica...|$|R
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her ace in the hole, the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no one out there who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, he understands that this move is going to mean that she's <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fare that well in this trial.

500|$|Neil Geinzlinger of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "it may not {{stay in the}} public eye long because this movie is <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put up Twilight-like numbers," [...] adding that [...] "the script doesn't give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status, which is odd, since the {{producers}} include Will Ferrell." [...] Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune suggested that this film should have been made 30 years ago by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell, while instead [...] "the Hansel and Gretel we’re left with runs out of its magic potion far too early to let us enjoy its wicked possibilities." [...] A more positive comparison to Raimi and Campbell's Army of Darkness was made by Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press, who gave it three out of five [...] "witch hazels" [...] and wrote: [...] "I'm not sure if witches are the next vampires/zombies, or if the hinted-at franchise potential has any legs, but this was a perfectly vulgar way to spend 90 minutes." [...] Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote that Hansel and Gretel [...] "works best as an unapologetic B-movie action flick" [...] and [...] "feels like a first film in a franchise that’s meant to set up the main characters and conflicts, which can then be fleshed out in sequels" [...] but [...] "the problem is that there isn't enough here to warrant a return trip to this semi-magical land." [...] Richard Corliss of TIME agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "one might be enough — too much, for some tastes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E
60|$|And {{concurrently}} {{with the}} systematic reconstruction {{of a large}} portion of our industries upon these lines {{there will have to be}} a vigorous development of the attempts that are already being made, in garden cities, garden suburbs, and the like, to re-house the mass of our population in a more civilised and more agreeable manner. <b>Probably</b> that is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pay from the point of view of the money-making business man, but we prosperous people have to understand that there are things more important and more profitable than money-making, and we have to tax ourselves not merely in money, but in time, care, and effort in the matter. Half the money that goes out of England to Switzerland and the Riviera ought to go to the extremely amusing business of clearing up ugly corners and building jolly and convenient workmen's cottages--even if we do it at a loss. It is part of our discharge for the leisure and advantages the system has given us, part of that just give and take, over and above the solicitor's and bargain-hunter's and money-lender's conception of justice, upon which social order ultimately rests. We have to do it not in a mood of patronage, but in a mood of attentive solicitude. If not on high grounds, then on low grounds our class has to set to work and make those other classes more interested and comfortable and contented. It is what we are for. It is quite impossible for workmen and poor people generally to plan estates and arrange their own homes; they are entirely at the mercy of the wealthy in this matter. There is not a slum, not a hovel, not an eyesore upon the English landscape for which some well-off owner is not ultimately to be blamed or excused, and the less we leave of such things about the better for us in that day of reckoning between class and class which now draws so near.|$|R
