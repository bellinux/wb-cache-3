Stimuli had a bandwidth of 0. 5 octave of spatial frequency, centred at 5. 0 cyc/deg, and an orientation bandwidth that covered the range from 0. 0 to 25. 0 deg. Thresholds were obtained on one <b>principal</b> (<b>vertical),</b> and one oblique axis (45 deg). It was found that acuity declined on both axes as bandwidth increased, {{in a manner that}} was compatible with simple statistical principles with virtually perfect sampling of the image. There was some evidence that the intrinsic noise is greater on the oblique axis than on the vertical, and that oblique axes are less densely sampled than the principal axes. These differences are small and are insufficient, either on their own or taken together to explain the oblique effect...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{vertical}} heating and thickening of galaxy disks due to accretion of small satellites. Our simulations {{are restricted to}} axial symmetry, which largely eliminates numerical evolution of the target galaxy but requires the trajectory of the satellite to be along the symmetry axis of the target. We find that direct heating of disk stars by the satellite is not important because the satellite’s gravitational perturbation has little power at frequencies resonant with the vertical stellar orbits. The satellite does little damage to the disk until its decaying orbit resonantly excites large-scale disk bending waves. Bending waves can damp through dynamical friction from the halo or internal wave-particle resonances; we find that wave-particle resonances dominate the damping. The <b>principal</b> <b>vertical</b> heating mechanism is therefore dissipation of bending waves at resonances with stellar orbits in the disk. Energy can thus be deposited {{some distance from the}} point of impact of the satellite. The net heating from a tightly bound satellite can be substantial, but satellites that are tidally disrupted before they are able to excite bending waves do not thicken the disk...|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{quantify}} {{changes to}} the trabecular structure in the femoral heads of patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA). MethodsPatients with OA (n= 14; F= 7), mean (standard deviation age) 50. 6 (10. 1) years, had macroradiographs at approximately × 4 magnification at baseline and 18 months later using a standardized protocol. Following digitization, computerized measurement was obtained of minimum hip joint space width and fractal signature analysis (FSA) measured longitudinal changes separately in the <b>principal</b> compressive (<b>vertical)</b> and horizontal trabeculae at the region of interest within {{the centre of the}} head. ResultsThe patient group had mean annual rate of joint space narrowing of 0. 14 ± 0. 36 mm/yr. FSA detected no significant changes in horizontal trabeculae, whereas the larger <b>principal</b> compressive (<b>vertical)</b> trabeculae (0. 96 mm to 1. 02 mm) increased significantly in thickness and the fine to medium trabeculae (0. 18 mm to 0. 54 mm) decreased significantly in number. ConclusionThe increased thickness of the larger trabeculae within the compressive structural element of the femoral head is a response to the increase in stress associated with an overall loss of trabeculae in this region, suggesting the presence of an osteoporosis within the femoral head in OA patients...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of body and head tilts on the haptic oblique effect. This effect {{reflects}} the more accurate processing of vertical and horizontal orientations, relative to oblique orientations. Body or head tilts lead to a mismatch between egocentric and gravitational axes and indicate whether the haptic oblique effect is defined in an egocentric or a gravitational reference frame. The ability to reproduce <b>principal</b> (<b>vertical</b> and horizontal) and oblique orientations was studied in upright and tilted postures. Moreover, by controlling the deviation of the haptic subjective vertical provoked by postural tilt, the possible role of a subjective gravitational reference frame was tested. Results showed that the haptic reproduction of orientations was strongly affected by both the position of the body (Experiment 1) and the position of the head (Experiment 2). In particular, the classical haptic oblique effect observed in the upright posture disappeared in tilted conditions, mainly because of a decrease in the accuracy of the vertical and horizontal settings. The subjective vertical appeared to be the orientation reproduced the most accurately. These results suggest that the haptic oblique effect is not purely gravitationally or egocentrically defined but, rather, depends on a subjective gravitational reference frame that is tilted in a direction opposite to that of the head in tilted postures (Experiment 3) ...|$|E

These methods, which can be used in conjunction with the 2005 NBCC, were {{based on the results of}} shear wall tests carried out using lateral loads alone. The research program was extended to determine the influence of gravity loads on the lateral performance of the shear wall. An initial series of stud column tests was completed to determine an appropriate predication method for the axial capacity of the <b>principal</b> <b>vertical</b> load carrying members. Recommendations for appropriate effective length factors and buckling lengths were derived from the results of 40 tests. A subsequent series of five single-storey shear wall configurations were designed using capacity based methods. These shear walls were tested under monotonic and cyclic lateral loading, where two of three shear walls were also subjected to a constant gravity load. In total, 32 steel frame/wood panel shear walls composed of 1. 09 [...] 1. 37 mm thick steel studs sheathed with DFP, CSP or OSB panels were tested and analyzed. The equivalent energy elastic-plastic analysis approach was used to determine design values for stiffness, strength, ductility and overstrength. The data from this most recent series of tests indicates that the additional gravity loads do not have a detrimental influence on the lateral behaviour of a steel frame/wood panel shear wall if the chord studs are designed to carry the combined lateral and gravity forces following a capacity based approach. A resistance factor of 0. 7 was found to be in agreement with previous tests that did not include gravity loads. The calculated seismic force modification factors also agreed with the previous test results, which suggest that Rd = 2. 5 and Ro = 1. 7...|$|E

40|$|In recent wars, {{the use of}} improvised {{explosive}} devices and landmines has dramatically increased as a tactical measure to counter armored vehicles. These weapons not only deform and damage the vehicle structure but also produce serious vertical deceleration injuries to mounted occupants. The reported injury patterns largely differ from those in an automotive crash and are often more severe than those in other vertical loading scenarios such as pilot seat ejection, helicopter crash, parachute landing and fall from height. High kinetic energy predominately along the <b>principal</b> <b>vertical</b> (Z-axis) over a short duration makes the underbody blast (UBB) loading conditions unique compared to other vertical and blunt impacts. With the lack of biomechanical response corridors (BRCs), the non-biofidelic nature of the automotive dummies to Z-axis loading {{and the lack of}} a finite element dummy model designed for vertical loading make it difficult to evaluate occupant response and develop mitigation strategies for UBB impact conditions. An introduction {{to the development of the}} BRCs this study provides a detailed methodology to perform whole body cadaver testing under a laboratory setup. Two whole body PMHS UBB impact tests were conducted using a sled system. An overview of pre-impact parameters such as bone mineral density, instrumentation technique, and vertical impulse generation is presented. Post-test CT scans, response data, and possible injury mechanisms were investigated. In addition, to PMHS testing, the responses of the Hybrid III dummy to short-duration large magnitude vertical acceleration in a laboratory setup were analyzed. Two unique test conditions were investigated using a horizontal sled system to simulate the UBB loading conditions. The biomechanical response in terms of the pelvis acceleration, chest acceleration, lumbar spine force, head accelerations and neck forces were measured during the tests. Subsequently, a series of finite element analyses (FEA) were performed to simulate the physical tests. The material parameters of various components as well as the mesh size were updated based on the high strain rate loading conditions obtained from Zhu et. al (2015) study. The correlation between the Hybrid III test and numerical model was evaluated using the CORA version 3. 6. 1. The Cora score for WSU FE model was determined to be 0. 878 and 0. 790 for loading conditions 1 and 2, respectively, in which 1. 0 indicated a perfect correlation between the experiment and simulation response. The original LSTC model simulated under the current loading condition became numerically unstable after 12 ms. With repetitive vertical impacts, the Hybrid III dummy pelvis showed a significant increase in the peak acceleration accompanied by rupture of the pelvis foam and flesh. The revised WSU Hybrid III model indicated high stress concentrations at the same location where the pelvis foam and flesh in the actual ATD showed rupture. The stress contour under the ischial tuberosities in the finite element model provides a possible explanation for the material failure in the actual Hybrid III tests...|$|E
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} panels find {{widespread use}} in many engineering structures and accurate prediction of their structural behaviour {{is important in}} achieving a safe structural design. The shear strengths of these panels depend strongly on the softening of concrete struts in the principal compression direction due to the principal tension in the orthogonal direction. Intensive investigations of the nonlinear structural behaviour of RC panels and shear walls by finite elements method {{have been reported in}} the last decades. Despite commendable progress made in developing new computational methods, accurate and efficient prediction of both the overall load-deflection and the local stress-strain cyclic responses of RC panels is still challenging because of the complicated nonlinear behaviour of these structures, especially in the case of coupled in-plane membrane-shear nonlinear behaviours. The main issues are the development of proper finite element models and the enhancement of effective constitutive laws for concrete, for reinforcement and for their interactions. Many finite element models have been developed for the nonlinear analysis of RC elements and generally there are three types of models: the discrete model, the smeared-crack model, and the layered model. In the discrete approach [1]-[2], the concrete and steel reinforcement are modelled separately by two different types of finite elements. The creation of discrete models can be quite difficult especially for complex structures. Since a large number of degrees of freedom are generated in the discrete model, it is significantly less efficient, which is of particular concerns in the nonlinear analysis of these structures [2]. In the smeared-crack model [3]-[4], the cracking of concrete and the degradation of its material properties are considered by using averaged stress-strain relationships, that are established directly from full-scale biaxial tests. The resulting models turn out to have low computational efficiency or even to cause numerical instability. The layered approach has been widely used for FE analysis of RC structures, and it has been demonstrated to be effective, particularly in predicting the cracking and the ultimate behaviour of RC panels and slabs in bending and shear [5]-[6]. In this model, the element is formulated by assembling a finite number of concrete layers and equivalent smeared steel layers. Each layer may have different material properties corresponding to its particular material states, and the material properties of each layer are usually assumed to be constant throughout the thickness of the layer. In this case the material constitutive laws for general stress states can follow analytical approaches as the theory of fracture and the theory of continuum damage mechanic. For out-of-plane loaded slabs, cracking and crushing of concrete and yielding of reinforcement through the thickness of the cross-section can be monitored progressively using the layered model, thereby providing an accurate and realistic representation of the structural behaviour [6]. The aim of the work herein is the investigation of the nonlinear modelling of reinforced concrete panels by means of a concrete constitutive law based on damage mechanics applied to a layered quadrilateral element. The concrete constitutive law, that took its bases on the works of Faria et al. [7], Lee et al. [8], Berto et al. [9], is presented in its general formulation having the possibility to represent softening isotropic and orthotropic material behaviour. The tensile branch takes into account the concrete energy of fracture and the tension-stiffening effects. A particular effort has been made to improve the convergence speed through the definition of an adequate secant material stiffness matrix. For what concerns the reinforcing steel, in sake of simplicity, a simple elastic-plastic law has been used with both kinematic and isotropic hardening. The material models have been implemented in the finite open source code Opensees of the University of California, Berkeley [10]. The already implemented quadrilateral layered element has been enhanced with the possibility of taking into account more than one nonlinear material. The validation of the proposed model has been made by comparison with entire experimental sets such as Bhide and Collins [11] and Mansour and Hsu [12]. These test campaigns have been chosen for representing a wide range of coupled membrane-shear nonlinear behaviours. In particular Bhide and Collins [11] carried out 32 tests on square panels applying combined tension, compression and shear stressed on their edge whereas Mansour and Hsu [12] presented 12 full-size reinforced concrete panel tests investigating the behaviour of reinforced concrete membrane elements under reversed cyclic shear stresses. These last set outlined the effects of the variation of angle of steel bar orientation with respect to the applied <b>principal</b> <b>vertical</b> stress and different percentages of reinforcing steel in the panels. The results of the numerical simulations are presented critically with the aim of showing the achievements and the model drawbacks in order to clearly delineate the future developments. The model showed its ability to interpret the experimental evidences especially in uniaxial stress states, biaxial compression and biaxial tension both locally and discretely, but it demonstrated the need of improvements on biaxial tension-compression due to its simplified definition of the damage limit surface in these stress regions.

Subjects were seated at 1 m {{in front of a}} screen where a random-dot pattern was projected and made saccades of 7. 5 and 15 deg along the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>principal</b> meridians and to tertiary positions in the upper and lower field. During the training period, compensatory disconjugacy of the amplitude of the saccades occurred for the <b>principal</b> horizontal and <b>vertical</b> meridians; such increased disconjugacy persisted after training, suggesting learning. In contrast, for horizontal saccades to or from tertiary positions made in the upper and lower field, no consistent changes in the disconjugacy occurred, either during training or after the training condition. In an additional experiment, three subjects read sequences of words with the 2 % magnifier in front of their dominant eye: in such a task, horizontal saccades to or from tertiary positions at the upper or lower field showed appropriate and lasting disconjugacy for two of the three subjects. We conclude that even a 2 % image size inequality stimulates oculomotor learning, leading to persistent disconjugacy of saccades. The small disparity created by the image-size inequality is thus compensated by the oculomotor system rather than tolerated by the sensory system (e. g. by enlarging the Panum's area) ...|$|R
