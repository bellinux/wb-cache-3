5|$|The Adbhuta Ramayana narrates: Ravana used {{to store}} the blood of sages he killed in a large <b>pot.</b> The sage Gritsamada was {{practicing}} penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with mantras in a <b>pot</b> so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this <b>pot</b> into his blood <b>pot.</b> Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking {{the contents of the}} blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in Kurukshetra, where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.|$|E
5|$|The fenjaan {{was a big}} <b>pot</b> full {{of water}} and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the <b>pot,</b> and the manager would empty the bowl and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the <b>pot.</b> He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.|$|E
50|$|When thrown and let dry to a bone dry stage, the <b>pots</b> {{are loaded}} into a massive kiln. The kilns can {{hold up to}} 80 large <b>pots</b> and around 20 smaller <b>pots</b> that are often fired inside of the larger <b>pots.</b> They prevent the <b>pots</b> from {{sticking}} together by using ash.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Potting</b> bench or {{gardening}} {{table is}} a kind of workbench used for small gardening tasks such as transplanting seedlings. A basic <b>potting</b> bench has a work surface at bench height, comfortable for a standing person; and storage for <b>potting</b> soil, <b>pots,</b> and tools. The same furniture is often also used to display <b>potted</b> plants, even indoors.|$|R
50|$|Pot-in-pot {{is a type}} {{of system}} used in plant nurseries. Plants are planted in <b>pots</b> that will {{accommodate}} their point-of-sale size, and those <b>pots</b> are placed into slightly larger <b>pots</b> planted in a field. These <b>pots</b> are usually planted in long rows in large fields. The larger <b>pots</b> are usually connected to a central irrigation system, and often fertilized through this system as well. When the plants have grown to their point-of-sale size, they can be removed in their <b>pots</b> and sold immediately. The larger <b>pots</b> (also called socket <b>pots)</b> remain in the field to be reused. This system allows growers to offset labor costs associated with planting and re-planting in the field with a significant initial investment.|$|R

5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with stand, a high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware <b>pot</b> which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware <b>pot</b> made on a turntable; the painting on the <b>pot</b> was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is a polished black ware in globular shape jar with a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the <b>pot</b> was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the <b>pot,</b> allowing the <b>pot</b> to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E

40|$|Stingless {{beekeeping}} {{has drawn}} the general attention of beekeepers {{because of the}} easy management {{and the quality of}} products. Nevertheless, little is known about their production and biology. The present study evaluated the development of Melipona scutellaris hives, considering the production parameters in a beekeeping environment. The growth parameter of hives is food storage. In the case of M. scutellaris, storage is made inside beeswax <b>pots.</b> Therefore, beeswax <b>pots</b> in the hives were classified and counted as nectar <b>pots,</b> pollen <b>pots,</b> open <b>pots,</b> closed <b>pots</b> and empty <b>pots.</b> Hive dimensions were also taken and evaluated. The results indicated that hives show different amounts of <b>pots</b> that vary {{as a function of the}} number of individuals in the hive. It was confirmed that the availability of food resources determines the utilization of food storage, i. e., if there is resource limitation and foraging is compromised, bees utilize the food that is stored inside the <b>pots...</b>|$|R
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{reacted to}} the {{political}} changes in Cambodia by sending Premier Phạm Văn Đồng to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. Pol <b>Pot</b> was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he wanted for his insurgency against the Cambodian government. Pol <b>Pot</b> and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing {{at the same time}} but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Pol <b>Pot</b> or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. In May 1970, Pol <b>Pot</b> finally returned to Cambodia and the pace of the insurgency greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.|$|E

Another legend records that when Brahma created his son Kama (desire), he became a victim of desire and lusted for his own daughter Sarasvati (Goddess of learning). Upon invocation {{by all of the}} deities, the sacred Turiya Tirtha river appeared and Brahma bathed in her waters to cleanse his sin of incest. Brahma then came to Morgaon to worship Ganesha, carrying water from the river in his water <b>pot.</b> Entering the Ganesha shrine, Brahma stumbled and water fell from the <b>pot.</b> When Brahma tried to pick it up, it was turned into the sacred Karha river, that still flows at Morgaon.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 <b>pot</b> {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the <b>pot</b> at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E
5|$|Bitter {{for having}} nothing left but a <b>pot,</b> the son {{closes the door}} on every person who asks for his help.

This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town.
