40|$|Effect {{of early}} {{postnatal}} neutropenia in very {{low birth weight}} infants born to mothers with pregnancy-induced hypertension Purpose: In this study, we aimed to investigate the perinatal clinical conditions of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants born to mothers with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) focusing {{on the effects of}} early postnatal neutropenia. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 191 VLBW infants who were born at Konyang University Hospital, between March 2003 and May 2011. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of the infants and their mothers and compared the incidence of <b>perinatal</b> <b>diseases</b> and mortality of the infants according to {{the presence or absence of}} maternal PIH and neutropenia on the first postnatal day. Results: Infants born to mothers with PIH showed an increased incidence of neutropenia on the first postnatal day (47. 4 %), cesarean delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. When the infants born to mothers with PIH showed neutropenia on the first postnatal day, their incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was increased (P= 0. 031); however, the difference was not found to be significant through logistic regression analysis. In all the VLBW infants, neutropenia on the first postnatal day was correlated with the development of RDS. The incidence of the other <b>perinatal</b> <b>diseases</b> involving sepsis and mortality did not significantly differ according to the presence or absence of neutropenia in infants born to mothers with PIH. Conclusion: In VLBW infants born to mothers with PIH, the incidence of neutropenia on the first postnatal day was increased and it was not significantly correlated with the development of <b>perinatal</b> <b>diseases</b> involving RDS, sepsis, and mortality...|$|E

40|$|Group B {{streptococcus}} (GBS) remains worldwide {{a leading}} cause of severe neonatal disease. Since the end of the 1990 s, various strategies for prevention of the early onset neonatal disease have been implemented and have evolved. When a universal antenatal GBS screening-based strategy is used to identify women who are given an intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis, a substantial reduction of incidence up to 80 % has been reported in the USA as in other countries including European countries. However recommendations are still a matter of debate due to challenges and controversies on how best to identify candidates for prophylaxis and to drawbacks of intrapartum administration of antibiotics. In Europe, some countries recommend either antenatal GBS screening or risk-based strategies, or any combination, and others do not have national or any other kind of guidelines for prevention of GBS <b>perinatal</b> <b>disease.</b> Furthermore, accurate population-based data of incidence of GBS neonatal disease are not available in some countries and hamper good effectiveness evaluation of prevention strategies. To facilitate a consensus towards European guidelines for the management of pregnant women in labor and during pregnancy for the prevention of GBS <b>perinatal</b> <b>disease,</b> a conference was organized in 2013 with a group of experts in neonatology, gynecology- obstetrics and clinical microbiology coming from European representative countries.

40|$|Maternal and <b>perinatal</b> <b>disease</b> {{accounts}} for nearly 10 % {{of the global}} burden of disease, with only modest progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Despite a favourable new global health landscape {{in research and development}} (R&D) to produce new drugs for neglected diseases, R&D investment in maternal/perinatal health remains small and non-strategic. Investment in obstetric R&D by industry or the not-for-profit sector has lagged behind other specialties, with the number of registered pipeline drugs only 1 – 5 % that for other major disease areas. Using a Delphi exercise with maternal/perinatal experts in global and translational research, we estimate that equitable pharmaceutical R&D and public sector research funding over the next 10 – 20 years could avert 1. 1 % and 1. 9 % of the global disease burden, respectively. In contrast, optimal uptake of existing research would prevent 3. 0 %, justifying the current focus on health service provision. Although R&D predominantly occurs in high-income countries, more than 98 % of the estimated reduction in disease burden in this field would be in developing countries. We conclude that better pharmaceutical and public sector R&D would prevent around 1 / 3 and 2 / 3, respectively, of the disease burden addressable by optimal uptake of existing research. Strengthening R&D may be an important complementary strategy to health service provision to address global maternal and <b>perinatal</b> <b>disease</b> burden...|$|R

We aim to assess whether histological patterns of placenta are {{associated with an increased}} risk of <b>perinatal</b> <b>diseases</b> and to evaluate how different patterns of placental dysfunction can affect the neurodevelopmental outcome. METHODS: We analyzed the histopathological characteristics of 105 singleton placentas from infants born between 23 and 31 weeks of gestation and we assessed pair-wise correlations with <b>perinatal</b> <b>diseases.</b> Estimated relative risks were calculated from odds ratios. RESULTS: Histological chorioamnionitis (CA group) was detected on 51 of 100 placentas tested. Lesions of uteroplacental circulation (abruption, infarction or thrombosis, perivillous fibrin deposition, syncytial knots; vasculopathy group) were detected on 29. 25 normal placentas served as controls. The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was higher in CA than in control group. The risk of developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and PDA was higher in CA than in vasculopathy group. CONCLUSIONS: At low gestational age CA, rather than placental lesions of vasculopathy, negatively impacts perinatal outcome. Clinical significance of histologic vasculopathy remains questionable.

40|$|Background: Laryngotracheobronchial {{anomalies}} (LTBAs) {{may cause}} respiratory problems during early childhood, {{and increase the}} risk of hospitalization or mortality in diseased children. This study investigated the initial hospitalization age and risk factors for in-hospital mortality in infants diagnosed with LTBAs during their first 5  years of life. Methods: Hospitalized infants diagnosed with LTBAs were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from 2003 to 2005. Their medical claim data were traced up to 59  months of age. The age distribution of all LTBA cases was analyzed, and then the enrolled infants were grouped into two age groups. Hospitalization-related comorbidities and risk factors for in-hospital mortality were also analyzed. Results: A total of 1272 LTBA cases were retrieved. Most of them (976, 76. 7 %) were initially hospitalized at an age of 0 – 3  months, and 47 infants (3. 7 %) died. These enrolled cases were grouped into early and late LTBA groups, with ages of 0 – 3  months and 4 – 11  months, respectively. Patients in the late LTBA group had significantly more acute airway infections/asthma and neurological diseases, more frequent hospitalizations, longer hospitalization stay, and higher in-hospital mortality than did the early LTBA group (p <  0. 001). The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for in-hospital mortality were significantly higher in the children aged 4 – 11  months [aOR =  2. 50, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 1. 36 – 4. 60], or having <b>perinatal</b> <b>disease</b> (aOR =  2. 00, 95 % CI: 1. 07 – 3. 73), cardiovascular disease (aOR =  2. 45, 95 % CI: 1. 30 – 4. 60), other congenital anomalies (aOR =  2. 42, 95 % CI: 1. 28 – 4. 60), and neurological diseases (aOR =  2. 32, 95 % CI: 1. 18 – 4. 53).

We performed a test for CDKL 5 in the boy, which came back negative. Driven by the mother’s compelling need for a diagnosis, we moved forward performing whole exome sequencing analysis. Surprisingly, two missense mutations in compound heterozygosity were identified in the RAPSN gene encoding a receptor-associated protein with a key role in clustering and anchoring nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at synaptic sites. This gene is responsible for a congenital form of myasthenic syndrome, a disease potentially treatable with cholinesterase inhibitors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rates of {{diseases}} and injuries {{and the effects}} of their risk factors can have substantial subnational heterogeneity, especially in middle-income countries like Mexico. Subnational analysis of the burden {{of diseases}}, injuries, and risk factors can improve characterization of the epidemiological transition and identify policy priorities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated deaths and loss of healthy life years (measured in disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) in 2004 from a comprehensive list of diseases and injuries, and 16 major risk factors, by sex and age for Mexico and its states. Data sources included the vital statistics, national censuses, health examination surveys, and published epidemiological studies. Mortality statistics were adjusted for underreporting, misreporting of age at death, and for misclassification and incomparability of cause-of-death assignment. Nationally, noncommunicable diseases caused 75 % of total deaths and 68 % of total DALYs, with another 14 % of deaths and 18 % of DALYs caused by undernutrition and communicable, maternal, and <b>perinatal</b> <b>diseases.</b> The leading causes of death were ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, and road traffic injuries. High body mass index, high blood glucose, and alcohol use were the leading risk factors for disease burden, causing 5. 1 %, 5. 0 %, and 7. 3 % of total burden of disease, respectively. Mexico City had the lowest mortality rates (4. 2 per 1, 000) and the Southern region the highest (5. 0 per 1, 000); under-five mortality in the Southern region was nearly twice that of Mexico City. In the Southern region undernutrition and communicable, maternal, and <b>perinatal</b> <b>diseases</b> caused 23 % of DALYs; in Chiapas, they caused 29 % of DALYs. At the same time, the absolute rates of noncommunicable disease and injury burdens were highest in the Southern region (105 DALYs per 1, 000 population versus 97 nationally for noncommunicable diseases; 22 versus 19 for injuries). CONCLUSIONS: Mexico is at an advanced stage in the epidemiologic transition, with the majority of the disease and injury burden from noncommunicable diseases. A unique characteristic of the epidemiological transition in Mexico is that overweight and obesity, high blood glucose, and alcohol use are responsible for larger burden of disease than other noncommunicable disease risks such as tobacco smoking. The Southern region is least advanced in the epidemiological transition and suffers from the largest burden of ill health in all disease and injury groups...|$|E

40|$|Analysis of the {{structure}} of real morbidity among children in Lagos, Nigeria, reveals that the leading diseases were of hygienic, nutritional and perinatal origin. These diseases were highly concentrated in infancy and early childhood; {{in the case of the}} former, the concentration was greater among boys than girls. During the 1970 s, a decline is noticed in the frequency of infective and parasitic diseases particularly among male infants. Simultaneously, a slightly rising trend of diseases related to birth complications and perinatal nature afflicting predominantly early infancy occurred, off-setting, to some extent, the effect of the diminishing trend in infective diseases. The rising trend of <b>perinatal</b> <b>diseases</b> should be seen in conjunction with a likely increase in gravidity of women and the resultant increase of pregnancies and birth complications, which affected the health of the mother as well as that of the child. The findings seem to suggest that although both medical and non-medical factors contributed to the change in morbidity pattern in the decade 1968 - 1978, the role of factors of socio-economic nature was significant. The implication is that without socio-economic epidemiology, biomedical epidemiology could make a limited contribution to the reduction of morbidity. ...|$|E

The Triton X- 114 (TX- 114) detergent phase of U. parvum was found to induce NF-kB through TLR 2. The active components of the TX- 114 detergent phase were lipoproteins, such as multiple banded (MB) antigen, UU 012 and UU 016 of U. parvum. The activation of NF-kB by these lipoproteins was inhibited by dominant negative (DN) constructs of TLR 1 and DN TLR 6.

After screening, Guthrie cards with residual blood (whole spots or portions of spots) are typically stored at ambient temperature in many facilities. The potential of archived dried blood spots (DBS) for at-birth molecular studies in epidemiological and clinical research is substantial. However, it is also challenging as analytes from DBS may be degraded due to preparation and storage conditions. We previously reported an improved assay for obtaining global RNA gene expression from blood spots. Here, we evaluated sex-specific gene expression and its preservation in DBS using oligonucleotide microarray technology.

Ery and Tet resistance genes are usually carried by conjugative transposons (CTns) belonging to the Tn 916 family, but their presence and transferability among GBS strains have not been totally explored. Here we evaluated the presence of Tet resistance genes (tetM and tetO) and CTns among Ery-resistant (Ery-R) and Ery-susceptible (Ery-S) GBS strains isolated from human and bovine sources; and analyzed the ability for transferring resistance determinants between strains from both origins. Tet resistance and int-Tn genes were more common among Ery-R when compared to Ery-S isolates. Conjugative transfer of all resistance genes detected among the GBS strains included in this study (ermA, ermB, mef, tetM and tetO), in frequencies between 1. 10 - 7 and 9. 10 - 7, was possible from bovine donor strains to human recipient strain, but not the other way around. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of in vitro conjugation of Ery and Tet resistance genes among GBS strains recovered from different hosts...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: {{to study}} {{efficiency}} of various methods of prevention of perinatal complications in mother and child. Material and methods. In three risk groups preventive treatment of intrauterine infected fetus (IUIF), gestosis, noncarrying of pregnancy and fetoplacental insufficiency {{has been carried}} out. In group I consisted of 71 pregnant women preventive treatment has included medication with application of antioxidants; stimulators of processes of carboxylation in cycle Krebs; endogenic synthesis prostaglandins, prostacyclin; drugs improving processes of microcirculation, stabilizing function of endothelium ofvessels, an exchange of homocysteine. In group II consisted of 67 pregnant women prevention of IUIF and complications {{has been carried out}} by means of physical exercises in combination with aqua aerobics. In group III consisted of 100 women prevention of IUIF has been standard. In the control group IV consisted of 70 women pregnancy has not been complicated. Parameters of oxidant and antioxidant systems, central hemodynamics, determined in this group have been determined as normal for comparison. Results. In relation to group III medicamen-tous treatment in group I, regular aqua aerobics in group II have allowed to lower frequency of IUIF, perinatal mother complications, <b>perinatal</b> <b>diseases,</b> death rates in newborns and morbidity in children of early age. Conclusion. For the prevention of IUIF, mother and child perinatal complications, morbidity in children of early age it has been proposed to use medication and regular aqua aerobics which provides nonmedicamentous pregnancy cours...|$|E
40|$|Perinatal stroke is {{presented}} as the ideal human model of developmental neuroplasticity. The precise timing, mechanisms, and locations of specific <b>perinatal</b> stroke <b>diseases</b> provide common examples of well defined, focal, perinatal brain injuries. Motor disability (hemiparetic cerebral palsy) constitutes the primary adverse outcome and the focus of models explaining how motor systems develop in health and after early injury. Combining basic science animal work with human applied technology (functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation), a model of plastic motor development after perinatal stroke {{is presented}}. Potential central therapeutic targets are revealed. The means to measure and modulate these targets, including evidence-based rehabilitation therapies and noninvasive brain stimulation, are suggested. Implications for clinical trials and future directions are discussed...|$|R
50|$|As {{part of his}} campaign, Salimpour led other physicians, nurses, the California Medical Association to {{petition}} the California State Legislature and the California Health and Human Services Agency. After a two-year fight that included lobbying lawmakers and the filing of an anti-trust lawsuit, hospitals were made to allow neonatologists to see patients in hospitals that received state funding, regardless of exclusivity agreements. With this change, patients {{had the right to}} be seen by the physician of their choice, regardless of any attempt by a hospital to limit which physicians could practice at their facility. Salimpour's work as a business executive and entrepreneur in the field of medicine including the co-founding of two medical companies and co-ownership of one of San Diego's largest hospitals. He is the co-founder of CareNex Health Services, a health-care technology company that specializes in neonatal and <b>perinatal</b> <b>disease</b> management. The company was founded in 2005 along with his brother Pedram and was acquired by publicly traded WellPoint in 2013. The brothers also founded the physician-owned company Plymouth Health, formed specifically for the purpose of acquiring Alvarado Hospital Medical Center in San Diego, California. Prior to the purchase, the hospital was owned by Tenet Healthcare Corporation which was accused of paying kickbacks to physicians for referrals to the hospital. Tenet settled a civil complaint filed against them, which included a $21 million settlement and agreement to either close or sell the hospital. Salimpour and his company closed on the purchase in 2007, paying approximately $36.5 million for the hospital. He invested millions of dollars to upgrade the hospital's equipment and bring in some of the nation's top physicians. He made the decision to sell the hospital to Prime Healthcare in 2010.|$|R
