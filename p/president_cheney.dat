500|$|A {{separate}} controversy {{surrounds the}} use {{of water in the}} Upper Klamath Basin for irrigated agriculture, which was temporarily halted in 2001 to protect endangered salmon and lake fish during a severe drought. Vice President Dick Cheney personally intervened to ensure water to the agriculture industry rather than to environmental flow. In 2002, the federal government, under Interior Secretary Gale Norton, provided full water deliveries to irrigators as the drought continued; despite the fact that Klamath area tribes have treaty rights that predate the settlement of the farmers. Norton argued for a [...] "free market" [...] approach by allowing farmers to sell the water to the Native Americans downstream. That year, the Klamath River system had the largest fish die-off ever recorded. [...] The House Natural Resources Committee investigated Vice <b>President</b> <b>Cheney</b> for having released extra water to ranchers for possible political gain.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{authorized}} the CIA to use waterboarding {{and several other}} [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques" [...] that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture.

The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given {{to it in the}} Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn. While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert [...] "that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information", the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations [...] "provided critical information" [...] to preserve American lives. Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, [...] "you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough." ...|$|E

500|$|Cheney has {{publicly}} criticized President Obama since the 2008 presidential election. On December 29, 2009, {{four days after}} the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized Obama: [...] " [...] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe. [...] Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with {{what seems to be the}} goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of American society." [...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling that Vice <b>President</b> <b>Cheney</b> and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer." ...|$|E
