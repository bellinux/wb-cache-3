40|$|Several carapid fishes, {{known as}} <b>pearlfishes,</b> are endosymbiotic in holothuroids and asteroids. These {{echinoderms}} contain a strong concentration of saponins that are efficient membranolytic repellents to predators. We compared {{the effects of}} exposure to saponins from the sea cucumber body wall and from the Cuvierian tubules on the behavior and gill ultrastructure of <b>pearlfishes</b> and free-living fishes. Saponins were extracted from the body wall of two holothuroids, the Mediterranean Holothuria forskali and the tropical Bohadschia atra, and from the water surrounding the Cuvierian tubules of B. atra. Five species of carapids that live in symbiosis with holothuroids and seven species of free-living fishes were exposed to these extracts. The free-living fishes exhibited a stress response and died about 45 times faster than <b>pearlfishes</b> when exposed to the same quantity of saponins. Cuvierian tubules and saponins extracted from the body wall were lethal to the free-living fishes, whereas the carapids were much less sensitive. The carapids did not exhibit a stress response. The high toxicity shown by Cuvierian tubules was not explained {{by the nature of}} the saponins that were identified by mass spectrometry, but it is likely due to the higher concentration of saponins in the tubules. Histology and scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the gills of the free-living fishes and <b>pearlfishes</b> showed that saponins act at the level of the secondary lamellae where they induce the detachment of the epithelia, create edema at the level of the epithelia, and induce pores in the epithelial cells that lead to their destruction and the invasion of inner cells (pillar cells and red blood cells). This sequence of events happens 5 min after saponin exposure in free-living fishes and after 1 h in carapids. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Ophidiiformes is {{an order}} of ray-finned fish that {{includes}} the cusk-eels (family Ophidiidae), <b>pearlfishes</b> (family Carapidae), brotulas (family Bythitidae), and others. Members of this order have small heads and long slender bodies. They have either smooth scales or no scales, a long dorsal fin and an anal fin that typically runs into the caudal fin. They mostly come from the tropics and subtropics, and live in both freshwater and marine habitats, including abyssal depths. They have adopted a range of feeding methods and lifestyles, including parasitism. The majority are egg-laying, but some are viviparous.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of {{the habits}} of the adults, the larvae of <b>pearlfish</b> are {{free-living}} among the plankton. <b>Pearlfish</b> larvae can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} a long filament in front of their dorsal fins, sometimes with various appendages attached.|$|E

500|$|Abu Abdullah Muhammad Ibn Battuta was a Moroccan Berber {{scholar and}} jurisprudent from the Maliki Islamic law, {{and at times}} a Qadi or judge. He {{is best known as}} a {{traveler}} and explorer. He spent a few days as a guest of an Aryacakravarti in 1344 and wrote a detailed account of his encounter. According to him, the king controlled the economically important <b>pearlfishing</b> trade in the Palk Straights and had trading links with countries as far as Yemen. The monarch also spoke Persian and was located in the western coastal area of the island, in Puttalam region. He was also noted as receiving tribute of cinnamon from other southern rulers.|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{variations}} allow a lineage to {{move into}} new regions of the adaptive landscape. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse the life history of the <b>pearlfishes</b> (Carapinae) in a phylogenetic framework and particularly to highlight the evolution of parasite and commensal ways of life. Furthermore, we investigate the skull anatomy of parasites and commensals and discuss the developmental process that would explain the passage from one form to the other. The genus Carapus forms a paraphyletic grouping in contrast to the genus Encheliophis, which forms a monophyletic cluster. The combination of phylogenetic, morphologic and ontogenetic data clearly indicates that parasitic species derive from commensal species and do not constitute an iterative evolution from free-living forms. Although the head morphology of Carapus species differs completely from Encheliophis, C. homei is the sister group of the parasites. Interestingly, morphological characteristics allowing the establishment of the relation between Carapus homei and Encheliophis spp. concern the sound-producing mechanism, which can explain the diversification of the taxon but not the acquisition of the parasite morphotype. Carapus homei already has the sound-producing mechanism typically found in the parasite form but still has a commensal way of life and the corresponding head structure. Moreover, comparisons between the larval and adult Carapini highlight that the adult morphotype “ Encheliophis ” is obtained by going beyond the adult stage reached by Carapus. The entrance into the new adaptive landscape could have been realised by at least two processes: paedomorphosis and allometric repatterning...|$|R
