5000|$|Suppressive {{action taken}} during the South Canyon Fire, which was ignited by {{lightning}} in a fire exclusion zone on July 2, 1994, caused controversy after a blow-up killed 14 firefighters {{two days after the}} initial blaze. An interagency team was formed and issued their report in August. They cited several direct and contributory causes of the fatalities including fire behavior, <b>personnel</b> <b>profiles,</b> and incident management procedures. The South Canyon incident led to the first comprehensive review and update of federal wildland fire policy in decades. The report reiterated that the first priority of all federal wildland fire programs was firefighter and public safety. With regard to prescribed fires and prescribed natural fires, the report stated that, [...] "Wildland fire will be used to protect, maintain, and enhance resources and, as nearly as possible, be allowed to function in its natural ecological role." [...] In 1998, a new procedures guide used the term [...] "wildland fire use" [...] to describe what had previously been prescribed natural fires. By the end of the decade, a 1995 policy had reinvigorated “wildland fire use” programs and given managers the support they needed to enable the programs to continue to grow and mature.|$|E

40|$|The GENESIS {{project is}} {{developing}} an Open Source platform that supports co-operation and communication among software engineers belonging to distributed development teams involved in modeling, controlling, and measuring software development and maintenance processes. The GENESIS platform {{is made up}} of three main elements: a distributed workflow management system, a resource management system, and an artefact management system (OSCAR, developed at Durham). The platform is designed to be non-invasive and have a low barrier to entry (in terms of the effort required to begin using the system). This is accomplished, as far as possible, by adapting the platform to the workflow processes and tools already in place in an organisation. OSCAR (Open-Source Component Artefact Repository) is the artefact management system, used to store and retrieve any item produced by any member of a software engineering team. Traditional artefacts (documents and code, for example) as well as non-traditional items (such as informal annotations, mailing list postings, and <b>personnel</b> <b>profiles)</b> are managed by the system, which has the capability to maintain a rich set of relationships between the artefacts (for traceability and comprehension purposes). Each instance of OSCAR contains a software configuration management system (currently, a plugin is provided to use CVS). Currently, OSCAR is slightly distributed: the workflow management system can use more than one instance of a repository, but a single instance of OSCAR can use only one repository. There are a few known systems which provide some form of real distributed software configuration management, which, it is hoped, can be used to inspire further development of the distribution of OSCAR and its associated services. Initially, OSCAR {{and the rest of the}} GENESIS platform communicated using RMI, but a web service interface is currently under development. As an initial attempt at realising this, the RMI interface is simply wrapped to provide servlets. The web services approach allows for a single instance of an OSCAR repository to serve many projects, and for potential global distribution of a single instance of the GENESIS platform. Possible avenues for future work include: applications to e-learning and e-science (applying OSCAR to the Grid, in order to support educational and scientific collaboration); using OSCAR as a basis for supporting collaborative design work; instrumenting the tools in the GENESIS platform to provide data for studies of software engineering practices; and studying process models (for example, determining the difference between the ideal models defined in the literature and the real processes of software engineering) ...|$|E

The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if there was a relationship among elementary, middle school and secondary school teachers' perception of their levels of empowerment. Secondarily, the study sought to determine if there was a relationship between principal leadership styles and teachers' perception of empowerment, and do these principal behaviors provide for the empowerment of teachers. The final purpose was to determine if the modified empowerment instrument was valid and useful to seek data related to teacher empowerment. Perceived empowerment was measured in eight constructs: decision making, planning, team concept, sponsorship, evaluation and supervision, access to information, control of resources, and delegation. A 56 -item survey instrument was used to determine the amount of perceived empowerment of teachers within the state of Illinois. The instrument, developed by J. R. Polzin in 1990 was modified for this use without changing the high degree(s) of reliability. A total of 734 surveys were used for this study. The results indicated that teachers perceived empowerment in seven of the eight constructs routinely or often. The elementary teachers perceived the highest levels of empowerment. It was concluded that elementary principals were more collaborative in all eight of the empowerment constructs with faculty members than principals at the other two levels. Finally, it was found that a vast majority (77 %) of the principals studied in this research were perceived to be collaborative in their style of leadership. Collaborative principals routinely empower their faculty in seven of the empowerment constructs.

The target group for this study was all the employees who have been in the employment of the target organisation for one year and longer. This group was divided into subgroups of specialist transactors and specialist support <b>personnel.</b> The <b>profile</b> of these two subgroups included a variety of ages, gender, races and educational backgrounds. Data was collected using a questionnaire that was discussed with each employee who agreed to participate in the study. The study clearly illustrates that money can be the primary drive for motivation to certain employees within an investment bank. When one ranks what makes the two subgroups work, it is quite clear that the ability to earn a bonus and the ability to earn more money is highest on the list of specialist transactors, whereas the specialist support personnel enjoys the culture of the bank and has to get job satisfaction to make them work. These results reflect the motivational drives of the sample group at the time of this research. The study concludes that one of the primary motivational aspects for the subgroup of employees which was subject to the empirical study is that these employees are motivated by the mere fact that they can earn more money and a bigger bonus as well as obtaining job satisfaction and having the ability to make their own decisions. The study discussed Maslow’s and McClellands need theories as well as various other motivational theories and approaches employers can introduce to motivate employees. Maslow’s and McClelland’s need theories were directly related to the empirical study with the view whether these two motivational theories can be applied successfully within an investment bank. Based on the results of the empirical study, the researcher came to the conclusion that both these theories can be equally successfully applied to employees working in the target organisation. Dr. K.
