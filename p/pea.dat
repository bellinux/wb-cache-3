50|$|Pigeon <b>peas</b> {{are both}} a food crop (dried <b>peas,</b> flour, or green {{vegetable}} <b>peas)</b> and a forage/cover crop. In combination with cereals, pigeon <b>peas</b> make a well-balanced human food. The dried <b>peas</b> may be sprouted briefly, then cooked, for a flavor {{different from the}} green or dried <b>peas.</b> Sprouting also enhances the digestibility of dried pigeon <b>peas</b> via the reduction of indigestible sugars that would otherwise remain in the cooked dried <b>peas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Snap <b>peas</b> (Pisum sativum var. macrocarpon), {{also known}} as sugar snap <b>peas,</b> are a {{cultivar}} group of edible-podded <b>peas</b> that differ from snow <b>peas</b> in that their pods are round as opposed to flat. The name mangetout (French for [...] "eat all") can apply both to snap <b>peas</b> and snow <b>peas.</b>|$|R
50|$|In India, fresh <b>peas</b> {{are used}} in various dishes such as aloo matar (curried {{potatoes}} with <b>peas)</b> or matar paneer (paneer cheese with <b>peas),</b> though they can be substituted with frozen <b>peas</b> as well. <b>Peas</b> are also eaten raw, as they are sweet when fresh off the bush. Split <b>peas</b> are also used to make dhal, particularly in Guyana, and Trinidad, {{where there is a}} significant population of Indians.|$|R

5000|$|A variant (particularly popular around Bolton, Bury and Preston, Lancashire) is [...] "parched peas" [...] - carlin <b>peas</b> (also {{known as}} maple <b>peas,</b> or black <b>peas)</b> are soaked and then boiled slowly {{for a long}} time; the <b>peas</b> are {{traditionally}} served with vinegar.|$|R
50|$|Hoppin' John, {{also known}} as Carolina <b>Peas</b> and Rice is a <b>peas</b> and rice dish served in the Southern United States. It is made with black-eyed <b>peas</b> (or red cowpeas such as iron and clay <b>peas</b> in the Southeast US) and rice, chopped onion, sliced bacon, and {{seasoned}} with salt. Some people substitute ham hock, fatback, or country sausage for conventional bacon; additionally, a popular and healthy modern alternative to pork {{is the use of}} smoked turkey parts. A few use green peppers or vinegar and spices. Smaller than black-eyed <b>peas,</b> field <b>peas</b> are used in the Low Country of South Carolina and Georgia; black-eyed <b>peas</b> are the norm elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} called nutritionally {{important}} substances <b>peas</b> and their changes during processing.

5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the <b>pea</b> plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E
5|$|According to the Constitution and the <b>PEA,</b> {{there must}} be between three and six MPs in a GRC. The precise number of MPs in each GRC is {{declared}} by the President at the Cabinet's direction prior to a general election.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to find the plants {{resistant}} to Ascochyta pisi causing leaf and spot-pot of <b>peas</b> and field <b>peas.</b> Fourty five cultivars of <b>peas</b> and field <b>peas</b> and 6 breeding materials were tested in field in the period 1975 - 1978. Cultivars: Bartel, Birte, Borek, Cebeco, Finale and Paloma were to be less susceptible. In laboratory and greenhouse conditions <b>peas</b> and field <b>peas</b> cultivares were examined for susceptible to pathotypes 2 and 4 of Ascochyta pisi. The results obtained proved that cultivars: Borel, cebeco, Finale and Paloma were to be less susceptible to two pathotypes of Ascochyta pisi...|$|R
5000|$|Black-eyed <b>peas</b> — While these <b>peas</b> {{are almost}} never {{referred}} to as [...] "soup beans", the preparation in the Appalachian region is almost identical. Black-eyed <b>Peas,</b> sometimes called blackeye <b>peas,</b> are most common where Appalachian culture intersects with lowland soul-food and coastal food cultures. Like Hoppin' John, black-eyed <b>peas</b> became common as a new year's dish. However, since rice was {{not a part of}} mountain culture, the <b>peas</b> were cooked with pork (usually hog jowls) like soup beans and served with stewed tomatoes and collard greens. This dish becomes less common as you move into more isolated mountain communities.|$|R
50|$|Rice and <b>peas</b> or <b>peas</b> {{and rice}} is a {{traditional}} food in the African continent. It {{is a traditional}} dish from Ghana and it is known as Moros de guandules con coco (Moorish pigeon <b>peas</b> with coconut). The 'peas' are not garden <b>peas,</b> but beans, as beans {{are referred to as}} 'peas' in the Caribbean.|$|R
5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in <b>pea</b> plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then <b>pea</b> plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{studying}} root interactions in mixtures of small crops (eg. cereals and <b>peas</b> is discussed. The technique involve the measurements of root activity using lithium, a non-radioactive tracer {{and using a}} mixture of cereal and <b>peas</b> {{as an example of}} a mixed crop where the technique is applicable. Results of studies on root activity of cereals and <b>peas</b> by Tofinga, Tofinga and Snaydon and Tofinga were used in the discussion and to explain how the technique works. The total lithium uptake by cereals was tenfold that of <b>peas</b> and for both species, the uptake decreased with placement depth. Semi-leafless <b>peas</b> absorbed more lithium than leafy <b>peas,</b> by about sixteen times. Lithium uptake by <b>peas</b> was significantly more in monoculture compared with mixtures, in cereals...|$|R

5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a <b>pea</b> comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport <b>pea</b> combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it will be much happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E
