5|$|After {{receiving}} {{a letter from}} the Pony Express, informing her that the railroad will not be built, Erica rides into town, intending to have Cane kill Rose. Deputy Joshua Tate (Chris Alcaide) is killed when he confronts them. Cane goes after Polk, killing his wife when she shields him. Cane then shoots and kills Polk. Rose enters town and Erica aims at her, but Erica is shot by Cane before she can <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> Rose and Cane exchange fire. After he is shot, Cane asks if Rose loved him, and she replies that she did. Cane's wound is fatal, and Rose rides out of Oracle, declaring she will never come back.|$|E
5|$|His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach {{farmer in}} his home town of Gaffney who {{died at the age}} of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.|$|E
5|$|Mulder's own {{problems}} arise when {{his cell phone}} rings and Krycek disappears from his car. Mulder, after learning what Doggett has witnessed, believes that Crane gave Krycek access to the FBI. Suddenly, Krycek smashes through the car window with his prosthetic hand and crushes Mulder's cell phone. Krycek aims his gun at Mulder and tells him to get out. Krycek is about to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> when a bullet administered by Skinner pierces his arm. Krycek tries to pick his gun up again, but Skinner shoots his hand, rendering it useless. Krycek pushes his gun over and tells Skinner to shoot Mulder, telling him Mulder's life will grant him a thousand lives. Instead, Skinner raises his gun and shoots Krycek in the head. Doggett attempts to apprehend Rohrer and Crane but ends up being chased by the two. The pursuit {{ends up in the}} FBI garage and ends violently with Crane being run over and Rohrer crashing his car into the garage wall, going up in flames. Both men are presumed dead.|$|E
5000|$|Double Action. The GP100 may {{be fired}} by either cocking the hammer and {{subsequently}} <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> (a.k.a. Single Action), or by merely <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> when <b>the</b> hammer is not cocked.|$|R
25|$|Firing the {{revolver}} {{is accomplished by}} drawing the hammer to full cock and <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> <b>The</b> hammer must be manually cocked for each shot.|$|R

5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E
25|$|July 2010, A {{stand-off}} in Rothbury between British {{police and}} armed fugitive Raoul Moat ended after two tasers were discharged, possibly causing Moat to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> {{to end his}} own life. An inquest is ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the album}} was completed, but Rafferty could not {{interest}} any record companies and lost {{in the region of}} ₤30,000 on the project.

25|$|According to hitman-turned-informant Charles Crimaldi, {{one time}} DeStefano made his wife Anita take {{his gun and}} put {{the end of the}} barrel in her mouth, then demanded that she <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> When she pulled the trigger and the gun didn't go off, DeStefano began to laugh and told her that he had removed the bullets. He would tell this story over and over again to his mob {{associates}} for amusement.|$|E
25|$|Semi-automatic {{actions are}} similar in {{principle}} to machine gun actions, but only allow one shot per pull of the trigger. These actions provide the fastest operation, usually allowing a shot to be fired {{as fast as the}} shooter can <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> Since the action requires the energy created by the cartridge to operate the cyclic, there is less felt recoil, however, they may fail to cycle under extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|The quality {{gap between}} locally {{manufactured}} guns and European arms continued to widen as new rapid {{advances in technology}} and mass production in Europe quickly outstripped the pace of developments in Asia. Important developments were {{the invention of the}} flintlock musket and mass production of cast-iron cannon in Europe. The flintlock was much faster, more reliable and more user-friendly than the unwieldy matchlock, which required one hand to hold the barrel, and another to adjust the match and <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} an Escape section, {{the player}} {{needs to take}} a stance in a moral decision; one such decision involves one character being locked into a chair with a gun next to it and another character inside an incinerator. To stop the incinerator, the player needs to choose to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> which has a 50% possibility of firing a live bullet, killing the character in the chair. The way the decisions are made varies: some involve choosing between options, and some have the player input their own answer.|$|E
25|$|Attempting {{to replace}} Morales' bat, {{at least for}} the short term, the Angels nearly had a trade in place for Chicago Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee; however, even though the two parties agreed on the terms of the deal and were ready to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> Lee invoked his no-trade clause, and the deal was nixed. This move on Lee's part proved fatal for the Angels, as they never did find the right bat to replace Morales, ending the season with a record of 80–82, in third place and ten games behind the {{division}} champion (and eventually American League champion) Texas Rangers.|$|E
25|$|Afterward, Falcone calls Shank {{about an}} {{important}} hit: the deputy mayor {{is in town}} and he must be eliminated. By taking him out, the mob {{will be able to}} gain control. Shank and Falcone kill the deputy's final bodyguard, and are about to take the deputy out when Eva is taken hostage. Suddenly Shank is full of doubt, and is not able to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> Rudy (voiced by David Goldstein), Cesar's personal assistant, kills the deputy mayor, threatening to kill Eva since she's deemed as a nuisance. Shank quickly dives {{in front of her and}} kills him. Realizing they must flee, Eva and Shank drive off into the sunset. The player then hears the voice of Cesar who tells his assassins to find and kill them.|$|E

25|$|Nina soon revived {{her role}} as an assassin, {{the only thing that}} she {{recalled}} from her previous life. Two years later, she was contracted by a Mafia syndicate to kill a famous British boxer, Steve Fox. However, she discovered that Steve was in fact her biological son, who was born through In vitro fertilisation during her years in cryosleep, with her gene is being used for Doctor Abel's Hybrid Gene experiment on children, including Steve, until the experiment was cancelled when most of children died during that experiment, except Steve and one of the surviving children, whose statuses are covered by the former Zaibatsu now G Corporation researcher Emma Kliesen (Leo's mother) from being watched by the Zaibatsu's eyes. At the last moment when she tried to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> to her rifle, she somehow and rarely regained her human emotions, and refused to kill Fox. she abandoned her assassination attempt after detective Lei Wulong brought down the syndicate. After the collapse of her employers, Nina no longer required a viable reason to pursue her target. It was also revealed that she remained emotionally impassive about the discovery of her biological son, but the fact that she did not kill him when the chance presented itself shows otherwise for some.|$|E
25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is to rack the slide, clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|E
500|$|Ralph summons his shipmates (Sir Joseph's female {{relatives}} also arrive) {{and tells}} {{them that he}} is bent on suicide.

500|$|Police {{were unable}} to recover any {{fingerprints}} from the well-oiled grip of the pistol, and a paraffin test for gunshot residue was not performed on Danna or Sharon Kinne. Multiple people, including family and neighbors, told police that James had often allowed Danna to play with his guns, and in a test by investigating officers, Danna proved able to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> on a gun matching {{the one that had}} killed her father. With no evidence to the contrary, investigators ruled the case an accidental homicide. The pistol that killed James Kinne was taken into police custody and never returned to the widow, despite her efforts to reclaim it; she later had a male friend secretly buy her a [...]22 caliber automatic pistol. When the friend told her that he had registered the gun in her name, she requested that he re-register it under a name other than hers.|$|E
500|$|Kafka {{worked out}} for the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Oakland Raiders prior to the draft. Mike Mayock called Kafka the [...] "sleeper" [...] of the quarterback class, {{projecting}} him to be drafted in the sixth round. Mayock also said, [...] "He's a really smart kid. Has a better arm than people think. I don't even think he's sleeping anymore. He was a month-and-a-half ago, but he's on the rise. He's a kid who could surprise people {{at the end of}} the day." [...] Former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski concurred, saying that Kafka [...] "knows how to play the quarterback position. There's a real feel for hitting the open receiver, good anticipation. I can see him being one of those sleeper type guys." [...] A scout before the draft said that Kafka [...] "throws a lot of picks, but at least he's willing to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> You don't see that from a lot of young kids." ...|$|E
500|$|Thompson has {{heavily criticized}} {{a number of}} video games and campaigned against their {{producers}} and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as [...] "murder simulators" [...] to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games {{and a number of}} school massacres. According to Thompson, [...] "In every school shooting, we find that kids who <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> are video gamers." [...] Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, [...] "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing , one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, {{but when it comes to}} kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain." [...] Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as [...] "Pearl Harbor 2". According to Thompson, [...] "Many parents think that stores won’t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked." ...|$|E
