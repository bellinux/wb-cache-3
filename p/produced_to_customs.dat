50|$|The appellant, on a {{visit to}} India, was {{approached}} by a man named Desai, who offered to pay him £1,000 if, on his return to England, he would receive a suitcase which a courier would deliver to him containing packages of substance which the appellant was then to distribute according to instructions he would receive. The suitcase was duly delivered to him in Cambridge. On 30 November 1982, acting on instructions, the appellant went to Southall station to deliver a package of substance to a third party. Outside the station, he and the man he had met by appointment were arrested. A package containing a powdered substance was found in the appellant's shoulder bag. At the appellant's flat in Cambridge, he <b>produced</b> <b>to</b> <b>customs</b> officers the suitcase from which the lining had been ripped out and the remaining packages of the same powdered substance. In answer to questions by customs officers and in a long written statement the appellant made what amounted to a full confession of having played his part, as described, as recipient and distributor of illegally imported drugs. The appellant believed the drugs to be either heroin or cannabis.|$|E

50|$|These enzymes were {{identified}} in the 1990s as promising tools for genome engineering. However, even though they occur in nature and each one exhibits slight variations in its DNA recognition site, {{there is virtually no}} chance of finding the exact meganuclease required to act on a specific DNA sequence. Each new genome engineering target therefore requires an initial protein engineering stage <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a <b>custom</b> meganuclease.|$|R

40|$|The ability <b>to</b> prepare <b>custom</b> {{designed}} {{reports and}} convey your {{message in a}} clear and concise manner {{is very important in}} today’s sophisticated business environment. Easy to read clearly designed reports can enhance your organization’s credibility and reputation. Traditional use of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) in PC SAS ® <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>custom</b> designed reports is the result of widespread and popular use of Microsoft Excel. However with most business organizations transitioning to SAS ® Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), where DDE does not function, ODS Report Writing technology is a powerful alternative <b>to</b> create <b>custom</b> designed reports in SAS ® Enterprise Guide. The driving force for this topic was the need to create hospital level data discrepancy reports which compare California CABG Outcome Reporting Program (CCORP) clinical data, to OSHPD’s hospital administrative data, to verify risk factors used in a risk-adjusted operative mortality model. This model provides hospital and surgeon performance scores for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) in California.

40|$|The authors {{introduce}} a new approach for the mechanical setup of low-cost transceivers for 1 mm PMMA fibers. It utilizes a modular design <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>custom</b> specific devices suitable for PF-POF/PCS (plastic clad silica) or analog transmission even at small or moderate volume at low cost, comparable to lead-frame devices. A small batch of early prototype transceiver devices working at 655 nm has been built and measured. They {{have been designed to}} work with GI-PMMA-POF type fibers but also with standard SI-POF for short links up to 10 m. At present, a new electronic circuitry is in production, designed to fit in a just recently available package. Measurements with these devices regarding performance, lifetime and eye-safety are planned...|$|R
