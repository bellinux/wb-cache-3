Solid, undissolved particles in macrocorpuscular form, are "kneaded " into the mucosa during their {{passage through the}} digestive tract. These particles in the micrometer size range pass between the epithelial cells into the subepithelial layer. From here they are transmitted both by the lymph vessels and by the mesenteric veins into the circulation, where they remain for a considerable time. This phenomenon, termed <b>persorption,</b> was investigated in detail. Absorption In the physiology of digestion, the concept of absorption is taken to mean the uptake of a substance by the absorptive cells (enterocytes) of the intestine. This takes place by three mechanisms: diffusion is a passive process for the enterocyte, in which substances of lower molecular dimensions ( 250 mol) are carried through the enterocytes {{with the help of}} enzymes; cytopempsis (micropinocytosis) transports particles in the nanometer (nm) size range through the enterocytes. The transportation through the enterocytes is effected in small vesicles (plasma membrane vesiculation). Also small crystals and fibers of nanometer size can be incorporated by means of cytopempsis (Fig. 1). <b>Persorption</b> In addition to the process of absorption, however, macrocorpuscular particles, whose diameter is well within the micrometer (Arm) range, are regularly incorporated. This process has been observed in detail (1) under the heading <b>persorption</b> (Figs. 2 and 3) ...|$|E

40|$|For someone {{interested}} in the toxicology of iron, a statement in Volkheimer’s paper was an eye opener. To study the phenome-non of <b>persorption</b> (penetration of the intes-tinal mucosa by undigested particles) he fed carbonyl iron to dogs in a dose of 250 g (1). Was this a misprint? Had he intended 250 mg? No, he replied, not 250 mg. It is easy to feed 250 g to a dog; mix it with cream and the dog will eat it. Recall that standard 50 mg tablets of iron as ferrous sulfate produce symptoms in 10 % of normal hu-mans, and 6 to 12 tablets have killed young children. Volkheimer’s dogs had not been harmed. Carbonyl iron seemed worth inves...|$|E
40|$|Glycogen {{storage disease}} type I (GSD I) (McKusick 232200) {{is caused by}} {{inherited}} defects of the glucose- 6 -phosphatase complex. Patients with GSD Ia as well as patients with GSD Ib may suffer from intermittent diarrhoea, which seems to worsen with age. The cause of this diarrhoea is unknown. This study describes the results of investigations of intestinal functions and morphology in patients with GSD Ia and GSD Ib, which were performed to detect a common cause for chronic diarrhoea in GSD I. The following were investigated: faecal fat excretion, faecal alpha(1) -antitrypsin and faecal chymotrypsin, expiratory H- 2 concentrations, <b>persorption</b> of cornstarch in urine and colonic biopsies. With the investigations presented in this study, no common cause for diarrhoea in GSD I was found. In GSD Ib loss of mucosal barrier function due to inflammation, documented by increased faecal alpha(1) -antitrypsin excretion (3. 5 - 9. 6 mg/g dry faeces) and inflammation in the colonic biopsies, {{seems to be the}} main cause. The inflammation is most likely related to disturbed neutrophil function, which is often found in GSD Ib. Whether another cause is involved in GSD Ia and in GSD Ib, related to the disturbed function of glucose- 6 -phosphatase in the enterocyte, remains to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|Microcapsules {{are fast}} {{becoming}} {{the most successful}} delivery systems for the oral delivery of drugs and food additives. Since many drugs are proteins and are destroyed in acidic conditions, micro capsules offer protection against the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although the use of microcapsules achieves controlled release of the inner material, many synthetically designed microcapsules lack consistency in their size and morphology. The outer coat (exine) of plant pollen grains and spores is composed of the material sporopollenin. Sporopollenin exines (25 flm diameter) were extracted from Lycopodium clavatum and were investigated as a novel drug delivery system that was inexpensive, non-toxic, from a renewable source, and exhibited a large internal cavity for loading of hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances. They showed many advantages over conventional microcapsules, including their constant chemical structure and size within a species, {{and their ability to}} offer UV and air-oxidation protection. Previous studies have shown that particles such as pollen, spores and starch migrate into the bloodstream following ingestion by a process termed 'Persorption' Such findings intrigued many researchers but the phenomenon has not been unanimously accepted'". This research is a body of evidence giving unequivocal confirmation that spores of Lycopodium clavatum and their emptied exines were absorbed into the bloodstream of man to the same extent following oral ingestion, with a maximum of 10 % (± 2 %) of the dose recovered just 15 - 30 minutes after ingestion. These findings resolve the debate between researchers in support of <b>persorption</b> 3, 7, 8 and those against?", whom doubted the transport of particles of micron size into the bloodstream, but did not disprove such a phenomenon. An extensive study was undertaken to investigate the effect of factors such as gender, age, quantity and the method of ingestion on the rate and extent of exine absorption into the bloodstream. In a preliminary in vivo experiment the successful delivery of fish oil into the bloodstream via sporopollenin exines was illustrated. A major breakthrough has formed the foundations of this research. Although sporopollenin exhibits incredible stability to organic and inorganic solvents", in contrast, this research has shown that exines degrade very rapidly in blood plasma both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro experiments were conducted in an attempt to characterise the specific mechanism responsible for exine degradation. Progression of work has provided much evidence that the conversion of plasminogen to the enzyme plasmin is either partially or wholly responsible for the characteristic degradation of sporopollenin in the blood. Further investigations showed {{that it was possible to}} load a sufficient quantity of substances into sporopollenin exines, such as human growth hormone (hGH), Enfurvitide (an antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of AIDS) and Cyclosporine (an antifungal agent). Their successful release from exines into different media in vitro and in vivo (carried out in Beagle dogs) was shown. These in vivo experiments highlighted the need for extra protection of the drug from the GI tract and additional coatings were applied to sporopollenin exines, including a soluble form of sporopollenin. Exines with coatings were assessed to ensure they were still able to degrade in blood and release the encapsulated substance. Current results are highly indicative that sporopollenin could become a practicable oral delivery system for molecules that are otherwise problematic to administer, such as protein drugs that degrade rapidly in acidic conditions.
