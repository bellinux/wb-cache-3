5|$|A {{survey in}} 2005 of 88 {{paediatric}} neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after {{three or more}} drugs had failed; 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort; 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases; and 16% had never prescribed the diet. There are several <b>possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> this gap between evidence and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} <b>possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> the high {{mortality}} {{rate of the}} 1918 influenza pandemic. Some {{research suggests that the}} specific variant of the virus had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E

5|$|There are two <b>possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> the {{evolution}} of this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources. This divergence may have arisen {{because of a lack}} of competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems. The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract a mate. In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia. It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} <b>possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> the bat; {{one is that}} bats are simply quite common in the area.

As he conquered the city, the bat was added to the arms.|$|E

There are two <b>possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> the positive role of A. curassavica on the monarch caterpillar: that it promotes overall monarch health to boost the monarch's immune system; or that chemicals from the plant have a direct negative effect on the parasites.|$|E

25|$|The {{more time}} that has elapsed {{since the last}} civil war, the less {{likely it is that}} a {{conflict}} will recur. The study had two <b>possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> this: one opportunity-based and the other grievance-based. The elapsed time may represent the depreciation of whatever capital the rebellion was fought over and thus increase the opportunity cost of restarting the conflict. Alternatively, elapsed time may represent the gradual process of healing of old hatreds. The study found that the presence of a diaspora substantially reduced the positive effect of time, as the funding from diasporas offsets the depreciation of rebellion-specific capital.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, a variety of <b>possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> flying saucers have been put forward. One {{of the most common}} states that most photos of saucers were hoaxes; cylindrical metal objects such as pie tins, hubcaps and dustbin lids were easy to obtain, and the poor focus seen in UFO images makes the true scale of the object difficult to ascertain. However, some photos and movies were deemed authentic after intensive study. An example was the saucer-like object photographed by farmer Paul Trent near Portland, Oregon in 1950, which passed all tests when studied by the Condon Committee in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> the G-spot were {{examined}} by Masters and Johnson, {{who were the}} first researchers to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. In addition to observing {{that the majority of}} their female subjects could only have clitoral orgasms, they found that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response. On this basis, they argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood; their notion that this provides the clitoris with sufficient sexual stimulation has been criticized by researchers such as Elisabeth Lloyd.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{unemployment}} in Muslim countries {{seems to be}} high for women and economic opportunities are limited. <b>Possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> this phenomenon could the same determinants of high self-employment among females and low rates of female employers: low levels of economic development, gendered employment social norms, or capital-intensive industry. This last explanation may be particularly salient in the oil-rich Muslim nations because petroleum exports are capital-intensive and require very high skilled labor which most Muslim women are incapable of providing given low levels of education. The Great Recession has increased unemployment across the board in many Muslim nations and female workers were not left unaffected. According to the World Bank, in 2009, 22.9% of women were unemployed in Egypt.|$|E
