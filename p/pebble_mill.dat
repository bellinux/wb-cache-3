40|$|Concrete is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used building material in our time. For every person on earth, more than one cubic meter of concrete is produced every year. Cement is the main feedstock for the production of concrete. Cement makes up about 15 % of the mass of concrete. The consumption of concrete will grow in the coming decennia [2]. Beside these developments, there is another issue going on, the issue of recycling concrete - from demolition of buildings or from construction materials(C&DW). Therefore it is worthwhile to examine these material streams. The major part of the demolition waste is now used for the construction of new roads. The objective of this thesis is to recycle the cement, by the means of liberation and separation. The focus of the investigation will be on (<b>pebble)</b> <b>milling.</b> By performing milling experiments, XRF analysis and the determination of the particle sizes more insight is gained in the milling and liberation of cement (calcium). During the milling experiments, variables like speed of the mill, size of the pebbles, fill rate of the feed and temperatures were varied to investigate the influence of these variables. To back up the results some ESEM images were taken and a TGA in combination with mass spectrometry was performed. The main actions performed during the experiments are summarised in a flow sheet. Most of the results were as one would expect. But still some of the XRF analysis and TGA analyses have unexpected results. The milling experiments showed that <b>pebble</b> <b>milling</b> does cause size reduction of the concrete fines. It also showed that heating of the material is not worthwhile. The performed experiments provide a good basis for further research. From this thesis it can be concluded that <b>milling</b> with bigger <b>pebbles</b> (16 - 64 mm) and great mill speed, improve the milling efficiency.

5000|$|Until {{recently}} flint {{was also}} an important raw material in clay-based ceramic bodies produced in the UK. In preparation for use flint pebbles, frequently sourced from the coasts of South-East England or Western France, were calcined to around 1,000 °C.

After calcination the flint <b>pebbles</b> were <b>milled</b> to a fine particle size. However, the use of flint has now been superseded by quartz.

40|$|Los Bronces is an {{open pit}} mine located on a large {{porphyry}} copper-molybdenum deposit near Santiago, Chile. Annual production is around 240 000 tonnes of copper and 2 700 tonnes of molybdenum. The extracted ore has a relatively low average copper grade of around 0. 6 %. This results in relatively high processing costs and creates the need to search for solutions to reduce the costs for ore processing at Los Bronces. Sorting by sensor technology may be a solution to decrease these processing costs. Sensor based sorting is a technique where singular particles are mechanically separated on certain physical properties after determining these properties by a sensor or detector. Sensor based sorting is of relatively low cost compared to other concentration methods. It is an evolving technology that is reaching the requirements for implementation in ore processing operations. However, sensor based sorting is completely dependant on an appropriate sensor that allows distinguishing between sub-economic and economic ore material. The applicability of a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor was investigated {{on a set of}} 150 <b>mill</b> <b>pebbles</b> from the Los Bronces processing plant to asses the feasibility of sensor based sorting. The NIR spectroscopic sensor allows characterisation of the reflected electromagnetic radiation from solids along the NIR wavelength regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (350 - 2500 nm). Mainly due to the vibrational effects of certain molecule bonds in these solids, absorption bands of lower reflected radiation are present around characteristic wavelength locations. These absorption bands can therefore be diagnostic for certain mineral presences in a solid. Copper minerals do not cause any characteristic absorption bands in the NIR region. Various hydrothermal alteration minerals that are associated with the formation of porphyry copper systems on the other hand do. These minerals include muscovite, illite, chlorite, tourmaline and kaolinite. Assessing the applicability of NIR spectroscopy for sensor based sorting of the Los Bronces <b>mill</b> <b>pebbles</b> was therefore focused on finding a relation between the copper grade and these alteration minerals. From general geological models it is known that copper mineralisation can be associated with certain zones of hydrothermal alteration. However, in practice the alteration zones and copper mineralisation usually form very complex systems due to several periods of intrusion, brecciation and overprinting of the pre-existing hydrothermal alterations. The test work showed that no direct correlation between the copper grade and a NIR spectral characteristic was present. However, it did prove to be possible to classify the <b>mill</b> <b>pebbles</b> based on the NIR spectral response and mineralogy determined from petrography and x-ray diffraction. This resulted in several groups of pebbles that proved to be identifiable by NIR spectroscopy and contained different average copper grades. One group of low grade pebbles was particularly interesting. This group contains 30 % of all pebble samples with an average copper grade of 0. 29 %. This group can be easily identified with NIR spectroscopy by a high depth ratio between the 1900 and 2200 nm absorption feature and presence of an absorption feature around 2350 nm. These spectral features are caused by a low crystallinity of mica minerals and presence of chlorite respectively. It was shown that it is technically feasible to make some discrimination on the copper grade of the Los Bronces <b>mill</b> <b>pebbles</b> by the response from a NIR spectroscopic sensor. However, because the discrimination possibilities are limited to only one group of pebbles, a detailed economical analysis still has to prove the economical feasibility of NIR spectroscopy as a sensor sorting application for the Los Bronces <b>mill</b> <b>pebbles.</b> A preliminary economical analysis already showed that the economical feasibility is mainly dependant on the copper price and the processing costs of the ore.

40|$|In {{the current}} energy-sensitive world, {{sustainable}} {{development in the}} mineral industry will require new, better and more efficient processes. Novel comminution methods, which offer the prospect of achieving the required outcomes of size reduction and mineral liberation at lower energy consumption, are continually being sought. In the past five years, extensive research using high voltage pulse electrical comminution technology {{has been carried out}} at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC), in collaboration with seiFrag AG. The major outcome of this research is the development of the concept of pre-weakening ore particles by electrical comminution procedures to reduce the energy consumption in the downstream grinding circuit. The research has also verified the preferential liberation of valuable minerals by electrical comminution. Given the advantages, several potential applications of electrical comminution in the mineral industry are proposed, including AG/SAG <b>mill</b> feed pre-weakening, <b>pebble</b> treatment, ball <b>mill</b> feed pre-weakening, early recovery of the liberated valuable minerals, crack/micro crack generation for improved leaching, and smelter slag treatment.

40|$|Grinding mills {{are large}} {{rotating}} cylindrical steel vessels used to grind ore and minerals into finer particles. The mills are {{important parts of}} the mineral enrichment process and the grinding is the last step of the comminution process, where the particle size is reduced {{by a combination of}} abrasion and impact. The rotation of the mill under loaded conditions can result in fatigue cracks. Fatigue cracks and associated failures have been identified as a major problem in mineral processing plants. The cracks lead to unpredicted and unplanned production stoppages for inspections and for repair and replacement of the cracked mill parts. This leads to increasing costs due to production loss, additional man-hours and spare parts. The purpose of the research presented in this licentiate thesis was to calculate the structural strains, stresses, displacements, etc. in grinding mills in operation, to prevent overloading, to calculate crack propagation speeds and critical crack lengths, and to develop new improved mills that would withstand the current loading. This research has also aimed to propose, develop and test methods for the detection and monitoring of fatigue cracks in mills during operation, in order to facilitate optimal maintenance decision-making based on current crack sizes. The performed research is a case study of the secondary <b>pebble</b> <b>mills</b> of LKAB, a mining company in northern Sweden. The mills are situated inside dressing plants KA 1 and KA 2 in Kiruna. To achieve the goals, a number of crack detection and monitoring methods were investigated and evaluated as to their ability to find and monitor fatigue cracks on the running mills. Measurements with wireless strain measurement equipment, infrared thermography and crack propagation sensors were performed on the mills in operation. A finite element model of a mill was developed to calculate the strains and stresses in the mill at any position in the mill and for any loading condition. A variety of spatial discretizations, boundary conditions, material properties and loading alternatives were considered to simulate the behaviour of the real mill in the best possible way. To calculate the loading on the mills in operation, a mathematical model and computer software were developed to calculate the charge configuration, as well as the loading and the magnitude and distribution of the forces acting on the mill in operation. Using the finite element model and the computer software, the global displacement field of the entire mill structure was calculated using quasi-static loading for different inputs of the charge and process parameters. To verify the finite element results, the measured strain ranges for one complete rotation of the mill were compared with the corresponding calculated ones. The numerical results were also verified with logged process data, such as bearing reaction forces. One conclusion, based on the comparisons, is that the developed finite element model and the developed software tools can be considered useful for engineering applications. The developed software tools, together with the finite element model, make it possible to calculate the global displacement field of the entire mill structure for any situation. This is achieved by inputting the desired process data and charge parameters into the software, calculating the loads and force distributions, exporting them to the finite element model, and running the simulation. From the global displacement field, strains, stresses, reaction forces, displacements, etc. can be calculated with standard routines for any position in the mill. The performed research work gives {{a deeper understanding of the}} field of structural analysis and load calculation of grinding mills in operation. The complexity of modelling the behaviour of mills in operation is high. Consequently, it is difficult to obtain accurate estimations of crack propagation speeds and critical crack sizes based on the calculated stresses. It has been found that strain measurements, with strain gauges attached to the mill mandrel, can be used to detect and monitor larger circumferential cracks near the flanges in the mill in operation, since the measured strain ranges increase with the crack size. It has further been found that infrared thermography can be used as a method to indicate cracks without stopping the mill, as the increased thermal gradient around the cracks can be detected by a special type of thermal instrument. Crack propagation sensors have proven to be ideal for high-precision online monitoring of the crack propagation of smaller cracks at the corners of the manholes in the mill. Finally, it has been found that strain measurement is a useful method not only to verify finite element results and to detect and monitor cracks, but also to prevent overloading of the mill and to estimate charge features such as the filling level, the charge shape and the position of the charge circumferentially inside the mill during operation.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIComminution, {{particularly}} milling, is {{on average}} the largest consumer {{of energy in}} mining. Actual comminution circuits consist {{in most of the}} cases in coarse crushing, SAG <b>milling,</b> <b>pebble</b> crushing and secondary ball milling. In these circuits the SAG mill is the largest energy consumer. In many engineering projects either a power equation and/or a specific energy equation are used for the designing of these mills but not always with acceptable results. In general these equations are used to predict power consumption as a function of mill size, level and density of the internal charge and % of critical speed. Almost none of these equations (with the notable exception of the Morrell's model) consider explicitly the effect that the feed particle size has on the mill performance, particularly on the power and on the specific energy consumption of the mill. To address this fact new models are developed in this work able to predict power or specific energy consumption, including the usual design variables, but adding a variable that represents the feed size distribution. Operational data from 4 grinding circuits corresponding to 3 Chilean copper concentration plants are used and the % - 6 '' + 1 '' (- 152 + 25 mm) is selected as independent variable. The results indicate that both models are able to estimate the required variables for all data sets. In the first model (power equation) the average error obtained was 3. 7 % and in the second model (specific energy) the average error was 6. 8 %. These models would be useful for performance optimisation of the test case mills and should be fitted (parameters values) again for other mills...|$|R

Ten tons of SAG mill feed {{with a top}} particle size 150 mm were tested with two pilot scale SELFRAG machines installed in Switzerland. A simulation study using JKSimMet software was carried out to find where the high voltage pulses preweakening technique can be best applied in a gold-copper ore comminution circuit, based on the data of the pilot scale SELFRAG tests. A novel comminution circuit was designed, which incorporated SELFRAG to pre-condition part of SAG mill feed (9. 5 to 150 mm) and to treat the circulating SAG <b>mill</b> <b>pebbles.</b> The high voltage pulse technology effectively reduced the amount of 2 ̆ 7 critical size 2 ̆ 7 particles in the SAG mill and pre-weakened particle strength for grinding.
