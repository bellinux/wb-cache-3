5|$|Although {{the level}} of {{allocation}} <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> output for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industrial activities decreases at 1.3% per year from 2013, as production may increase, allocations may also increase over time.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, the area {{enclosed}} by the curve shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> time, {{independent of the}} curve.

5|$|Allocations {{will be made}} to firms who {{undertake}} {{activities that}} are deemed to be both 'trade-exposed' and 'emissions-intensive'. Moderately emissions intensive activities will receive allocations equal to 60% of the industry average for the financial years ending 2007, 2008 and 2009. Highly emissions intensive industries will receive allocations equal to 90% of the industry average for this period. Allocation <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> output will decrease by 1.3% per year from 2013 (on an exponential basis rather than a summation basis).|$|E
5|$|Nearly all mammals are {{endothermic}} ("warm-blooded"). Most mammals {{also have}} hair {{to help keep}} them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy {{is not unique to}} mammals.|$|E

5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of wind power {{when compared to the}} {{environmental impact}}s of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. According to the IPCC, in assessments of the life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources, wind turbines have a median value of between 12 and 11 (geq/kWh) depending on whether off- or onshore turbines are being assessed. Compared with other low carbon power sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> electrical energy generated.|$|E
5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} is {{the amount}} of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E

5|$|In its time, Dunston B Power Station ranked {{consistently}} in England's leading stations, both {{in terms}} of thermal efficiency and cost <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> electricity. However, the station eventually became outdated, and notification of its partial closure was given in October 1975, with some units being closed the following October. It was then only used as a stand-by station, operating only at peak electrical demand times. Finally, after some units having been in operation for about 40years, the station ceased to generate electricity on 26 October 1981. At the time of closure, only 98MW of the station's capacity was in use.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E
5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (<b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E
5|$|The station {{would have}} had an {{efficiency}} of 46%, which in comparison to conventional subcritical coal-fired power stations, equates {{to a reduction in}} carbon dioxide (CO2) of 23% <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> electricity generated. The station would have utilised pollution abatement and gas cleaning systems, including selective catalytic reduction, to remove nitrogen oxide, and Flue-gas desulphurisation, to remove sulphur dioxide. The station would also have been able to allow the installation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, when it becomes technically and commercially viable. There was also a possibility that the station may have co-fired biomass, and cogenerated heat as a combined heat and power plant.|$|E
5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above {{the cost of}} new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Compared {{with blood}} plasma, rete testis fluid (RTF) from rams {{was found to}} contain a higher {{concentration}} <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> volume <b>of</b> the enzymes {{that occur in the}} sperm acrosome and in the kinoplasmic droplet, but the levels of these enzymes could be reduced by high-speed centrifugation. Other enzymes present in blood plasma were also found in RTF but at a lower concentration <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> volume. Because <b>of</b> the low concentration of protein in RTF, however, the activity of most <b>of</b> these enzymes <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> weight <b>of</b> protein was higher in RTF than in blood plasma. The concentrations of these enzymes and the total protein concentrations were only slightly reduced by high speed centrifugation. There was no appreciable concentration of the X-isoenzyme of lactic dehydrogenase in RTF and the activity <b>of</b> most enzymes <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> weight <b>of</b> protein was less in RTF than in the testis. Epididymal plasma and RTF from rams and boars were found to contain appreciable concentrations of an inhibitor of trypsin and the activity <b>of</b> the inhibitor <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> weight <b>of</b> protein was comparable with the activity in seminal plasma...|$|R
