40|$|One of {{the goals}} of NASA's Advanced Life Support Program (ALS) for {{sustaining}} human life in space is to achieve a closed system in plant production and usage. That all inedible plant parts should be recycled or used in some way. A Tuskegee University team researching sweetpotato and peanut for ALS has developed paper products from dried sweet-potato stems and peanut shells. In this study, the sweet-potato stems and peanut shells were soaked separately in water for 48 hours. After 48 hours, researchers manually separated the pulp and the unusable parts. To form the paper, 160 g of pulp and water mixture was poured through a 15. 1 cm (diameter) filtration funnel and the pulp was trapped on 15 cm (diameter) filter paper. The filter <b>paper</b> and pulp <b>were</b> dried in an air oven, and the filter <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> removed, An examination under a scanning electron microscope showed that the sweet-potato <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> "fibers", whereas the peanut shell <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> "blocks".

The PDEs can be defined by continuous, not necessarily smooth expressions, and the solutions obtained cab be assimilated with usual measurable functions, or even with Hausdorff continuous ones. The respective result sets aside completely, and with a large nonlinear margin, the celebrated 1957 impossibility of Hans Lewy regarding the nonexistence of solution in distributions of large classes of linear smooth coefficient PDEs. 1.

First, pure crystalline nanopowders of Cu 2 O and ZnO were synthesized {{by a simple}} soft-chemistry method. These powders were then inserted {{on top of each}} other into a graphite die to prepare a junction of the two oxides. The SPS technique allows to obtain a nanoceramic with high densification for a very short time of heat treatment under high pressure. The oxide phases remain well fitted and separated after SPS treatment, while a limited region of grain growth is observed on the ZnO side at the oxide interface probably due to an electrical potential in the SPS apparatus. Finally, the solar energy conversion into electricity was tested with success on this system, showing that this method can be used to prepare photovoltaic devices.|$|R
