25|$|Supported by the United States, Magsaysay {{was elected}} {{president}} in 1953 on a populist platform. He promised sweeping economic reform, and made progress in land reform by promoting the resettlement of <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the Catholic north into traditionally Muslim areas. Though this relieved population pressure in the north, it heightened religious hostilities. Nevertheless, he was extremely popular with the common people, and his death in an airplane crash in March 1957 dealt a serious blow to national morale.|$|E

25|$|Health {{security}} – Health Security aims {{to guarantee}} a minimum protection from diseases and unhealthy lifestyles. In developing countries, the major causes of death traditionally were infectious and parasitic diseases, whereas in industrialized countries, the major killers were diseases of the circulatory system. Today, lifestyle-related chronic diseases are leading killers worldwide, with 80 percent of deaths from chronic diseases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. According to the United Nations, in both developing and industrial countries, threats to health security are usually greater for <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> rural areas, particularly children. This is due to malnutrition and insufficient access to health services, clean water and other basic necessities.|$|E

25|$|Buruli ulcer {{commonly}} affects <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> remote {{rural areas}} with {{limited access to}} health care. The disease can affect all age groups, although {{children under the age}} of 15 years (range 2–14 years) are predominantly affected. There are no sex differences in the distribution of cases among children. Among adults, some studies have reported higher rates among women than males (Debacker et al. accepted for publication). No racial or socio-economic group is exempt from the disease. Most ulcers occur on the extremities; lesions on the lower extremities are almost twice as common as those on the upper extremities. Ulcers on the head and trunk accounted for less than 8% of cases in one large series.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, {{she gave}} up all her possessions, lived among the {{multitude}} of <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> downtown Toronto and established Friendship House with its soup kitchen. She gave food to them when she had none for herself – and offered Catholic education and fellowship, too. Ironically, she was tagged as a communist sympathizer and, beleaguered by her own organization, Friendship House was forced to close in 1936. Catherine then went to Europe and spent a year investigating Catholic Action. On her return, she established the Friendship House at 34 West 135th Street in Harlem in 1937. The interracial charity center, in addition to distributing goods to the poor, conducted lectures and discussions to promote racial understanding.|$|E
25|$|There were no <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> {{the land}} of Oz, {{because there was no}} such thing as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E

25|$|Their initial {{goal was}} to {{instigate}} a revolution against the rise of neoliberalism throughout Mexico, but as this did not happen, they used their uprising as a platform to call the world's attention to their movement to protest the signing of NAFTA, which the EZLN believed would increase the {{gap between rich and}} <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Chiapas—a prediction affirmed by subsequent developments. Gaining attention on a global level through their convention called the Intercontinental Encounter for Humanity and Against Neoliberalism that was attended by 3,000 activists worldwide, the Zapatistas were able to help initiate a united platform for other anti-neoliberal groups. This did not detract from the Zapatistas' national activism efforts, but rather expanded their already existent ideologies. The EZLN also called for greater democratization of the Mexican government, which had been controlled by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (Institutional Revolutionary Party, also known as PRI) for 65 years, and for land reform mandated by the 1917 Constitution of Mexico but largely ignored by the PRI. The EZLN did not demand independence from Mexico, but rather autonomy in the forms of land access and use of natural resources normally extracted from Chiapas, as well as protection from despotic violence and political inclusion of Chiapas' indigenous communities.|$|E
