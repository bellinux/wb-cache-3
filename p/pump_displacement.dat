To {{solve the}} problem of piston {{striking}} cylinder and pumping insufficiency, an optimization method of concrete open-loop <b>pumping</b> <b>displacement</b> control is derived and presented. In order to control piston stroke effectively, the optimization model of concrete open-loop <b>pumping</b> <b>displacement</b> control parameters is built based on considering the system’s open-loop characteristics.

40|$|A novel type of an axial, piston-driven high {{pressure}} hydraulic pump with variable capacity marks {{a significant improvement}} {{in the area of}} the hydraulic machinery design. Total discharge from hydrostatic forces eliminates a need for a servomechanism, thus simplifying operation, reducing weight and introducing the possibility of the <b>pump</b> <b>displacement</b> control by computer. PWK-type pumps, invented in the Gdansk University of Technology, offer high efficiency for pressure levels up to 55 MPa, ability to work self sucking even at high speed.

The main focus {{of this study is}} to predict the effect of the size of the pipeline on the cross flow injection process. A test-rig was designed, built and equipped with three different pipelines, 1 ½", ¾" and ½" diameters. Comparison was made under constant line pressure of 40 -bar and line flow rate of 5 liter/min, with a fixed injection pump rotational speed of 100 rpm. The main parameter tested was the injection dose capacity at different pump displacements. Cross flow mixing process is also theoretically studied using 3 D-CFD analysis to show the injection cross flow behavior for the same geometry and parameters used for experimental test. Results show that increasing the size of the pipeline increases injection pump doses ability. This effect is insignificant at lower injection pump displacements, while the effect of the size of the pipeline becomes dominant when increasing the displacement. By changing the size of the pipeline from ½" to 1 ½" diameter injection pump dose capacity increases by 3. 24 % at 100 % <b>pump</b> <b>displacement.</b> Selecting larger pipe sizes for injection ports is recommended whenever possible...|$|E

40|$|This project {{developed}} the inlet metering system. An inlet metering system represents a new option in hydraulic pump design. Traditional pressure controlled hydraulic pumps rely on either swashplate displacement (for variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps)</b> or bleed off valves (for fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps).</b> Variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> require mechanically complex parts which are expensive to machine {{and prone to}} break down. Bleed off valves represent a significant loss in system efficiency. In contrast, the inlet metering system is able {{to make use of}} a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> (which is relatively inexpensive and mechanically robust) and a two-way spool valve. This dissertation goes through the process of designing the valve and pump dimensions, presents a theoretical dynamic analysis, studies the control law associated with this pump, and examines the energy requirements associated with inlet metering system operation. A prototype of the design was constructed and experimental data was used to validate the efficiency analysis. The major finding associated with this work was that the inlet metering system can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the inlet metering system is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures. Additionally {{it was found that the}} inlet metering system is more efficient than using a bleed off valve, but less efficient than using a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether an in-line filter {{inserted in the}} syringe pump infusion line assembly influences start-up times and flow irregularities during vertical <b>pump</b> <b>displacement</b> at low infusion rates. METHODS: Fluid delivery after syringe pump start-up and after vertical displacement of the syringe pump by - 50 cm was determined gravimetrically at flow rates of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 ml h(- 1). Measurements were repeated for each flow rate four times with two different syringe pumps with and without an in-line filter incorporated. Data are shown as median and range. RESULTS: Start-up times were reduced by an in-line filter at 0. 5 ml h(- 1) flow rate from 355. 5 s (0 - 660) to 115 s (0 - 320), whereas the effect was attenuated at higher flow rates. Pooling of fluid into the infusion system after lowering the infusion syringe pump was halved in all flow rates tested. Amount of infusion bolus after elevating the syringe pump by 50 cm was not affected by an in-line filter. CONCLUSION: In the evaluated model in-line filters help to reduce flow irregularities and delay in drug delivery of syringe pumps at low flow rates and represent an option to optimize continuous administration of highly concentrated short-acting drugs at very small infusion rates...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Nearly all tractor PTO {{arrangements}} {{used today}} {{consist of a}} rotating mechanical shaft with two or more universal joints. This arrangement {{continues to be an}} entanglement hazard. By driving the attachment with fluid power, this hazard could be eliminated. This project included the design, development, and testing of an experimental tractor based on a John Deere 4040. The entire power train was treated as a single computer-controlled system where both the PTO output and the wheels were driven by fluid power. To support direct laboratory and in-field comparison of hydraulic and mechanical scenarios, the original transmissions were left intact and functional. Results showed that at low power demand, the hydraulic system was more efficient than the mechanical equivalent; however, the mechanical version was more efficient over most of the load range and was capable of higher power output. The use of computer control helped to minimize fuel consumption by matching engine speed to loading conditions while maintaining operating speeds by varying hydraulic <b>pump</b> <b>displacement.</b> The hydraulic PTO system for the JD 4040 has the potential to match or increase fuel efficiency compared to its mechanical counterpart for loads up to about 40 % of rated mechanical PTO output.
