One of these lies in the practice of some men applying Gopi Chandanam, an yellow <b>pigment</b> <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>origin</b> similar in appearance to that obtained from sandalwood, on the forehead, instead of Vibhuthi. However, others like Appayya Dikshitar's family applied only Vibhuti, being staunch devotees of Shiva.

Archaeological surveys and excavations led on Fabrika Hill, on the north-east acropolis of the ancient city of Hellenistic and Roman Paphos revealed the existence of important Hellenistic quarries, water supplies and houses of the same period.

40|$|The {{selection}} of power generation systems is important when striving {{for a more}} sustainable society. However, the results of environmental, economic and social sustainability assessments are subject to {{new insights into the}} calculation methods and to changing needs, economic conditions and societal preferences. Researchers active in the field of exergy and sustainability claim that exergy losses and sustainability are related. The Total Cumulative Exergy Loss method and the exergy replacement costs <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> are used to assess and compare power generation systems that make use of fossil and renewable energy carriers. These power generation systems are the following: an ultrasupercritical coal power plant, a power plant that co-fires coal and biomass, a wind farm, and a combined cycle power plant that uses bioethanol originating from the fermentation of verge grass. Furthermore, environmental, economic and social sustainability assessment methods are applied to assess the four power generation systems as well. On the basis {{of the results of the}} assessments, it is concluded that the wind farm system is preferred from the environmental, social and exergetic sustainability points of view, but not from the economic sustainability viewpoint. The advantage of the exergetic sustainability assessment method is that its results are not influenced by choices like whether verge grass should be considered a waste product or not. The influence of the exergy replacement costs on the results of the exergetic assessment is small, because less than 5 per cent of the exergy input of the systems during construction, operation and commission is <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>origin.</b> When looking at the infrastructural part of the systems only, the influence of the exergy replacement costs is larger because about 25 to 40 per cent of the exergy input is <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>origin.</b> accepted authors manuscriptEnergy & IndustryPetroleum Engineerin...|$|R

Heating {{did not affect}} dust micromorphology and crystallinity, except for limited sintering and decreased surface area of CRIS- 1300. Thermal treatments deeply affected surface properties. Electron paramagnetic resonance showed surface radicals progressively annealed by heating, mostly disappearing at {{greater than or equal}} to 800 degrees C. Surface hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, evaluated with water vapor adsorption, still showed some hydrophilic patches in CRIS- 800, but CRIS- 1300 was fully hydrophobic. Heating modified the biological activity of cristobalite. Cytotoxicity, tested on proliferating cells of the mouse monocyte macrophage cell line J 774, showed that CRIS was cytotoxic and CRIS- 800 was still cytotoxic, but CRIS- 1300 was substantially inert. Cytotoxicity of CRIS to the rat lung alveolar epithelial cell line, AE 6, as measured by colony forming efficiency, was greatly reduced for CRIS- 800 and eliminated for CRIS- 1300. The rate of lactate dehydrogenase release by rat alveolar macrophages was lowered for CRIS- 800, and release was completely inactivated for CRIS- 1300. The absence of surface radicals and the onset of hydrophobicity may both account for the loss of cytotoxicity upon heating. Differences observed between CRIS- 800 and CRIS- 1300, both fully deprived of surface radicals, indicate that hydrophobicity is at least one of the surface properties determining the cytotoxic potential of a dust...|$|R

The maximum density of compaction of these materials increased in the sequence bentonite < slate processing fines < quartz sand, while the moisture corresponding to the maximum density (critical water content) followed the inverse order. The addition of increasing rates of compost (about 3 %, 7 % and 14 % dry weight) resulted in general in flatter compaction curves and reduced maximum bulk density. The highest rate of compost reduced the maximum density of the quartz sand from 1. 88 to 1. 33 Mg m− 3, from 1. 54 to 1. 22 Mg m− 3 for the slate processing fines, and from 1. 16 to 1. 00 Mg m− 3 for the bentonite.
