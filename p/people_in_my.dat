500|$|Following the 2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent bank bailouts, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Capuano berated the bank CEOs for their practices, saying at one point: [...] "You {{come to us}} today on your bicycles after buying Girl Scout cookies and helping out Mother Teresa and telling us, 'We're sorry, we didn't mean it, we won't do it again, trust us.' Well, I have some <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> constituency that actually robbed some of your banks {{and they say the}} same thing." [...] Capuano's speech was included in the 2010 documentary film Inside Job, described by director Charles H.

500|$|Comedian Richard Jeni {{performed}} a popular stand-up routine {{based on the}} film. During his routine, Jeni suggested that {{the title of the}} film should have been [...] "Here's a Fish, You're Stupid" [...] instead of the official title (Jaws 4: The Revenge) and called the film itself, [...] "A movie so stupid... You couldn't be stupid enough to enjoy it". Jeni also poked fun at several moments in the film, including Ellen's decision to leave Long Island and go to The Bahamas ("You with me here? An ideal place to avoid a fish [...] " [...] and [...] "Wouldn't an apartment building be sufficient protection?"), her affair with Hoagie right after three of her family members had been killed by the shark ("Ghee whizz, three <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> family have been eaten by a shark in one week... GEEZ AM I HORNY!") and how the shark reached The Bahamas before Ellen & Hoagie ("They land; there he [...] is, couple of beers, Ray-Bans.").|$|E
500|$|Silence is {{considered}} a [...] "passion project" [...] of Scorsese's {{and has been in}} development since 1990, two years after the release of Scorsese's most controversial film, The Last Temptation of Christ, which also carried strongly religious themes. Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more... Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E

500|$|Sheen {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with English actress Kate Beckinsale from 1995 until 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995, and began living together shortly afterwards. Their daughter, Lily Mo Beckinsale-Sheen, was born in 1999 in London, England. The actress has said she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] that Sheen never proposed, but {{felt as if she were}} married. Their relationship ended in January 2003, soon after the couple moved to Los Angeles from London. Beckinsale had persuaded director Len Wiseman to cast Sheen in Underworld; but while on set, she and Wiseman fell in love, and subsequently married in 2004. Sheen has said he continues to live in Los Angeles to be close to his daughter. He remains friends with Beckinsale. [...] "We were very lucky in that we didn't have an acrimonious split," [...] Beckinsale has said. [...] "We are still very close and [...] sees us around each other." [...] "He's absolutely one of my most favourite people ever." [...] "I love him dearly—I would miss him dreadfully if he wasn't in my life." [...] Sheen has said that Beckinsale [...] "will always be one of the most important <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. I have real love for her." ...|$|E
500|$|In Argentine society, Messi is {{generally}} held in lesser esteem than Maradona, {{a consequence of}} not only his uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi {{is in some ways}} the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, although through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt—he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays—have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi has said: [...] "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> country happy." [...] In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they haven't been given their salaries for six months. He has stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.|$|E
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [...] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is." ...|$|E

Paul Martin, who had succeeded Chrétien as Prime Minister, asked her to use more tact and discretion when sharing her opinions about such subjects but stopped short of asking her to apologize.

Bryant offered to buy another property from the Martins at Palmers Lookout Road, but they declined the offer. Bryant apparently believed the Martins had deliberately bought the property to hurt his family and believed this event {{to be responsible for}} the depression that led to his father's suicide, which in turn led to their own murders.
