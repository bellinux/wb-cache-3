50|$|Ping-pong {{recording}} (also called <b>ping-ponging,</b> bouncing tracks, or reduction mixing) is {{a method}} of sound recording.

50|$|After {{the success}} of Jim Copp Tales, Copp and Brown engaged in a {{laborious}} routine of annually self-producing albums and releasing them on their own label Playhouse Records. A record's creation began with Copp sitting at home writing songs and stories, while Ed Brown worked on the jacket design at his own house. Copp and Brown would record all of the sound effects, speeches, songs, and stories in segments, often in multiple takes until satisfied with the results. Copp recorded instruments in different rooms at his parents' house: voices were taped in the kitchen, the piano in the living room, the celeste in a bedroom, the pump organ in the bathroom, and sound effects in the bathtub. The entire recording was done with one microphone and three monaural Ampex tape recorders, with which Copp devised his own overdubbing technique by <b>ping-ponging</b> between the tape decks to build up layers of sound. This recording method allowed the duo to create whole classrooms and housefuls of different voices—as many as 90 on a single track.|$|E

Michael Madden of Consequence of Sound named it one of the album's best tracks saying, [...] "The most ambitious moment on Oxymoron, is the six-minute “Break the Bank”. Produced by The Alchemist, who hasn’t had a better, higher-profile showing this decade, it’s all inchworm piano runs and vinyl crackle, taking the 'If you ain’t talking money...' cliché to new heights. The song starts as an ode to the promises of wealth. ... It’s a wildly drunk-sounding song, but it’s all sober thinking." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said, [...] "ScHoolboy Q's lock-step rhyme schemes and <b>ping-ponging</b> intensity -- every time you think he's about to fly off the handle, he dials his energy back down and powers up for another peak.

5000|$|Painting With {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on 36 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Rolling Stones Jon Dolan called it [...] "weirdly addictive and enjoyably absurd". Marc Hogan of Spin praised the album for its [...] "richness" [...] in his review, stating, [...] "It’s poppier, in a characteristically warped way, than even Merriweather, the group's most popular album to date. That’s {{down to the}} record’s rarely wavering energy; subtle details abound in the interplay between Lennox and Portner’s near-indistinguishably overlapping yawps, or in the giddy, <b>ping-ponging</b> sonic backdrops, but that’s all a bonus when the songs bounce along like Tigger in a 5 Hour Energy ad." [...] Jamie Atkins of Record Collector compared the album's sound to the soundtrack of the 1992 video game Sonic the Hedgehog 2, [...] "the band sounding like a motley crew of Deadheads and club kids stuck between the Mystic Cave and Oil Ocean zones, in constant fear of Dr Robotnik's frankly unreasonable temper and whichever drill or submarine he might pilot next."

30|$|In {{order to}} improve {{convergence}} time, such situations should be avoided. An extra threshold is introduced, which will allow the direction to be switched only if performance degrades with more than x% compared to the previous value. In the following, this x% increase will {{be referred to as}} Performance Degradation Percentage (PDP). By tolerating worse performance, needless switching of optimization direction due to isolated incidents is avoided. Also, this will mean that, in the same amount of time, the enhanced WPHPO (EWPHPO) will be able to derive a more suitable HOP, since valuable changes will not be wasted by <b>ping-ponging</b> between two HOPs.|$|E
30|$|When stating in {{an extreme}} HOP (such as (10 dBm, 5120 ms) or (0 dB, 0 ms)), the {{diagonal}} approach performs {{significantly better than}} the zigzag. This is because in this approach, both Hysteresis and TTT are changed in each step; thus, the performance variance between two consecutive HOPs is more significant, and the chances for <b>ping-ponging</b> between two of them will decrease. In these cases, the WPHPO improves performance in {{a short amount of}} time. The exception here is the (10 dB, 5, 120 ms) with zigzag case, where the algorithm does not manage to converge in the given time frame (if more time were allocated, this approach too would improve performance; see Figure 4 (a) in the next section), because of repeated changes between the same HOPs. This would be the exact situation which the PDP would help avoid.|$|E
40|$|For cost reasons, {{the usage}} of SDRAM is {{preferred}} in HDTV SoC. However, accessing SDRAM is a complex task, especially when the same SDRAM is shared by various functional modules with different bandwidth requirements and requirements for responding speeds. For two-way cable networked HDTV SoC especially when the network data throughput is very high, the performance of SDRAM controller is very important. This paper describes a high-performance AMBA interfaced SDRAM controller design that exploits SDRAM features and uses popular IC designing techniques such as the buffering technology, <b>ping-ponging</b> between buffers and adopts bank-closing control as well. Simulation results under a realistic application demonstrate a significant decrease of total execution time of the program used in our experiments.

40|$|Objectives. (1) To {{develop a}} {{probability}} trade-off technique (PTOT) {{for determining the}} minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of warfarin therapy from the patients' perspective; (2) to estimate the MCID for the efficacy of warfarin to prevent stroke {{in the treatment of}} nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) from the perspective of patients with this disease and who have experienced a course of warfarin therapy; (3) to assess two different methods of eliciting the patients' MCID. The two elicitation methods were: (1) <b>ping-ponging</b> (PP), in which the hypothetical efficacy of warfarin to prevent stroke was varied from one extreme to the other until the patients' MCID was determined; and (2) starting at known efficacy (SKE), in which the hypothetical efficacy was started at a midpoint value and then incrementally increased or decreased until the patients' MCID was determined. Conclusions. The MCID for this group of patients was much smaller than the known efficacy of warfarin to prevent stroke in patients with NVAF. The PTOT, using the flipchart approach, was well accepted and appeared to improve their knowledge of their disease, and its consequences and treatment. The method of elicitation used to determine the patients' MCIDs can have a clinically important effect on their responses. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Low input-referred offset {{performance}} and linearity in analog filters are critical design parameters, yet transistor mismatch limitations are a severe hindrance. Programmability {{is also a}} feature of growing significance because high performance state-of-the-art systems must adapt on-the-fly to various operating conditions, {{as is the case}} in battery-operated electronics where systems traverse through idle, alert, and high performance modes in an effort to conserve energy and extend battery life. This paper presents a continuous and programmable first-order – filter with sub-millivolt offset performance. Low offset is achieved by auto-zeroing and continuity by <b>ping-ponging</b> between two transconductors, all under the construct of a compact and bandwidth-efficient circuit topology. The proposed – circuit was fabricated with AMI’s 0. 5 - m CMOS process technology and achieved an input-referred offset of less than 210 V, hand-over glitches of less than 40 mV, and 57 dB of linearity over the rail-to-rail input span for a lithium-ion battery supply range of 3 to 4. 2 V. The bandwidth and gain of the filter were programmable from 1. 1 to 6. 5 kHz and 1. 27 to 29. 1 V/V, respectively, both with better than 3. 2 % resolution. Index Terms—Auto-zero (AZ), current sensing, – filter, linearity, low offset, ping pong, programmable, rail-to-rail. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Efficient {{contention}} {{management is}} the key to achieving scalable performance for multithreaded applications running on multicore systems. However, contention management policies provided by modern operating systems increase context-switches and lead to performance degradation for multithreaded applications under high loads. Moreover, this problem is exacerbated by the interaction between contention management policies and OS scheduling polices. Time Share (TS) is the default scheduling policy in a modern OS such as OpenSolaris and with TS policy, priorities of threads change very frequently for balancing load and providing fairness in scheduling. Due to the frequent <b>ping-ponging</b> of priorities, threads of an application are often preempted by the threads of the same application. This increases the frequency of involuntary context-switches as wells as lock-holder thread preemptions and leads to poor performance. This problem becomes very serious under high loads. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we present a scheduling policy called Faithful Scheduling (FF), which dramatically reduces context-switches as well as lock-holder thread preemptions. We implemented FF on a 24 -core Dell PowerEdge R 905 server running OpenSolaris. 2009. 06 and evaluated it using 22 programs including the TATP database application, SPECjbb 2005, programs from PARSEC, SPEC OMP, and some microbenchmarks. The experimental results show that FF policy achieves high performance for both lightly and heavily loaded systems. Moreover it does not require any changes to the application source code or the OS kernel. Keywords-Scheduling; priorities; contention; contextswitches I...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{infections are}} a common cause of disease, {{particularly}} in colonized persons. Recently, a series of published articles have reported that community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains are evolving and increasingly becoming prevalent in households while health care acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) is declining in the USA. The changing superbugs have often been used {{as an example of}} evolution in action. Although MRSA infections have become increasingly reported in the community, population-based studies of students preparing for the health professions having S. aureus and MRSA colonization are lacking. During the 2014 – 2015 school year 544 students were tested for MRSA carriage at Liberty University. A subset of the students, classified as having clinical exposure, had a 20 %+ MRSA carriage rate which is 5 – 10 times the national average. We have seen a changing profile from HA-MRSA to CA-MRSA. This is potentially dangerous because the new strains are more virulent and aggressive. CA-MRSA is somewhat difficult to define—but these bacteria are mostly associated with their genetic and antibiotic profile (i. e. Cipro resistance), toxin genes, and place of acquisition. There are genetic variations of S. aureus strains among students of tightly knit groups: households, dorms, and other close living quarters. The bacteria are <b>ping-ponging</b> around among students, changing as they go. Since the majority {{of the students in the}} nursing and biology courses are looking to pursue a career in medicine, this sampling was beneficial to inform students, researchers, medical workers, and others if they are S. aureus and MRSA carriers, so they can take preventative measures to reduce the risk of infection...|$|E
