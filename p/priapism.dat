5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} <b>priapism.</b> The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male <b>priapism</b> as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral <b>priapism,</b> in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral <b>priapism,</b> in one case, and clitoral <b>priapism</b> can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral <b>priapism,</b> has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases.|$|E
5|$|Persistent genital arousal {{disorder}} (PGAD) {{results in}} a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable genital arousal in women, with or without orgasm, unrelated to any feelings of sexual desire. Clitoral <b>priapism,</b> also known as clitorism, is a rare, potentially painful medical condition and is sometimes described as an aspect of PGAD, in which the erect clitoris does not return to its relaxed state for an unusually {{extended period of time}} (ranging from minutes to days), despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation; PGAD can also be associated with morphometric and vascular modifications of the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is <b>priapism,</b> an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; {{after a number of}} hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and <b>priapism</b> (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died within hours of a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E
25|$|The medical {{condition}} <b>priapism</b> derives {{its name from}} Priapus, alluding to the god's permanently engorged penis.|$|E
25|$|Male-specific: {{spontaneous}} erections, nocturnal emissions, <b>priapism,</b> erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia (mostly {{only with}} aromatizable and hence estrogenic AAS), oligospermia/azoospermia, testicular atrophy, intratesticular leiomyosarcoma, prostate hypertrophy, prostate cancer.|$|E

25|$|One {{possibly}} serious, but rare, {{side effect}} with vardenafil is heart attack. Also, in rare cases, vardenafil use may cause <b>priapism,</b> {{a very painful}} emergency condition that can cause impotence if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} rare, but dramatic, {{side effect}} associated with trazodone is <b>priapism,</b> {{likely due to}} its antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors. More than 200 cases have been reported, and the manufacturer estimated {{that the incidence of}} any abnormal erectile function is about one in 6,000 male patients treated with trazodone. The risk for this side effect appears to be greatest during the first month of treatment at low dosages (i.e. <150mg/day). Early recognition of any abnormal erectile function is important, including prolonged or inappropriate erections, and should prompt discontinuation of trazodone treatment. Clinical reports have also described trazodone-associated psychosexual side effects in women, including increased libido, <b>priapism</b> of the clitoris, and spontaneous orgasms.|$|E
25|$|The common, adverse drug {{reactions}} (side effects) are {{the same}} as with other PDE5 inhibitors. The frequent vardenafil-specific side-effect is nausea; the infrequent side effects are abdominal pain, back pain, photosensitivity, abnormal vision, eye pain, facial edema, hypotension, palpitation, tachycardia, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, itch, and <b>priapism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{medication}} that {{is effective in}} roughly 85% of men is called intracavernous pharmacotherapy and involves injecting a vasodilator drug directly into the penis in order to stimulate an erection. This method has {{an increased risk of}} <b>priapism</b> if used in conjunction with other treatments, and localized pain.|$|E
25|$|She helped Hrut take {{possession}} of an inheritance by arranging {{the death of a}} man named Soti at the hands of her servant, Augmund and her son Gudrod. When Hrut returned home, Gunnhild gave him many presents, but she cursed Hrut with <b>priapism</b> to ruin his marriage to Unn, daughter of Mord Fiddle; the two ultimately divorced.|$|E
25|$|<b>Priapism</b> is {{a painful}} {{erection}} that occurs {{for several hours}} and occurs {{in the absence of}} sexual stimulation. This condition develops when blood gets trapped in the penis and is unable to drain out. If the condition is not promptly treated, it can lead to severe scarring and permanent loss of erectile function. The disorder occurs in young men and children. Individuals with sickle-cell disease and those who abuse certain medications can often develop this disorder.|$|E
25|$|Priapus' iconic {{attribute}} was his <b>priapism</b> (permanently erect penis); {{he probably}} absorbed some pre-existing ithyphallic deities as his cult developed. He was represented {{in a variety}} of ways, most commonly as a misshapen gnome-like figure with an enormous erect phallus. Statues of Priapus were common in ancient Greece and Rome, standing in gardens or at doorways and crossroads. To propitiate Priapus, the traveler would stroke the statue's penis as he passed by. The Athenians often conflated Priapus with Hermes, the god of boundaries, and depicted a hybrid deity with a winged helmet, sandals, and huge erection.|$|E
500|$|Lilly Icos {{hired the}} Grey Worldwide Agency in New York, {{part of the}} Grey Global Group, to run the Cialis {{advertising}} campaign. Cialis advertisements were described as being gentler, warmer and with a more relaxed feel than those of its rivals, to reflect the longer duration of the drug. (Tadalafil has a half-life of 17.5 hours, compared to 3.5 for sildenafil and 4.5 for vardenafil.) Iconic themes in Cialis advertisements include couples in bathtubs and the slogan [...] "When the moment is right, will you be ready?" [...] Cialis advertisements were unique among those of ED drugs in that they went beyond describing ED and mentioning the drug's benefits. As a result, Cialis advertisements were also the first to describe side effects, as the FDA requires advertisements {{in support of a}} specific brand name to mention side effects; ads for Levitra and Viagra did not mention the brand name of the drug, therefore circumventing this FDA requirement. One of the first advertisements for Cialis aired during the 2004 Super Bowl; Lilly Icos paid more than $4million for the one-minute ad. Just weeks before the game, the FDA required more possible side effects, including <b>priapism,</b> to be listed in the advertisement. Although many parents objected to the ad being aired during the Super Bowl, Janet Jackson's halftime [...] "wardrobe malfunction" [...] overshadowed Cialis. In January2006, a physician was added to the advertisements to describe side effects on-screen, and Icos began running advertisements only where more than 90percent of the audience was made up of adults, effectively ending Super Bowl advertisements. In 2004, Lilly Icos, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline spent a combined $373.1million to advertise Cialis, Viagra, and Levitra respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudoephedrine is {{also used}} as a {{first-line}} prophylactic for recurrent <b>priapism.</b> [...] Erection is largely a parasympathetic response, so the sympathetic action of pseudoephedrine may serve to relieve this condition. Treatment for urinary incontinence is an off-label use ("unlabeled use") for these medications.|$|E
2500|$|In Greek mythology, Priapus ( [...] ; , Priapos) {{was a minor}} rustic {{fertility}} god, {{protector of}} livestock, fruit plants, gardens and male [...] genitalia. Priapus is marked by his oversized, permanent erection, which {{gave rise to the}} medical term <b>priapism.</b> He became a popular figure in Roman erotic art and Latin literature, and is the subject of the often humorously obscene collection of verse called the Priapeia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Priapism</b> is a {{condition}} in which a penis remains erect for hours in the absence of stimulation or after stimulation has ended. There are three types: ischemic (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic (intermittent). Most cases are ischemic. Ischemic <b>priapism</b> is generally painful while nonischemic <b>priapism</b> is not. In ischemic <b>priapism</b> most of the penis is hard; however, the glans penis is not. In nonischemic <b>priapism</b> the entire penis is only somewhat hard.|$|E
50|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} <b>priapism.</b> The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male <b>priapism</b> as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral <b>priapism,</b> in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral <b>priapism,</b> in one case, and clitoral <b>priapism</b> can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
50|$|<b>Priapism</b> {{may also}} be {{associated}} with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, which leads to decreased NADPH levels. NADPH is a co-factor involved {{in the formation of}} nitric oxide, which may result in <b>priapism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Phenylephrine {{is used by}} urologists {{to abort}} <b>priapism.</b> It is diluted with normal saline and {{injected}} directly into the corpora cavernosa. The mechanism of action is to cause constriction of the blood vessels entering into the penis, thus causing decreased blood flow and relieving the <b>priapism.</b> An injection is given every 3-5 minutes. If <b>priapism</b> is not resolved in 1 hour, another form of therapy is considered.|$|E
50|$|Sickle cell {{disease is}} {{the most common cause of}} ischemic <b>priapism.</b> Other causes include {{medications}} such as antipsychotics, SSRIs, and blood thinners, as well as drugs such as cocaine and cannabis. Nonischemic <b>priapism</b> may occur following trauma to the penis or a spinal cord injury. Ischemic <b>priapism</b> occurs when blood does not adequately drain from the penis. Nonischemic <b>priapism</b> is typically due to a connection forming between an artery and the corpus cavernosum or disruption of the parasympathetic nervous system resulting in increased arterial flow. Diagnosis may be supported by blood gas analysis of blood aspirated from the penis or ultrasound.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the type. Ischemic <b>priapism</b> is {{typically}} treated with a nerve block of the penis followed by aspiration of blood from the corpus cavernosum. If this is not sufficient the corpus cavernosum may be irrigated with cold normal saline or injected with phenylephrine. Nonischemic <b>priapism</b> is often treated with cold packs and compression. Surgery may be done if usual measures are not effective. In ischemic <b>priapism</b> the risk of permanent scarring of the penis begins to increase after 4 hours and definitely occurs after 48 hours. <b>Priapism</b> occurs in about 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 males per year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Priapism</b> is {{a painful}} {{condition}} in which the penis does not return to its flaccid state, {{despite the absence of}} both physical and psychological stimulation. <b>Priapism</b> lasting over four hours is a medical emergency.|$|E
50|$|Sickle cell disease often {{presents}} {{special treatment}} obstacles. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy {{has also been}} used with success in some patients. <b>Priapism</b> is also found to occur in extreme cases of rabies. <b>Priapism</b> also occurs due to encephalitic rabies.|$|E
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} has {{been attributed to}} pressure on the cerebellum created by the noose. Spinal cord injuries are known to be associated with <b>priapism.</b> Injuries to the cerebellum or spinal cord are often associated with <b>priapism</b> in living patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Priapism</b> {{can also}} be caused by {{reactions}} to medications. The most common medications that cause <b>priapism</b> are intra-cavernous injections for treatment of erectile dysfunction (papaverine, alprostadil). Other groups reported are antihypertensives, antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, clozapine), antidepressants (most notably trazodone), anti-convulsant and mood stabilizer drugs such as sodium valproate, anticoagulants, cantharides (Spanish Fly) and recreational drugs (alcohol, heroin and cocaine). <b>Priapism</b> is also known to occur from bites of the Brazilian wandering spider and the black widow spider.|$|E
50|$|<b>Priapism</b> may be {{associated}} with haematological disorders, especially sickle-cell disease, sickle-cell trait, and other conditions such as leukemia, thalassemia, and Fabry's disease, and neurologic disorders such as spinal cord lesions and spinal cord trauma (<b>priapism</b> has been reported in people who have been hanged; see death erection).|$|E
5000|$|Some sources give a {{duration}} of four hours as {{a definition of}} <b>priapism,</b> but others give six: [...] "The {{duration of}} a normal erection before it is classifiable as <b>priapism</b> is still controversial. Ongoing penile erections for more than 6 hours can be classified as priapism." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} in men: impotence, <b>priapism,</b> delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, decreased libido ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{name comes}} from the Greek god Priapus (Πρίαπος), a {{fertility}} god often represented with a disproportionately large and permanent erection. <b>Priapism</b> in females (continued, painful erection of the clitoris) is known as clitoral <b>priapism</b> or clitorism. Relentless, persistent or continuous erections that lack any complications are {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "permaboner" [...] in slang terms.|$|E
50|$|Being a Urologist by Profession, he {{developed}} the Winter Shunting to treat <b>Priapism.</b>|$|E
50|$|The medical {{condition}} <b>priapism</b> derives {{its name from}} Priapus, alluding to the god's permanently engorged penis.|$|E
5000|$|Because ischemic <b>priapism</b> {{causes the}} blood {{to remain in}} the penis for unusually long periods of time, the blood becomes {{deprived}} of oxygen and can cause damage to the penile tissue itself. Should the penile tissue become damaged, it can result in erectile dysfunction or disfigurement of the penis. [...] In extreme cases, if the penis develops severe vascular disease, the <b>priapism</b> can result in penile gangrene.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{physicians}} use {{the term}} persistent sexual arousal syndrome {{to refer to the}} condition in women; others consider the syndrome of <b>priapism</b> in men to be the same disorder. <b>Priapism</b> was a recognized, diagnosable medical condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, whereas PGAD was not. With the release of the DSM-5 in 2013, PGAD was again not included as a listed condition.|$|E
