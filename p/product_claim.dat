However, adult dermatology patients members of Saint Nicholas Catholic Church or/and patients at MedStar Clinic in Houston, Texas, have not been of interest for any study so far. The purpose of this quantitative study was to assess the relationship between <b>product</b> <b>claim,</b> help-seeking, types, and purposes of medical dermatology services used amongst males and females aged at least 18 years. Prospect theory (PT) was the theoretical framework used to analyze the purpose of this study. A cross-sectional survey approach permitted to collect primary data from 120 participants who were members of Saint Nicholas Catholic Church or/and patients at MedStar Clinic. The results, based on a forced entry multiple regression analysis at 95 % confidence interval, indicated that <b>product</b> <b>claim</b> and help-seeking significantly explained (p â?¤. 05) the variances of certain types and purposes of medical dermatology services used.

40|$|The {{advertising}} {{of prescription}} drugs aimed directlyat the public is prohibited in most countries, in-cluding Canada. However, a shift in interpretation of the policy governing this marketing strategy, known as direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), has occurred in Canada, resulting in its partial introduction without public and parliamentary debate. 1 Consultations on the potential introduction of DTCA have been held by Health Canada since 1996, {{but there has been}} little interest in allowing DTCA from health professional and consumer organiza-tions or provincial governments. 2 Despite this, some forms of advertising {{of prescription drugs}} to consumers have be-come widespread. It is important for clinicians to be aware of how DTCA has developed in Canada, its current status and potential outcomes for health care.

40|$|Atypical food {{packaging}} draws {{attention in the}} retail environment, and therefore increases product sal- ience. However, until now, no {{research has focused on}} how atypical packaging affects the persuasive impact of other food information. In the present study, we propose that atypical packaging enhances pro- cessing of product information, affecting <b>product</b> <b>claim</b> recall and product evaluation in turn. Specifically, we argue that atypical packaging may have detrimental consequences for the evaluation of food products that are presented with so-called weak product claims. Participants (N = 102) were presented with an online shopping environment, showing a food product with either a typical or an atypical package, and product claims that were either weak or strong. Results showed that atypical shaped packaging design enhanced cognitive processing, which in turn decreased the persuasive impact of weak claims on willingness to pay, and increased the persuasive impact of strong product claims on quality judgment. Furthermore, product knowledge improved when packaging design was atypical, through increased processing...|$|E

40|$|This {{guidance}} document {{is a response}} to an internationally recognized need for additional instruction on the development of rules specific to a category of products for making claims based on a life cycle assessment (LCA). The purpose is to supplement existing standards for LCA-based claims that require the development of product category rules (PCRs) or their equivalents. The aim is that PCRs can be developed in a consistent manner and used to support claims based on multiple standards. The scope of the Guidance is global. The Guidance embodies the efforts of individuals with expertise in LCA and LCA-based product claims from more over 40 organizations in 13 countries and regions under the name of The Product Category Rule Guidance Development Initiative. The Initiative received no financial support from any standard or other <b>product</b> <b>claim</b> program and this Guidance reflects no bias toward any particular standard or program. The Guidance is intended to be a living document and we hope that it will continue to improve as the application of product claims based on LCA expands and diversifies. JRC.

40|$|The Cue Utilization Theory {{establishes}} {{that all}} products {{are made of}} multiples cues that {{may be seen as}} surrogates for the intangible attributes that make up any given product. However, the results of many years of research have yet yielded little consensus as to the impact generated by the use of such cues. This research aims to contribute to the discussion about the importance of intrinsic cues by investigating the effects that the use of product cues that confirm the <b>product</b> <b>claim</b> may have on Claim Credibility (measured through Ad Credibility), and also on consumers’ Purchase Intention and Perceived Risk toward the product. An experiment was designed to test such effects and the results suggest the effects of the use of Claim Confirming Product Cues depend on consumer’s level of awareness about such cue, and that when consumers are aware of it, Ad Credibility and Purchase Intention increase, as Perceived Risk decreases. Such results may have implications to academicians and practitioners, as well as may provide insights for future research...|$|E

40|$|A <b>product</b> <b>claim</b> {{based on}} breach of express warranty, {{tortious}} misrepresentation, or inadequate directions or warnings, requires the plaintiff to show {{not only that}} the product was defective and was the cause of his injury, but usually he must also show that he was aware of the defective representation. Proof of such awareness if not required when defects arise from the failure of a product to meet ordinary expectations, since these expectations are presumed. Where the defect consists of a representation, however, special expectations are supposed to be involved, and the plaintiff, in order to recover, may therefore be required to show his awareness of the misrepresentation. Proof of such awareness is thought necessary to establish cause-in-fact. Cause-in-fact, however, is not a fixed quantum in every case, but may vary according to the policy considerations involved in the particular circumstances of each case. This article 2 ̆ 7 s thesis is that concern for proof of causation based on awareness should play a lesser role in representational defect cases than the courts usually accord the matter, because of countervailing policy considerations that minimize its importance.

40|$|This {{article is}} about the pharma patent {{litigation}} sparked by Lundbeck's blockbuster drug for escitalopram. The article focuses on the trials and tribulations before the Dutch Patent Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, while also briefly contrasting and comparing this with the decisions in Germany and the United Kingdom. Particular attention is given to novel substances which can be fully envisaged but not yet made. Under the doctrine, set out by the Technical Boards of Appeal, such envisaged substance can still {{be considered to be}} non-obvious and therefore patented if the claimed method for preparing such substance is the first to achieve this in an inventive manner. The Dutch Supreme Court follows this doctrine. The author criticizes the lack of explanation provided by the Supreme Court in reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal. By merely referring to foreign precedent, the Supreme Court violates its (own) duty to state (its own) reasons. The article concludes by outlining the practical impact of the decision of the Supreme Court: inventors developing a (novel and) inventive process for obtaining a (novel) product which can be fully envisaged but not yet made, can obtain not only a process claim for inventing the process, but also monopolize the substance under a <b>product</b> <b>claim...</b>|$|E
