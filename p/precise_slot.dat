50|$|At its {{inception}} in October 1961, the programme was broadcast at 18:15. From September 1962, it moved to 18:50, and then to 18:40 from April 1977. Religious programming was also broadcast on ITV in the same timeslot, but this custom ceased {{at the end of}} 1992. From January 1993, the programme's scheduled broadcast time was changed to 18:25 and then 18:10 from January 1996. Since then, the time of broadcast has tended to shift slightly earlier, but the <b>precise</b> <b>slot</b> has often varied from week to week.|$|E
50|$|Gina Ford (born c. 1960) is the bestselling {{author of}} {{childcare}} {{books in the}} United Kingdom and a former maternity nurse who has cared for over 300 babies during her career. Ford's 1999 book The Contented Little Baby Book advocates a daily routine for both the baby and the parents, with the day divided up into very <b>precise</b> <b>slots.</b> Ford has written nine books on childcare.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a high performance, all metal compact heat exchanger. The device is designed for use in a reverse Brayton cryogenic cooler which provides five watts of refrigeration at 70 K. The heat exchanger consists of a stainless steel tube concentrically assembled within a second stainless steel tube. Approximately 300 pairs of slotted copper disks and matching annular slotted copper plates are positioned along the centerline axis of the concentric tubes. Each of the disks and plates has approximately 1200 <b>precise</b> <b>slots</b> machined by means of a special electric discharge process. Positioning of the disk and plate pairs is accomplished by means of dimples in the surface of the tubes. Mechanical and thermal connections between the tubes and plate/disk pairs are made by solder joints. The heat exchanger assembly is 9 cm in diameter by 50 cm in length and has a mass of 10 kg. The predicted thermal effectiveness is greater than 0. 985 at design conditions. Pressure loss at design conditions is less than 5 kPa in both fluid passages. Tests were performed on a subassembly of plates integrally soldered to two end headers. The measured thermal effectiveness of the test article exceeded predicted levels. Pressure losses were negligibly higher than predictions...|$|R
50|$|The {{teardrop-shaped}} {{air knife}} has a bulbous plenum which tapers {{down to a}} <b>precise</b> air discharge <b>slot</b> as the standard of the blower driven air knife industry. Whereas a round pipe with holes drilled has an average coefficient of discharge of 0.6 (60% efficient), the teardrop-shaped air knife is commonly 0.95 (95% efficient), which provides much higher-impact air velocity to the surface at which the air is directed with the lowest blower motor power demand. These teardrop designs are available in extruded aluminum shapes as well as fabricated carbon and stainless steels.|$|R
40|$|For the new European {{satellite}} navigation system Galileo many new applications are envisaged using the enhanced features with {{the reliability and}} accuracy of the system. Most applications focus on the transport area where new approaches are dealing with increased traffic and road safety using Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The paper shows how this can be realised by means of procedures for a high precise relative positioning of vehicles vs. other vehicles or infrastructure (e. g. fixed obstacles). For that Galileo based technologies can primary be used being supplemented by additional onboard sensors. The acquired positioning raw data (satellite pseudo ranges, speed, acceleration, etc.), being subject of the same ionospheric interferences within a short range, will be exchanged with other vehicles where special algorithms can calculate the precise distances or velocities finally creating a virtual image of a vehicles surrounding with an extended visual horizon. For the information exchange high amounts of data have to be transferred on dedicated frequencies with standardised procedures. The paper shows that future data communication for that high dynamic radio data traffic with permanent changing link partners needs highly enhanced protocols and access procedures (ad-hoc networks) where each participant gets a <b>precise</b> allocated time <b>slot</b> for transmitting own data. The synchronisation of such transmissions needs then a high accurate common time base which can be provided by the onboard Galileo receiver with services of guaranteed reliability and availability...|$|R
