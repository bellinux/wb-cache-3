40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{microsatellite}} data of 20 loci were generated and utilized to evaluate genetic variability of the Croatian <b>Spotted</b> <b>goat.</b> Genetic variability was high, with means for expected gene diversity of 0. 771, observed heterozygosity of 0. 759, and 8. 1 {{for the total}} number of alleles per locus. There are no indications for deviations from random breeding within the population. Level of inbreeding was only 2 % and non-significant. The population was found to deviate significantly under infinitive allele model (IAM) and two phase model (TPM), while stepwise mutation model (SMM) and qualitative mode-shift test of allele frequencies indicate the absence of genetic bottleneck in the recent past in the population of the Croatian <b>Spotted</b> <b>goat.</b> High level of genetic diversity, as it is presented in this study, may be seen as an initial guide for conservation decisions in the future...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to relate the polymorphisms at CLPS and RYR 1 genes to pork quality in case of Złotnicka Spotted breed. The {{experiment}} was carried out on 30 <b>purebred</b> Złotnicka <b>Spotted</b> pigs, which were reared in standard conditions and slaughtered at approximately 100 to 110 kg body weight. Genetic polymorphisms were determined with the PCR-RFLP procedure. Polymorphism at the colipase gene (CLPS) was identified with DdeI restriction enzyme and stress sensibility gene (RYR 1) with HinPI. In the studied pig sample three genotypes at locus CLPS/DdeI and two genotypes at locus RYR 1 /HinPI were found. The genotype frequencies at CLPS gene were 0. 07 for AA, 0. 40 for AB and 0. 53 for BB. Colipase gene affected intramuscular fat content in RYR 1 /CT pigs. Meat from pigs with genotype BB had higher intramuscular fat content (2. 50 %) compared to AA group (1. 59 %); P≤ 0. 05. Moreover, significant influence of gene RYR 1 T on pH 1 trait was shown. Values of all analyzed traits were within ranges characterizing good meat quality of the native Polish Złotnicka Spotted pig...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Laban asked Jacob to name {{how much he}} wanted to stay. Jacob recounted how he had served Laban and how Laban had benefited, and asked when he could provide for his own family. Laban pressed him again, so Jacob offered to keep Laban's flock in {{exchange}} for the speckled, spotted, and dark sheep and goats, and thus Laban could clearly tell Jacob's flock from his. Laban agreed, but that day he removed the speckled and <b>spotted</b> <b>goats</b> and dark sheep from his flock and gave them to his sons and put three day's distance between Jacob and himself. Jacob peeled white streaks in fresh rods of poplar, almond, and plane trees and set the rods where the flocks would see them when they mated, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted young. Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the stronger sheep, but not before the feeble, so the feebler sheep became Laban's and the stronger Jacob's. Jacob's flocks and wealth thus increased. Jacob heard that Laban's sons thought that he had become wealthy at Laban's expense, and Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him as before. God told Jacob to return to the land of his fathers, and that God would be with him. Jacob called Rachel and Leah to the field and told them that Laban had changed his opinion of Jacob, but Jacob had served Laban wholeheartedly and God had remained with Jacob. Jacob noted that Laban had mocked him and changed his wages ten times, but God would not allow him to harm Jacob, but had rewarded Jacob, giving Laban's animals to Jacob. Jacob said that in a dream God told him to return to the land of his birth. Rachel and Leah answered that they no longer had any portion in Laban's house and all the riches that God had taken from Laban were theirs and their children's, so Jacob should do whatever God had told him to do. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|R
40|$|The South African Boer goat {{displays}} a characteristic white spotting phenotype, {{in which the}} pigment {{is limited to the}} head. Exploiting the existing phenotype variation within the breed, we mapped the locus causing this white spotting phenotype to chromosome 17 by genome wide association. Subsequent whole genome sequencing identified a 1 [*]Mb copy number variant (CNV) harboring 5 genes including EDNRA. The analysis of 358 Boer goats revealed 3 alleles with one, two, and three copies of this CNV. The copy number is correlated with the degree of white <b>spotting</b> in <b>goats.</b> We propose a hypothesis that ectopic overexpression of a mutant EDNRA scavenges EDN 3 required for EDNRB signaling and normal melanocyte development and thus likely lead to an absence of melanocytes in the non-pigmented body areas of Boer goats. Our findings demonstrate the value of domestic animals as reservoir of unique mutants and for identifying a precisely defined functional CNV...|$|R
50|$|Three {{types of}} skins to {{manufacture}} puppets - antelope, <b>spotted</b> deer and <b>goat.</b> Antelope skins {{are reserved for}} making {{a limited number of}} auspicious characters such as the gods and epic heroes. Deer skin, noted for its strength and resistance to rough handling, is employed in the figures of warrior, Bhima; the ten-headed demon king, Ravana. All other puppets are made from goat skin, readily available locally. Most puppets are made from a single skin, though some require more. At least four skins are necessary for Ravana -one for his body, one for his legs, and one to make each set of five arms.|$|R

McKee along with {{illustrator}} John Gee, The Timbertoes has appeared in Highlights magazine for more than 50 years. The first Highlights incarnation was a full-page black and white comic strip featuring line-drawn characters, later switching to digital color in 2003. The Timbertoes family consists of parents Ma and Pa and their children Tommy and Mabel. The characters, including their dog <b>Spot,</b> cat Splinter, <b>goat</b> Butter, and horse Troy are depicted as being constructed from wood. Upon Gee's death, Highlights Senior Editor Marileta Robinson took over writing the strip, with illustrations done by Judith Hunt. Since 2003, the Timbertoes have appeared in color with Ron Zalme as the illustrator. Rich Wallace is the current writer.|$|R
5000|$|On November 24, 2012, a passerby <b>spotted</b> an Angora <b>goat</b> tied up {{near the}} Pentagon in a median at an {{intersection}} on Army Navy Drive in Arlington County, Virginia. Representatives of the Animal Welfare League of Arlington rescued the ruminant {{and took it to}} the League's animal shelter. Calls were then placed to law enforcement officials in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, who notified the caprine's presumptive owners that their property had been found and needed a ride back home. The manager of Maryland Sunrise Farm (the successor to the Naval Academy Dairy Farm), where Bill XXXVIII and Bill XXXIV usually resided, then claimed and retrieved the beast, which was in good condition, but did not know which Bill was absent from the farm. A Navy spokeswoman said, “At this time, we are unaware of who may have taken the goat, but it could be related to the Army-Navy game Dec. 8.” A spokesman for the USMA stated that he had [...] "no official knowledge" [...] of any theft of a goat. No charges were filed because it was unclear as to who had tied and abandoned the animal in the median.|$|R
5000|$|Two of {{the highest}} waterfalls in Bulgaria are located {{near the town of}} Vratsa, North-West Bulgaria. One is named Skaklia and the other one Borov Kamak. Skaklia (Скакля) is the name of two {{different}} waterfalls in Bulgaria. The one near Vratsa is 130 metres high ( [...] 141 metres according to other sources [...] ) and is located 1.5 kilometres south of the town behind the Kaleto hill top [...] It is considered one {{of the highest}} waterfalls in Bulgaria and on the Balkan peninsula. Nevertheless, this remains a debatable question in Bulgaria until today, as this is a semi-active waterfall, not a constant one (not having constant flow of water) unlike the 124.5 metres high Raysko Praskalo (Heavenly Spray) also situated in Bulgaria. Water falls from the vertical Skaklia cliff when there is heavy raining or after the massive melting of snow at the end of winter or early spring, otherwise little water can be seen from farther distances. When active, however, the waterfall is easy to recognize from tourists standing many kilometres away from it, especially if they approach it from the north-west parts of Bulgaria. In the waterfall area a lot of remains from the ancient Bulgarian village Patleina have been found. Beautiful throughout the entire year it overlooks the town of Vratsa and the Vratsa lowlands. The waterfall is a summit <b>spot</b> of different <b>goat</b> routes. The Skaklia cliff itself is situated in a difficult to reach area and regardless of its clear visibility from the city, remains a difficult spot to reach by the majority of the tourists visiting Vratsa.|$|R
40|$|Milk {{production}} {{has always been}} the main ob-jective of rearing of goats and kids are still con-sidered to be a by-product. On the other hand, it is necessary to mention that the interest of do-mestic consumers to consume kids is increasing and the highest demand is for animals of the body weight ranging from 12 to 18 kg. As far as the share of individual breeds in the market of kid meat is concerned, the customers can buy meat of kids of White Short-Haired (WSH) breed most frequently; the supply of kids of other breeds is very limited. This situation is influenced above all by small popu-lations of other breeds, fractionation of individual herds and low numbers of animals on individual farms. Such a situation also exists in the second most frequent breed in the Czech Republic, viz. the Brown Short-Haired (BSH), which was created by the crossing-over of native <b>spotted</b> and brown <b>goats</b> with sires of the Harz breed imported from Germany (Pinďák et al., 2003). As compared with the other breeds, numbers of goats of this breed have increased in recent years. On the majority of Czech farms, reproduction of goats is organised {{in such a way that}} parturi-tions take place mainly in January so that newborn kids reach the required slaughter weight just before Easter, i. e. in the period when the demand is the highest. Such a system, however, requires that rela-tively high daily gains of kids will be achieved.
