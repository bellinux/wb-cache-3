50|$|EOS' Drip Irrigation System is a low-cost, low-tech {{irrigation}} method that uses less water than traditional methods focused on fighting food security and increasing incomes. Through {{the use of}} plastic tubing with small holes at consistent intervals (commonly known as drip tape), water is distributed directly {{to the root of}} a plant. A drip irrigation system requires a water source and typically consists of: a storage device, a piping system, a filter, and drip tape. Systems may include the use of rivers, wells, and portable water for the primary source as well as low-cost methods such as harvesting rainwater to allow farmers in the driest, most water scarce areas to increase yields and grow vegetables during the dry season. EOS' system uses a metal barrel as a storage device, durable <b>plastic</b> <b>hose</b> for the piping system, and plastic connectors that connect drip tape to the <b>plastic</b> <b>hose.</b> All materials are purchased in Nicaragua.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} basic parts {{in a space}} toilet: the liquid waste vacuum tube, the vacuum chamber, the waste storage drawers, and the solid waste {{collection}} bags. The liquid waste vacuum tube is a 2 to 3 ft long rubber or <b>plastic</b> <b>hose</b> that {{is attached to the}} vacuum chamber and connected to a fan that provides suction. At the end of the tube there is a detachable urine receptacle, which come in different versions for male and female astronauts. The male urine receptacle is a plastic funnel two to three inches in width and about four inches deep. A male astronaut urinates directly into the funnel from a distance of two or three inches away. The female funnel is oval and is two inches by four inches wide at the rim. Near the funnel's rim are small holes or slits that allow air movement to prevent excessive suction. The vacuum chamber is a cylinder about 1 ft deep and six inches wide with clips on the rim where waste collection bags may be attached and a fan that provides suction. Urine is pumped into and stored in waste storage drawers. Solid waste is stored in a detachable bag made of a special fabric that lets gas (but not liquid or solid) escape, a feature that allows the fan {{at the back of the}} vacuum chamber to pull the waste into the bag. When the astronaut is finished, he or she then twists the bag and places it in a waste storage drawer. Samples of urine and solid waste are frozen and taken to Earth for testing.|$|E

This article shows how multivariate design and response surface modeling were applied to a lay-flat <b>plastic</b> <b>hose</b> extrusion process in a full-scale experiment. Clear quantitative relationships were found, which {{to a large degree}} match existing qualitative process understanding. For instance, it was quantified how adhesion improves with increased extrusion screw speed and extrusion head temperature. The results can readily be used to inform the operators in real-time of important quality parameters of the hose currently under production. The clear results also indicate that increased process automation is achievable...|$|E
40|$|As a way {{to reduce}} water losses in furrow {{irrigation}} systems, used in fresh market tomato production, farmers are improperly distributing water into the field using <b>plastic</b> <b>hose.</b> The objective of this work was to study the suitability of using quick coupler sprinkler as hose connectors for water distribution in tomato plantation. The first step {{of the study was}} to assess the current hose field operation for tomato growers. Subsequently, four models of quick couplers sprinklers available in the market were tested in laboratory to determine the coefficient of resistance, the equivalent tube length, the head loss curve and the linking efficiency. As result, a structural design for hose connectors was presented using the model of coupling with the best hydraulic performance. Additionally, some technical recommendations on its use in irrigation water distribution are highlighted.

As part of this investigation, a study was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of dewatering Alaska placer effluent. Based on the laboratory tests, preliminary field tests were conducted on three placer mines in Alaska. At these mines, the water recovered from the placer effluent (250 to 23, 000 NTU) exhibited turbidities of 20 to 240 NTU. In {{the second year of}} the project, a large-scale dewatering unit was set up at a mine located in the Livengood district.

40|$|The Information Era {{has brought}} along a myriad of revolutionary changes. The Internet in {{particular}} has given new forms to old paradigms. It is quite a challenge for companies to decide which of all these options best suit their business model and their strategies, hopefully one that also provides them with a competitive edge. One of these new alternatives is online auctions used as a procurement tool. And because of their novelty, it is still unclear whether they are a flawless method of decreasing costs. Although there are many issues concerning this topic, the one addressed here is how the bidders' behavior during the auction (the strategy used to place their bids) affects the outcome, for {{them as well as}} for the company setting up the event; and how managers on both sides can maximize the benefits. The basis for the study was a recent auction conducted by autoparts maker Visteon for the procurement of a <b>plastic</b> <b>hose.</b> On the supplier side, the results show that those companies that had a target price before entering the auction, would obtain the most benefits (less sacrifice in profits), since Visteon did not award the projects solely based on price. On the buyer side, having a rich mixture of bidders (diverse in size, location, quality concern for example) enables a more dynamic process (lower prices). by Michel Galland Lopez. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|On April 21, 1996, at 6 : 12 p. m., {{approximately}} 20 tons {{of molten}} glass were expelled from a 216 -ton body of molten (approximately 1600 {degrees}C) radioactively contaminated soil (containing 2. 4 Ci of {sup 137 }Cs) at a field site at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The melt expulsion {{was caused by}} pressurized steam venting rapidly through, {{rather than by the}} desired path around, the molten body. During the previous 17 days, an old seepage pit was undergoing in situ vitrification (ISV) to convert it from porous, leachable soil into a monolithic, impermeable vitreous waste form. Approximately 2 MW of electrical power was being delivered to the molten body, which was contained in the ground and covered with a stainless steel hood maintained under negative pressure to collect, filter, scrub, and monitor off-gas. Off-gas into the hood was rapidly heated by the melt expulsion from a typical operating temperature of 250 {degrees}C to over 1000 {degrees}C with an associated surge of pressure sufficient to lift the 15, 000 -lb hood approximately 12 in. off the ground. A small pool of molten glass was able to flow up to 3 ft outside the hood while it was raised off the ground. The escaping hot off-gas and molten glass ignited several small fires in combustible components near or attached to the external hood frame (e. g, wire insulation, <b>plastic</b> <b>hose,</b> fiberglass trays). Fire department personnel responded to the emergency notification within minutes but were not needed because the small fires self-extinguished within an hour. Four project personnel were performing tasks at the site {{at the time of the}} melt expulsion; none were injured or contaminated during the melt expulsion incident. Air samples taken from the hood perimeter near the small fires failed to detect any airborne contamination...|$|E
40|$|The term noninvasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) encompasses {{two different}} modes of delivering positive airway pressure, namely continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (bilevel-PAP). The two modes are different since CPAP does not actively assist inspiration whereas bilevel-PAP does. Bilevel-PAP {{is a type}} of noninvasive ventilation that helps keep the upper airways of the lungs open by providing a flow of air delivered through a face mask. The air is pressurized by a machine, which delivers it to the face mask through long, <b>plastic</b> <b>hosing.</b> With bilevel-PAP, the doctor prescribes specific alternating pressures: a higher pressure is used to breathe in (inspiratory positive airway pressure) and a lower pressure is used to breath out (expiratory positive airway pressure). Noninvasive ventilation has been shown to reduce the rate of tracheal intubation. The main indications are exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE). This last is a common cause of respiratory failure with high incidence and high mortality rate. Clinical findings of ACPE are related to the increased extra-vascular water in the lungs and the resulting reduced lung compliance, increased airway resistance and elevated inspiratory muscle load which generates a depression in pleural pressure. These large pleural pressure swings are responsible for hemodynamic changes by increasing left ventricular afterload, myocardial transmural pressure, and venous return. These alterations can be detrimental to patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Under these circumstances, NIV, either by CPAP or bilevel-PAP, improves vital signs, gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamics by reducing left ventricular afterload and preload. In the first randomized study which compared the effectiveness of CPAP plus medical treatment vs medical treatment alone, the CPAP group showed a significant decrease in its 48 h mortality rate and no patient required endotracheal intubation. This result was successively confirmed in many reviews and meta-analyses. There are still unanswered questions regarding the role of NIV in ACPE: this review aims to support clinicians treating patients in emergency departments with various presentations of ACPE. It also covers recent developments in the treatment of ACPE and associated evidence...|$|R
