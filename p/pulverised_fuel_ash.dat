Among <b>pulverised</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ashes,</b> OSFA samples collected from the electrostatic precipitation tend to present lower CO 2 uptake compared to the OSFA sample obtained from the cyclones.

50|$|The British Electricity Authority built a third {{station at}} Creekmouth, which was {{completed}} in 1954. The station was closed on 26 October 1981, at which time its generating capacity was 220 MW. All three stations have since been demolished. The C Station had three B.T.H. 75 MW turbo-generators operating with steam conditions of 900 psig and 900'F. There were 6 B&W boilers, 5 being <b>pulverised</b> <b>fuel</b> and the sixth a cyclone furnace. The <b>pulverised</b> <b>fuel</b> boilers were converted to oil firing around 1960.|$|R

500|$|<b>Pulverised</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Ash</b> (PFA) and Furnace Bottom Ash (FBA) were {{byproducts}} produced {{through the}} burning of coal in the station. Bottom ash was removed from ash hoppers {{at the bottom of}} the boilers by high pressure water jets. It then travelled to ash settling ponds via sluiceways. For much of the station's life, the station was served by a series of barges, which took the ash to dump [...] out into the North Sea. Two barges provided this service over the years; Sir Fon and MVA. The barges were loaded by silos situated at a special dock to the east of the stations. However, dumping in the sea stopped in 1992 when the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships prevented further dumping in the North Sea. From then on FBA was sold to the construction industry, while PFA was either dried for sale, or was disposed of at a licensed landfill on-site.|$|E
500|$|<b>Pulverised</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ash</b> (PFA) and {{furnace bottom}} ash (FBA) are two {{byproducts}} {{from the burning}} of coal. Each year, the station produces about 1,000,000 tonnes of PFA and around 220,000 tonnes of FBA: all FBA and 85% of PFA is sold. Under the trade name Drax Ash Products, the ash is sold to the local building industry, where it {{is used in the}} manufacture of blocks, cement products, grouting and the laying of roads. The ash is also used {{in other parts of the}} country. [...] Between 2005 and 2007, PFA was used as an infill at four disused salt mines in Northwich in Cheshire. 1,100,000 tonnes was used in the project, which was to avoid a future risk of subsidence in the town. Ash was delivered by DB Schenker in ten trains a week, each carrying 1,100 tonnes. Following a trial in January 2010, PFA is also transported to Waterford in Ireland by boat. [...] One ship a month will transport 1,200 tonnes for the manufacture of construction materials. This will replace 480 lorry journeys annually and is deemed more environmentally friendly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Square-shaped {{pneumatic}} conveying pipes {{are used in}} some industrial processes such as fuel injection systems in coal-fired power plants and circulating fluidized beds. However, {{little research has been}} conducted to characterise the gas–solid two-phase flow in a square-shaped {{pneumatic conveying}} pipe. This paper presents mathematical modelling and experimental assessment of novel non-restrictive electrostatic sensor arrays for the measurement of <b>pulverised</b> <b>fuel</b> flow in a square-shaped pipe. The sensor arrays consist of twelve pairs of strip-shaped electrodes, which are uniformly embedded in the four flat pipe walls. An analytical mathematical model of the sensor arrays is established and the induced charge and currents of different electrodes due to a point charge are then derived based on the model. Experimental tests were conducted on a 54 mm square-shaped pipe section of a pneumatic conveyor test rig under a range of flow conditions. The fuel velocity profile over the whole cross-section of the pipe is measured. Mathematical modelling and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed non-restrictive electrostatic sensor arrays are capable of characterising the local <b>pulverised</b> <b>fuel</b> flow in a square-shaped pneumatic conveying pipe.

40|$|AbstractResultsfor {{ignition}} behaviour of <b>pulverised</b> biomass <b>fuels</b> in a 20 litre (L) spherical {{combustion chamber}} are presented and discussed. Four types of biomass currently used in UK utility <b>pulverised</b> <b>fuel</b> boilers {{have been tested}} for ignition behaviour in air, so at 21 %v/v O 2, and also, to assess relative performance under oxy-fuel combustion conditions, in a 21 %v/v O 2, balance carbon dioxide (CO 2) balance mixture (21 Oxy) and a 25 %v/v O 2 mixture (25 Oxy) respectively. Peak pressures (Pmax) during constant volume ignition and combustion with 2500 J and 5000 J igniters were measured and recorded. The pressure ratios (P/R), defined as {{the ratio of the}} maximum pressure (Pmax) to the pressure at the start of ignition (P 0) for each test are reported. A P/R above a threshold of 2. 5 is taken as an indication of positive ignition. All four biomass types ignited nearly as readily in 25 Oxy as in air at a range of fuel concentrations. Ignition was much less readily achieved in 21 Oxy for all fuel concentrations and peak pressures were also generally lower. Results were more erratic with 2500 J igniters compared to 5000 J igniters, suggesting a relatively stronger ignition source is required with these biomass samples than with pulverised coals previously tested; this is tentatively attributed to larger particle sizes and higher moisture contents. Implications for <b>pulverised</b> <b>fuel</b> oxy-fuel combustion applications are: 1) a primary recycle (PR) stream with 21 %v/v O 2 would give improved <b>pulverised</b> <b>fuel</b> (PF) milling safety when compared to air firing but reduced ignitability in the burners; 2) a 25 %v/v O 2 primary stream would approach air behaviour in mills and burners.

This paper presents the effects of nano size palm oil <b>fuel</b> <b>ash</b> on the long term characteristics of mortar. The study covers basic properties of mortar including the morphology, porosity, compressive strength and microstructural with regards to the variations in the mix design of the mortar. The palm oil <b>fuel</b> <b>ash</b> used has gone through heat treatment and was ground to a nano size with the percentage replacement of cement used was 60 %, 80 % and 100 %. The different types of mortar samples were cast in a 70 x 70 x 70 mm cube for compressive strength test. All casting and testing of the samples were conducted in the laboratory at ambient temperature. The results show that the use of 80 % nano size palm oil <b>fuel</b> <b>ash</b> has produced higher compressive strength at the age of 28 days by 32 % compared to the control mortar. Grinding the palm oil <b>fuel</b> <b>ash</b> to a nano size particle has improved the reactivity of the ash and because of it is a {{waste material}} it reduces the cost of the mortar.
