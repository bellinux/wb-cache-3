5|$|<b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>AIDS</b> have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>AIDS</b> and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E

Identification of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>aid</b> of machine is needed to solve insecurity challenges in our society. Human palm-print is a good raw material for machine based identification systems. These systems require strong predominate feature from palm-print for successful operation. In this work, a discriminate feature {{that can be used}} to differentiate people accurately is extracted from palm-print image. Edge detected palm-print image is sliced into smaller image blocks through centre points thereafter robust feature vector is generated from these smaller image blocks. The new feature was experimental using feature plot and it is shown clearly that this feature will deliver excellent classification result...|$|R

5|$|The {{publicity}} of Ryan White's story catapulted {{him into}} the national spotlight, amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media. Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled.
