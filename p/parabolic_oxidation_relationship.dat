Gamma-prime dispersion and solid-solution strengthening were the principal modes of alloy strengthening.

The oxidation behavior of three high temperature reactor candidate materials, 316 L stainless steel, alloy 617, and Incoloy 800 -H under different conditions were investigated in the present work. For molybdenum-based 316 L stainless steel, the tests were performed isothermally at temperatures between 773 K and 1, 273 K (in steps of 100 K) for 24 hours in controlled air environments. The oxidation behavior followed the <b>parabolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> kinetic rate law. The activation energy was 149. 21 kJ/mol at 873 K to 1273 K. At 773 K, a thin external oxide layer was observed, while at higher temperatures a continuous and relatively irregular and inwardly protruded external oxide layer was observed. The external layer width and composition depended on increasing temperatures. At 1073 K a Cr 2 O 3 layer was detected. After 1273 K, a Fe 2 O 3 sub-layer formed {{in addition to the}} Cr 2 O 3 layer. Continuous larger external oxide scales and grain boundary ridges were also observed with increasing temperatures. The oxide morphology and structure of 316 L stainless steel were strongly affected by the controlled air environments. The best oxidation resistance of 316 L stainless steel was observed at 1073 K with the highest Cr content value. At 1273 K, mass gain was related to iron oxidation. Increasing oxidation temperatures were attributed to the formation of pores, voids, and grain boundaries. Alloy 617 tests were performed isothermally at temperatures between 1073 K to 1473 K (in steps of 100 K) for 24 hours in controlled air environments. The oxidation behavior followed the <b>parabolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> kinetic rate law. The activation energy was found to be 233. 46 kJ/mol for 1073 K to 1473 K.

Meanwhile, a continuous and relatively irregular and inwardly protruded external oxide layer was observed with an external layer width dependent on increasing temperatures. Besides the NiO-Cr 2 O 3 layer, Al 2 O 3 areas were also detected. Figures sequentially showed a continuous growth of external oxide scales and grain boundary ridges with temperatures. The oxide morphology and structure of alloy 617 were strongly affected by environments. At 1473 K, the increasing mass gain was related to Ti oxidation. The oxidation depth increased as the temperature increased. Increasing oxidation temperatures is attributed to the formation of pores, voids, and grain boundaries.

The activation energy results indicate that the phenomena of diffusion of oxygen ions into the oxide layer and interfacial reactions between oxide layer and intergranular phase are the responsible for oxidation mechanism...|$|R
40|$|An {{interconnect}} for an SOFC stack is used {{to connect}} fuel cells into a stack. SOFC stacks are expected to run for 40, 000 hours and 10 thermal cycles for the stationary application and 10, 000 hours and 7000 thermal cycles for the transportation application. The interconnect of a stack must be economical and robust enough to survive the SOFC stack operation temperature of 750 C and must maintain the electrical connection to the fuel cells throughout the lifetime and under thermal cycling conditions. Ferritic and austenitic stainless steels, and nickel-based superalloys were investigated as possible interconnect materials for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks. The alloys were thermally cycled in air and in a wet nitrogen-argon-hydrogen (N 2 -Ar-H 2 -H 2 O) atmosphere. Thermogravimetry {{was used to determine}} the <b>parabolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> rate constants of the alloys in both atmospheres. The area-specific resistance of the oxide scale and metal substrates were measured using a two-probe technique with platinum contacts. The study identifies two new interconnect designs which can be used with both bonded and compressive stack sealing mechanisms. The new interconnect designs offer a solution to chromium vaporization, which can lead to degradation of some (chromium-sensitive) SOFC cathodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of a-Fe and e-FezNl-z at 573 K and 673 Kin Oe at 1 atm {{was investigated}} by thermogravimetrical analysis, X-ray diffraction, light-optical microscopy, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and electron probe X-ray microana-lysis. Upon oxidation at 573 K and 673 K, on a-Fe initially a-Fez 03 develops, whereas on e-FezN>z initially Fes 04 develops. In {{an early stage of}} oxidation the oxidation rate of e-FezN~-z appears to be much larger than of a-Fe. This can be attributed largely to an effective surface area available for oxygen uptake, which is much larger for e-FezN~_ ~ than for a-Fe due to the porous structure of e-FezNl- ~ as prepared by gaseous nitriding of iron. The develop-ment of a magnetite layer in-between the hematite layer and the a-Fe substrate, at a later stage of oxidation, enhances layer-growth kinetics. After 100 min oxidation at 673 K the (<b>parabolic)</b> <b>oxidation</b> rates for a-Fe and e-FezN~-z become about equal, indicating that on both substrates the oxide growth is controlled by the same rate limiting step which is attributed to short-circuit diffusion of iron cations. Oxidizing e-Fez Nl-z increases the nitrogen concentra...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of chromium in dry O 2 and in O 2 + 10 %H 2 O at 600 and 700 °C is studied. Scale morphology is {{investigated by}} several methods, including {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) of cross sections prepared by focussed ion beam milling (FIB). In O 2 + H 2 O at 600 and 700 °C, chromium forms a duplex scale consisting of an inner barrier oxide and a discontinuous outer oxide made up of blade-shaped crystals. Thermogravimetric (TG) measurements show that water vapour influences chromium oxidation by causing vaporization of the protective oxide, resulting in paralinear oxidation kinetics. An extension of the original treatment by Tedmon is deduced, which allows for {{the determination of the}} evaporation rate constant k s and the <b>parabolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> rate constant k d from TG data acquired during short exposures. The results show that k d is the same in dry O 2 and in O 2 + 10 %H 2 O. Equivalently, the transport properties of chromia are the same in the two environments. The equilibrium constant of CrO 2 (OH) 2 formation from chromia is reported. The activation enthalpy of the vaporization reaction is determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of oxidation-reduction of Hot Briquetted Iron (HEI) {{has been}} investigated in both N 2 and CO 2 atmospheres over the temperature range 400 to 900 degrees Celsius. The reaction rate was measured using thermogravimetric techniques and differential thermal analysis. Reactions between wustite (FeO) and carbon, which is predominantly present as cementite (Fe 3 C) in HBI, were detectable in nitrogen above 500 degrees Celsius. A parabolic rate law, suggested to be governed by gas diffusion, was followed {{in the initial stages}} of reaction above 700 degrees Celsius. The highest rate of decarburisation was found at 800 degrees Celsius. In a CO 2 atmosphere, the degree of the HBI oxidation increased with the temperature, though simultaneous decarburisation was detectable from 700 degrees Celsius onwards. Only external oxidation was observed, with either magnetite or wustite formation, due to the relative low porosity of the HBI samples. The decarburisation predominantly occurs by reaction of pre-existing FeO with Fe 3 C/C. Linear oxidation were obtained between 400 and 500 degrees Celsius, whilst <b>parabolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> was observed initially at higher temperatures. At 800 degrees Celsius, a high decarburisation rate during the first 10 minutes resulted in increased metallisation of the HBI sample...|$|R
40|$|Single-crystal MoSi 2 {{and four}} {{polycrystalline}} MoSi 2 materials prepared by three different preparation techniques (hot pressing, arc melting, and vacuum plasma spraying) were isothermally oxidized for 100 hours at 1500 ∘C in 1 atm. oxygen. After an initial period which varied among the samples, these materials exhibited <b>parabolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> behavior and their parabolic rate constants ranged from 0. 4 × 10 - 9 to 2. 0 × 10 - 9 g 2 cm- 4 hr- 1, indicating that preparation method {{does not have}} a significant effect on the oxidation behavior. Short-time oxidation runs showed that the higher initial oxidation rate in two of the materials did not correspond to variations in the crystallization rate of the scale from amorphous silica to cristobalite, but instead correlated to higher impurity levels of Al and Fe which diffused into the scale within 0. 25 hr. A Mo 5 Si 3 interlayer between the oxide and the MoSi 2 was observed in the single crystal but not in the polycrystalline materials, indicating the importance of grain boundary diffusion in delaying the formation of the Mo 5 Si 3 interlayer. ^ Four MoSi 2 -based composites containing 40 vol. ...|$|R
