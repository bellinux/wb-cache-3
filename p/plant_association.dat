30|$|Ponderosa pine sites {{included}} {{sites that}} belonged to ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and warm-dry grand fir <b>plant</b> <b>associations</b> that historically {{had little or no}} grand fir. Grand fir sites consisted of sites that belong to cool-moist grand fir <b>plant</b> <b>associations</b> and warmdry grand fir <b>plant</b> <b>associations</b> that had significant grand fir structure in the late 1800 s (Table 1). Between 93 % to 100 % of the fire history samples collected from ponderosa pine sites were from ponderosa pine trees. Ponderosa pine made up between 10 % to 56 % of samples from moist grand fir sites, with western larch, Douglas-fir, grand fir, and lodgepole pine making up the remainder.|$|R
