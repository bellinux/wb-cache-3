5|$|As {{a result}} of {{pressure}} from the Egyptian and Saudi governments to spare the life of their ally Quwatli, al-Zaim agreed to release Quwatli from prison in mid-April 1949. After officially resigning as President, Quwatli was exiled to Alexandria, Egypt. In Egypt he was respected as a guest of honor by King Farouk and after the July 1952 revolution, by the Free Officers who gained power. Despite his <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> with the ousted King Farouk, Quwatli developed a close friendship with {{the founder of the}} Free Officers, Gamal Abdel Nasser, who became Egypt's leader in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, {{accompanied}} by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E
5|$|Canada and the United States {{share the}} world's longest undefended border, co-operate on {{military}} campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partner. Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba since, and declining to officially {{participate in the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq. Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie. Canada is noted for having a <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Edin's Hall Broch in Berwickshire is {{the best}} {{preserved}} southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar {{to some of the}} larger Orcadian broch villages {{it is unlikely that the}} tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, perhaps even the Orcadian chiefs whose <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.|$|E
5|$|Instrumental {{in facilitating}} the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi's <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, {{who was his}} first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He {{appeared}} in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined with back spasms. After being diagnosed with a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted for surgery, which {{kept him out of}} the lineup for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks. Bertuzzi was {{in the last year of}} his contract with no guarantee he would re-sign with Florida in the off-season.|$|E

40|$|Investigating how other-oriented perfectionism (OOP) {{differed}} from self-oriented perfectionism (SOP) and socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP), Stoeber (2014 a) found OOP to show unique <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> with the Dark Triad personality traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy) and unique negative relationships with nurturance, intimacy, {{and social development}} goals. Aiming to expand on Stoeber’s findings, the present study examined 229 university students investigating the unique relationships of the three forms of perfectionism with humor styles, callous-unemotional-uncaring traits, social value orientations, self- and other-interest, and positive self-evaluations (positive self-regard, feeling superior to others). When multiple regressions were conducted controlling for the overlap between the three forms of perfectionism, OOP showed unique <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> with aggressive humor, uncaring traits, an individualistic orientation, and positive self-regard and unique negative relationships with a prosocial orientation and other-interest. In contrast, SOP showed unique <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> with affiliative humor and other-interest and unique negative relationships with aggressive humor, callous-uncaring traits, and a competitive orientation whereas SPP showed unique <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> with self-depreciating humor and unemotional traits and unique negative relationships with both forms of positive self-evaluations. The findings provide further evidence that OOP is a “dark” form of perfectionism positively associated with narcissistic, antisocial, and uncaring personality characteristics...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores positive {{communication in}} the workplace; namely, that communication which constitutes quality connections and <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> associated with <b>positive</b> organizational climate. High quality connections and <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> {{are some of the}} most important dynamics in work life and key to developing a respectful, affirming work climate. By coding their communicative elements, this study develops a new communicative model of <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> and quality connections at work which synthesizes contemporary models from the fields of organizational behavior, psychology, and organizational communication. It demonstrates the applicability of this new model with empirical evidence from working professionals’ stories and establishes the model’s link to organizational climate. 	Using an interpretive approach, I conducted 21 interviews with a diverse group of working adults about their best-work experiences. At the time of their best work experiences, working professionals ranged in age from 17 to 57, were employed in 11 different countries, and worked in nine industry sectors; 60 percent were managers. Qualitative content data analysis was utilized to analyze participants’ interviews. Findings provide convincing empirical evidence supporting the initial five proposed dimensions from past models and suggest two other dimensions absent from past models, positive spiral and adventure. These dimensions are key to quality connections and <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> at work. Thus, I propose the following dimensions for a new communicative model of <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> and quality connections at work: inclusion, instrumental, sensemaking, positive spiral, transparency, generative emotional resources, and adventure.
