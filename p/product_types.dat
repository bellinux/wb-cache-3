5000|$|In {{programming}} {{languages and}} <b>type</b> theory, a <b>product</b> of <b>types</b> is another, compounded, type in a structure.

An instance of a <b>product</b> <b>type</b> retains the fixed order, but otherwise may contain all possible instances of its primitive data types. The expression of an instance of a <b>product</b> <b>type</b> will be a tuple, and is called a [...] "tuple type" [...] of expression.

40|$|Green {{consumption}} behaviour {{has been}} widely investigated. Scholars have suggested that a luxury tourism <b>product</b> <b>type</b> can be a negative predictor of environmentally friendly consumption intentions. However, conditions under which green practices can be most effective {{still need to be}} discovered, particularly in the tourism industry. Therefore, the objective of this present research is to explore the moderation effect of benefit type (self versus other) and benefit timing (now versus future) in the relationship between tourism <b>product</b> <b>type</b> and environmentally friendly consumption intentions, respectively. Specifically, this thesis hypothesizes that a self-benefit appeal will lessen the negative relationship between luxury <b>product</b> <b>type</b> and consumers’ green consumption intentions. In addition, a now-time benefit appeal will strengthen the weak relationship between non-luxury <b>product</b> <b>type</b> and consumers’ green consumption intentions. The hypotheses are tested using two experimental studies in the hotel industry. By understanding the moderating roles benefit type and benefit timing play in the relationship between tourism <b>product</b> <b>type</b> and consumers’ green consumption intentions, the current research advances our understanding in how different types of incentives motivate green consumption behaviours, and provides managerial implications for promoting environmentally friendly practices and programs to tourists more effectively...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted {{to carry out a}} study entitled “Consumer perception towards buying China product among Gen Y”. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the key factors which influence the Gen Y consumer perception. The four independent variables are Country of Origin (COO), <b>product</b> <b>type,</b> <b>product</b> quality and price sensitivity. The sample size used for this study was 150. Data was obtained by using convenience sampling. The study seeks to identify the Gen Y consumer perception towards buying China product, to examine the relationship between independent variables (Country of Origin (COO), <b>product</b> <b>type,</b> <b>product</b> quality and price sensitivity) and dependent variable (Gen Y consumer perception) and to identify the most important variable on consumer perception towards buying China product among Gen Y. Finding shows that, there is a consumer perception towards buying China product and all independent variables (Country of Origin (COO), <b>product</b> <b>type,</b> <b>product</b> quality and price sensitivity) show significant relationship with the dependent variable (Gen Y consumer perception). The most significant variable on Gen Y consumer perception towards buying China <b>product)</b> is <b>product</b> <b>type</b> at at 0. 105 (10. 5 %).

In [6], Zheng has introduced a new kind of approximate identity kernels for the Walsh system—the kernels of <b>product</b> <b>type.</b> In the present paper we discuss the approximation properties of such <b>product</b> <b>type</b> kernels. Estimates of their moments as well as a direct approximation theorem are obtained. Then, to establish an inverse approximation theorem, we need the p-adic derivative of <b>product</b> <b>type</b> kernels and we estimate this derivative in L 1 -norm...|$|R
