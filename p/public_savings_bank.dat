At the federal state level, bank outreach shows South-North and West-East gaps. Combining regional and bank data at the district level for 2005, we examine the determinants of geographic and demographic branch penetration of the regional <b>savings</b> and cooperative <b>banks.</b> Both banking groups provide a larger branch penetration in more wealthy regions, but maintain {{a larger number of}} branches per inhabitant in less densely populated regions, easing access to retail banking services. With their comparatively large branch penetration in less wealthy regions, <b>public</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> help to reduce regional economic disparities.

The function of the head and Abteilung XXs was to maintain surveillance of religious communities; cultural and media establishments; alternative political parties; the GDR's many political establishment-affiliated mass social organisations; sport; and education and health services - effectively covering all aspects of civic life. The Stasi made use of the means available to them within, and as a circumstance of, the GDR's closed social system. An established, politically motivated collaborative network (politisch-operatives Zusammenwirken, or POZW) provided them with extensive opportunities for interference in such situations as the sanctioning of professionals and students, expulsion from associations and sports clubs, and occasional arrests by the Volkspolizei (the GDR's quasi-military national police). Refusal of permits for travel to socialist states, or denial of entry at Czechoslovakian and Polish border crossings where no visa requirement existed, were also arranged. The various collaborators (Partnern des operativen Zusammenwirkens) included branches of regional government, university and professional management, housing administrative bodies, the Sparkasse <b>public</b> <b>savings</b> <b>bank,</b> and in some cases head physicians.

40|$|Until about 25 years ago, {{almost all}} European {{countries}} had a so-called “three pillar” banking system comprising private <b>banks,</b> (<b>public)</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> and (mutual) cooperative banks.

25|$|Between 1978 and 1981, {{when the}} United States and Puerto Rican economies were {{suffering}} from high inflation rates, local banks were facing losses {{due to an}} increasing number in bankruptcies and unemployment rates, and some were forced to either close, merge, or sell portions of their assets. To counter these economic conditions, Westernbank applied conservative policies and banking practices that included tightening its credit lending criteria, assuming stricter loan to value ratios, favoring collateralized loans, and restructuring its assets and liabilities. In 1988, facing an impending recession in the US and Puerto Rico, Westernbank began applying the same conservative measures, to reduce inherent risks and protect the bank’s capital position. During the following years, between 1989 and 1990, private and <b>public</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> on the island, {{with the exception of}} Westernbank, faced losses, restated their financial statements, and saw significant decreases in their stock prices.|$|R

40|$|Germany's bank-based {{financial}} system provides {{a high level}} of financial inclusion, measured by bank outreach and use of financial services. However, the most vulnerable individuals and small enterprises in Germany tend to be excluded or credit constrained. The quality of financial inclusion is impaired by a low level of financial literacy, which is also concentrated among specific population subgroups. The high level of financial inclusion can be attributed to relationship lending by <b>public</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks,</b> credit cooperatives, <b>public</b> promotional banks, and guarantee banks using the "housebank" model, and financial consumer protection and credit reporting regulations and institutions. Programs involving microfinance institutions have been stopped. Financial inclusion of consumers with the aim of responsible finance may be improved by implementing the right to a basic bank account with an overdraft facility and protection against attachment, establishing public credit bureaus, redirecting banking regulation toward the protection of borrowers in long-term credit relationships, and strengthening financial education in schools.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview and an economic analysis {{of the development of}} the corporate governance of German banks since the 1950 s, highlighting peculiarities - as seen from the meanwhile prevailing standard model perspective - of the German case. These peculiarities refer to the specific German notion and legal-institutional regime of corporate governance in general {{as well as to the}} specific three-pillar structure of the German banking system. The most striking changes in the corporate governance of German banks during the past 50 years occurred in the case of the large shareholder-owned banks. For them, capital markets have become an important element of corporate governance, and their former orientation towards the interests of a broadly defined set of stakeholders has largely been replaced by a one-sided concentration on shareholders' interests. In contrast, the corporate governance regimes of the smaller local <b>public</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> and the local cooperative banks have remained virtually unchanged. They acknowledge a broader horizon of stakeholder interests and put an emphasis on monitoring. The Great Financial Crisis, beginning in 2007, has led to a considerable reassessment in the academic and political debate on bank governance. On an international level, it has revived the older notion that, in view of their high leverage and their innate complexity, banks are "special" and bank corporate governance also - and needs to be seen in this light, not least because research indicates that banks with a strong and one-sided shareholder orientation - and thus with what appears to be the best corporate governance according to the standard model - have suffered most in the crisis. In the German case, the crisis has shown that the smaller local banks have survived the crisis much better than large private and public banks, whose funding strongly depends on wholesale markets. This may point to certain advantages of their governance and ownership regimes. But the differences in the performance during the crisis years may also, or even more so, be a consequence of the business models of large vs small banks than of their different governance regime...|$|R
