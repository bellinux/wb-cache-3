40|$|Western man {{has great}} pride in his {{political}} institutions, which with some justification he holds {{to be the first}} to recognize the rule of law as superior to the rule of men. Thus it was with great confidence in his laws and rectitude of his ways that the first Europeans occupied Africa. The impact of this invasion upon the indigenous populations of Africa was tremendous. Every facet of Africa life, its social, political, economic and legal systems were affected. A study of Bantu customary law has to depend largely on secondary material, because until recent times, the law of Bantu Africa was largely unwritten. A number of monographs has been written by anthropologists in the field, but few of them give more than a chapter to an examination of the laws and their <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanction</b> as exercised by the courts. Yet it is the courts that are the precursors of legislation, and ultimately, legislation is the province of the state. 2 ̆ 2 it was the court really that launched the 2 ̆ 7 state 2 ̆ 7 for it was in the court that the sentiment of etatism, with all its devotion and loyalties, was first nurtured. 2 ̆...|$|E
30|$|A {{model of}} {{democratic}} quality analysis {{that is just}} as important is that developed by Leonardo Morlino. The author (Morlino 2003; Diamond and Morlino 2005) considers as “good democracy” and therefore “quality democracy”, first and foremost that system of government that fulfils citizens’ expectations as regards services for public decisions (quality in terms of results); secondly, regimes in which citizens, associations and communities enjoy full political equality and freedom (quality in terms of content); almost as a consequence, a legitimised democracy will see these same citizens enjoy the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanction</b> and assessment as concerns the way and degree to which the government provides them with freedom and equality, in agreement with rule of law criteria. Last but not least, quality democracy requires citizens, organisations and political parties to participate and compete to obtain elective offices which entrust them, not only with the power to hold office and take decisions, but also the responsibility of doing so. It should therefore be the citizens themselves who guarantee high levels of democratic quality, monitoring the efficiency and impartiality of law enforcement, efficacy of government decisions, political responsibility and the continuous responsiveness of the elected to their needs and requirements (quality in terms of procedure).|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at gaining a better {{understanding}} of how people fight for change collectively in societies that, unlike the United States, have less of democratic processes, and fundamental civil-political rights, and, of how law matters to their processes of doing so. It focuses on a particular minority group, gay people, in one particular society - Singapore, an Asian country with shades of authoritarianism - and explored how gay activists make sense of their grievances, strategize and take action to achieve their goals, and evaluate their own efforts. Based on systematic collection and analysis of data, including in-depth interviews with 100 activists, the study found: Unlike what sociology of law has learned in the United States, law - in the form of legal rights - is neither a strategic nor symbolic resource for these activists. The role of law in collective fights for social change goes beyond that of rights, which are stymied by the very legal system set up by the powers in control. Gay activists in Singapore regard law as a key source of oppression that obstructs their movement. The ruling party, in control for the past 45 years, has used law's <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanction</b> and delegitimization not only to deter legally, but also to cultivate cultural norms that discourage its people from coming together to agitate for social change, to use rights, and to ask for change in the form of rights, which are painted as confrontational, and detrimental to their society's stability and economic progress. Hence, these activists focus on achieving social changes outside formal law, such as gaining acceptance from society at large, and the state to come out, speak out, and have their grievances heard, and to organize, and assemble more publicly as a group of people with shared concerns and interests. Rather than turning to the law to aid their cause, they resist it through "pragmatic resistance," a strategy that precariously balances movement survival, and advancement. To "live to fight another day," they abide by the law, and oppressive cultural norms so as to avoid legal sanctions that could lead to the repression of their movement, and demise of small gains already accumulated, thus reversing their hard work; meanwhile, to advance their goals, without changing formal law they imperceptibly push the boundaries of those cultural norms - which are backed by legal sanctions - on what are socially and politically acceptable. They are conscious of, and accept, their strategy as a trade-off between the accumulation of informal gains outside formal law, and the reification and reinforcement of legal power that perpetuates the cultural legitimacy of the existing political order...|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} a causal explanation of adjudicative compliance that {{is distinct from}} both the court 2 ̆ 7 s threat <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> and its institutional legitimacy. The new mechanism for compliance is the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> adjudicative expression. The theory of 2 ̆ 2 expressive adjudication 2 ̆ 2 arises from a previously neglected synergy among three expressive concepts in game theory -correlated equilibria, focal points, and signals. The article identifies {{the circumstances in which}} adjudicative expression can, by itself, influence the behavior of existing disputants and of future potential disputants. In each case, ambiguity in the relevant facts or the concepts underlying intentional and spontaneous order can cause a conflict that clarifying expression resolves. This expressive power explains otherwise puzzling instances of compliance with tribunals that lack the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions,</b> and unifies theories of third-party norm enforcement with a theory <b>of</b> legal <b>sanctions.</b> Finally, the article examines certain normative implications of the expressive theory, including a novel function of adjudicative impartiality, a new justification for the system of public adjudication, and a trade-off between dispute resolution and dispute avoidance...|$|R

40|$|To avert {{environmental}} degradation, {{the governments}} of most nations have put in place environmental regulations to ensure sustainable development.

The aim of this paper was to study the role of communication in environmental inspection. Interviews were used as the principle method for data collection. Results obtained revealed that lack of communication led to conflict between the environmental inspectors and the economic operators. Strategies were used by both the inspectors and their clients to avoid conflict or to avoid misunderstanding escalating in to conflict. It was also revealed that the clients saw the inspectors as having <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctioning</b> them, and that trust existed between the inspectors and their clients. One other finding was that environmental inspections made use of participatory approach.

40|$|Frequent {{compliance}} with the adjudicative decisions of international institutions, such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), is puzzling because these institutions {{do not have the}} power domestic courts possess to impose sanctions. This Article uses game theory to explain the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> international adjudication via a set of expressive theories, showing how law can be effective without sanctions. When two parties disagree about conventions that arise in recurrent situations involving coordination, such as a convention of deferring to territorial claims of first possessors, the pronouncements of third-party legal decision makers-adjudicators [...] can influence their behavior in two ways. First, adjudicative expression may construct focal points that clarify ambiguities in the convention. Second, adjudicative expression may provide signals that cause parties to update their beliefs about the facts that determine how the convention applies. Even without the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> or legitimacy, an adjudicator 2 ̆ 7 s focal points and signals influence the parties 2 ̆ 7 behavior. After explaining the expressive <b>power</b> <b>of</b> adjudication, this Article applies the analysis to a range of third-party efforts to resolve international disputes, including a comprehensive review of the docket of the International Court of Justice. We find strong empirical support for the theory that adjudication works by clarifying ambiguous conventions or facts via cheap talk or signaling. We claim that the theory has broad implications for understanding the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> adjudication generally...|$|R

40|$|The <b>power</b> <b>of</b> moral <b>sanction,</b> as {{a penalty}} of {{conscience}} {{for violations of}} our sense of decency, based on {{a belief in the}} application of justice, has been essential to struggles for autonomy and dignity since the Middle Ages, and is, in my opinion, central to the struggle of rebuilding democratic society today.

This paper is my attempt to articulate the related aspects of leadership as demonstrated by the historical figures focused on in our readings and discussion. I begin with some general thoughts and impressions from our seminars, and proceed to particulars revolving around some of the figures examined. Moral sanction, alone, may be insufficient to constrain political violence or official repression, but it can bring significant pressures to bear on public behavior as well as within institutions under the control or influence of civil society. Indeed, both reform and revolutionary movements, as well as all forms of resistance in fundamental conflict with tyrannical powers, rely on moral sanction as an essential component of warfare. Resistance warfare may take different and multiple forms: war of position, based on...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we draw on {{established}} theoretical {{works in}} international political economy {{to compare the}} empirical impact of the threat <b>of</b> economic <b>sanctions</b> to the actual imposition <b>of</b> economic <b>sanctions</b> on international trade. Deepening the analysis, we analyze whether there are any differential effects when different instruments are employed. We also examine the international trade effect <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> at a more disaggregated products level. Thus, {{we are able to}} test whether sanctions have any adverse effect on essential commodities such as food and medical supplies in contravention of the Geneva Convention which stipulates the passage of such essential goods even in times <b>of</b> <b>sanction.</b> To achieve this, we use the gravity model as our empirical tool and recent detailed disaggregated data on sanctions spanning a long time series from 1960 to 2009. Our results show the impact <b>of</b> threatened <b>sanctions</b> differs qualitatively and quantitatively from imposed sanctions. Whereas imposed sanctions lead to a decrease in the trade flow between the sender and the target, a threat <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> leads to an increase in the trade flow. The positive impact of the threat may be due to economic agents in both the sender and its target resorting to stockpiling prior to the actual imposition <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> to minimize any adverse consequences <b>of</b> the <b>sanctions.</b> In addition, we find varying effects for the different sanction instruments.

It provides a general study on {{sanctions and}} South Africa that is not limited to economic factors alone. It develops a framework for analysis using legal, economic and political factors that form the components <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> such as the legality <b>of</b> <b>sanctions,</b> the actors which impose <b>sanctions,</b> types <b>of</b> <b>sanctions,</b> the purposes and targets <b>of</b> <b>sanctions,</b> and the response of targets. The effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> as an instrument of foreign policy is assessed, and factors that limit or enhance their effectiveness are identified. The investigation is in two parts. The first part uses the framework to examine international cases other than South Africa. The second part uses the same framework to examine sanctions against South Africa. Fundamental to the study is the fact that although sanctions are widely used in the conduct of international relations, the research on them is meagre in comparison with the available literature on other instruments of foreign policy such as diplomacy and war. The study finds that from a legal viewpoint there is no apparent rule in international law that prohibits the imposition <b>of</b> <b>sanctions.</b> For sanctions to succeed, sanctioners must commit themselves to making the sanctions work from the point of implementation and enforcement. Different types <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> achieve different levels of effectiveness. Even if sanctions do not fulfil their stated purpose, they do often fulfil other purposes which may, in fact, be more important. When faced with sanctions, targets invariably react to their imposition. The effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> cannot be measured by economic and stated objectives alone. When additional criteria are used, it is found that contrary to conventional wisdom, sanctions are an effective instrument of foreign policy. </p...|$|R
