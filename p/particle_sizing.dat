5000|$|The Aerodyne AMS {{provides}} real-time aerosol {{mass spectrometry}} analysis of size-resolved mass concentration of non-refractory components (Ex. organics, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium). The term non-refractory {{is assigned to}} species that evaporate rapidly at 600 °C under vacuum conditions (e.g. organic matter, NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4. [...] The schematic of a typical AMS {{is shown in the}} figure to the right. The Aerodyne AMS is made up of three sections; The aerosol inlet, the <b>particle</b> <b>sizing</b> chamber, and the particle detection chamber. The aerosol inlet has a flow limiting orifice entrance that is around 100 um in diameter. Once in the chamber the sample goes through aerodynamic focusing lens system, which consist of several orifice lenses that are mount in sequence of decreasing inner diameter. [...] The lens focuses the particles into a narrow particle beam.The beam now travels through the <b>particle</b> <b>sizing</b> chamber where the particle aerodynamic diameter is measured. The <b>particle</b> <b>sizing</b> chamber is made up of a flight tube maintained at (~ 10-5 torr).

Using the velocity and the particles diameter is obtained. [...] As the particle beam exit the flight tube, it enters the particle composition detection chamber. In this section the particles collide with a heated tungsten element (~600 °C). At this tungsten element non-refractory components of the particle beam are flash vaporized, and then ionized by EI.

40|$|The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution}} and mean <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{are the most}} important characteristics in particulate or powder technology. Various approaches have been used to measure <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions. For solid-liquid systems, the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions have been measured by the Stokes diameter. The Andreasen pipette method, sedimentation balance method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. have been used to measure the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution in suspensions. These methods measure the migration velocities of particles in solution, and then <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> is calculated using Stokes formula. However, all these methods are time consuming and require special skills. On the other hand, a different principle can be used to analyze the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering method, and a Coulter counter method. These methods require numerous samples to accurately determine the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution. Although the laser diffraction/scattering and Coulter counter methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, they require extremely expensive equipment. Hence, a simple and cost effective method to determine the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution is highly demanded. The investigation of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions by the buoyancy weighing-bar method which is a novel method in <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution measurement have been done for several samples particles of Japan Industrial Standard (Test Powders 1 and Test Powders 2), Sumitomo 3 M (glass beads K 1, K 37, S 60 HS), polystyrene beads (spherical), nylon beads (cylindrical), etc. The influence of solid concentration, influence of shape and size of weighing bar and influence of vessel size also had been investigated in <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution measurement by the buoyancy weighing-bar method. The result data obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method were comparable with the others <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> analyzer, such as sedimentation balance method, Andreasen pipette method, Coulter counter method, microscopy and the laser diffraction/scattering method. The buoyancy weighing-bar method is suitable for measuring the settling <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution and}} the floating <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution. The buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to measure the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution in Stokes region and in Allen region. The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to estimate the smaller <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> by using the Rosin-Rammler distribution. Theory was rediscussed and the new mean <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> was defined. Beside, the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to determine the mean <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> for a ternary mixture and multi-component particles in a short time. This ability is very useful in the powder industry. Similar to other methods to analyze <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> the buoyancy weighing-bar method is accurate in an initially homogeneous suspension. Because the buoyancy weighing-bar method apparatus can be made by hand, it is also economical.
