The items, spells and equipment available to the player are based upon those in the original game, and although a large number have been omitted along with optional characters and some side quests, the original story was reproduced in very minute detail. The game was received with mixed reception, cited as an impressive achievement {{but at the same}} time criticized for its difficulty and choice of a target console.|$|E
5|$|During the 1968 Democratic Convention, {{a motion}} {{had been passed}} to {{establish}} a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the Commission on <b>Party</b> <b>Structure</b> and Delegate Selection, {{also known as the}} McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and primaries, and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms was a massive {{increase in the number of}} presidential primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well. The U.S.presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.|$|E

At {{the time of the}} second COPWE congress, half of provinces had district-level <b>party</b> <b>structures.</b> By June 1982 there were 436 basic party units across the country.

5|$|Many of Khrushchev's {{innovations}} {{were reversed}} after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, {{as was the}} division in the <b>Party</b> <b>structure</b> between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program {{for high school students}} was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. He began to change the economic base of the country, away from heavy industry beginning light, consumer industries. People were required to register to attend, and church-going would bar you from party membership, from promotion, from better housing and your children {{would not be able to}} get into the better schools.|$|E
5|$|The nomenklatura {{political}} elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within the ruling <b>party</b> <b>structure,</b> in all branches {{of central and}} local government and in institutions of all kinds. The nomenklatura members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management or education. For the party, the privileged nomenklatura layer was maintained to assure the proper placement {{of people who were}} ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the revisionist dissidents Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political bureaucracy for its own sake. The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted nomenklatura and the security services were resented.|$|E
5|$|The power {{contest between}} the allied Military Committee and the Regionalists against the National Command was fought out within the <b>party</b> <b>structure.</b> However, the Military Committee and the Regionalists managed {{to turn the}} <b>party</b> <b>structure</b> on its head. At the 2nd Regional Congress (held in March 1965), {{it was decided to}} endorse the {{principle}} that the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command would be the ex officio head of state, and the Regional Command acquired the power to appoint the prime minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff, and the top military commanders. This change curtailed the powers of the National Command, who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs. In response, at the 8th National Congress (April 1965) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the Military Committee and the Regionalists, but was persuaded not to by fellow National Command members – most notably by a Lebanese member, Jibran Majdalani, and a Saudi member, Ali Ghannam – because it could lead to the removal of the party's civilian leadership, as had occurred in the Iraqi Regional Branch. Because of this decision, Aflaq was voted from office as Secretary General, to be succeeded by fellow National Command member Munif al-Razzaz. Razzaz was a Syrian-born Jordanian who was not rooted enough in party politics to solve the crisis, even if under his command several joint meetings of the National and Regional Commands took place. Not longer after Aflaq's loss of office, Hafiz, the Secretary of the Regional Command, changed his allegiance to support the National Command. While Hafiz was the de jure leader of Syria (he held the offices of Regional Command secretary, Chairman of the Presidential Council, prime minister and commander-in-chief), it was Jadid, the Assistant Secretary General of the Regional Command, who was the de facto leader of Syria.|$|E

5|$|In March 2005, Mesa resigned, {{citing the}} {{pressure}} of Morales and the cocalero road blocks and riots. Amid fears of civil war, Eduardo Rodríguez became President of a transitional government, preparing Bolivia for a general election in December 2005. Hiring the Peruvian Walter Chávez as its campaign manager, the MAS electoral campaign was based on Salvador Allende's successful campaign in the Chilean presidential election, 1970. Measures were implemented to institutionalize the <b>party</b> <b>structure,</b> giving it greater independence from the social movement; this was done to allow Morales and other MAS leaders to respond quickly to new developments without the lengthy process of consulting the bases, and to present a more moderate image away from the bases' radicalism. Although he had initially hoped for a female running mate, Morales eventually chose Marxist intellectual Álvaro García Linera as his Vice Presidential candidate, with some Bolivian press speculating as to a romantic relationship between the two. MAS' primary opponent was Jorge Quiroga and his center-right Social and Democratic Power, whose campaign was centered in Santa Cruz and which advocated continued neo-liberal reform; Quiroga accused Morales of promoting the legalization of cocaine and being a puppet for Venezuela.|$|E

The League also led a demonstration against the detonation of French nuclear weapons in the Sahara. Cudjoe was eventually demoted with the consolidation of national women's groups, and marginalized within the <b>Party</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E

25|$|In its {{original}} form, the Bloc Québécois was a loose alliance of parliamentarians {{rather than a}} formal political party. Plamondon {{was one of the}} first Bloquistes to promote the creation of a strong party organization to challenge the Progressive Conservative Party's Quebec machine in the next federal election. Others, including Lucien Bouchard, initially favoured a weaker <b>party</b> <b>structure</b> that would simply allow Bloc candidates to have their party designation appear on the ballot. The vision favoured by Plamondon ultimately won out, and the Bloc became a strong political organization throughout Quebec.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} interest in the SLP in the late 1960s was not a permanent growth spurt. New recruits subscribed to the anti-authoritarian views {{of the time and}} wanted their voices to have an equal status with the old-time party workers. Newcomers felt that the party was too controlled by a small clique, resulting in widespread discontent. In 1976, the SLP nominated its last Presidential candidate and has run few campaigns since then. In 1980, members of the SLP in Minnesota, claiming that the party had become bureaucratic and authoritarian in its internal <b>party</b> <b>structure,</b> split from the party and formed the New Union Party.|$|E

25|$|In 1882, {{he changed}} his party's name to the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP). A central aspect of Parnell's reforms was a new {{selection}} procedure to ensure the professional selection of party candidates committed to taking their seats. In 1884, he imposed a firm 'party pledge' which obliged party MPs to vote as a bloc in parliament on all occasions. The creation of a strict party whip and formal <b>party</b> <b>structure</b> was unique in party politics at the time. The Irish Parliamentary Party is generally seen as the first modern British political party, its efficient structure and control contrasting with the loose rules and flexible informality found in the main British parties, which came to model themselves on the Parnellite model. The Representation of the People Act 1884 enlarged the franchise, and the IPP increased its number of MPs from 63 to 85 in the 1885 election.|$|E

500|$|Around 1957, the ACWF {{entered a}} new phase, {{dropping}} [...] "Democratic" [...] from its name, as the federation was formally incorporated in the <b>party</b> <b>structure.</b> It entered the administrative hierarchy of the state, and declared itself a mass organization. Formal inclusion into the state apparatus altered some of {{the duties of the}} ACWF. The ACWF was now responsible for spreading political propaganda among women, guaranteeing the inclusion of women in political campaigns, marketing the campaigns to Chinese women, and organizing parades, meetings and demonstrations to encourage female participation in campaigning. The CPC sought to use the ACWF to promote its gender-specific ideas and create a formal channel to mobilize women.
