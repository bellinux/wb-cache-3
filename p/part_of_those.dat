As a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roadways using a metric called average annual daily traffic. This is a calculation of the traffic levels for a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that the highest traffic volume along M-43 was east of the I-96/I-69 interchange at 38,927vehicles per day. The highest commercial traffic was west of the interchange at 645trucks daily. The lowest volumes were at Woodland with only 1,700vehicles and 120trucks traveling along that section of the highway daily.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was signposted in 1919, the north–south highway through Saginaw {{was part of}} the {{original}} M-10. This highway was later redesignated as part of US23 when the United States Numbered Highway System was created in 1926. US23 was initially routed on the western side of the Saginaw River through the city, but it was moved in 1929 to run along the eastern side. In 1953, the initial eastern bypass of Saginaw was built as a two-lane highway, and the former routing through downtown was redesignated Bus. US23. This bypass was upgraded in 1961 to a full freeway as part of I-75/US23, and the business loop through downtown was redesignated BL I-75. In 1971, I-675 was completed, and BL I-75 was decommissioned through Saginaw. The segments of the business loop that were concurrent with M-13, M-46 or M-81 remained <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> state highways, but the rest of BL I-75 was returned to local control.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact. The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E
