5|$|Atoms of {{the same}} element have {{the same number of}} <b>protons,</b> called the atomic number. Within a single element, the number of {{neutrons}} may vary, determining the isotope of that element. The total number of <b>protons</b> and neutrons determine the nuclide. The number of neutrons relative to the <b>protons</b> determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay.|$|E
5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} <b>protons</b> and typically a similar number of neutrons. <b>Protons</b> and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The <b>protons</b> have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of <b>protons</b> and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than <b>protons,</b> then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E
5|$|Pumping <b>protons</b> {{out of the}} {{mitochondria}} {{creates a}} proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient. This force drives <b>protons</b> back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase. The flow of <b>protons</b> makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate– turning it into ATP.|$|E

5|$|The JINR team {{sought to}} use {{berkelium}} because calcium-48, the isotope of calcium {{used in the}} beam, has 20 <b>protons</b> and 28 neutrons, making a neutron–proton ratio of 1.4; {{and it is the}} lightest stable or near-stable nucleus with such a large neutron excess. The second-lightest such nucleus, palladium-110 (46 <b>protons,</b> 64 neutrons, neutron–proton ratio of 1.391), is much heavier. Thanks to the neutron excess, the resulting nuclei were expected to be heavier and closer to the sought-after island of stability. Of the aimed for 117 <b>protons,</b> calcium has 20, and thus they needed to use berkelium, which has 97 <b>protons</b> in its nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} of an atom {{are attracted}} to the <b>protons</b> in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force. The <b>protons</b> and neutrons in the nucleus {{are attracted to}} each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged <b>protons</b> from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane, the lipid-soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10 (Q) carries both electrons and <b>protons</b> by a redox cycle. This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two <b>protons,</b> it becomes {{reduced to the}} ubiquinol form (QH2); when QH2 releases two electrons and two <b>protons,</b> it becomes oxidized back to the ubiquinone (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced {{on one side of}} the membrane and QH2 oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle <b>protons</b> across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as menaquinone, in addition to ubiquinone.|$|E

5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as <b>protons</b> and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, <b>protons</b> are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E

50|$|<b>Proton</b> {{emission}} (also {{known as}} <b>proton</b> radioactivity) {{is a rare}} type of radioactive decay in which a <b>proton</b> is ejected from a nucleus. <b>Proton</b> emission can occur from high-lying excited states in a nucleus following a beta decay, {{in which case the}} process is known as beta-delayed <b>proton</b> emission, or can occur from the ground state (or a low-lying isomer) of very proton-rich nuclei, in which case the process is very similar to alpha decay. For a <b>proton</b> to escape a nucleus, the <b>proton</b> separation energy must be negative - the <b>proton</b> is therefore unbound, and tunnels out of the nucleus in a finite time. <b>Proton</b> emission is not seen in naturally occurring isotopes; <b>proton</b> emitters can be produced via nuclear reactions, usually using linear particle accelerators.|$|R
50|$|<b>Proton</b> captures at {{extremely}} high <b>proton</b> densities are called rapid <b>proton</b> capture processes. They are {{distinct from the}} p-process {{not only by the}} required high <b>proton</b> density but also by the fact that very short-lived radionuclides are involved and the reaction path is located close to the <b>proton</b> drip line. Rapid <b>proton</b> capture processes are the rp-process, the &nu;p-process, and the pn-process.|$|R
5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through this complex, four <b>protons</b> are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, {{but it seems}} to involve conformational changes in complex I that cause the protein to bind <b>protons</b> on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two <b>protons</b> are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E

5|$|In eukaryotes, the enzymes in this {{electron}} {{transport system}} use the energy {{released from the}} oxidation of NADH to pump <b>protons</b> across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This causes <b>protons</b> to build up in the intermembrane space, and generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The energy stored in this potential is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation in the eukaryotic mitochondrion is the best-understood example of this process. The mitochondrion is present in almost all eukaryotes, {{with the exception of}} anaerobic protozoa such as Trichomonas vaginalis that instead reduce <b>protons</b> to hydrogen in a remnant mitochondrion called a hydrogenosome.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Proton</b> logo in 1983 was a {{dark blue}} shield which {{encompassed}} a yellow crescent positioned below a yellow fourteen-pointed star, {{in reference to the}} Malaysian flag and coat of arms. However, this emblem was only used for <b>Proton</b> cars which were sold domestically. <b>Proton</b> cars exported to other markets received different badge designs. In 2000, the new <b>Proton</b> logo was used on the <b>Proton</b> Waja which launched in that year. It featured a stylised yellow tiger head on a green roundel embossed upon a dark blue shield, with the <b>Proton</b> name in yellow capital letters in Frutiger font. The standard text representation of the <b>Proton</b> name was also changed from the lowercase italic text [...] "proton" [...] to the uppercase [...] "PROTON". All <b>Proton</b> cars manufactured after 2000 carried the new badge, both in the domestic and export markets.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the fundamental understanding of the <b>proton</b> transfer process and translating the knowledge into design/development of new organic materials for efficient non-aqueous <b>proton</b> transport. For example, what controls the shuttling of a <b>proton</b> between two basic sites ? a) Distance between two groups? or b) the basicity? c) What {{is the impact of}} protonation on molecular conformation when the basic sites are attached to rigid scaffolds? For this purpose, we developed several tunable <b>proton</b> sponges and studied <b>proton</b> transfer in these scaffolds theoretically as well as experimentally. Next we moved our attention to understand long-range <b>proton</b> conduction or <b>proton</b> transport. We introduced liquid crystalline (LC) <b>proton</b> conductor based on triphenylene molecule and established that activation energy barrier for <b>proton</b> transport is lower in the LC phase compared to the crystalline phase. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of several critical factors: the choice of the <b>proton</b> transferring groups, mobility of the charge carriers, intrinsic vs. extrinsic charge carrier concentrations and the molecular architectures on long-range <b>proton</b> transport. The outcome of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of non-aqueous <b>proton</b> transfer process and aid the design of next generation <b>proton</b> exchange membrane (PEM) for fuel cell...|$|R

5|$|The known {{isotopes}} {{of plutonium}} range in mass number from 228 to 247.

The primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is beta emission, mostly forming americium (95 <b>protons)</b> isotopes as decay products. Plutonium-241 is the parent isotope of the neptunium decay series, decaying to americium-241 via beta emission.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} <b>protons</b> and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun <b>protons</b> require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of <b>protons</b> in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E
5|$|The proton, the electron, and {{the neutron}} are {{classified}} as fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple <b>protons,</b> from occupying the same quantum state at the same time.
