5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 9 to 12% {{of people}} (632million) have LBP {{at any given}} point in time, and nearly 25% report having it at some point over any one-month period. About 40% of people have LBP at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> with {{estimates}} as high as 80% among people in the developed world. Difficulty most often begins between 20 and 40years of age. Men and women are equally affected.

5|$|In the 21st century, {{approximately}} 75percent of Finnhorses {{are used}} at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> for harness racing, with riding being {{the second most}} popular use. Many Finnhorses have multiple uses, such as starting their career in harness racing and later moving on to riding. Finnhorses perform both at their own competitions and in open, all-breed classes in dressage, show jumping, and eventing. They are also used for endurance riding, western riding and combined driving. Approximately 1,000 Finnhorses are used in riding schools and in riding therapy. They are also popular as pleasure horses.|$|E

5|$|Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did {{not give}} up her own life for his. In fact, they {{spent a great deal}} of time away from each other and {{maintained}} a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> and {{is the most common}} cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E

5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> and that 72% of Catholics believed that one {{could be a good}} Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently {{between the ages of}} 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis occurs between 20–30 times less frequently. They {{are the most}} common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are between 7-10%. Asymptomatic bacteria in the urine occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan and at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue {{is derived from the}} ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus {{at the base of the}} tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E

2500|$|Bisexuality is romantic {{or sexual}} {{attraction}} to males and females. The American Psychological Association states that [...] "sexual orientation falls along a continuum.
