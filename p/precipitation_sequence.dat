Precipitation and dissolution events observed by microcalorimetry and TEM have been related {{to changes in the}} yield strength during ageing of these alloys. Two types of precipitation mechanisms have been observed: precipitates were formed heterogeneously on dislocation loops and helices, but a homogeneous <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequence</b> in the matrix occurred as well. It has been shown that a long (30 min at 525 degrees C) solutionizing treatment favours more the homogeneous <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequence.</b> After a short (10 s at 525 degrees C) solutionizing treatment a more extensive heterogeneous precipitation on dislocations has been observed. In both cases, the rapid initial hardening of the alloy is attributed mainly to cluster - dislocation interactions. The peak of hardness which, after a short solutionizing treatment, is caused by the homogeneous precipitation of S' phase is rather modest compared to the one after a long solutionizing treatment. In the latter case the peak of hardness is additionally influenced by a massive homogeneous precipitation of fine S " and S' phases.

40|$|Continuous sub-daily <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequences</b> are {{required}} for many hydrological applications. Unfortunately sub-daily precipitation data is often unavailable due to the paucity of measurements. To overcome this, statistical methods are used to synthetically generate continuous <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequences.</b> These methods generally assume the climate is stationary, that is, the future climate will behave {{in the same way}} as the past climate. Anthropogenic climate change implies that the assumption of stationarity is no longer valid. Sub-daily precipitation is expected to change with greater precipitation intensities associated with warmer temperatures, causing greater flood related extremes and disasters. This thesis examines the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature and proposes to use the relationship between precipitation and temperature to simulate sub-daily precipitation for a future warmer climate. Quantile regression is presented as a superior alternative to current binning techniques in quantifying the relationship between precipitation and temperature. It is found the relationship between precipitation intensity and temperature is modulated by storm duration. Using precipitation from an accumulation of differing storm duration results in a different relationship to when individual storm durations are considered. It is shown that, at higher temperatures, storm patterns are temporally less uniform with more precipitation occurring in a shorter duration. Likewise, the spatial pattern of precipitation also changes with more moisture concentrated in the storm centre at higher temperatures. The results suggest a change to flood peaks at higher temperatures, however, an investigation of the scaling relationship of streamflow and temperature presented little evidence of greater discharges at higher temperatures. It is concluded that antecedent conditions are likely to dominate flooding in a future climate with only the most extreme storms dominated by changes to the flood causing precipitation. Two non-stationary Poisson process continuous sub-daily precipitation models are presented. The first is conditioned on climatic state and the second on temperature, presenting methodologies that can be used to generate <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequences</b> that better reflect the future climate.

40|$|Downscaling to station-scale hydrologic {{variables}} from large-scale atmospheric variables simulated {{by general}} circulation models (GCMs) is usually necessary {{to assess the}} hydrologic impact of climate change. This work presents CRF-downscaling, a new probabilistic downscaling method that represents the daily <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequence</b> as a conditional random field (CRF). The conditional distribution of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequence</b> at a site, given the daily atmospheric (large-scale) variable sequence, is modeled as a linear chain CRF. CRFs do not make assumptions on independence of observations, which gives them flexibility in using high-dimensional feature vectors. Maximum likelihood parameter estimation for the model is performed using limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimization. Maximum a posteriori estimation is {{used to determine the}} most likely <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequence</b> for a given set of atmospheric input variables using the Viterbi algorithm. Direct classification of dry/wet days as well as precipitation amount is achieved within a single modeling framework.

The Cu:Mg ratio was between 0. 14 and 0. 29 (in mass) and the ageing temperatures {{were in the}} range 60 - 180 degrees C. Strengthening curves during ageing at 140 to 180 degrees C show several typical stages, namely an initial jump compared to the as-annealed state, followed by a linear increase and finally a peak in strength which appears after considerable ageing time. A two-fold <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequence</b> has been confirmed. On one side S "- and further on S'-phase (precursors of the Al 2 MgCu phase) precipitate heterogeneously on dislocation loops and helices, {{on the other hand}} a homogeneous <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequence</b> in the matrix of the type: Cu/Mg clusters (GPB zones) [...] > S " [...] > S' has also been observed. The ageing at 60 degrees C follows the same scheme but at much lower speed, so up to three months only the first precipitation stages (i. e. clusters in the matrix and S " on dislocations) were found. An increased amount of Cu increases the bake hardening response, not only at the peak but over the whole ageing curve. Increasing the amount of Mg (or lowering the Cu:Mg ratio), retards the <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequence</b> which increases the stability against natural ageing. It does not severely decrease the precipitation hardening response since for this practical application the hardening is given by the initial jump. This last appears promptly in the first minutes of ageing at 140 - 180 degrees C, irrespective of the Mg content. Decreasing the baking temperature from 180 to 140 degrees C is also not affecting the first two hardening stages which means that traditional baking temperatures (160 - 180 degrees C) can be decreased to 140 degrees C and may be less. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A geochemical {{assessment}} {{was conducted at}} three permeable reactive barrier sites to evaluate performance and longevity issues. The {{assessment was}} carried out at former NAS Moffett Field (California), Dover AFB (Delaware), and former Lowry AFB (Colorado). These sites were selected because they differ in barrier design, contaminant types, hydrology, and geochemistry, and therefore represent {{a number of factors}} that could have bearing on long-term performance. Analysis of groundwater and iron cores were the primary means used to evaluate the potential for precipitate formation, which could affect both the surface reactivity of the iron as well as the hydraulic conductivity of the reactive cell. In addition, geochemical modeling with PHREEQC and Geochemist’s Workbench was used to simulate iron reactivity {{in each of the three}} groundwater types and assist in understanding <b>precipitation</b> <b>sequences.</b> The study focused on behavior of native inorganic constituents of the groundwaters, such as dissolved oxygen, calcium, magnesium, alkalinity, and sulfate, as potentially able to influence precipitation within the reactive cells. In addition, long-term accelerated column tests are currently underway using two different iron-groundwater systems which model the Moffett Field and Lowry barriers. Results of the column tests will assist in understanding precipitation kinetics and physicochemica...|$|R
