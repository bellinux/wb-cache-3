It belongs to the Fanconi anaemia complementation group (FANC) family of genes of which 12 complementation groups are currently recognized and is hypothesised to operate as a <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> or a cell cycle checkpoint. FANCA proteins are involved in inter-strand DNA cross-link repair and in the maintenance of normal chromosome stability that regulates the differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells into mature blood cells.|$|E
5000|$|PCNA is also {{involved}} in the DNA damage tolerance pathway known as <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> (PRR). In PRR, there are two sub-pathways:(1) a translesion pathway, which is carried out by specialised DNA polymerases {{that are able to}} incorporate damaged DNA bases into their active sites (unlike the normal replicative polymerase, which stall), and hence bypass the damage, and(2) a proposed [...] "template switch" [...] pathway that is thought to involve damage bypass by recruitment of the homologous recombination machinery.PCNA is pivotal to the activation of these pathways and the choice as to which pathway is utilised by the cell. PCNA becomes post-translationally modified by ubiquitin. Mono-ubiquitin of lysine number 164 on PCNA activates the translesion synthesis pathway. Extension of this mono-ubiquitin by a non-canonical lysine-63-linked poly-ubiquitin chain on PCNA is thought to activate the template switch pathway. Furthermore, sumoylation (by small ubiquitin-like modifier, SUMO) of PCNA lysine-164 (and to a lesser extent, lysine-127) inhibits the template switch pathway. This antagonistic effect occurs because sumoylated PCNA recruits a DNA helicase called Srs2, which has a role in disrupting Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments fundamental for initiation of homologous recombination.|$|E
40|$|Accurate DNA {{replication}} {{is crucial}} for cell survival {{and the maintenance of}} genome stability. Cells have developed mechanisms to cope with the frequent genotoxic injuries that arise from both endogenous and environmental sources. Lesions encountered during DNA replication are often tolerated by <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> mechanisms that prevent replication fork collapse and avert the formation of DNA double strand breaks. There are two predominant <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> pathways, trans-lesion synthesis (TLS) and template switching (TS). TLS is a DNA damage-tolerant and low-fidelity mode of DNA synthesis that utilizes specialized ‘Y-family’ DNA polymerases to replicate damaged templates. TS, however, is an error-free ‘DNA damage avoidance’ mode of DNA synthesis that uses a newly synthesized sister chromatid as a template in lieu of the damaged parent strand. Both TLS and TS pathways are tightly controlled signaling cascades that integrate DNA synthesis with the overall DNA damage response and are thus crucial for genome stability.

Nature has provided a set of proteins that support DNA polymerases in performing processive, accurate and rapid DNA synthesis.

The SRS 2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a 3 ′– 5 ′ DNA helicase that functions both in {{homologous recombination}} repair and in <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair.</b> This study identifies and characterizes the SRS 2 homolog in Neurospora crassa, {{which we call}} mus- 50. A knockout mutant of N. crassa, mus- 50, is sensitive to several DNA-damaging agents and genetic analyses indicate that it is epistatic with mei- 3 (RAD 51 homolog), mus- 11 (RAD 52 homolog), mus- 48 (RAD 55 homolog) and mus- 49 (RAD 57 homolog), suggesting a role for mus- 50 in homologous recombination repair. However, epistasis evidence has presented that MUS 50 does not participate in <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> in N. crassa. Also, the N. crassa mus- 25 (RAD 54 homolog) mus- 50 double mutant is viable, which {{is in contrast to}} the lethal phenotype of the equivalent rad 54 srs 2 mutant in S. cerevisiae.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in mammalian chromosomes has not remained fully explored. There is {{evidence to show that}} the double-strand exchange appears to be more likely as the mechanism than the single-strand exchange. It has been postulated that the formation of SCE is associated with a process such as the <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> that is possibly attributed to a single strand exchange (Kato 1973; Sobel 1972). On the other hand, Kihlman (1975), in Vicia faba treated with thiotepa, failed to detect the single strand exchanges between the double DNA helices in the sister chromatids at chromosomal level. Thus, the possible relation-ship of SCE to <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> of DNA damage has been a matter of controversy.

40|$|Bulk replicative DNA {{synthesis}} in eukaryotes {{is highly}} accurate and efficient, {{primarily because of}} two DNA polymerases (Pols) : Pols d and e. The high fidelity of these enzymes is due to their intrinsic base selectivity and proofreading exonuclease activity which, when coupled with <b>post-replication</b> mismatch <b>repair,</b> helps to maintain human mutation rates at less than one mutation per genome duplication. Conditions that reduce polymerase fidelity result in increased mutagenesis {{and can lead to}} cancer in mice. Whereas yeast Pol e has been well characterized, human Pol e remains poorly understood. Here, we present the first report on the fidelity of human Pol e. We find that human Pol e carries out DNA synthesis with high fidelity, {{even in the absence of}} its 30 ! 50 exonucleolytic proofreading and is significantly more accurate than yeast Pol e. Though its spectrum of errors is similar to that of yeast Pol e, there are several notable exceptions. These include a preference of the human enzyme for T!A over A!T transversions.

40|$|DNA repair is {{regulated}} {{on many levels}} by ubiquitination. In order to identify novel connections between DNA repair pathways and ubiquitin signaling, we used mass spectrometry to identify proteins which interact with lysine 6 -linked polyubiquitin chains. From this proteomic screen, we identified the DNA repair protein Werner helicase interacting protein 1 (WRNIP 1), along with nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP 1), as novel ubiquitin-interacting proteins. We found that a small zinc finger domain at WRNIP 1 's N terminus is sufficient and necessary for non-covalent ubiquitin binding. This ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain binds polyubiquitin, but not monoubiquitin, and appears to show no specificity for polyubiquitin chain linkage. A homologous zinc finger domain in RAD 18 also binds polyubiquitin, suggesting a wider role for the UBZ domain in DNA repair. WRNIP 1 's ubiquitin-binding function, along with its previously established ATPase activity, suggests that WRNIP 1 {{plays a role in}} the metabolism of ubiquitinated proteins. Supporting this model, deletion of MGS 1, the yeast homolog of WRNIP 1, slows the rate of ubiquitin turnover, rendering yeast resistant to cycloheximide. We also find that WRNIP 1 is heavily modified with ubiquitin and SUMO, revealing complex layers in the involvement of ubiquitin pathway proteins in the regulation of DNA repair. WRNIP 1 's novel ubiquitin-binding ability sheds light on the role of UBZ domain-containing proteins in <b>post-replication</b> DNA <b>repair...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{budding yeast}} Srs 2 protein {{possesses}} 3 ′ to 5 ′ DNA helicase activity and channels untimely recombination to <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> by removing Rad 51 from ssDNA. However, it also promotes recombination via a synthesis-dependent strand-annealing pathway (SDSA). Furthermore, at the replication fork, Srs 2 {{is required for}} fork progression and prevents the instability of trinucleotide repeats. To better understand the multiple roles of the Srs 2 helicase during these processes, we analysed the ability of Srs 2 to bind and unwind various DNA substrates that mimic structures present during DNA replication and recombination. While leading or lagging strands were efficiently unwound, the presence of ssDNA binding protein RPA presented an obstacle for Srs 2 translocation. We also tested the preferred directionality of unwinding of various substrates and studied the effect of Rad 51 and Mre 11 proteins on Srs 2 helicase activity.

Repair by cells {{deficient in}} polymerase I and in polymerases I and II is inhibited by 1 -β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine at 43 °, whereas that by cells deficient in polymerase III is {{insensitive to the}} inhibitor. When both DNA polymerases I and III are deficient, both excision repair and <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> are greatly reduced at 43 °, and the residual repair capability is inhibited by 1 -β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Very little dark repair is observed in cells deficient in DNA polymerases I, II, and III, and the DNA is extensively degraded. These results suggest that either DNA polymerase I or DNA polymerase III is required for complete and efficient repair, and that when both DNA polymerases I and III are deficient, DNA polymerase II mediates a limited, incomplete dark repair of UV-damaged DNA. DNA polymerases I and III thus appear to be important enzymes in both DNA replication and DNA dark repair...|$|E

The interactions of the inhibitory effects of the uvrD, exaA, and recB mutations and chloramphenicol treatment were determined by examining the survival and repair characteristics of the several multiple mutants. The survival results suggest that the <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> process in uvrB strains may be subdivided into at least five different branches. These include three branches that are blocked by the exrA, recB, or uvrD mutation, a fourth branch that is blocked by any of these mutations and is also sensitive to chloramphenicol treatment, and at least one additional branch that is not sensitive to either of these mutations or to chloramphenicol treatment.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} semiconservative quasispecies {{equations}} {{to account for}} arbitrary <b>post-replication</b> lesion <b>repair</b> efficiency. Such an extension could be an important tool for understanding processes such as cancer development and stem cell growth. Starting from the quasispecies dynamics over the space of genomes, we derive an equivalent dynamics over the space of ordered sequence pairs. From this set of equations, {{we are able to}} derive the infinite sequence length form of the dynamics for a class of ``master-genome''-based fitness landscapes. We use these equations to solve for a ``generalized'' single-fitness-peak landscape, where the master genome can sustain a maximum number of lesions and remain viable. The central pattern that emerges from our studies is that imperfect lesion repair often leads to increased mutational robustness over semiconservative replication with completely efficient lesion repair. The {{reason for this is that}} imperfect lesion repair breaks some of the correlation between the parent and daughter strands, thereby preventing replication errors from destroying the information in the original genome. The result is a delayed error catastrophe over that expected from the original semiconservative quasispecies model. In particular, we show that when only of the strands is necessary for conferring viability, then, when lesion repair is turned off, a semiconservatively replicating system becomes an effectively conservatively replicating one.

The FA proteins (FANCs) are implicated in DNA repair, although the precise {{mechanisms by which}} FANCs process DNA lesions are not fully understood. An epistatic relationship between the FA pathway and translesion synthesis (TLS, a <b>post-replication</b> DNA <b>repair</b> mechanism) has been suggested, but the basis for cross-talk between the FA and TLS pathways is poorly understood. We show here that ectopic overexpression of the E 3 ubiquitin ligase Rad 18 (a central regulator of TLS) induces DNA damage-independent mono-ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (a known Rad 18 substrate) and FANCD 2. Conversely, DNA damage-induced mono-ubiquitination of both PCNA and FANCD 2 is attenuated in Rad 18 -deficient cells, demonstrating that Rad 18 contributes to activation of the FA pathway. WT Rad 18 but not an E 3 ubiquitin ligase-deficient Rad 18 C 28 F mutant fully complements both PCNA ubiquitination and FANCD 2 activation in Rad 18 -depleted cells. Rad 18 -induced mono-ubiquitination of FANCD 2 is not observed in FA core complex-deficient cells, demonstrating that Rad 18 E 3 ligase activity alone is insufficient for FANCD 2 ubiquitylation. Instead, Rad 18 promotes FA core complex-dependent FANCD 2 ubiquitination {{in a manner that}} is secondary to PCNA mono-ubiquitination. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel Rad 18 -dependent mechanism that couples activation of the FA pathway with TLS...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{hydrogen}} peroxide (H₂O₂), and its free-radical product the hydroxyl radical (OH·), {{have been identified}} as major sources of DNA damage in living organisms. We examined DNA repair of {{hydrogen peroxide}} damage, using a standard bacteriophage T 4 test system in which several different types of repair could be determined. <b>Post-replication</b> recombinational <b>repair</b> and denV-dependent excision repair had little or no effect on H₂O₂ damage. Also, an enzyme important in repair of H₂O₂-induced DNA damage in the E. coli host cells, exonuclease III, was not utilized in repair of lethal H₂O₂ damage to the phage. However, multiplicity reactivation, a form of recombinational repair between multiply infecting phage genomes, was found to repair H₂O₂ damages efficiently. The RAD 52 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and genes 46 and 47 of bacteriophage T 4 are essential for most recombination and recombinational repair in their respective organisms. The RAD 52 gene was introduced into expression vectors which were used to transform E. coli. RAD 52 expression was induced, and its ability to complement either gene 46 or gene 47 phage mutants was determined with respect to phage growth, recombination, and recombinational repair. RAD 52 gene expression allowed growth of gene 46 and gene 47 mutants under otherwise restrictive conditions, as measured by plaque formation and burst size. The RAD 52 gene also restored the ability of gene 46 and gene 47 mutants to undergo recombination of rII markers. Furthermore, the RAD 52 gene restored recombinational repair after UV irradiation of gene 46 and gene 47 mutants. The published DNA sequence of RAD 52 was compared with the published sequences of genes 46 and 47. Although overall homologies were only marginally significant, RAD 52 and gene 46 had substantial sequence similarity over a limited region. These results indicate that the recombinational repair pathway found in phage T 4 may be ubiquitous for DNA damage caused by endogenous exidative reactions. Furthermore, they indicated that an essential element of the recombination mechanism in both procaryotic viruses and eucaryotes arose from a common ancestor. Procaryotes and eucaryotes are thought to have diverged at least one billion years ago. Thus, recombination apparently arose early in evolution...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{duplication}} of DNA prior to cell division {{is essential to}} suppress mutagenesis and tumour development. The high fidelity of eukaryotic DNA replication {{is due to a}} combination of accurate incorporation of nucleotides into the nascent DNA strand by DNA polymerases, the recognition and removal of mispaired nucleotides (proofreading) by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerases δ and ε, and <b>post-replication</b> surveillance and <b>repair</b> of newly synthesized DNA by the mismatch repair (MMR) apparatus. While the contribution of defective MMR to neoplasia is well recognized, evidence that faulty DNA polymerase activity is important in cancer development has been limited. We have recently shown that germline POLE and POLD 1 exonuclease domain mutations (EDMs) predispose to colorectal cancer (CRC) and, in the latter case, to endometrial cancer (EC). Somatic POLE mutations also occur in 5 - 10 % of sporadic CRCs and underlie a hypermutator, microsatellite-stable molecular phenotype. We hypothesized that sporadic ECs might also acquire somatic POLE and/or POLD 1 mutations. Here, we have found that missense POLE EDMs with good evidence of pathogenic effects are present in 7 % of a set of 173 endometrial cancers, although POLD 1 EDMs are uncommon. The POLE mutations localized to highly conserved residues and were strongly predicted to affect proofreading. Consistent with this, POLE-mutant tumours were hypermutated, with a high frequency of base substitutions, and an especially large relative excess of G:C>T:A transversions. All POLE EDM tumours were microsatellite stable, suggesting that defects in either DNA proofreading or MMR provide alternative mechanisms to achieve genomic instability and tumourigenesis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Post-replication</b> DNA {{mismatch}} <b>repair</b> plays crucial {{roles in}} mutation avoidance {{and maintenance of}} chromosome stability in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In humans, deficiency in this repair system leads to a predisposition for certain cancers. The biochemistry of this repair system has been best studied in a model bacterium Escherichia coli. In this thesis, regulation of expression of mutS, mutL and mutH genes, whose products mediate methyl-directed mismatch (MDM) repair in E. coli, is investigated. One-step affinity purification schemes were developed to purify E. coli MutS, MutL and MutH proteins fused to a His- 6 -affinity tag. His- 6 -MutS exhibited the same mismatch binding activity and specificity as the native MutS protein. Purified His- 6 -MutS, -MutL and -MutH proteins were used to develop quantitative Western blotting assays for amounts of MutS, MuL and MutH proteins under various conditions. It {{was found that the}} three proteins were present in relatively low amounts in exponentially growing cells and MutS and MutH were diminished in stationary-phase cells. Further studies indicated that the drop in the amounts of MutS and MutH proteins in stationary-phase cells was mediated through RpoS, a key global regulator of stationary-phase transition. In both exponential- and stationary-phase cells, MutS amount was also negatively regulated by the Hfq (HF-I) global regulator, which is required for RpoS translation, through an RpoS-independent mechanism. β-galactosidase assays of mutS-lacZ operon and gene fusions suggested that hfq regulates mutS posttranscriptionally, and RNase T 2 protection assays revealed that Hfq destabilizes mutS transcripts in exponentially growing cells. To study the relation between regulation of MDM repair and mutagenesis, amounts of MutS, MutL and MutH were measured in starved cells undergoing adaptive mutagenesis. It was found that MutS amount dropped drastically, MutH amount dropped slightly, whereas MutL amount remained essentially constant in starved cells. Overexpression of MutL did not reverse the drop in the amounts of MutS or MutH protein. These results ruled out several explanations for a phenomenon in which overexpression of MutL, but not MutS, reversed adaptive mutagenesis. The findings further suggested that functional MutL is limiting during adaptive mutagenesis. The implications of regulation of the MDM repair are discussed in the context of mutagenesis, pathogenesis and tumorigenesis. ...|$|R

In an effort to better understand the function of Cullin- 4 (CDT 2) E 3 ubiquitin ligase in mammalian <b>Post-Replication</b> <b>Repair</b> during an unperturbed S-phase, we show that down-regulation of Cullin- 4 (CDT 2) leads to two distinguishable independent phenotypes in human cells that unveil at least two independent roles of Cullin- 4 (CDT 2) in S-phase. Apart from the re-replication preventing activity, we identified a non-canonical Cullin- 4 (CDT 2) complex, containing both CUL 4 A and CUL 4 B, associated to the COP 9 signalosome, that controls a RAD 18 -dependent damage avoidance pathway essential during an unperturbed S-phase. Indeed, we show that the non-canonical Cullin- 4 A/ 4 B(CDT 2) complex binds to RAD 18 and it is required to modulate RAD 18 protein levels onto chromatin and the consequent dynamics of PCNA monoubiquitylation during a normal S-phase. This function prevents replication stress, ATR hyper-signaling and, ultimately, apoptosis. A very similar PRR regulatory mechanism has been recently described for Spartan.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, proteins {{acting in the}} Rad 6 -dependent pathway are required to channel lesions into these pathways. Until recently there was little information as to how this channelling was regulated. However, several recent papers, and in particular from the Jentsch and Ulrich groups have provided striking insights {{into the role of}} modified forms of PCNA in these events [C. Hoege, B. Pfander, G. L. Moldovan, G. Pyrowolakis, S. Jentsch, RAD 6 -dependent DNA repair is linked to modification of PCNA by ubiquitin and SUMO, Nature 419 (2002) 135 - 141; P. Stelter, H. D. Ulrich, Control of spontaneous and damage-induced mutagenesis by SUMO and ubiquitin conjugation, Nature 425 (2003) 188 - 191; B. Pfander, G. L. Moldovan, M. Sacher, C. Hoege, S. Jentsch, SUMO-modified PCNA recruits Srs 2 to prevent recombination during S phase, Nature 436 (2005) 428 - 433; E. Papouli, S. Chen, A. A. Davies, D. Huttner, L. Krejci, P. Sung, H. D. Ulrich, Crosstalk between SUMO and ubiquitin on PCNA is mediated by recruitment of the helicase Srs 2 p, Mol. Cell. 19 (2005) 123 - 133]. In particular they have shown that mono-ubiquitinated PCNA directs translesion synthesis via DNA polymerases with low stringency, and that polyubiquitinated PCNA is associated with error-free avoidance of lesions. Recent data have shown that the role of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of PCNA is not an event that occurs merely in the absence of ubiquitination, rather it serves to recruit Srs 2 to replication forks in order to inhibit recombination. The implications of these findings for <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> in S. cerevisiae and other eukaryotes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Cullin- 4 CDT 2 E 3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase {{plays an}} essential role in DNA replication origin licensing directing degradation of several licensing factors at the G 1 /S transition in order to prevent DNA re-replication. Recently a RAD 18 -independent role of Cullin- 4 CDT 2 in PCNA monoubiquitylation has been proposed. In an effort to better understand the function of Cullin- 4 CDT 2 E 3 ubiquitin ligase in mammalian <b>Post-Replication</b> <b>Repair</b> during an unperturbed S-phase, we show that down-regulation of Cullin- 4 CDT 2 leads to two distinguishable independent phenotypes in human cells that unveil at least two independent roles of Cullin- 4 CDT 2 in S-phase. Apart from the re-replication preventing activity, we identified a non-canonical Cullin- 4 CDT 2 complex, containing both CUL 4 A and CUL 4 B, associated to the COP 9 signalosome, that controls a RAD 18 -dependent damage avoidance pathway essential during an unperturbed S-phase. Indeed, we show that the non-canonical Cullin- 4 A/ 4 BCDT 2 complex binds to RAD 18 and it is required to modulate RAD 18 protein levels onto chromatin and the consequent dynamics of PCNA monoubiquitylation during a normal S-phase. This function prevents replication stress, ATR hyper-signaling and, ultimately, apoptosis. A very similar PRR regulatory mechanism has been recently described for Spartan. Our findings uncover a finely regulated process in mammalian cells involving <b>Post-Replication</b> <b>Repair</b> factors, COP 9 signalosome and a non-canonical Cullin 4 -based E 3 ligase which is essential to tolerate spontaneous damage and for cell survival during physiological DNA replication. © 2013 Sertic et al.

40|$|Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an {{autosomal}} recessive human disease characterized by extreme sensitivity to sunlight {{resulting in a}} high incidence of skin cancer and frequent neurological abnormalities. Cells from XP patients are hyper-sensitive to the lethal effect of ultraviolet (UV) radiation because they have a defective DNA repair system (1). There are eight genetic forms of XP, complementation groups A-G have defects in excision repair, while the XP variants is thought to have impaired <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> (2). The causative genes for groups A, B, C, D and G XP have been already identified (3 - 7). We have cloned a cDNA for the human DNA repair gene that complements the defect of group A XP cells and named it the XP group A (XPA) gene. The human XPA gene codes a protein of 273 amino acids with a zinc finger domain which is important for DNA repair activity of the XP...|$|E
40|$|Host factors {{belonging}} to the DNA repair machineries are assumed to aid retroviruses in the obligatory step of integration. Here we describe the effect of DNA repair molecule Rad 18, {{a component of the}} <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> pathway, on viral infection. Contrary to our expectations, cells lacking Rad 18 were consistently more permissive to viral transduction as compared to Rad 18 (+/+) controls. Remarkably, such susceptibility was integration independent, since retroviruses devoid of integration activity also showed enhancement of the initial steps of infection. Moreover, the elevated sensitivity of the Rad 18 (-/-) cells was also observed with adenovirus. These data indicate that Rad 18 suppresses viral infection in a non-specific fashion, probably by targeting incoming DNA. Furthermore, considering data published recently, it appears that the interactions between DNA repair components with incoming viruses, often result in inhibition of the infection rather than cooperation toward its establishment...|$|E
40|$|SummaryTelomeric repeats {{located within}} {{chromosomes}} are called interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs). They are polymorphic {{in length and}} are likely hotspots for initiation of chromosomal rearrangements that {{have been linked to}} human disease. Using our S.  cerevisiae system to study repeat-mediated genome instability, we have previously shown that yeast telomeric (Ytel) repeats induce various gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCR) when their G-rich strands serve as the lagging strand template for replication (G orientation). Here, we show that interstitial Ytel repeats in the opposite C orientation prefer to expand rather than cause GCR. A tract of eight Ytel repeats expands at a rate of 4  × 10 − 4 per replication, ranking them among the most expansion-prone DNA microsatellites. A candidate-based genetic analysis implicates both <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> and homologous recombination pathways in the expansion process. We propose a model for Ytel repeat expansions and discuss its applications for genome instability and alternative telomere lengthening (ALT) ...|$|E
40|$|RAD 6 {{is known}} to {{suppress}} duplication-mediated gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) but not single-copy sequence mediated GCRs. Here, {{we found that the}} RAD 6 - and RAD 18 -dependent <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> (PRR) and the RAD 5 -, MMS 2 -, UBC 13 -dependent error-free PRR branch acted in concert with the replication stress checkpoint to suppress duplicationmediated GCRs formed by homologous recombination (HR). The Rad 5 helicase activity, but not its RING finger, was required to prevent duplication-mediated GCRs, although the function of Rad 5 remained dependent upon modification of PCNA at Lys 164. The SRS 2, SGS 1, and HCS 1 encoded helicases appeared to interact with Rad 5, and epistasis analysis suggested that Srs 2 and Hcs 1 act upstream of Rad 5. In contrast, Sgs 1 likely functions downstream of Rad 5, potentially by resolving DNA structures formed by Rad 5. Our analysis is consistent with models in which PRR prevents replication damage fro...|$|E
40|$|Aicardi–Goutières {{syndrome}} (AGS) is {{an inflammatory}} encephalopathy caused by defective nucleic acids metabolism. Over 50 % of AGS mutations affect RNase H 2 the only enzyme able to remove single ribonucleotide-monophosphates (rNMPs) embedded in DNA. Ribonucleotide triphosphates (rNTPs) {{are incorporated into}} gen-omic DNA with relatively high frequency during normal replication making DNA more susceptible to strand breakage and mutations. Here we demonstrate that human cells depleted of RNase H 2 show impaired cell cycle progression associated with chronic activation of <b>post-replication</b> <b>repair</b> (PRR) and genome instability. We identify a similar phenotype in cells derived from AGS patients, which indeed accumulate rNMPs in genomic DNA and exhibit markers of constitutive PRR and checkpoint activation. Our data indicate that in human cells RNase H 2 {{plays a crucial role}} in correcting rNMPs misincorporation, preventing DNA damage. Such protective function is compromised in AGS patients and may be linked to unscheduled immune responses. These findings may be relevant to shed further light on the mechanisms involved in AGS pathogenesis...|$|E
