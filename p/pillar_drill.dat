50|$|A {{drill press}} (also {{known as a}} {{pedestal}} drill, <b>pillar</b> <b>drill,</b> or bench drill) is a fixed style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models with a magnetic base grip the steel workpieces they drill. A drill press consists of a base, column (or pillar), table, spindle (or quill), and drill head, usually driven by an induction motor. The head has a set of handles (usually 3) radiating from a central hub that, when turned, move the spindle and chuck vertically, parallel to the axis of the column. The drill press is typically {{measured in terms of}} swing. Swing is defined as twice the throat distance, which is the distance {{from the center of the}} spindle to the closest edge of the pillar. For example, a 16 in drill press has an 8 in throat distance.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an original {{piece of work}} and contribution to knowledge by creating a new process planning system; Haptic Aided Process Planning (HAPP). This system {{is based on the}} combination of haptics and virtual reality (VR). HAPP creates a simulative machining environment where Process plans are automatically generated from the real time logging of a user’s interaction. Further, through the application of a novel usability test methodology, a deeper study of how this approach compares to conventional process planning was undertaken. An abductive research approach was selected and an iterative and incremental development methodology chosen. Three development cycles were undertaken with evaluation studies carried {{out at the end of}} each. Each study, the pre-pilot, pilot and industrial, identified progressive refinements to both the usability of HAPP and the usability evaluation method itself. HAPP provided process planners with an environment similar to which they are already familiar. Visual images were used to represent tools and material whilst a haptic interface enabled their movement and positioning by an operator in a manner comparable to their native setting. In this way an intuitive interface was developed that allowed users to plan the machining of parts consisting of features that can be machined on a <b>pillar</b> <b>drill,</b> 21 / 2 D axis milling machine or centre lathe. The planning activities included single or multiple set ups, fixturing and sequencing of cutting operations. The logged information was parsed and output to a process plan including route sheets, operation sheets, tool lists and costing information, in a human readable format. The system evaluation revealed that HAPP, from an expert planners perspective is perceived to be 70...|$|E

Diligence provides a large workshop facility for Royal Navy vessels, this is equipped with specialist machinery such as arc welding equipment, lathes, <b>pillar</b> <b>drills,</b> grinders, band saws and a large store of spares.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{people use}} annular cutters on {{conventional}} drilling machines like radial <b>drilling</b> machines or <b>pillar</b> <b>drilling</b> machine, {{it is not}} recommended because these machines have very high RPM which creates high tool breakage risk for annular cutters as they are hollow unlike solid twist drills. It is always recommended to use an annular cutter or core drill with a magnetic core drilling machine (also called as magnetic drill, magnetic base drilling machine, etc.) as these machines are slower. A magnetic drilling machine is ideally made for using annular cutters.Different Shanks of Annular cutters: ...|$|R
50|$|The school {{also has}} a Design Technology suite, with CAD/CAM {{facilities}} and a laser cutter. The CAD/CAM suite also includes an A3 colour laser printer. The department also includes two workshops including CNC lathes, wood-turning lathes, metal working lathes, scroll saws and <b>pillar</b> <b>drills,</b> jig-saws and clamps. The department also features facilities for textiles and sewing {{as well as an}} area for pupils to review and edit design plans digitally using a range of programmes. It was refurbished in 2008 at a cost of £250,000. The school also has its own video editing studio with chroma-key (blue-screen) facility.|$|R

50|$|Tapping {{may either}} be {{achieved}} by a hand tapping by using a set of taps first tap, second tap & final (finish) tap or using a machine to do the tapping, such as a lathe, radial drilling machine, bench type <b>drill</b> machine, <b>pillar</b> type <b>drill</b> machine, vertical milling machines, HMCs, VMCs. Machine tapping is faster, and generally more accurate because human error is eliminated. Final tapping is achieved with single tap.|$|R

The vandalism soon reached the disapproving ears of the villagers of Zennor and the local vicar, William Borlase (a great grandson of Dr. William Borlase), intervened and successfully offered a financial incentive of five shillings to the farmer to build it elsewhere, although he had already built stone posts on the site to erect it. Traces of drill-holes can still be seen in the stone ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{an optical}} sensor system, which is integrated into an industrial push-button. The sensor allows to classify {{the type of}} material that is {{in contact with the}} button when pressed into different material categories {{on the basis of the}} material's so called "spectral signature". An approach for a safety sensor system at circular table saws on the same base has been introduced previously on SIAS- 2007. This contactless working sensor is able to distinguish reliably between skin, textiles, leather and various other kinds of materials. A typical application for this intelligent push-button is the use at possibly dangerous machines, whose operating instructions include either the prohibition or the obligation to wear gloves during the work at the machine. An exemple of machines at which no gloves are allowed are <b>pillar</b> <b>drilling</b> machines, because of the risk of getting caught in the drill chuck and being turned in by the machine. In many cases this causes very serious hand injuries. Depending on the application needs, the sensor system integrated into the push-button can be configured flexibly by software to prevent the operator from accidentally starting a machine with or without gloves, which can decrease the risk of severe accidents significantly. Especially two-hand controls are incentive to manipulation for easier handling. By equipping both push-buttons of a two-hand control with material classification properties, the user is forced to operate the controls with his bare fingers. That limitation disallows the manipulation of a two-hand control by a simple rodding device...|$|R

40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{continuation}} of that which appeared in this Journal, no. 255, November 1973, on the subject of control of hardened concrete by means of drilled cores. &# 13; The total amount of results obtained in the various tests are presented in the shape of tables and diagrams. For the tests pillars of structural size have been used. &# 13; The studied subjects are resistance of the drilled specimens with regard to that of the column from which they are taken; and the variation of this resistance at changing humidity conditions and in relation to the extraction height above the column base. &# 13; The second subject to be analized is the resistance loss of the <b>pillars,</b> after the <b>drilled</b> cores, with a diameter of 10 cm, have been extracted and after the resulting hollow has been filled up according to various methods. &# 13; The research has been carried out in the laboratories of the Department of Structures of the College of Industrial Engineering in Bilbao and in the Testing and Industrial Research Laboratories «L. J. Torróntegui».
