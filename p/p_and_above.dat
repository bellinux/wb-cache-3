However, open standards and patent grants are paramount {{to the adoption of}} video codecs across different platforms and browsers. Google On 2 released VP 8 in May 2010 to compete with H. 264, the current standard of video codecs, complete with source code, specification and a perpetual patent grant. As the amount of video being created every day is growing rapidly, the decision of which codec to encode this video with is paramount; if a low quality codec or a restrictively licensed codec is used, the video recorded might be of little to no use. We sought to study VP 8 and its quality versus its resource consumption compared to H. 264 [...] the most popular current video codec [...] so that reader may make an informed decision for themselves or for their organizations about whether to use H. 264 or VP 8, or something else entirely. We examined VP 8 in detail, compared its theoretical complexity to H. 264 and measured the efficiency of its current implementation. VP 8 shares many facets of its design with H. 264 and other Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based video codecs. However, VP 8 is both simpler and less feature rich than H. 264, which may allow for rapid hardware and software implementations. As it was designed for the Internet and newer mobile devices, it contains fewer legacy features, such as interlacing, than H. 264 supports. To perform quality measurements, the open source VP 8 implementation libvpx was used. This is the reference implementation. For H. 264, the open source H. 264 encoder x 264 was used. This encoder has very high performance, and is often rated at the top of its field in efficiency. The JM reference encoder was used to establish a baseline quality for H. 264. Our findings indicate that VP 8 performs very well at low bitrates, at resolutions at and below CIF. VP 8 may be able to successfully displace H. 264 Baseline in the mobile streaming video domain. It offers higher quality at a lower bitrate for low resolution images due to its high performing entropy coder and non-contiguous macroblock segmentation. At higher resolutions, VP 8 still outperforms H. 264 Baseline, but H. 264 High profile leads. At HD resolution (720 <b>p</b> <b>and</b> <b>above),</b> H. 264 is significantly better than VP 8 due to its superior motion estimation and adaptive coding. There is little significant difference between the intra-coding performance between H. 264 and VP 8. VP 82 ̆ 7 s in-loop deblocking filter outperforms H. 2642 ̆ 7 s version. H. 2642 ̆ 7 s inter-coding, with full support for B frames and weighting outperforms VP 82 ̆ 7 s alternate reference scheme, although this may improve in the future. On average, VP 82 ̆ 7 s feature set is less complex than H. 2642 ̆ 7 s equivalents, which, along with its open source implementation, may spur development in the future. These findings indicate that VP 8 has strong fundamentals when compared with H. 264, but that it lacks optimization and maturity. It will likely improve as engineers optimize VP 82 ̆ 7 s reference implementation, or when a competing implementation is developed. We recommend several areas that the VP 8 developers should focus on in the future...|$|E

The method uses {{the strengths of}} real-time ray tracing for objects close to the camera, by storing them in a per-frame constructed bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). For objects further from the camera, rasterization is used to create G-buffers which store an image-based representation of the scene out- side the near objects. Rays that exit the BVH continue tracing in the G-buffers’ perspective space using ray marching, and can even be reflected back into the BVH. Our hybrid renderer is to our knowledge the first method to merge real- time ray tracing techniques with image-based rendering to achieve smooth transitions from accurately ray-traced fore- ground objects to image-based representations in the back- ground. We are able to achieve more complex reflections and refractions than existing screen space techniques, and offer reflections by off-screen objects.
