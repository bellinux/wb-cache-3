5000|$|National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (Supreme Court of California, 1983, [...] ) {{was a key}} case in California {{highlighting}} {{the conflict between the}} <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> and appropriative water rights. The <b>Public</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Doctrine</b> is based on the principle that certain resources (such as navigable waters) are too valuable to be privately owned and must remain available for public use. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court, the court held that the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> restricts the amount of water that can be withdrawn from navigable waterways. The basis for the <b>Public</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Doctrine</b> goes back to Roman law. Under Roman law, the air, the rivers, the sea and the seashore were incapable of private ownership; they were dedicated {{to the use of the}} public. In essence, the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> establishes the role of the state as having trustee environmental duties owed to the public that are subsequently enforceable by the public. There is judicial recognition of this, dictating that certain rights of the public are key to individual common law rights (such as state recognition of the public right or trust for waterways and coastal zones). Judicial recognition of the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> has been established for tidelands and non-navigable waterways, submerged land (such as lake beds) and the waters above them, and preservation of a public interest (such as recreation, swimming, access, and sport fishing).|$|E

40|$|Oceanfront {{landowners and}} states share a {{property}} boundary that runs between the {{wet and dry}} parts of the shore. This legal coastline is different from an ordinary land boundary. First, on sandy beaches, the line is constantly in flux, and it cannot be marked except momentarily. Without {{the help of a}} surveyor and a court, neither the landowner nor a citizen walking down the beach has the ability to know exactly where the line lies. This uncertainty means that, as a practical matter, ownership of some part of the beach is effectively shared. Second, the common law establishes that the owner of each oceanfront lot holds easement-like interests in adjacent state-owned land; and, the state holds similar interests in the oceanfront lot. For these two reasons, the legal relationship between the oceanfront owner and the state is more interdependent than it may seem at first. It is much more than the usual neighbor relationship. Disputes over oceanfront property are often framed as cases of wrongful taking under the Fifth Amendment’s Just Compensation Clause. The Supreme Court has historically applied its standard takings test for determining whether or not a state is liable for the impact of its rules on a landowner’s rights. This Article is the first to examine the question of whether use of this standard test is optimal, or even logical, in cases between states and the owners of oceanfront land. Given the fact that climate change impacts such as sea-level rise are likely to increase rates of conflict along the legal coastline, the potential benefits of a test that takes into account the special relationship between these parties are significant. Support for an alternative test can be found in two sets of common law property rules, the upland rights and <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrines,</b> as well as in a mechanism that nineteenth-century courts used to resolve similar disputes...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) has come to define its {{conservation}} mission {{in the context of}} species protection. The concept of “trust species” is now a common focal point for the myriad responsibilities of the FWS. This has become problematic for one of the major programs of the agency: management of the world’s largest biodiversity conservation network, the national wildlife refuge system (“NWRS”). A major legislative overhaul of the NWRS charter and the imperatives of climate change adaptation have weakened the concept as a reliable touchstone for NWRS management and expansion. The FWS should build on its culture and history to respond to new challenges that the conservation network cannot meet with the “trust species” concept alone. While management to benefit specific species offers a simple measure of accomplishment, as a policy tool it creates more problems than it solves. Adherence to the “trust species” theme limits full engagement with, and abdicates the FWS’ leadership role in, contemporary conservation challenges and science. This article makes the case for alternative measures of NWRS conservation success that move beyond just counting populations. We begin in Part I by tracing the rise of the trust concept to prominence as the dominant FWS conservation theme. We illustrate how the idea works in practice with three examples. In Part II we proceed to analyze what the “trust species” theme offers for conservation objectives and what problems it presents for the NWRS. We conclude that, on balance, its strengths do not justify its predominance. In particular, the trust concept has four problems. First, it fails to capture the full, systemic statutory mandate, and thus neglects an important part of Congress’ instructions. Second, it invites confusion with real federal trust duties pertaining to natural resources damages and relations with Indian tribes. Third, it risks conflation with state <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrines,</b> and therefore blurs the distinction between the FWS’ functions and the state role in wildlife management. Fourth, it narrows the FWS’ conservation vision to only a few elements of the broader ecological concerns animating landscape-level nature protection. Part III shows how climate change, ecosystem management, and land acquisition would be better addressed through a broader approach. We conclude with some suggestions for alternatives to the reductive “trust species” focus. Ecological integrity offers a more accurate theme for the NWRS goals, a more robust tool for adapting to climate change, and a concept that the scientific literature recognizes and quantifies...|$|R

50|$|Justice Field {{determined}} that the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> applies to the Great Lakes, {{despite the fact that}} they are not subject to the ebb and flow of the tides. Initially, the United States adopted English Common law which limited the definition of navigable waters to those that were subject to the ebb and flow of the tides. In the United States the tidal requirement was removed because many rivers can be navigated for great distances by large commercial vessels. Great Lakes, while not subject to the tides, are the conduit of a great deal of transnational and interstate commerce, and it was this value the common law sought to protect in the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine.</b> The <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> limits private property rights to lands submerged by navigable waters.

5000|$|In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court, it was alleged by {{the plaintiffs}} that the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> was being {{violated}} due to environmental damages to Mono Lake {{in the form}} of significant water level declines as a result of water diversions by the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP). DWP based their defense on the fact that they held permits, issued by the state for the diversions, and so the diversions were allowable. The central issue in the case was whether appropriative water rights (granted in the past) must consider the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> requiring protection of natural resources by the state. More specifically, the issue being addressed by the court was whether Mono Lake was subject to a public trust, which would invalidate Los Angeles’ use of the streams feeding the lake. The California Supreme Court held that the state, under the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> had continuing responsibility for the state's navigable waters and that the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> therefore, prevented any party from appropriating water in a manner that harmed the public trust interests. However, the court also recognized that LA depended on these diversions as a critical water source, and this in turn mitigated the rule of law as the court held that water transfers were permissible even though some damage to the environment would occur as long as this was kept to minimal harm to the extent feasible. This ruling established that the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> and appropriative water rights are [...] "part of an integrated system of water law" [...] and so both must be considered when determining appropriate use of water in California.|$|E
50|$|In California, {{courts have}} held that {{appropriation}} water rights may be limited under the <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> a common law principle recognized by some courts, which holds that the public has access rights upon navigable waters and that navigable waters are held in trust {{for the use of}} the people.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} how <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care is formed, by studying the mechanisms behind it, addressing the following research question: ‘Which mechanisms explain differences in <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care?’. <b>Public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care is important. Low levels of trust in health care are related to counterproductive behaviors, such as delay in using health services or lower compliance with medical treatment. This means that low levels of <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> may lead to less effective treatment and higher health care costs. The mechanisms that we expected {{to have an impact}} on <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care consist of two types: system-related and informational mechanisms. System-related mechanisms concern the health care system and the institutions surrounding the health care system, also called institutional guarantees. These guarantees relate to cultural beliefs, normative structures and regulatory systems that provide significance and stability to the health care sector. With regard to cultural beliefs, we expect that the belief that in general the health care system provides good quality care, will have an impact on <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care within a country and that it can lead to differences between countries. The presence of normative and regulative guarantees is expected to lead to higher levels of <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care. Informational mechanisms consist of personal experiences in health care, information from others and information received through various media including the radio, television, newspapers and the internet. Positive information is expected to lead to higher levels of trust, whereas negative information is expected to lead to lower levels. Additionally, we assume that negative information will have a greater impact on <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care than positive information (negativity-effect). Objects of <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care can be found on two levels. <b>Public</b> <b>trust</b> can be placed in groups of people and institutions on a macro-level (occupational groups in general, institutions in general, or the health care system) and on a meso-level (health care providers working in a specific institution or a specific institution itself). Therefore, the impact of the mechanisms on <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> has been studied on both levels. Next to that, we have studied both conventional health care and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This thesis was the first to present a theoretical model on the mechanisms influencing <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care. Evidence was presented that suggested that both the mechanisms related to systems, as well as the informational mechanisms, have an impact upon <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in health care.
