MethodsBetween 1990 and 2001, a total of 18 consecutive patients affected by large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung were operated on. Lobectomy and systemic lymphadenectomy were performed in all cases. Postoperative radiotherapy was performed when stage was higher than Ib. Ten patients with positive results of preoperative indium In- 111 <b>pentetreotide</b> scintigraphy received octreotide after the operation. ResultsNine patients (50 %) had local recurrences or distant metastases (mean recurrence time 14 months); palliative chemotherapy was given, but all patients died. In 10 cases (55. 5 %) octreotide alone or in combination with radiotherapy was administered as adjuvant treatment; 9 of these patients (90 %) are alive and free of disease (P =. 0007), and the other had liver and brain metastases 21 months after surgery.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate and illustrate the use of Indium In- 111 <b>pentetreotide</b> scintigraphy as it applies to carotid body tumors (CBT). Localization has relied primarily on ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging with angiographic confirmation. These methods only assess the cervical bifurcation without providing an evaluation of metastasis in patients without symptoms or recurrence in patients after surgery. Methods: Indium In- 111 <b>pentetreotide</b> scintigraphy was used in five patients with a diagnosis of CBT. Four patients were evaluated after surgical excision for evidence of tumor recurrence. One patient was evaluated before excision for diagnostic confirmation. Results: No evidence of tumor recurrence was demonstrated in the four patients who had undergone previous CBT excision. One of these patients had increased activity in the pituitary, later confirmed as an enlarged pituitary without evidence of an adenoma with computed tomography. The diagnosis of CBT was confirmed in the patient evaluated before surgery. This patient also had increased activity in the occipital region, confirmed as the site of previous ischemia on computed tomography. Conclusion: Indium In- 111 <b>pentetreotide</b> scintigraphy is a new innovative method for viewing neuroendocrine tumors. Its potential lies not only in tumor localization but also in identification of recurrent tumor at the operative site and metastatic disease. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 25 : 905 - 8. ...|$|E

40|$|Some {{neoplasms}} {{are classified}} as primary neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) because of their positivity for neuroendocrine markers [chromogranins A and B (CgA, CgB) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) ]. Neuroendocrine differentiation has been reported, for example, in both "in situ" and infiltrating breast cancer. Diagnosis of NET is bio-humoral (CgA, NSE, synaptophysin) and instrumental. Even if the final diagnosis is made by open biopsy, radionuclide imaging using radiolabelled somatostatin analogs, such as In- 111 <b>pentetreotide,</b> may detect neuroendocrine primary tumours and metastases before they become detectable using traditional and advanced imaging modalities [mammography (MX), ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ]. When neuroendocrine breast lesions are not detectable, radio-guided surgery (RGS) is able to localise cancer. We report {{a case of a}} woman with a palpable lymph node in the left axilla. She underwent a US-guided lymph node biopsy, which was positive for massive metastases, probably of neuroendocrine breast origin. Mammary plus axillary US showed only lymphadenopathy in the left axilla. MX and breast MRI were negative. Neoplastic markers (CEA, CA 15. 3, CA 125 and CA 19. 9) were negative too. On the other hand, neuroendocrine markers (NSE and CgA) were positive. A whole body scintigraphic scan plus thorax and abdomen single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with In- 111 <b>pentetreotide</b> (222 MBq; 6 mCi) showed an uptake in the left mammary gland. No other pathological localisations were observed. The day after the intravenous injection of In- 111 <b>pentetreotide,</b> the patient underwent RGS breast tumour resection and left axillary lymphadenectomy. In conclusion, we would like to emphasise: (1) the role of radionuclide imaging for the detection of breast NETs in relation to conventional diagnostic procedures; (2) the role of RGS in localising and removing a non-palpable breast NET that was undetectable with the use of conventional imaging techniques...|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Aim: Head {{and neck}} paragangliomas (HNP), are usually slowly growing, biochemically silent, benign tumors derived from {{parasympathetic}} ganglia. However, screening for genetic alterations is mandatory nowadays because HNP {{can be part}} of paraganglioma syndrome, due to mutations in SDHB, SDHC and SDHD genes, associated with tumors arising in adrenal gland, orthosympatetic para aortic and retroperitoneal paraganglia. Aim {{of the study was to}} correlate an uptake ratio of 111 In <b>pentetreotide</b> with genetic testing in 14 cases of HNP. Material and Methods: Charts of 14 consecutive patients [3 males (21. 5 %), 11 females (78. 5 %), median age 59 years, range 26 76] who underwent 111 In <b>pentetreotide</b> scintigraphy from 2005 to 2007 were reviewed. SPET and whole body 111 In <b>pentetreotide</b> scintigraphy (mean dose of 150 MBq) at 5 and 24 hours after injection, were performed in all patients. As concerns semiquantitative indexes, a ratio was obtained comparing counts/pixel derived from a VOI in the tumour area with mirrored VOI in the contralateral site (or non affected areas if bilateral HNP). Mutation of genes encoding for succinate dehydrogenase subunit B(SDHB), C(SDHC), D(SDHD) have been studied by direct sequencing of all exons and intronic flanking regions in all patients. Multiple ligation dependent probe amplification method (MLPA P 226 kit, MRC Holland) was used to assess gross deletions. RET and VHL mutations were also analyzed in all patients. Results: Two groups of patients were identified: group A (6 patients, 11 lesions) with positive genetic testing† † group B (8 patients, 8 lesions) with negative genetic testing. Identified mutations were SDHD c. 341 G>C p. Y 114 C substitution (5 patients) and SDHC c. 439 C>G p. Q 147 X substitution (1 patient). All but one patient in both groups (histologically confirmed) presented high radiopharmaceutical uptake (group A mean ratio= 14. 78 ± 20, group B mean ratio= 12. 57 ± 9. 18). Mann Whitney U Test demonstrated no statistically significant difference between uptake in the two groups (p= 0. 184). Interestingly in group A 5 of 6 patients presented bilateral uptake while in group B none. Conclusions: HNP, in the majority of cases (16 of 19), presented high uptake of 111 In <b>pentetreotide.</b> Mutations in genes encoding for succinate dehydrogenase subunit do not affect radiopharmaceutical uptake suggesting that the high content of somatostatin receptors is independent from this genetic background.

40|$|The Indium-labelled {{somatostatin}} analogue <b>pentetreotide</b> {{has been}} successfully developed for imaging of somatostatin receptor positive tumours. However there is significant renal tubular uptake of the radiolabelled peptide, which can obscure upper abdominal tumours and would preclude its use for targeted radiotherapy. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether amino acid infusion, which has been shown to block renal tubular peptide reabsorption, diminishes renal parenchymal uptake of this radiolabelled analogue. Eight patients being scanned with the 111 In-labelled somatostatin analogue, <b>pentetreotide,</b> for localisation of gastroenteropancreatic tumours received an infusion of synthetic amino acids. The ratio of isotope uptake in kidney to that in spleen was assessed, and compared to the ratio for matched control patients, to determine if amino acid infusion reduced renal parenchymal uptake of the radiopharmaceutical. The amount of isotope in the urine was determined to ensure that any effect of the amino acid infusion was unrelated to changes in clearance. Infusion of amino acids significantly reduced renal parenchymal uptake of isotope at 4 h. There was a non-significant increase in urinary clearance of isotope over the 4 h, consistent with reduced reuptake and a lack of effect on glomerular filtration rate. This technique, by preventing renal damage, may allow the use of this somatostatin analogue for local radiotherapy, and could be of wider value in blocking tubular re-uptake of potentially nephrotoxic agents, such as radiolabelled Fab fragments...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} utility of SPECT / CT {{in subjects with}} endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors compared to SPECT alone. Material and Methods: 48 subjects (31 women; 17 men; mean age 54 ± 11) with clinical suspicion or diagnosis of endocrine and neuroendocrine tumor had 50 SPECT/CT scans (32 Tc- 99 m MIBI, 5 post treatment I- 131, 8 In- 111 <b>Pentetreotide,</b> and 5 I- 123 MIBG). SPECT alone findings were compared to SPECT/CT and to pathology or radiological follow up. Results: From the 32 Tc- 99 m MIBI scans, SPECT accurately localized the lesion in 22 positive subjects while SPECT/CT did in 31 subjects. Parathyroid lesions not seen on SPECT alone were smaller than 10 mm. In five post treatment I- 131 scans, SPECT alone neither characterized, nor localized any lesions accurately. SPECT/CT revealed 3 benign etiologies, a metastatic lymph node, and one equivocal lesion. In 8 In- 111 <b>Pentetreotide</b> scans, SPECT alone could not localize primary or metastatic lesions in 6 subjects {{all of which were}} localized with SPECT/CT. In five I- 123 MIBG scans, SPECT alone could not detect a 1. 1 cm adrenal lesion or correctly characterize normal physiologic adrenal uptake in consecutive scans of the same patient with prior history of adrenelectomy, all of which were correctly localized and characterized with SPECT/CT.

40|$|Aim : To {{study the}} long term benefits, {{toxicity}} and survival rate in patients with neuroendocrine tumors receiving multiple cycles of high activity In- 111 <b>Pentetreotide</b> therapy. Moreover, our secondary aim was to evaluate the value of F- 18 FDG PET-CT scan as prognostic indicator in this group of patients. Background : Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of malignancies which are usually metastatic at diagnosis. Standard chemotherapy in these patients is associated with appreciable adverse events and low effectiveness. Since 1990 s, Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radio-labeled somatostatin analogues has been introduced as a new method of treatment in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors expressing high levels of Somatostatin receptors. Methods : 112 patients with progressive disseminated and unresectable neuroendocrine tumor (stage III and stage IV) were enrolled in a non-randomized trial in an out-patient setting. High activity In- 111 <b>Pentetreotide</b> (500 mCi (18. 5 GBq) per cycle) was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours and repeated therapy cycles every 9 - 12 weeks in eligible patients up to maximum of 4 cycles. Response to therapy was evaluated by clinical imaging using the RECIST criteria, metabolic criteria and patient's quality of life questionnaire. Dosimetry and biodistribution studies were also performed. Finally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed for patients followed for greater than 12 months. The relationship between pretreatment F- 18 FDG PET-CT scan status and survival was determined by two-tailed Student's t-test in 42 patients who underwent pre-therapy PET scans. Results : For an average of 25 (median 18. 65) months following the therapy, patients were evaluated for any evidence of toxicity. No significant acute toxicity was observed in patients. Grade II or III hematological toxicity (7. 6 % of patients), liver toxicity (18. 4 %) and also grade I renal toxicity (6. 1 %) was observed in 92 evaluable patients. Radiological responses were evaluated {{for an average of}} 29 months following their last cycle of therapy and results were analyzed by the RECIST criteria. Majority (85 %) of patients had stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) rate was 7. 5 % and progressive disease (PD) was observed in 7. 5 % of patients. The average survival was 24. 67 months after 2 cycles of therapy, 30. 53 months after 3 cycles of therapy and 30. 19 months after 4 cycles of therapy. Of the 42 patients who had pretreatment PET-CT imaging, 31 patients had positive F- 18 FDG scans (SUV &# 62; 2. 5) with an average survival time of 18. 9 months (range 1. 4 - 45. 8 months) and 11 patients had negative F- 18 FDG scans (SUV &# 8804; 2. 5) with an average survival time of 31. 8 months (range 7. 4 - 42. 9 months). Survival times for FDG negative patients were significantly longer than those for FDG positive patients (p = 0. 001 with 95 % confidence). Conclusion : High activity In- 111 therapy is a safe and effective therapy for patients with progressive disseminated neuroendocrine tumors. No major hematological, renal and hepatic toxicities were observed. There was an increase in survival time particularly in patients with lower degree of liver involvement as well as patients who received three or more cycles of therapy, as compared to historical data.

Although both primary and metastatic mammary carcinoid tumours are uncommon, the recognition of the true origin of the tumours may be of importance owing to the different clinical management and prognosis of the two conditions. Recently, radionuclide-labelled imaging techniques have been applied to the localization of such lesions, based on isotope uptake by receptors present in these neuroendocrine tumours. We report two new cases of carcinoid tumours with breast metastases, the primaries being in the ileocaecal valve and the bronchus, respectively. The diagnosis of a carcinoid tumour was based on the clinical, biochemical, histopathological and immunostaining features. Furthermore, these patients had both 123 I-MIBG and 111 In <b>pentetreotide</b> scintigraphy performed. These radionuclides play a useful role in the localization and potentially in the management of carcinoid tumours and their distant metastases...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Mediastinal paragangliomas are low {{incidence}} tumors {{that arise from}} neural crest. Its diferential diagnosis include several malignant diseases, so its correct characterization is mandatory for an adecuate therapeutic management. 111 In-Pentetreotide scintigraphy/SPECT-CT can detect paraganglioma, mainly in those cases of atypical or unsuspected location, and may have {{a significant role in}} follow-up of those patients diagnosed with multifocal and familiar paraganglioma. Case: Here we report a case of an extremely rare middle mediastinal paraganglioma, detected by scintigraphy and SPECT-CT with 111 In-Pentetreotide in a patient diagnosed of multifocal and family history of paraganglioma. Surgery was carried out by median sternotomy and extracorporeal circulation. The pathological examination of the surgical specimen showed a para-aortic low-grade tumor, positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin, cytokeratin AE 1 -AE 3 negative and Ki 67 lower than 5 %, compatible with paraganglioma. Currently, the patient is tumor free, under clinical monitoring. Conclusions: 111 In- <b>Pentetreotide</b> scan proved to be a helpful diagnostic method because of its potential to explore full body, so It allows us to locate unsuspected and atypical location paragangliomas. This finding suggests that patients diagnosed with multifocal head and neck paraganglioma should undergo periodical follow-up with 111 In-Pentetreotide scan to detect unsuspected paraganglioma...|$|E
40|$|In In- 111 - <b>pentetreotide</b> single-photon {{emission}} {{computed tomography}} (SPECT), the tumor-to-background-uptake ratio is generally high. The noise is, however, also usually {{on a high}} level, and {{in combination with the}} low spatial resolution of SPECT, this may lead to difficulties in the detection of small tumors. This is especially the case in regions with a relatively high background activity, such as in the liver, which is a common region for somatostatin-positive metastases. Visually detecting the small tumors is important for a successful treatment of the cancer disease. In this paper, we compare three different parallel-hole collimators for In- 111 -pentetreotide SPECT regarding contrast as a function of image noise for a phantom simulating small tumors in liver background. The corresponding contrast-to-noise ratios are also presented. All raw-data projections are produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The collimators are of type low-energy general-purpose (LEGP), extended LEGP (ELEGP), and medium-energy general-purpose (MEGP). Reconstructions were performed with OSEM both with and without model-based compensation. Of the investigated collimators, the ELEGP collimator proved to be the most optimal for the smallest tumors, both with and without model-based compensation included in the reconstruction. It is also shown that model-based compensation outperforms the conventional reconstruction technique...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three {{dogs with}} insulinoma were {{included}} in this retrospective study. These tumors were mostly found in middle-aged to old dogs, weighing over 25 kg. The most important symptoms were weakness, seizures and collapse. The mean duration of clinical signs before referral was 5 months. Interestingly, the onset of clinical signs was reported more frequently during the summer months. Paired serum glucose and insulin concentrations were measured in all dogs. Fructosamine concentrations were measured {{in more than one}} third of the cases, all showing levels lower than normal (258 mu mol/l). In 50 % of the dogs, abdominal ultrasound detected signs of an insulinoma, but only in one third of the cases nodules were visible. Scintigraphy, with the radiopharmaceutical drug Indium- 111 <b>pentetreotide,</b> was performed in 6 dogs, with a detection rate of 83 %. Electrophysiological examination of 3 dogs confirmed the clinical signs of an insulinoma-associated polyneuropathy. Histopathological examination of 5 dogs demonstrated the presence of an insulinoma. In one third of the dogs metastases were present at the time of diagnosis. The mean survival time after diagnosis was 10, 3 months. There {{was no significant difference in}} survival between the medicinally and surgically treated group. However, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion, because of the low number of surgically treated dogs...|$|E
40|$|Until {{recently}} {{there was}} no imaging technique available which could demonstrate pathological changes in orbital tissues and could {{be regarded as a}} reliable measure of inflammation in thyroid eye disease (TED). <b>Pentetreotide</b> (a synthetic derivative of somatostatin) labelled with 111 In has been used to localize tumours which possess surface or membrane receptors for somatostatin in vivo using a gamma camera (1). This technique visualizes somatostatin receptors in endocrine-related tumours in vivo and predicts the inhibitory effect of the somatostatin analogue octreotide on hormone secretion by the tumours (1). By applying 111 In-DTPA-D-Phe octreotide scintigraphy (octreoscan), accumulation of the radionuclide was also detected in both the thyroid and orbit of patients with Graves ’ disease (2 – 4). If peak activity in the orbit 5 h after injection of radiolabelled octreotide is set at 100 %, a decrease to 4064 % is found at 24 h, significantly different from the decrease in blood pool radioactivity, which is 1564 % at 24 h. Accumulation of the radionuclide is most probably due to the presence in the orbital tissue of activated lymphocytes bearing somatostatin receptors (5). Alternative explanations are binding to receptors on other cell types (e. g. myoblasts, fibroblasts or endothelial cells) or local blood pooling due to venous stasis by the autoimmune orbital inflammation.

40|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} provides physiologic {{and functional}} data for normal and pathologic organs but often the clear {{definition of the}} sites of radiotracers' uptake are difficult. Radiological methods are able to identify structural changes in a detailed way, but do not give precise information on function of organs or pathologic lesions. The registration and fusion of nuclear medicine studies with structural information obtained by radiological exams allows the precise correlation of functional and anatomical data. Software-based fusion of independently performed nuclear medicine and morphologic studies is uncertain of success and the alignment procedures are labor intensive. Recently, a new imaging device combining a dual-head, variable angle gamma camera with a low-dose x-ray tube has been introduced; the acquired single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and x-ray computed tomography (CT) images are coregistered {{by means of the}} hardware in the same session. This new technology can be particularly useful when applied to scintigraphic procedures in neuroendocrine tumors. In- 111 <b>pentetreotide</b> and radio-labeled MIBG {{play an important role in}} the study of patients with these tumors; the addition of anatomical maps provides a precise localization of SPECT findings and allows the exclusion of disease in sites of physiologic tracer uptake. SPECT/CT fused images are able to provide additional information that improves the accuracy of SPECT interpretation and leads to changes in therapeutic options, so enhancing the clinical role of nuclear medicine in evaluating patients with neuroendocrine tumors...|$|E
