5|$|A {{large dam}} across the Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a dam capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on <b>plans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang {{and surveyed the}} area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E

All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.|$|E

5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations.

Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E

Hogg repeatedly made the case to Shelley that marriage was in Harriet's best interests. Shelley was eventually persuaded and eloped with Harriet to Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light Rail to Sotra was to be made part of the extension <b>plans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period until 2040. For the light rail to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E
40|$|Scenario <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{public sector}} has {{significant}} differences from scenario <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corporate world. Scenario <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government not only {{tends to be}} focused on issue of higher complexity and significance to public policy, but also in comparison to people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> private business, public officials have fundamental psychological and institutional constraints in their scenario thinking. These constraints make {{it difficult for them to}} contemplate multiple ‘untidy’ futures and imagine the possibility of policy failure: skills which are essential for successful scenario projects. Based on specific characteristics of scenario <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese government, this paper contributes on better understanding the challenges and strategic solutions in providing more successful scenario <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public sector. Specifically, this paper argues that possible solutions in overcoming these constraints may be to shake public bureaucrats out of their thinking by providing free and open venues of conversation and more importantly through ‘derailment’ exercises...|$|R

Rogue bands of gendarmes subsequently conducted random raids around the city and looted the local bank.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak sank {{with up to}} 3,000tons of {{fuel oil}} aboard, the precise amount being unknown since such records were lost with the ship. Oil leaked from the {{corroding}} hull at an increased rate during the 1990s and concerns about the environmental impact led the Ministry of Defence to consider plans for extracting it. Royal Oaks status as a war grave required that surveys and any proposed techniques for removing the oil be handled sensitively: <b>plans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s to raise and salvage the wreck had been dropped in response to public opposition. In addition to the ethical concerns, poorly managed efforts could destabilise the wreck, resulting in a mass release of the remaining oil; the ship also contains many tons of unexploded ordnance.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Arlene caused torrential and prolonged rainfall across Central America. In El Salvador, a single landslide {{attributed to the}} flooding killed 20people. Flooding in Mexico associated with the tropical system killed four {{in the state of}} Yucatán and one in Campeche, where flood damage was estimated at US$33million. As many as 4,000homes were flooded, impacting roughly 10,000people and prompting Mexican armed forces to implement emergency rescue <b>plans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state. The highest rainfall total in Mexico was documented in Mérida, Yucatán, where a station measured 13.26in (336mm) of rain. As a tropical cyclone, however, Arlene's highest rainfall total occurred in the Camargo Municipality of Tamaulipas, where 7.32in (186mm) of rain was reported. In Matamoros, roads were blocked by mud and rocks.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally Caernarfon's {{design and}} defences have been {{thought to have}} been {{inspired}} by the growth of the bastides. The bastides were new planned towns created in both France and English-held Gascony during the period, characterised by grids of straight streets, often defended by combinations of castles and town walls. More recent research, however, has shown that English town design played a more significant role in shaping Caernarfon and other Edwardian town <b>plans.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of Caernarfon, the town plan and walls were adapted to fit around the site of the former Norman castle on the site, which lay just outside the new town and was used a market place.|$|E
5|$|A highway roughly {{parallel}} to the modern I-275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. As plans developed through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, the freeway was to run from I-75 near Newport north to Novi and connect back to I-75 near Davisburg. Some <b>plans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s had the northern Novi–Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through Oakland County were kept on the drawing boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 right-of-way between 1994 and 2000.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, The 4th Earl of Kilmorey (a peer from an Ulster family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such <b>plans.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish peers to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish peers the right to stand for election to the House of Commons, and to vote at parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|Friction {{existed between}} the two sides from the {{beginning}} of World War I. The unconditional surrender of the border fortress of Rupel in May 1916 to the Central Powers' forces, mainly composed of Bulgarian troops, was the first event that led to the Noemvriana. The Allies feared the possibility of a secret pact between the Greek royalist government and the Central Powers. Such an alliance would endanger the Allied army in Macedonia bivouacking around Thessalonica since the end of 1915. Intensive diplomatic negotiations between King Constantine I and Allied diplomats took place throughout the summer. The king wanted Greece to maintain her neutrality, a position that would favor the Central Powers <b>plans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans while the Allies wanted demobilization of the Greek army and the surrender of war materiel equivalent to what was lost at Fort Rupel as a guarantee of Greece's neutrality. By {{the end of the summer}} of 1916, the failure of negotiations, along with the Bulgarian army's advance in eastern Macedonia and the Greek government's orders for the Greek army not to offer resistance, led to a military coup by Venizelist military officers in Thessaloniki with the support of the Allies. The former Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who from the very beginning supported the Allies, established a provisional government in northern Greece. He began forming an army to liberate areas lost to Bulgaria, but this effectively split Greece into two entities.|$|E
5|$|Henry did {{not give}} up on his hopes for a crusade, but became {{increasingly}} absorbed {{in a bid to}} acquire the wealthy Kingdom of Sicily for his son Edmund. Sicily had been controlled by Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire, for many years a rival of Pope Innocent IV. On Frederick's death in 1250, Innocent started to look for a new ruler, one more amenable to the Papacy. Henry saw Sicily as both a valuable prize for his son and as an excellent base for his crusading <b>plans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east. With minimal consultation within his court, Henry came to an agreement with the Pope in 1254 that Edmund should be the next king. Innocent urged Henry to send Edmund with an army to reclaim Sicily from Frederick's son Manfred, offering to contribute to the expenses of the campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 1936 the U.S. {{court ruled}} in U.S. v. One Package that {{medically}} prescribing contraception {{to save a}} persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent {{of the adult population}} supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families. The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all <b>plans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods.

Several European cities wanted to follow the likes of London, Madrid, Moscow and Paris, and were thus hopeful to gain their NOC's support.

Other referenced cities were Budapest, Milan, Rome, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Oslo and Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, an {{existing}} tropical storm watch was extended northward to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. The next day, {{a tropical storm}} warning was extended northward to Plymouth, Massachusetts, but was soon replaced by a hurricane warning. The watch stretching to the Merrimack River was then replaced by a warning. By 0900 UTC on September 17, all tropical cyclone advisories were lifted. In Connecticut, utility companies readied supplies and emergency crews {{in advance of the}} hurricane. In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with the anticipation of heavy rains, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) prepared to send eight teams into the field to take measurements along 30 rivers. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond advised residents to prepare for the storm's onslaught.
