40|$|Abstract—Web Services can be published, {{discovered}} and invoked over the web. Web Services {{can be implemented}} in any available technology but they are accessible through a standard protocol. With web services being accepted and deployed in both research and industrial areas, the security related issues become important. In this paper, architecture evaluated for web service on negotiating a mutually acceptable security policy based on web service description language to both consumer and provider [1]. It allows a service consumer to discover and retrieve a service-provider’s security <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> service requests and allows a service consumer to send its own security <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> service responses to the service provider. The service consumer combines its own <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> service requests {{with that of the}} service provider to obtain the applied security <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> requests, which specifies the set of security operations that the consumer must perform on the request. The combining takes place {{in such a way that}} the applied security policy is consistent with both the consumer’s and provider’s security policies.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between municipal <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply and the planning of new housing in Sweden. Through {{a case study of}} Göteborg municipality and a comparative content analysis of Göteborgs <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply and a number of plans featuring housing the analysis {{seeks to investigate}} the effect of <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply as a tool for securing the demand for housing in the Swedish municipalities. The thesis also seeks to discuss its findings using theory concerning the implementation of policy and the general planning situation for Swedish municipalities today. The result of the analysis shows that most plans fail to regulate most of the content suggested in the <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply, particularly regarding aspects such as pricing, type of housing and type of ownership. The result also points towards a relationship regarding the prevalence of municipal land contracts and compatibility to <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply as well as a connection between how extensive the plans are in their proposed land use and their compatibility with <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply. Using theories of policy implementation and the municipal planning situation, possible explanations for the findings of the analysis could be a split in responsibility between the formulating and implementation of the <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply and its contents, a lack of resources of means for implementing or the prevalence of special interests when attempting to convert policy to plans...|$|R
