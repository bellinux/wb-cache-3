40|$|Abstract — Suppose Alice and Bob try to {{transform}} an entangled state shared between them into another one by local operations and classical communications. Then in general {{a certain amount}} of entanglement contained in the initial state will decrease in the process of transformation. However, an interesting phenomenon called <b>partial</b> entanglement <b>recovery</b> shows {{that it is possible to}} recover some amount of entanglement by adding another entangled state and transforming the two entangled states collectively. In this paper we are mainly concerned with the feasibility of <b>partial</b> entanglement <b>recovery.</b> The basic problem we address is whether a given state is useful in recovering entanglement lost in a specified transformation. In the case where the source and target states of the original transformation satisfy the strict majorization relation, a necessary and sufficient condition for <b>partial</b> entanglement <b>recovery</b> is obtained. For the general case we give two sufficient conditions. We also give an efficient algorithm for the feasibility of <b>partial</b> entanglement <b>recovery</b> in polynomial time. As applications, we establish some interesting connections between <b>partial</b> entanglement <b>recovery</b> and the generation of maximally entangled states, quantum catalysis, mutual catalysis, and multiple-copy entanglement transformation.

5|$|After Manzikert, a <b>partial</b> <b>recovery</b> (referred {{to as the}} Komnenian restoration) {{was made}} {{possible}} by the Komnenian dynasty. The first Komnenian emperor was Isaac I (1057–1059), after which the Doukas dynasty held power (1059–81). The Komnenoi attained power again under Alexios I in 1081. From the outset of his reign, Alexios faced a formidable attack by the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemund of Taranto, who captured Dyrrhachium and Corfu, and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly. Robert Guiscard's death in 1085 temporarily eased the Norman problem. The following year, the Seljuq sultan died, and the sultanate was split by internal rivalries. By his own efforts, Alexios defeated the Pechenegs; they were caught by surprise and annihilated at the Battle of Levounion on 28 April 1091.|$|E
40|$|Nielsen’s theorem {{indicates}} that a bipartite entangled pure state can be exactly converted into another pure one by local quantum operations and classical communication {{if and only if}} the Schmidt coefficient vector of the former is majorized by that of the latter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 436 (1999) ]. As a consequence of Nielsen’s majorization criterion, the quantity of entanglement is decreased during the conversion process. On the other hand, it was observed that the entanglement lost in this process may be partially recovered by using an auxiliary entangled state [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 3189 (2000) ]. However, it is usually not easy to find an auxiliary state {{that can be used to}} do <b>partial</b> entanglement <b>recovery</b> for a given transformation. The major difficulty seems due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this paper, we introduce three indices of uniformity for bipartite entangled pure states. These indices enable us to find some convenient conditions for <b>partial</b> entanglement <b>recovery.</b> In the case that the Schmidt coefficient vector of the source state is strictly majorized by that of the target state, a complete characterization of auxiliary states for <b>partial</b> entanglement <b>recovery</b> is obtained. For the general case, two sufficient conditions for such auxiliary states are given. A combination of these results implies that the choice of the auxiliary state can only depend on the target state and the presence of the equalities in the majorization relation, and the source state is in fact irrelevant. As applications, we establish some interesting connections of <b>partial</b> entanglement <b>recovery</b> to the generation of maximally entangled states, entanglement catalysis, and multiple-copy entanglement transformation.

The Boangi and Likeli peoples were {{forcibly}} resettled closer to the post at Bosow and in 1903 Abir troops intervened to stop the emigration of the Lika people and villagers near Samba. To stop small scale emigration Abir instigated a permit system for people wishing to visit another village. At the Momponi post the Abir agent led a punitive expedition against the Seketulu tribe which resulted in 400 civilian deaths with hundreds captured and put in prison, where a further 100 died. When the Nsongo Mboyo tribe attempted to emigrate 1,000 were captured and sent to a forced labour camp. The Likongo, Lianja, Nkole, Yan a-Yanju, Nongo-Ingoli, and Lofoma people all successfully fled toward Tshuapa. Despite this chaos Abir managed to increase its exports for 1903 to 951 tons recording the second highest profits in its history.

40|$|Random linear coding (RLC) {{can improve}} the {{performance}} of multicast transmissions in terms of throughput and energy efficiency. However, RLC and linear codes in general cannot necessarily attain the optimal performance in arbitrary networks. In this regard, <b>partial</b> packet <b>recovery</b> {{can be considered as}} a nonlinear strategy to complement such approaches for more general networks. In this paper, we propose a <b>partial</b> packet <b>recovery</b> scheme that benefits from the sparsity of bit errors in partially corrupted RLC packets. As opposed to many previous schemes, it performs without introducing preliminary checksums or preambles, demanding physical layer soft information, or requesting post-redundancy from the transmitter. It relies only on algebraic coding and data processing techniques, the existing knowledge at the receiver, and the conventional acknowledgment messages in RLC. By reconstructing and utilizing the partially corrupted packets that are usually discarded, it can reduce the average number of transmitted RLC packets required for successful decoding by typically 50 %, which improves throughput and energy efficiency at the transmitter. We formulate our <b>partial</b> packet <b>recovery</b> {{in the form of a}} sparse recovery problem, present its different solutions using compressive sensing theory, discuss their complexity, and present and evaluate a Markov chain model for its performance. 15 page(s...|$|R

Whilst simple, this approach may lead to data selection bias, which may be at the basis of regulatory guidance requiring the assessment of the relevance of incomplete workouts to LGD estimation.

We enhance this literature by developing a non-parametric estimator that -under certain distributional assumptions on the recovery profiles- aggregates complete and incomplete workout data to produce unbiased and more efficient estimates of mean LGD than those obtained from the estimator based on resolved cases only. Our estimator is appropriate in LGD estimation for wholesale portfolios, where the exposure-weighted LGD estimators available in the literature would not be applicable under Basel II regulatory guidance. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Partial</b> packet <b>recovery</b> {{protocols}} {{attempt to}} repair corrupted packets instead of retransmitting {{them in their}} entirety. Recent approaches have used physical layer confidence estimates or additional error detection codes embedded in each transmission to identify corrupt bits, or have applied forward error correction to repair without such explicit knowledge. In contrast to these approaches, our goal is a practical design that simultaneously: (a) requires no extra bits in correct packets, (b) reduces recovery latency, except in rare instances, (c) remains compatible with existing 802. 11 devices by obeying timing and backoff standards, and (d) can be incrementally deployed on widely available access points and wireless cards. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate Maranello, a novel <b>partial</b> packet <b>recovery</b> mechanism for 802. 11. In Maranello, the receiver computes checksums over blocks in corrupt packets and bundles these checksums into a negative acknowledgment sent when the sender expects to receive an acknowledgment. The sender then retransmits only those blocks for which the checksum is incorrect, and repeats this partial retransmission until it receives an acknowledgment. Successful transmissions are not burdened by additional bits and the receiver needs not infer which bits were corrupted. We implemented Maranello using OpenFWWF (open source firmware for Broadcom wireless cards) and deployed it in a small testbed. We compare Maranello to alternative recovery protocols using a trace-driven simulation and to 802. 11 using a live implementation under various channel conditions. To our knowledge, Maranello is the first <b>partial</b> packet <b>recovery</b> design to be implemented in commonly available firmware. ...|$|R
