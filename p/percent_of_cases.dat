5|$|Many {{cases of}} croup are {{preventable}} by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. Croup is usually {{treated with a}} single dose of steroids by mouth. In more severe cases inhaled epinephrine may also be used. Hospitalization is required in one to five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E
5|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD), a hereditary kidney condition, {{is known to be}} associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> but most such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely to rupture. As a result, screening is only recommended in families with ADPKD where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm.|$|E

50|$|A 2016 {{report by}} the Sarasota Herald-Tribune found that Florida judges {{sentence}} black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background. For the same drug possession crimes, blacks were sentenced to double the time of whites. Blacks were given longer sentences in 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> felony <b>cases,</b> 68 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the most serious first-degree crimes, 45 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> burglary <b>cases</b> and 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> battery <b>cases.</b> For third-degree felonies (the least serious types of felonies in Florida), white judges sentenced blacks to twenty percent more time than whites, whereas black judges gave more balanced sentences.|$|R

5|$|Health {{professionals}} are often involved in Egypt, Kenya, Indonesia and Sudan. In Egypt 77 percent of FGM procedures, and in Indonesia over 50 percent, were performed by medical professionals as of 2008 and 2016. Women in Egypt reported in 1995 that a local anaesthetic {{had been used}} on their daughters in 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> a general anaesthetic in 13 percent and neither in 25 percent (two percent were missing/don't know).|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|Neck {{stiffness}} usually presents {{six hours}} after initial onset of SAH. Isolated dilation of a pupil {{and loss of}} the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation {{as a result of}} rising intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull). Intraocular hemorrhage (bleeding into the eyeball) may occur in response to the raised pressure: subhyaloid hemorrhage (bleeding under the hyaloid membrane, which envelops the vitreous body of the eye) and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy. This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases)</b> and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the complications of}} gold sodium thiomalate therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 32 patients with active RA (27 female, 5 male) treated for a mean period of 28 ? 14 weeks were studied. From these patients, 62. 5 (46 - 79) percent showed at least one drug reaction. Pruritus {{was the most common}} complication occurred in 59 (42 - 76) percents, and was accompanied by skin rush in 37 (15 - 57) <b>percents</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> Renal, mucosal and post-injection complication developed, each in 16 (3 - 29) and <b>percents</b> <b>of</b> patients. Hematologic and pulmonary reaction occurred in 12. 5 (1 - 24) and 9 (1 - 19) <b>percents</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> respectively. Drug reaction resulted to discontinuation of gold therapy in 19 (5 - 32) <b>percents</b> <b>of</b> patients. Majority of drug reactions occurred during the first 15 weeks of therapy. In comparison to reports coming from other studies, drug reactions in Iranian patients were more frequent but less severe...|$|R
40|$|New York State has {{reported}} more AIDS cases (26, 576) through November 1989 {{than any other}} state, accounting for 23 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> all reported <b>cases</b> in the nation at the time. New York City {{has reported}} 22, 231 (84 <b>percent)</b> <b>of</b> the statewide <b>cases.</b> The epidemiology <b>of</b> AIDS in New York State has been easily influenced by the large number <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> among IVDUs. Whereas intravenous drug use accounts for 16 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> adult/adolescent <b>cases</b> {{in the rest of}} the nation, it accounts for 39 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cases</b> in New York State. Intravenous drug use is the leading exposure category among racial minorities, with a disproportionately high rate <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> among Blacks and Hispanics. The epidemic among women and children has also been severe, resulting from intravenous drug use by women, heterosexual transmission from drug users to women, and perinatal transmission to their children...|$|R

5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|If the {{compressed}} {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The air may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the second most common cause of death while diving (drowning being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> diagnosed as AGE, with approximate estimates of frequency.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected {{on the first}} angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E

5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal.|$|E
5|$|Infection with {{smallpox}} {{is focused}} in small blood vessels {{of the skin}} and in the mouth and throat before disseminating. In the skin it results in a characteristic maculopapular rash and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters. V. major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent. V. minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim) which killed about 1 percent of those it infects. Long-term complications of V. major infection included characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 percent of survivors. Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pain is {{experienced}} by 53 {{percent of all}} people diagnosed with malignant cancer, 59 percent of people receiving anticancer treatment, 64 percent of people with metastatic or advanced-stage disease, and 33 percent of people after completion of curative treatment. Evidence for prevalence of pain in newly diagnosed cancer is scarce. One study found pain in 38 {{percent of people who}} were newly diagnosed, another found 35 percent of such people had experienced pain in the preceding two weeks, while another reported that pain was an early symptom in 18–49 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> More than one third of people with cancer pain describe the pain as moderate or severe.|$|E

5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of sexual partners and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{psoriasis}}: plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic. Plaque psoriasis, {{also known as}} psoriasis vulgaris, makes up about 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> It typically presents as red patches with white scales on top. Areas of the body most commonly affected are {{the back of the}} forearms, shins, navel area, and scalp. Guttate psoriasis has drop-shaped lesions. Pustular psoriasis presents as small non-infectious pus-filled blisters. Inverse psoriasis forms red patches in skin folds. Erythrodermic psoriasis occurs when the rash becomes very widespread, and can develop from any of the other types. Fingernails and toenails are affected in most people with psoriasis at some point in time. This may include pits in the nails or changes in nail color.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar {{region of the}} brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum is one {{of several}} {{poisonous}} members of the genus Tricholoma; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant smell and taste add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. These arise 15minutes to 2hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes 4 to 6 days. Sweating and anxiety may be evident, and disturbance in liver function has been recorded. Cramping may occur in the calves. In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the stomach and intestines.|$|E
