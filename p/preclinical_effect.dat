30|$|Because of the {{characteristics}} of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation of CSCs, the efficacy of conventional cancer treatments including chemotherapy and radiotherapy is often low. The few attempts using CART cells to eliminate CSCs (e.g., using CART cells specific for CD 133 or EpCAM for cancer therapy) (Zhu et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2015) indicated that the strategy of CART cells specific for CSCs can probably be regarded as a considerable treatment in various cancer types. Further, the impressive data generated from CART cells to treat liquid and solid tumors provide a novel concept for the use of CSC-targeted CART cells in cancer treatment. However, there is not enough available information to make a conclusion about the clinical response of CART-CSC cells in cancer treatment, although a number of in vitro and animal model studies suggest a therapeutic benefit. Unfortunately, these explorations of CART-CSC cells in cancer treatment are prohibited by ethics problems, whereas successful cancer treatment is only measured on patients in the clinic. Therefore, more detailed data about the <b>preclinical</b> <b>effect</b> of CART-CSC cells on various types of cancer will undoubtedly be in favor of the development of this therapy in future clinical trials.|$|E

SMT is associated with changes in pain sensitivity, suggesting related altered central nervous system response or processing of afferent nociceptive input. Placebo is also associated with changes in pain sensitivity, and the efficacy of SMT for changes in pain sensitivity beyond placebo has not been adequately considered. We randomly assigned 110 participants with low back pain to receive SMT, placebo SMT, placebo SMT with the instructional set "The manual therapy technique you will receive {{has been shown to}} significantly reduce low back pain in some people," or no intervention. Participants receiving the SMT and placebo SMT received their assigned intervention 6 times over 2 weeks. Pain sensitivity was assessed prior to and immediately following the assigned intervention during the first session. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline and following 2 weeks of participation in the study. Immediate attenuation of suprathreshold heat response was greatest following SMT (P = . 05, partial η(2)  = . 07). Group-dependent differences were not observed for changes in pain intensity and disability at 2 weeks. Participant satisfaction was greatest following the enhanced placebo SMT. This study was registered at www. clinicaltrials. gov under the identifier NCT 01168999. PERSPECTIVE: The results of this study indicate attenuation of pain sensitivity is greater in response to SMT than the expectation of receiving an SMT. These findings suggest a potential mechanism of SMT related to lessening of central sensitization and may indicate a <b>preclinical</b> <b>effect</b> beyond the expectations of receiving SMT...|$|E

The majority of studies have focused on animal models. Recent preclinical studies have identified the B. longum 1714 strain as a putative psychobiotic with an impact on stress-related behaviors, physiology and cognitive performance. Whether such <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects</b> could be translated to healthy human volunteers remains unknown. We tested whether psychobiotic consumption could affect the stress response, cognition and brain activity patterns. In a within-participants design, healthy volunteers (N= 22) completed cognitive assessments, resting electroencephalography and were exposed to a socially evaluated cold pressor test at baseline, post-placebo and post-psychobiotic. Increases in cortisol output and subjective anxiety in response to the socially evaluated cold pressor test were attenuated. Furthermore, daily reported stress was reduced by psychobiotic consumption. We also observed subtle improvements in hippocampus-dependent visuospatial memory performance, as well as enhanced frontal midline electroencephalographic mobility following psychobiotic consumption. These subtle but clear benefits are in line with the predicted impact from preclinical screening platforms. Our results indicate that consumption of B. longum 1714 is associated with reduced stress and improved memory.

This study undertakes both a systematic and meta-analytic review of research investigating APOE-related differences in cognition in mid-adulthood, when detrimental effects of the allele may first be detectable. Methods: Thirty-six papers investigating the behavioral effects of APOE ε 4 in mid-adulthood (defined as a mean sample age between 35 and 60 years) were reviewed. In addition, the effect of carrying an ε 4 allele on individual cognitive domains was assessed in separate meta-analyses.

This approach attempts to prevent cancer by incorporating laboratory methods to document the molecular dose and <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects</b> of carcinogens, as well as factors that increase individual susceptibility to carcinogens. Recently we have carried out validation studies of biologic markers such as carcinogen-DNA and carcinogen-protein adducts, gene and chromosomal mutations, alterations in target oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, polymorphisms in putative susceptibility genes (individual P 450 s, glutathione transferase Ml), and serum levels of micronutrients. This research involves adults, infants, and children exposed to varying levels of carcinogens, as well as cancer cases and controls. On a group level, dose-response relationships have frequently been seen between various biomarkers and environmental exposures such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cigarette smoke (active and passive), and ambient indoor and workplace air pollution. However, there is significant interindividual variation in biomarkers that appears to reflect a modulating effect on biomarkers (hence potential risk) by genetic and acquired susceptibility factors. Ongoing retrospective and nested case-control studies of lung and breast cancer are examining the association between biomarkers and cancer risk.

Accordingly, we have carried {{out a series of}} molecular epidemiologic studies aimed at validating a panel of biologic markers, including carcinogen–DNA and –protein adducts, sister chromatid exchange, micronucleus formation, DNA strand breaks, and DNA repair capacity. Results from three such studies illustrate the usefulness of these biomarkers in elucidating low-dose–response relationships, correlations between biomarkers, and the range of variation in biomarkers between individuals exposed to similar concentrations of carcinogens. Low-level workplace or ambient exposures to styrene, ethylene oxide, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were associated with significant increases in both molecular dose of carcinogens (adducts) and various markers of <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects.</b> Correlations between biomarkers varied by exposure. For example, in the styrene study, sister chromatid exchange frequency was not correlated with any of the markers, in contrast to the studies of ethylene oxide and PAH. Significant molecular effects were observed not only in occupationally exposed people but also in residents of an area in Poland characterized by high levels of air pollution. For example, the mean PAH–DNA level in exposed residents (winter sample) was 30. 4 adducts per 108 nucleotides. This level was significantly higher than that of adducts seen in summer samples from the same area (4. 2 / 108), or in winter samples from residents of a rural area (11. 01 / 108). Significant seasonal variation in PAH–DNA adduct formation in this group was consistent with recorded fluctuations in air pollution levels.

40|$|Porphyrias are {{relatively}} uncommon inherited or acquired disorders in which clinical manifestations {{are attributable to}} a disturbance of heme synthesis (porphyrin metabolism), usually in association with endogenous or exogenous stressors. Porphyrias are characterized by elevations of heme precursors in blood, urine, and/or stool. A number of chemicals, particularly metals and halogenated hydrocarbons, induce disturbances of heme synthesis in experimental animals. Certain chemicals have also been linked to porphyria or porphyrinuria in humans, exposures or environmental exposures much higher than generally involving chronic industrial those usually encountered. A noteworthy example is the Turkish epidemic of porphyria cutanea tarda produced by accidental ingestion of wheat treated with the fungicide hexachlorobenzene. Measurements of excreted heme precursors {{have the potential to}} serve as biological markers for harmful but <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects</b> of certain chemical exposures; this potential warrants further research and applied field studies. It has been hypothesized that several otherwise unexplained chemical-associated illnesses, such as multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome, may represent mild chronic cases of porphyria or other acquired abnormalities in heme synthesis. This review concludes that, although it is reasonable to consider such hypotheses, there is currently no convincing evidence that these illnesses are mediated by a disturbance of heme synthesis; it is premature or unfounded to base clinical management on such explanations unless laboratory data are diagnostic for porphyria.

Vortioxetine (Lu AA 21004) in development as a novel multimodal antidepressant is a 5 -HT 3, 5 -HT 7 and 5 -HT 1 D receptor antagonist, a 5 -HT 1 B receptor partial agonist, a 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist and a 5 -HT transporter (5 -HTT) inhibitor in vitro. Preclinical studies suggest that 5 -HT 3 and 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonism as well as 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonism may have a positive impact on cognitive functions including memory. Thus vortioxetine may potentially enhance memory. We investigated <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects</b> of vortioxetine (1 – 10 mg/kg administered subcutaneously [s. c. ]) on memory in behavioral tests, and on cortical neurotransmitter levels considered important in rat memory function. Contextual fear conditioning and novel object recognition tests were applied to assess memory in rats. Microdialysis studies were conducted to measure extracellular neurotransmitter levels in the rat medial prefrontal cortex. Vortioxetine administered 1 h before or immediately after acquisition of contextual fear conditioning led to an increase in freezing time during the retention test. This mnemonic effect was not related to changes in pain sensitivity as measured in the hotplate test. Rats treated with vortioxetine 1 h before training spent more time exploring the novel object in the novel object recognition test. In microdialysis studies of the rat medial prefrontal cortex, vortioxetine increased extracellular levels of acetylcholine and histamine. In conclusion, vortioxetine enhanced contextual and episodic memory in rat behavioral models. Further demonstration of its potential effect on memory functions in clinical settings is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Src family kinase {{activity}} is elevated {{in a number}} of human cancers including breast cancer. This increased activity has been associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Src inhibitors are currently in clinical development with a number of trials currently assessing their activity in breast cancer. However, the results to date have been disappointing and a further evaluation of the <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects</b> of Src inhibitors is required to help establish whether these agents will be useful in the treatment of breast cancer. In this study we investigate the effects of dasatinib, which is a potent inhibitor of Src family kinases, on the initiation and development of breast cancer in a genetically engineered model of the disease. The mouse model utilised is driven by expression of activated ErbB 2 under the transcriptional control of its endogenous promoter coupled with conditional loss of Pten under the control of Cre recombinase expressed by the BLG promoter. We show that daily oral administration of dasatinib delays tumour onset and increases overall survival but does not inhibit the proliferation of established tumours. The striking difference between the dasatinib treated group of tumours and the vehicle controls was the prominent squamous metaplasia that was seen in 6 out of 11 dasatinib treated tumours. This was accompanied by a dramatic upregulation of both E-cadherin and β-catenin and down regulation of ErbB 2 in the dasatinib treated tumours. Dasatinib also inhibited both the migration and invasion of tumour derived cell lines in vitro. Together these data support the argument that benefits of Src inhibitors may predominate in early or even pre-invasive disease...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{usually has}} a dismal prognosis {{because of its}} limited response to current pharmacotherapy and high metastatic rate. Sulfated oligosaccharide has been confirmed as having potent antitumor activities against solid tumors. Here, we explored the <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects</b> and molecular mechanisms of isomalto oligosaccharide sulfate (IMOS), another novel sulfated oligosaccharide, in HCC cell lines and a xenograft model. Methods The effects of IMOS on HCC proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, and invasiveness in vitro were assessed by cell counting, flow cytometry, adhesion, wound healing, and transwell assays, respectively. The roles of IMOS on HCC growth and metastasis in xenograft models were evaluated by tumor volumes and fluorescent signals. Total and phosphorylated protein levels of AKT, ERK, and JNK as well as total levels of c-MET were detected by Western blotting. IMOS-regulated genes were screened by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) array in HCCLM 3 -red fluorescent protein (RFP) xenograft tissues and then confirmed by qRT-PCR in HepG 2 and Hep 3 B cells. Results IMOS markedly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis of HCCLM 3, HepG 2, and Bel- 7402 cells and also significantly suppressed cell adhesion, migration, and invasion of HCCLM 3 in vitro. At doses of 60 and 90 mg/kg/d, IMOS displayed robust inhibitory effects on HCC growth and metastasis without obvious side effects in vivo. The levels of pERK, tERK, and pJNK as well as c-MET were significantly down-regulated after treatment with 16 mg/mL IMOS. No obvious changes {{were found in the}} levels of pAkt, tAkt, and tJNK. Ten differentially expressed genes were screened from HCCLM 3 -RFP xenograft tissues after treatment with IMOS at a dose of 90 mg/kg/d. Similar gene expression profiles were confirmed in HepG 2 and Hep 3 B cells after treatment with 16 mg/mL IMOS. Conclusions IMOS is a potential anti-HCC candidate through inhibition of ERK and JNK signaling independent of p 53 and worth studying further in patients with HCC, especially at advanced stages. </p...|$|R

Therefore, lymphoma is {{a suitable}} model {{for studying the}} therapeutic value of disrupting the HDM 2 -p 53 interaction by small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs). HDM 2 have been developed and are under various stages of preclinical and clinical investigation. Previously, we examined the anti-lymphoma activity of MI- 319, the laboratory grade of {{a new class of}} HDM 2 SMI, the spiro-oxindole, in follicular lymphoma. Since then, MI- 219, the clinical grade has become readily available. This study further examines the <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects</b> and mechanisms of MI- 219 in a panel of human lymphoma cell lines as well as a cohort of patient-derived B-lymphcytes for its potential clinical use. Results Preclinical assessment of MI- 219 was evaluated by means of an in vitro and ex vivo approach and compared to Nutlin- 3, the gold standard. Characterization of p 53 activity and stability were assessed by quantitative PCR, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation. Biological outcome was measured using Trypan blue exclusion assay, Annexin V/PI, PARP and caspase- 3 cleavage. Surprisingly, the overall biological effects of Nutlin- 3 were more delayed (48 h) while MI- 219 triggered an earlier response (12 - 24 h), predominantly in the form of apoptotic cell death. Using a cell free autoubiquitination assay, neither agent interfered with HDM 2 E 3 ligase function. MI- 219 was more effective in upregulating wt-p 53 stabilization compared to Nutlin- 3. MI- 219, but not Nutlin- 3, enhanced the autoubiquitination and degradation of HDM 2. Conclusions Our data reveals unexpected differences between MI- 219 and the well-studied Nutlin- 3 in lymphoma cell lines and patient samples. We suggest a novel mechanism for MI- 219 that alters the functional activity of HDM 2 through enhanced autoubiquitination and degradation. Additionally, this mechanism appears to correspond to biological outcome. Our results provide evidence that different classes of HDM 2 SMIs elicit molecular events that extend beyond HDM 2 -p 53 dissociation which may be of biological and potentially therapeutic importance. </p...|$|R

To determine {{the health benefits of}} reducing air pollution related to coal-burning, we compared molecular biomarkers of exposure and <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects</b> in umbilical cord blood to neurodevelopmental outcomes from two successive birth cohorts enrolled before and after a highly polluting, coal-fired power plant in Tongliang County, China had ceased operation. Women and their newborns in the two successive cohorts were enrolled at the time of delivery. We measured PAH-DNA adducts, a biomarker of PAH-exposure and DNA damage, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein involved in neuronal growth, in umbilical cord blood. At age two, children were tested using the Gesell Developmental Schedules (GDS). The two cohorts were compared with respect to levels of both biomarkers in cord blood as well as developmental quotient (DQ) scores across 5 domains. Lower levels of PAH-DNA adducts, higher concentrations of the mature BDNF protein (mBDNF) and higher DQ scores were seen in the 2005 cohort enrolled after closure of the power plant. In the two cohorts combined, PAH-DNA adducts were inversely associated with mBDNF as well as scores for motor (p =  0. 05), adaptive (p =  0. 022), and average (p =  0. 014) DQ. BDNF levels were positively associated with motor (p =  0. 018), social (p =  0. 001), and average (p =  0. 017) DQ scores. The findings indicate that the closure of a coal-burning plant resulted in the reduction of PAH-DNA adducts in newborns and increased mBDNF levels that in turn, were positively associated with neurocognitive development.

Secondary end points included the ACR 20 over time, as well as 50 % (ACR 50) and 70 % (ACR 70) improvement responses, changes in individual components of the ACR improvement criteria, and disease activity measured with the Disease Activity Score based on the 28 -joint count. AZD 5672 was a highly potent and selective antagonist of CCR 5, displaying nonproportional steady-state pharmacokinetics while inhibiting internalization of CCR 5 in an ex vivo macrophage inflammatory protein 1 β stimulation assay in which AZD 5672 was evaluated over the 20 - 150 -mg dose range. In the phase IIb study testing this dose range in patients with RA (n = 371 patients randomized to received treatment), AZD 5672 was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected adverse events. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at week 12 between those receiving any dose of AZD 5672 and those receiving placebo; etanercept was significantly more efficacious than AZD 5672 and placebo. Despite a clear rationale for targeting CCR 5, this clinical study showed that AZD 5672, administered orally, did not have any clinical benefit, suggesting that CCR 5 antagonism alone is unlikely to be a viable therapeutic strategy in R...|$|R

40|$|PurposeDespite {{established}} insulin-sensitizing and anti-atherosclerotic <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects,</b> epidemiological {{investigations of}} adiponectin, an adipocyte derived peptide, have yielded conflicting findings, particularly in long-term prognosis. Therefore, we investigated in a case-control study conducted in men whether serum adiponectin levels {{are associated with}} long-term mortality in patients with Coronary Heart Disease and in controls. Methods 461 patients and 468 controls aged 35 – 64 (60. 2 ± 8. 1 years) were included and followed 6. 5 ± 1. 2 years. Patients and controls were compared at inclusion {{and the risk of}} death was estimated separately. ResultsMore prevalent hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemias, low physical activity, smoking and elevated CRP was observed in patients in comparison with controls. Adiponectin levels were significantly lower in patients (5. 7 ± 4. 5 vs 7. 2 ± 4. 6 mg/l, p = 0. 001). After multivariate adjustment, adiponectin remained related to CHD patients in relation to controls: OR = 0. 54 (95 % CI: 0. 30 – 0. 98) for Q 2 –Q 3 (i. e. 3. 4 – 7. 9 mg/L) and OR = 0. 52 (95 % IC: 0. 31 – 0. 87) for Q 4 (8. 0 mg/L) versus Q 1 (< 3. 4 mg/L), respectively. After an identical follow-up, CHD patients showed a higher overall mortality rate than controls (n = 79 vs n = 22 deaths, p = 0. 001). Risks of death by adiponectin levels were assessed after adjustment for established risk factors. In controls, HR was 1. 44 (95 % IC: 0. 28 – 7. 35) for Q 2 –Q 3 and 2. 56 (0. 50 – 13. 2) for Q 4, compared to Q 1. In cases, HR was 2. 97 (1. 45 – 6. 10) for Q 2 –Q 3 and 7. 07 (3. 11 – 16. 8) for Q 4. ConclusionWhereas serum adiponectin levels were higher in controls than in CHD patients, adiponectin was positively related to long-term mortality in both CHD patients and controls. Such paradoxical observation suggests that adiponectin levels could be modified in patients by cardiovascular drugs and goes against a protective effect of adiponectin in vascular disease...|$|R
40|$|Cannabinoid agonists, {{including}} marijuana containing delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), {{are found}} rewarding by humans. In addition to human self-reports and experimental {{studies that show}} marijuana is rewarding, contributions from preclinical studies also have implicated cannabinoid receptors in reward-motivated behavior. One way to assess these <b>preclinical</b> <b>effects</b> of cannabinoids is intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), where an animal performs a response to receive electrical stimulation of a specific brain area or circuit known {{to be involved in}} reward. Drugs of abuse, such as psychomotor stimulants, facilitate responding for ICSS. While a few studies have shown facilitating effects of cannabinoids in rats, several have shown the opposite effect, and no studies so far have evaluated cannabinoids in mouse ICSS. Furthermore there are no studies evaluating specific inhibitors of endocannabinoid catabolic enzymes in ICSS in any species. In these studies we assessed the cannabinoid agonist THC, as well as the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor, PF- 3845, the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor JZL 184, and the combined FAAH/MAGL inhibitor SA- 57 in ICSS of the medial forebrain bundle in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Additionally, we assessed the psychomotor stimulant cocaine as a positive control to facilitate ICSS. These studies were complimented with spontaneous locomotor activity and food-maintained operant experiments to assess the sensitivity of ICSS to cannabinoids. Additionally, brain endocannabinoid levels were measured in brain regions associated with the mesolimbic system after enzyme inhibitor treatments. 	THC, JZL 184, and SA- 57 all produced time-dependent reductions in ICSS that were mediated through CB 1 receptors, as they were blocked by pre-treatment with the CB 1 antagonist rimonabant, but not with the CB 2 antagonist SR 144528. PF- 3845 also reduced ICSS, but did so independent of CB 1 and CB 2 receptors, and only with one dose (30. 0 mg/kg) that has not been assessed previously in vivo. We showed that ICSS was more sensitive to the rate-reducing effects of cannabinoids than other measures of behavior with motor components including spontaneous locomotor activity and operant nose-poking for food, and that the reduction of ICSS produced by both JZL 184 and SA- 57 is accompanied by increases in 2 -AG in mesolimbic brain areas. Thus, cannabinoids do not facilitate ICSS in C 57 BL/ 6 mice over a range of doses and pre-treatment times, similar to most studies with rats. These data suggest that cannabinoids may produce rewarding effects through non-mesolimbic areas of the brain...|$|R
40|$|Human xenografts {{of acute}} myeloid leukemia (AML) in nonobese diabetic/severe {{combined}} immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice result in disease states of diffuse, nonpalpable tissue infiltrates exhibiting a variable disease course, with some animals not developing a disease phenotype. Thus, disease staging and, more critically, quantification of <b>preclinical</b> therapeutic <b>effect</b> in these models are particularly difficult. In this study, we present the generation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) -labeled human leukemic cell line, NB 4, and validate the potential of a time-domain imager fitted with a 470 nm picosecond pulsed laser diode to decouple GFP fluorescence from autofluorescence {{on the basis of}} fluorescence lifetime and thus determine the depth and relative concentration of GFP inclusions in phantoms of homogeneous and heterogeneous optical properties. Subsequently, we developed an optical imageable human xenograft model of NB 4 -GFP AML and illustrate early disease detection, depth discrimination of leukemic infiltrates, and longitudinal monitoring of disease course employing time-domain optical imaging. We conclude that early disease detection through use of time-domain imaging in this initially slowly progressing AML xenograft model permits accurate disease staging and should aid in future preclinical development of therapeutics for AML...|$|R
40|$|Measuring and {{incorporating}} a scanner-specific point spread function (PSF) within image reconstruction {{has been shown}} to improve spatial resolution in PET. However, due to the short half-life of clinically used isotopes, other long-lived isotopes not used in clinical practice are used to perform the PSF measurements. As such, non-optimal PSF models that do not correspond to those needed for the data to be reconstructed are used within resolution modeling (RM) image reconstruction, usually underestimating the true PSF owing to the difference in positron range. In high resolution brain and <b>preclinical</b> imaging, this <b>effect</b> is of particular importance since the PSFs become more positron range limited and isotope-specific PSFs can help maximize the performance benefit from using resolution recovery image reconstruction algorithms...|$|R
40|$|This EPA Website {{document}} {{summarizes the}} progress {{made by the}} EPA PM Centers in identifying and understanding {{the health effects of}} PM air pollution since the mid-course report prepared in 2002 (Lippmann et al., 2003). When the PM Centers were designated in 1999, the primary body of evidence for health effects of PM consisted of epidemiologic studies of associations of short-term PM concentrations with daily mortality and long-term average PM with long-term mortality. In the first six years of the PM Centers program there was substantial work to understand and assess potential flaws and weaknesses in this body of evidence, and to develop an understanding of the mechanisms underlying these associations. In the more recent work, the PM Centers research has substantially expanded the range of clinical and <b>preclinical</b> health <b>effects</b> indicators associated with PM exposures. With respect to toxicological studies, both in experimental animals and in vitro, increasing efforts were devoted to using real-world particles and exposures (e. g., use of ambient PM concentrators) and mimicking human conditions of compromised organ functions in animals for evaluating PM effects. While interest has continued in measuring the respiratory effects of PM, much of the recent research has focused on identifying and understanding the cardiovascular health effects of PM 2. 5 exposures...|$|R

40|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{controversy}} regarding the tumor-protective effects of regional anesthesia in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Evidence of up-to-date systematic reviews {{will be presented}} alongside recent updates {{on the effects of}} opioids and local anesthetics. In recent years, the literature regarding the effects of regional anesthesia techniques on cancer recurrence has raised many unanswered questions. Ongoing randomized controlled trials {{may not be able to}} shed light on the controversial discussion regarding the tumor protective effects of regional anesthesia because the expected effect size and event rate in those studies may be overstated. Recent more refined animal data, provides no evidence to suggest that opioids promote cancer recurrence or facilitate the development of metastatic disease. In addition, local anesthetics have promising <b>preclinical</b> anticarcinogenic <b>effects</b> that extend beyond their voltage-gated sodium channel blocking properties and could be of therapeutic value. Cancer recurrence in patients undergoing surgery remains a global burden. Current evidence suggests that regional techniques, opioid analgesia and local anesthetics in onco-anesthesia may require a tailored individual approach due to the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity within and between different tumors. The authors surmise that future or ongoing randomized controlled trials regarding regional anesthesia techniques and cancer outcome may not be able to reproduce clear results, as it will be challenging to prove the efficacy of one single intervention (e. g. regional anesthesia) in an otherwise complex multifactorial perioperative oncological settin...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigations described in this thesis was to characterize the in vivo pharmacological and PK-PD properties of buprenorphine relative to fentanyl with respect to: 1) kinetics of onset and offset of the pharmacological effects at the mu-opioid receptor, 2) selectivity of action (antinociception versus respiratory depression), 3) the interspecies extrapolation of the PK-PD correlation of the antinociceptive and respiratory depressant effect, 4) the role of active metabolites, 5) kinetics of antagonism of the respiratory depressant <b>effect.</b> <b>Preclinical</b> investigations were performed to develop and validate mechanism-based PK-PD models {{for the effects of}} opioids on antinociception and respiration. These PK-PD models were subsequently applied to characterize the effects of buprenorphine and fentanyl in humans. It was shown that the developed PK-PD model can be used to predict the efficacy and safety outcome of opioids in animals. Furthermore, the PK-PD model had excellent properties to enable animal-to-human extrapolation of the efficacy and safety outcome. Promotoren: M. Danhof, A. DahanWith summary in Dutc...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThat {{promising}} neuroprotectants {{failed to}} demonstrate benefit against stroke highlights the great difficulties to translate <b>preclinical</b> pharmacological <b>effects</b> in clinical outcomes. Part of this hurdle implies the complex response to injury of the neurovascular unit increasing the cerebrovascular permeability {{at the level}} of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Previous studies reported neuroprotection in animal models upon activation of the nuclear receptor PPARα (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) α, but the cellular targets at the BBB level remain largely unexplored. Here, to study whether PPAR-α activation acts on BBB permeability, we adapted a mouse BBB cell model to ischaemic conditions at the stage of occlusion defined in vitro as oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). This model consists of a co-culture of brain capillary endothelial cells (ECs) on a filter insert placed upon a rat glial cell culture. The EC monolayer permeability increase induced by 4 h of OGD was significantly restricted after treatment with the PPAR-α agonist fenofibric acid (FA) 24 h before or at the onset of OGD. Treatments of separated ECs or glial cells showed that this protective effect was conferred by BBB ECs but not glial cells. Furthermore, co-cultures with ECs from PPAR-α-deficient mice revealed that FA had no effect on OGD-induced hyperpermeability. No transcriptional modulation of classical PPAR-α target genes such as SOD, ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, ACO, CPT- 1, PDK- 4 or ET- 1 was observed in wild type mouse ECs. In conclusion, these results suggest that part of the preventive PPAR-α-mediated protection may occur via BBB ECs by limiting hyperpermeability...|$|R
