5|$|Due to low accuracy, the C-PIB-PET scan is not {{recommended}} {{to be used as}} an early diagnostic tool or for predicting the development of Alzheimer's disease when people show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The use of ¹⁸F-FDG PET scans, as a single test, to identify <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> develop Alzheimer's disease is also not supported by evidence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{within a few}} years to decades of the {{destruction}} of Easter Island society by slave raiding and introduced epidemics, two amateur investigators recorded readings and recitations of rongorongo tablets by Easter Islanders. Both accounts were compromised at best, and are often taken to be worthless, but they are the only accounts from <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> have been familiar with the script first-hand.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> have been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E

50|$|By {{singing the}} {{songs in the}} {{appropriate}} sequence, indigenous people could navigate vast distances, often travelling through the deserts of Australia's interior.

5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% of young <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required {{to continue their education}} full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, {{the spirits of the}} Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E
5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> {{have been at the}} council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus {{it is difficult to know}} what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E

5000|$|The Bad Pass Trail {{runs through}} the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area. For {{thousands}} of years, this trail was used by prehistoric indigenous <b>peoples,</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> also have been following paths made by migrating game. During the winter, the prehistoric people would travel southward on the trail to reach the caves in the canyon, where they took shelter. In the spring, they would travel northward to hunting grounds {{in what is now}} called Montana. The trail is considered a cultural or sacred site by Native Americans, and in the 21st century, no one is allowed to walk or drive on it.|$|R

25|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the Romans from southern Britain after 410, the remaining population slowly adopted the language, customs and beliefs of the Germanic Angles, Saxons and Jutes. Much of the process may have been due to cultural appropriation, as there was a widespread migration into Britain. The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> arrived <b>may</b> have been relatively small in numbers and aggressive towards the local populations they encountered.|$|R
25|$|This {{conflict}} {{may have}} been aggravated by the influx of less settled peoples, Numic-speakers such as the Utes, Shoshones, and Paiute <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> have originated in what is today California. Others suggest that more developed villages, such as that at Chaco Canyon, exhausted their environments, resulting in widespread deforestation and eventually the fall of their civilization through warfare over depleted resources.|$|E

25|$|The book is {{edited by}} Alam's friend Alikhani, {{who was also}} a {{minister}} in Alam's cabinet.
