5000|$|From {{an early}} age Johnson {{demonstrated}} a facility with the piano. Encouraged by his parents, along with singing in his church's choir, he began taking lessons in classical piano from his choir director. After many years of being {{under the tutelage of}} teachers and family influences, Johnson began using his ability to <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> pick out his favorite tunes from the radio. He was inspired by such songs as [...] "The In Crowd" [...] by Ramsey Lewis, [...] "Soulful Strut" [...] by Young-Holt Unlimited, and [...] "Tighten Up" [...] by Archie Bell and the Drells to focus on R&B rather than classical music. Johnson formed his own band, performing the R&B songs that were climbing the charts at that time.|$|E

25|$|Although {{for many}} years after her death Clara Schumann was not widely {{recognized}} as a composer, as a pianist she made an impression which lasts until today. She {{was one of the}} first pianists to perform from memory, making that the standard for concertizing.

5000|$|Meinecke {{developed}} {{an interest in}} jazz {{at the age of}} 12, which led him to start collecting records. When his father gave him a clarinet as a gift at the age of 19, he took a few lessons to learn basic fingerings, then immediately began <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> and <b>to</b> improvise. Between 1932 and 1943 he home-recorded a series of acetates with a [...] "slinky sound and bottomless trove of melodic ideas". Later, after moving to Chicago, Meinecke would study composition under American Five composer John J. Becker. Of one of Meinecke's works, Dr. Becker said it was [...] "exceedingly good, and likewise exceedingly difficult to perform, and that might be his greatest stumbling block - the difficulty to perform". He also played professionally around Chicago during the 40s.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the {{relationships}} among three basic auditory representations as well as their interaction with a measure of overall musicianship (sight-singing) among a group of classical and non-classical university music students (N = 112) selected from three different universities. Students were enrolled in level one of an aural skills course at the time. Basic auditory representations included were tonic centrality, measured by Colwell’s (1968) Feeling for Tonal Center, tonal grouping, measured by Colwell’s (1968) Auditory-Visual Discrimination, and harmonic function grouping, measured by a revised version of Holahan, Saunders and Goldberg’s (2000) assessment. I evaluated relationships by correlating scores on each measure and also compared these relationships among classical and non-classical music students. The {{participants in this study were}} the most skilled at forming auditory representations of tonic centrality and non-classical musicians significantly (p =. 002) outperformed classical musicians in this area. Tonic centrality was also most strongly correlated with overall musicianship (τ =. 45, p <. 001) within the sample, and this relationship appeared to be stronger among non-classical musicians (τ =. 52, p <. 001) than among classical musicians (τ =. 39, p <. 001). This difference may be accounted for by the increased reliance on grounding in a tonal center required by the musical activities of a typical non-classical music student. Given the changing balance of musical endeavors present in tertiary music schools today (Lehmann, Sloboda, & Woody, 2007), educators are encouraged to better understand the particular strengths non-classical musicians may bring to the classroom in terms of ear-based musical abilities. Likewise, music educators on each level are encouraged to incorporate ear-based activities such as improvisation and <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> the benefit of musicians of all genres...|$|R
5000|$|Both Robert and {{his younger}} sister Janet had piano lessons; Smith said that Janet [...] "was a piano prodigy, so sibling rivalry made me take up guitar because she couldn't get her fingers around the neck." [...] He told Chris Heath of Smash Hits {{magazine}} that from about 1966 (when Smith turned seven years old) his brother Richard (thirteen years Robert's senior) taught him [...] "a few basic chords" [...] on guitar. Smith began taking classical guitar lessons {{from the age of}} nine, [...] "with a student of John Williams, a really excellent guitarist ... I learned a lot, but {{got to the point where}} I was losing the sense of fun. I wish I'd stuck with it." [...] Smith has said his guitar tutor was [...] "horrified" [...] <b>by</b> his <b>playing.</b> Robert consequently gave up formal tuition and began teaching himself <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear,</b> listening <b>to</b> his older brother's record collection.|$|R
25|$|The Landt Trio {{was one of}} {{the busiest}} singing groups in early radio. In 1928, the three brothers, Karl (1908-1997), Jack (1911-1959), and Dan (1996-1961) Landt, with their accompanist Howard White, were signed onto the NBC Blue Network as {{sustaining}} artists and began a career of more than 20 years. They performed primarily on radio but also performed in vaudeville, including some headline runs at the Palace and Carnegie Hall, and made many personal appearances. They were unusual in the music world in that they did not read music, so they sang and <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear.</b> They continued <b>to</b> perform on radio and in advertising until the early 1950s, when the rising popularity of television ended their performance career.|$|R
50|$|Cobi became {{interested}} in music at about age eight, when a family friend visited their home with an electric guitar and began teaching Cobi and his brother a few chords. Once {{he was able to}} play them, his interest in music grew. That summer, he bought his first guitar, a Squier Stratocaster, by saving up money made from mowing lawns for $3 an hour. From then on, he taught himself <b>to</b> <b>play</b> guitar <b>by</b> <b>ear,</b> listening <b>to</b> songs over and over until he mastered them. Shortly after, Cobi and a long time friend formed a blues band, playing covers of songs at local bars in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Cobi is an alumnus of Berklee School of Music in Boston.|$|R
40|$|Interview with Bishop O. Kenneth Wells, choir director, radio announcer, preacher, {{and music}} {{industry}} executive. Bishop O. (Olson) Kenneth Wells (1963 -) {{was born in}} Sparr, Florida and migrated to Fontana, California in 1969. He is the pastor of Spirit of Love Christian Church in San Bernardino, California and a Jurisdictional Bishop (California) for the Mt. Calvary Holy Churches of America.

Bishop Wells has served as a gospel radio announcer on KPRO Radio (AM 1570 -Riverside/San Bernardino) since the mid- 1980 ’s. A former record executive at Pearl Records (Houston, Texas), Wells is also credited with aiding the early career of national gospel artist Kim Burrell.; The interview covers his early religious upbringing within the African Methodist Episcopal (A. M. E.) Church, his religious conversion in a “country” revival in Citra, Florida (1979), and his eventual movement to the Pentecostal church. Gaining his first exposure to professional gospel singing {{as a member of the}} Southern California A. M. E. Mass Choir, he began directing choirs at Loveland Church in Fontana, California. Eventually becoming the business manager and assistant director of the San Bernardino Community Choir, founded by Dennis Jackson and directed by William Brown, Wells is best know for his work as the founder of the Riverside Mass Choir. Heavily influenced by the Los Angeles Gospel Music scene, he credits membership in the GMWA, Keith Pringle’s Pentecostal Community Choir, and the music of Andrae Crouch, Edwin and Walter Hawkins, James Cleveland, the Winans, and the Clark Sisters as his major influences.; Topics covered in the interview include the power of song as a tool of conversion and deliverance, tarrying, gospel preachers, the influence of the Hammond B- 3 organ and Leslie speaker, the role of community choirs, the Bible’s King David as a musician, <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear,</b> ministry <b>to</b> youth, hip hop culture, musician salaries, marketing gospel, the music industry, and the role that online music downloads play on record sales and profits. Specific songs mentioned in the interview include; “Try Me Again”, “Precious Lord”, “Oh Happy Day”, “Stomp”, “Great Is Thy Faithfulness”, “Yes, Lord!”, “I Surrender All”, and “Hallelujah Jesus”.

50|$|Contemporary music pedagogies {{emphasize}} sound before sight, or {{the idea}} {{that in order to}} develop an understanding of music and music notation, individuals must first become comfortable with listening to, singing, and performing tonal and rhythm patterns before reading and writing music. Modern studies by Luce (1965), McPherson (1993, 1995, 2005), and Bernhard (2004) all suggest a significant positive correlation with <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> and the ability to sight read, and experimental research by Haston (2004) and Musco (2006) also suggest that spending classroom time <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> does not negatively impact students' abilities to develop music reading skills.|$|R

40|$|A {{conditional}} discrimination {{training procedure}} {{was used to}} establish stimulus-stimulus relations {{that might lead to}} the emergence of relations that define <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear.</b> The participants were four college students. Overall, the results varied across participants. Of the 3 participants who received Training 1 (hear-note-name/select-key), all 3 participants acquired that relation. Out of those 3 participants, 2 participants showed emergence of the hear-see-key-pressed/say-note-name relation after Training 1. Of the 3 participants who received Training 2, (hear-note-name/select-tone), 2 participants acquired that relation for at least one set. Out of those 3 participants, 1 participant showed emergence of the hear-tone/say-note-name relation. One out of three participants was successful in correctly playing a sequence of four notes <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> {{at the end of the}} study. One participant did not complete the study due to availability conflicts. The overall results can suggest that the relations used in this study should be taken into account when training someone <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear.</b> However, the current data do not allow us to conclude whether it is necessary to teach or test all of these relations in order <b>to</b> teach <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear...</b>|$|R
40|$|Exploring how western {{classical}} musicians {{could develop}} their aural, improvisatory and creative musicianship skills through <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> {{is an area}} that has recently received noteworthy attention within Higher Education. This article describes a five-week Group Ear Playing (GEP) programme with first year, western classical undergraduate students.

5000|$|<b>Playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> is {{the ability}} of an {{instrumental}} musician to reproduce a piece of music they have heard, without having observed another musician play it or having seen the sheet music notation. It is the most common way to learn to play a musical instrument in cultures and musical that do not use musical notation, such as by early Blues guitarists and pianists, Romani fiddlers and folk music guitarists. Outside of the Suzuki method, <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> is less common in Western Classical music. In this musical tradition, instrumentalists learn new pieces by reading the music notation. Classical students do study how <b>to</b> notate music <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> during [...] "ear training" [...] courses that are a standard part of conservatory or college music programs and by the use of Solfège.|$|R
