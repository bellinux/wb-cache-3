50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the polygroove belt that makes them popular {{is that they can}} run over pulleys on the ungrooved back of the belt. Though this is sometimes done with V-belts with a single idler <b>pulley</b> for <b>tensioning,</b> a polygroove belt may be wrapped around a pulley on its back tightly enough to change its direction, or even to provide a light driving force.|$|R

Both systems often require redundant backup {{to deal with}} failures, which increases weight. Both have limited ability to compensate for changing aerodynamic conditions. Dangerous characteristics such as stalling, spinning and pilot-induced oscillation (PIO), which depend mainly on the stability {{and structure of the}} aircraft concerned rather than the control system itself, can still occur with these systems.|$|R

40|$|Classical {{mechanics}} is {{the study}} of the motion of “material bodies”[3]. First-semester college physics (force, work, energy, momentum, torque, <b>tension,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> masses on springs, etc.) lays the groundwork for this, but the field is far richer, and physics majors take at least one more full semester of classes on this topic.

50|$|Directly below each {{carrier and}} above the chain is an eyelet through which the curtain {{operating}} line passes, if present. The operating line runs through two pulleys that are located near {{the tops of the}} curtains, one {{on each side of the}} stage (the dead end and live end pulleys), and then down to the stage floor, where it runs through a <b>tension</b> <b>pulley</b> before returning to the other pulleys in the fly space.|$|R
50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads. Belt tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and <b>pulley</b> diameters. Belt <b>tension</b> is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.|$|R
5000|$|Lucien Juy owned {{a bicycle}} shop in Dijon, Côte d'Or, France. [...] It {{was there that}} he made the first Simplex {{derailleur}} in 1928. The bicycle historian Hilary Stone said: [...] "It used a single <b>pulley</b> to <b>tension</b> the chain {{and a pair of}} guide plates to push the chain to each one of two sprockets. The whole arm was spring-loaded in order to tension the chain - this was the first use of the sprung top pivot which was to become {{an essential part of the}} modern indexed derailleur as we know it today. The pulley and guide plates were moved sideways on a push-rod by means of a chain pulling through the centre of the push-rod. Lucien Juy managed to persuade the management of the Alcyon racing team to fit his Le Simplex gear to their machines for the 1928 Paris-Roubaix - unfortunately the riders revolted and refused to use the new unproven gears." ...|$|R
40|$|Pouch {{conveyor}} systems typically employ point-contact drives {{in order to}} generate traction. Differing from troughed conveyors which wrap the belt around a large drive <b>pulley</b> under high <b>tension,</b> point contact drives transmit force through load or indentation based contacts. This research focusses on quantifying the attainable drive traction for various surface configurations, including flat, concave and convex belts indented by cylindrical or spherical drive wheels. A viscoelastic contact under shear induces regions of stick and slip. Using this, the traction generated from each zone is superimposed to estimate the traction within the whole contact. These values are subsequently compared with experimental data indenting a cylindrical idler into a flat belt surface...|$|R
5000|$|Timing belts (also {{known as}} toothed, notch, cog, or {{synchronous}} belts) are a positive transfer belt and can track relative movement. These belts have teeth that {{fit into a}} matching toothed <b>pulley.</b> When correctly <b>tensioned,</b> they have no slippage, run at constant speed, and are often used to transfer direct motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used instead of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary. Camshafts of automobiles, miniature timing systems, and stepper motors often utilize these belts. Timing belts need the least tension of all belts and {{are among the most}} efficient. They can bear up to [...] at speeds of [...]|$|R
5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable <b>pulleys,</b> the <b>tension</b> force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|R
5000|$|Tension in {{a string}} is a non-negative scalar quantity. Zero tension is slack. A string or rope is often {{idealized}} as one dimension, having length but being massless with zero cross section. If there are no bends in the string, as occur with vibrations or <b>pulleys,</b> then <b>tension</b> is a constant along the string, equal to {{the magnitude of the}} forces applied by the ends of the string. By Newton's Third Law, these are the same forces exerted on the ends of the string by the objects to which the ends are attached. If the string curves around one or more pulleys, it will still have constant tension along its length in the idealized situation that the pulleys are massless and frictionless. A vibrating string vibrates with a set of frequencies that depend on the string's tension. These frequencies can be derived from Newton's laws of motion. Each microscopic segment of the string pulls on and is pulled upon by its neighboring segments, with a force equal to the tension at that position along the string. tension [...] where [...] is the position along the string.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the rotation vibration {{dynamics of the}} <b>pulleys</b> and the <b>tension</b> arms, and to estimate the vibrations of the belts and the slip ratio between the belt and the pulleys in the engine front-end accessory drive systems, a systematic modelling and analytical method is proposed for engine front-end accessory drive systems; this {{can be used for}} modelling engine front-end accessory drive systems with different layouts and different numbers of tensioners, including automatic and fixed tensioners. In the modelling, the rotational pulleys are classified as fixed-axis pulleys and moveable-axis pulleys (such as the pulley in the tensioner). Moreover, the belt spans are classified as the belt spans between the two fixed pulleys, and the belt spans adjacent to the pulley of a tensioner. The equations of motion for each type of <b>pulley</b> and the <b>tension</b> calculation equations for each type of belt span are developed. In this way, the equations of motion for all the pulleys and the tensioner arms can be obtained easily, irrespective of the layout of the tensioners. To obtain the dynamic rotational vibration responses of an engine front-end accessory drive system by the conventional Runge-Kutta method, high-efficiency algorithms or methods are also proposed for calculating the tangent-point coordinates between a belt and the adjacent pulleys and the belt length of the contact arc on one pulley. The proposed modelling and analysis methods are validated by modelling different layouts of the engine front-end accessory drive systems with different types and numbers of tensioners, and also by comparisons between the calculated dynamic vibration responses of the pulleys and the belts and the real experimental data.

40|$|In {{belt drive}} applications, the tension {{fluctuation}} caused by transverse vibration has important consequences on belt and bearing lifetime. Additionally, <b>pulley</b> oscillations induce <b>tension</b> fluctuations {{that are a}} source of parametric instabilities that create transverse vibration. This paper focuses on an experimental investigation of an industrial axially moving belt subjected to multi-frequency parametric excitation. The experimental results validate a corresponding theoretical analysis previously developed. First, a stationary parametrically excited beam is considered. A simply supported, Euler-Bernoulli beam is subjected to mono-frequency sinusoidal tension fluctuation via a shaker and torque arm assembly on one pulley of a two pulley drive. The transverse vibration from parametric instability is measured for varying amplitude and frequency of tension fluctuation and compared with theoretical predictions. In industrial applications, excitation sources are not at a single frequency as in the previous case, especially in an automotive engine. Engine firing and driven accessories cause multi-frequency speed and tension fluctuation. A specific test bench was built to reproduce this kind of excitation. The set-up is composed of four pulleys linked together by an automotive multi-ribbed belt. The driving shaft is driven by an electric motor, and the driven shaft is linked to a hydraulic pump. The internal design of the pump creates torque fluctuation when it rotates, which induces tension fluctuation in the belt drive. Angular positions are measured by optical encoders mounted on the <b>pulleys,</b> belt <b>tension</b> by a piezo-electric sensor on a pulley support, and lateral vibration by a laser displacement sensor. Data acquisition is based on the principle of angular sampling and is applied {{here for the first time}} on non-discrete geometry. This technique is particularly useful for rotating system with variable speed, as the samples always have the same size and the angular resolution remains the same. A speed sweep is performed on this test bench. Results demonstrate that when a second source of excitation exists at a lower frequency than the major one causing the instability, the entire instability region shifts to lower frequency,instead of occurring at twice a natural frequency. While this phenomenon is not classical, the experimental observations confirm the theoretical results. This experiment also demonstrates unexpected sources of excitation from changing belt characteristics (longitudinal stiffness and friction coefficient) along the belt length. These variation can also excite parametric instability...|$|R
50|$|Although {{variations}} exist, {{as noted}} below, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two pulleys that guide the chain in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys {{are known as}} the jockey pulley or guide pulley (top) and the <b>tension</b> <b>pulley</b> (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up chain slack. The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The {{other end of the}} arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.|$|R
50|$|Most systems {{include a}} brake {{to stop the}} wires from {{unravelling}} completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a single large <b>tensioning</b> <b>pulley</b> (basically a ratchet mechanism) with a toothed rim, mounted on an arm hinged to the mast. Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of {{a stop on the}} mast. The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop. This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired. Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple smaller pulleys in a block and tackle arrangement.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAt {{the present}} time in many {{material}} handling industries, need and capacity of conveying equipments are increasing rapidly. Conveyor pulleys have been recognized as a most necessary component of the conveyor system. As {{a result of these}} demand of conveyor pulley increasing day by day. Various types of pulleys are used for conveying systems. Here a focus is on the high <b>tension</b> <b>pulleys</b> where the use of custom made engineered welded steel pulley is dictated due to its higher capacity and ease of manufacturing. Requirement of various sizes conveyor pulleys are there as a result of various size of conveying systems are to be designed. It is now compulsory for the conveyor pulley manufacturer to increase the production rate. To be specific industries want a special purpose machine which in turn useful according to various diameter and various length of pulleys. Even they have to supply it on time with less cost to fulfill the customer needs.

50|$|In addition, as the {{transmission}} diameter is increased, the chain {{has to be}} pushed up the inclined surfaces of the pulley halves of the variator <b>pulley,</b> while the <b>tension</b> in the chain tends to pull the chain towards the opposite direction. Hence a large force, which {{is larger than the}} tension in the chain, is required to change {{the transmission}} diameter. Since the transmission ratio has to be changed within less than one full rotation of the variator pulley, a large force has to be applied on the pulley halves within a very short duration. If for example the variator pulley rotates at 3600 rpm, which is equivalent to 60 revolutions per second, then the force required to change the transmission ratio has to be applied within 1/60 seconds. This would be similar to hitting something with a hammer. Therefore, here significant shock loads are applied to the variator pulley during transmission ratio change that increases the transmission diameter. These shock loads may cause comfort problems for the driver of the vehicle using an iCVT. Also an iCVT has to be designed as to be able to resist these shock loads which would most likely increases the cost and weight of an iCVT.|$|R
40|$|Summary:. Scalp defects {{greater than}} 2 [*]cm in {{diameter}} {{are not usually}} amenable to primary closure and require local tissue rearrangement, grafting, tissue expansion, or prolonged second intention healing. Scalp flap reconstruction is a significant undertaking that requires elevation of a total flap surface area that is 3 – 6 {{times the size of}} the defect, often involves profuse bleeding, and can be challenging to perform without conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Anticoagulated and medically complex patients pose additional challenges and limit options for treatment. The pulley suture uses the mechanical advantage of the <b>pulley</b> to distribute <b>tension</b> across a wound and is useful in areas of high tension such as scalp wounds. For scalp wounds greater than 2 [*]cm, pulley sutures are placed along the length of the wound. An assistant exerts equal <b>tension</b> on the <b>pulley</b> sutures, and the surgeon sequentially ties the sutures. The sutures are tightened and retied weekly until complete scalp closure is achieved. The pulley sutures can be used for rapid primary closure of scalp wounds up to 2. 5 – 3. 0 [*]cm in diameter under local anesthesia. For scalp wounds larger than 3 [*]cm, we have also found that pulley sutures can be progressively tightened yielding additional tissue expansion every week. Scalp wounds greater than 3. 0 [*]cm can be easily closed via primary repair and weekly tightening of pulley sutures without the need for flap reconstruction, traditional tissue expander placement, or second intention healing...|$|R
40|$|Belt-drives {{are used}} in many {{applications}} such as industrial machines, washing machines, and accessory drives for automobiles and other vehicles. Multibody dynamics/finite element numerical models have become {{an effective way to}} predict the dynamic response of belt-drives. In this thesis, a high fidelity numerical model was built using a multibody dynamics/finite element code to simulate a belt-drive. The belt-drive transmits power from a turbine of a Rankin cycle (that uses the exhaust waste heat of the internal combustion engine as heat source) to the crank shaft of the engine. The code uses a time-accurate explicit numerical integration technique to solve the multibody dynamics differential equations. The belt was modeled using three-node beam elements to account for the belt axial and bending stiffness/damping, while the pulleys, shafts and tensioner body were modeled as rigid bodies. The penalty technique was used to model normal contact between the belt and the pulleys. An asperity-based friction model was used to approximate Coulomb friction between the belt and the pulleys. The dynamic response predicted using the model was validated by comparing it to experimental results supplied by Cummins Inc. A parameter sensitivity study was performed to evaluate the change in response due to change in various belt-drive parameters. A fatigue model was developed to predict the belt fatigue life using output from the explicit finite element code including normal and tangential forces between the belt and the <b>pulleys</b> and belt <b>tension.</b> The belt fatigue life was evaluated for alternative belt-drive configurations in order to find the configuration with the longest life. ...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the forces at the <b>pulleys</b> and the <b>tension</b> in the ropes during maximal loading for a dynamic gymnastics skill. Additionally the relationships between the drop height and the peak force and between the gymnast mass and the peak force, together with the effect of the coach's actions, were investigated. A gymnastics support system was instrumented with strain-gauge-based load cells. A coach attempted to arrest the fall of a gymnast equivalent mass (range, 10 — 35 kg) over a range of drop heights (0. 25 — 1. 5 m). To establish the coach's contribution, trials were repeated with the coach replaced by an equivalent mass and with the rope tied off to the floor. Peak forces of 1. 3 kN were recorded for a simulated maximum loading gymnastics scenario (drop height, 1. 25 m; gymnast mass, 35 kg).
