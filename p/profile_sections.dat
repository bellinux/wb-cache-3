40|$|The stator and {{rotor blade}} hub {{sections}} {{designed for a}} high pressure turbine stage were studied in detail for their aerodynamic and heat transfer characteristics. The <b>profile</b> <b>sections</b> were tested in the National Aeronautical Laboratory(NAL) cascade tunnels over a range of exit flow Mach numbers. The flow field and heat transfer characteristics of the cascades were analysed,employing the Euler code,the method of singularities and the K- turbulence model. The results {{indicated that there was}} scope for improving the blade <b>profile</b> <b>sections</b> for the proposed high Mach number application. In particular,it has been observed that the energy loss coefficients of the stator blade are rather high around the design point. The air swallowing capacity of the rotor blade design appears to be inadequate compared to the design expectations. The predictions of the surface pressure distributions obtained from the Euler code are generally in good agreement with the measured values in the Transonic Cascade Tunnel. The measured distribution of heat transfer coefficients around the blade surfaces give a useful data base for the design of the cooled blades. Prediction of the heat transfer for these transonic blades using the K- model of turbulence appears to be in general,not adequate. Recourse to correlation of the measured data using power-law relations appears to be promising,at least as a short time measure...|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{representation}} of accumulation measurements {{is a major}} limitation for current glacier mass balance monitoring approaches. Here, we present a method for estimating annual accumulation rates on a temperate Alpine glacier based on the interpretation of internal reflection horizons (IRHs) in helicopter-borne ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. For each individual GPR measurement, the signal travel time is combined with a simple model for firn densification and refreezing of meltwater. The model is calibrated at locations where GPR repeat measurements are available in two subsequent years and the densification can be tracked over time. Two 10. 5 m long firn cores provide a reference for the density and chronology of firn layers. Thereby, IRHs correspond to density maxima, but not exclusively to former summer glacier surfaces. Along GPR <b>profile</b> <b>sections</b> from across the accumulation area we obtain the water equivalent (w. e.) of several annual firn layers. Because deeper IRHs could be tracked over shorter distances, the total length of analysed <b>profile</b> <b>sections</b> varies from 7. 3 km for the uppermost accumulation layer (2011) to 0. 1 km for the deepest (i. e. oldest) layer (2006). According to model results, refreezing accounts for 10 % of the density increase over time and depth, and for 2 % of the water equivalent. The strongest limitation to our method is the dependence on layer chronology assumptions. We show that GPR can be used not only to complement existing mass balance monitoring programmes on temperate glaciers but also to retrospectively extend newly initiated time series...|$|E
