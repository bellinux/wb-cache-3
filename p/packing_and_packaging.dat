40|$|Postconsumer {{plastics}} from <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaging</b> represent {{about the}} 60 % {{of the total}} plastic wastes (i. e. 23 million of tons) produced in Europe. The EU Directive (2014 / 12 /EC) fixes as target that the 60 %, by weight, of packaging waste has to be recovered, or thermally valorized. When recovered, the same directive established that packaging waste has to be recycled in a percentage ranging between 55 % (minimum) and 60 % (maximum). The non-respect of these rules can produce that large quantities of end-of-life plastic products, specifically those utilized for packaging, are disposed-off, with a strong environmental impact. The application of recycling strategies, finalized to polymer recovery, can represent an opportunity to reduce: i) not renewable raw materials (i. e. oil) utilization, ii) carbon dioxide emissions and iii) amount of plastic waste disposed-off. Aim of this work was to perform a full characterization of different end-of-life polymers based products, constituted not only by single polymers but also of mixtures, in order to realize their identification for quality control and/or certification assessment. The study was specifically addressed to characterize the different recovered products as resulting from a recycling plant where classical processing flow-sheets, based on milling, classification and separation, are applied. To reach this goal, an innovative sensing technique, based on the utilization of a HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) device working in the SWIR region (1000 - 2500 nm), was investigated. Following this strategy, single polymers and/or mixed polymers recovered were correctly recognized. The main advantage of the proposed approach {{is linked to the}} possibility to perform "on-line" analyses, that is directly on the different material flow streams, as resulting from processing, without any physical sampling and classical laboratory "off-line" determination...|$|E
40|$|This volume, {{the second}} {{in a series of}} three devoted to the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in World War II, now the Chemical Corps, covers research, development, procurement, and {{distribution}} of chemical warfare materiel. It traces the history of these activities from the World War I period, when the CWS was activated to supervise the offensive and defensive aspects of gas warfare throughout the Army, until the end of World War II. The first volume in the series, "Organizing for War", discusses the development of the CWS organization and mission as well as personnel management and military training. The third volume, entitled "Chemicals in Combat", will deal with the chemical warfare activities in the theaters of operations. In treating research and development, the present volume concentrates on CWS projects that proved of greatest significance to the armed forces during World War II. It attempts to point up the problems that arose in course of research and development and to indicate the solutions which the scientists hit upon. Since research and development in the zone of the interior was closely related to research and development in the theaters of operations, the volume covers activities in both areas. In contrast to research and development, procurement and distribution differed considerably as between the zone of the interior and the theaters of operations; in the theaters these activities were closely associated with the commanders' combat responsibilities.

40|$|As society ages {{there is}} a growing need to {{understand}} issues surrounding declining user capabilities. One such area has been accessibility of packaging by older people. To date much of the current research in this area has focused on measuring strength of older people and analysing the force needed to open various <b>pack</b> formats <b>and</b> has largely concentrated on accessibility of jam or sauce jars. However, a survey by 'Yours' magazine indicated that problems with thin film <b>pack</b> forms <b>and</b> peelable <b>packaging</b> was also an issue for older people. Hence the authors undertook a small-scale study to understand the issues surrounding accessing a rigid plastic container with a peelable lid. To that end the authors built a bespoke measuring device to measure container peeling forces, measured finger friction between <b>pack</b> <b>and</b> finger and undertook an observational analysis on 60 users accessing packaging of this type. Results indicated that the force needed to open containers of this type is lower than measured user forces including older people and it is therefore likely that the issues surrounding accessibility of this type of pack format are related to dexterity not strength. However, the authors also showed that this can be affected by context of use in that oily fingers could reduce the friction coefficient between finger <b>and</b> <b>pack</b> such that older people may not have sufficient strength to open packs of this type...|$|R

Furthermore, sensory analyses of fillets was classified and customer preferences were evaluated by using an anonymous questionnaire. In microbiological analyses, an increase {{of the total number}} of microorganisms with increasing storage time was observed. Microbial communities grew to between 2. 3 - 2. 69 log CFU. g- 1 on the first day of fish processing (day 0) and 6. 35 - 8. 28 log CFU. g- 1 on the last day of storage (day 9). Microbiological analysis showed that skinless fillets reached the lowest total number of microorganisms, regardless the type of packaging (air / vacuum packaged). Also sensory analyses showed that consistency and odour of carp fillets were influenced by packaging conditions as well as descaling methods. The best results in sensory evaluation achieved fillets without skin and undercut scales.

40|$|This project {{centered}} on inventory optimization for operative custom surgical <b>packs</b> <b>and</b> soft good supplies for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a 947 -bed medical center. Custom surgical packs {{are used in}} every surgical case and delivered to the hospital by a vendor who manufactures them off site. These large packs contain unwrapped surgical items (drapes, gown, sutures, etc.) delivered to each operating room {{prior to the start}} of surgery. Once a surgical pack is opened, the items inside are consumed or wasted. MGH uses the custom packs to reduce the amount of time warehouse associates spend picking individual items and to reduce preparation time in the operating rooms prior to the patient arriving. To augment the custom <b>packs,</b> individually <b>packaged</b> <b>and</b> sterilized items (called soft goods) are requested by the surgeon for each case. Specific case information, surgeon's preferences for materials, and patient needs dictate these soft good supply requirements. Soft goods are ordered from separate vendors and together with the custom packs comprise a surgeon's preference card. The hospital orders custom <b>packs</b> <b>and</b> soft goods with the intent to keep three days of supply on hand or to fill shelf space, whichever is greater. This situation triggers bloated and redundant inventory stores throughout MGH. Despite the sub-optimality of this policy, no analysis had informed hospital leadership of the correct levels of inventory or the best ways to cover preference cards. To solve these challenges, we formalized an optimization model that minimized the purchasing and holding costs of custom <b>packs</b> <b>and</b> soft goods while satisfying the supply requirements of all preference cards. As an input, the model used all current <b>pack</b> configurations <b>and</b> new <b>pack</b> configurations born from the overlaps of current surgical packs. Base stock reductions are achievable through covering "sibling" procedures with the new combined <b>pack</b> configurations <b>and</b> picking displaced items as soft goods. The model results revealed a modular pack structure as the most cost effective method to cover all preference cards. The new modular pack structure prescribed replacing 14 of the 65 current packs with 16 smaller packs to reduce overall value of inventory on hand. Currently, we estimate that this work will save the hospital in excess of $ 1. 3 M annually by reducing inventory on the shelf and lowering associated holding costs through risk pooling. by Matthew R.
