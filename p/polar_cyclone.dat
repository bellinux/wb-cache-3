40|$|Geiger, Cathleen A. This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between <b>polar</b> <b>cyclones</b> and sea ice cover. Through this research, an archive of <b>polar</b> <b>cyclones</b> is created. The archive contains storms for the time period 01 January 1979 through 31 August 2014 for the Weddell Sea, a region east of the Antarctic Peninsula extending to where the Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean meet. The four defined properties of <b>polar</b> <b>cyclones</b> used in this work are: high wind speeds, low pressures, short duration, and small spatial scales. The storm strength is expressed specifically through the maximum wind speed and minimum sea level pressure. The archive additionally includes characteristics of individual storms including the storm date, duration, strength, and size which are analyzed and compared to changes in sea ice cover during each storm. Subsequently, this research quantifies linkages between <b>polar</b> <b>cyclones</b> and sea ice by computing each storm's integrated kinetic energy {{as a measure of}} the size, duration, and wind speeds. Specific linkages include the surface energy balance, sea ice growth rate, and the quantity of brine rejected {{to the top of the}} water column. The results show that the area of open water is the biggest contributor to sea ice growth and brine production through new ice formation. The ejected brine from the ice increases the density of sea water in the nearby upper ocean layers which contribute to the destabilization of the water column. Subsequently, the destabilization of the water column helps to form Weddell Sea Bottom Water - the coldest and densest water mass on the planet and major contributor to the global ocean circulation. Hence, the storm climatology developed herein provides a new quantitative resource for establishing significant links between polar storms and Weddell Sea deep water formation.

40|$|Intense, cyclone-like shaped {{plumes of}} tropospheric bromine {{monoxide}} (BrO) are regularly observed by GOME- 2 {{on board the}} MetOp-A satellite over Arctic sea ice in polar spring. These plumes are often transported by high-latitude cyclones, sometimes over several days despite the short atmospheric lifetime of BrO. However, only few {{studies have focused on}} the role of polar weather systems in the development, duration and transport of tropospheric BrO plumes during bromine explosion events. The latter are caused by an autocatalytic chemical chain reaction associated with tropospheric ozone depletion and initiated by the release of bromine from cold brine-covered ice or snow to the atmosphere. In this manuscript, a case study investigating a comma-shaped BrO plume which developed over the Beaufort Sea and was observed by GOME- 2 for several days is presented. By making combined use of satellite data and numerical models, it is shown that the occurrence of the plume was closely linked to frontal lifting in a <b>polar</b> <b>cyclone</b> and that it most likely resided in the lowest 3 â€¯km of the troposphere. In contrast to previous case studies, we demonstrate that the dry conveyor belt, a potentially bromine-rich stratospheric air stream which can complicate interpretation of satellite retrieved tropospheric BrO, is spatially separated from the observed BrO plume.

A knowledge-driven system is eventually constructed for visualizing and analyzing an atmospheric phenomenon (cyclone) in the North Pole. The cyclone is simulated with WebGL on in a web environment using particle tracing.

30|$|The {{increase}} in maize skewness likely {{comes from the}} co-location of maize-growing areas with frost-free climates and seasons containing moderate amounts of rainfall. Due to temperature constraints maize is typically not grown at high-latitudes and {{is not in the}} ground during the wintertime storms that deliver a large portion of seasonal rainfall to the dry, primarily mid-latitude regions. Maize is therefore concentrated where soil moisture is variable and prevailing weather patterns associate rainfall with cool and wet air masses (typical of a mid-latitude summer) rather than warm and wet air masses (as are often found in wintertime or <b>polar</b> <b>cyclones).</b> Increased temperatures and energy are projected to raise global evapotranspiration demand, however some maize-growing regions {{will not be able to}} keep up with the elevated demand posed by the warmest GCMs and will therefore shift toward drier conditions. This in turn raises B, increasing sensible heat (and local temperatures) and leading to hot/dry vs. cool/wet skew such as that we saw over the Amazon for annual changes. The maize season maps do not include the winter season and high-latitude areas constrained by surface moisture and energy, leading to more instances where the warmest models increase evapotranspiration and drive wetter conditions (hot/wet vs. cool/dry skew). FigureÂ  5 c illustrates hot/wet vs. cool/dry skewness using an annual grid box in Massachusetts that is dominated by wintertime precipitation, while Fig.Â  5 d uses the Ames maize-growing season from the gridded analysis to demonstrate hot/dry vs. cool/wet skewness.|$|R

We construct a near-continuous record of atmospheric variability poleward of 60 Â° from northern winter/southern summer (2004, Ls= 293 Â°) through the equinox (2009, Ls= 0 Â°) to northern spring/southern autumn (2014, Ls= 56 Â°). The hot tropospheric <b>polar</b> <b>cyclones</b> that are entrained by prograde jets within 2 - 3 Â° of each pole, and the hexagonal shape of the north polar belt, are both persistent features throughout the decade of observations. The hexagon vertices rotated westward by â‰ˆ 30 Â° longitude between March 2007 and April 2013, confirming {{that they are not}} stationary in the Voyager-defined System III longitude system as previously thought. Tropospheric temperature contrasts between the cool polar zones (near 80 - 85 Â°) and warm polar belts (near 75 - 80 Â°) have varied in both hemispheres, resulting in changes to the vertical windshear on the zonal jets in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The extended region of south polar stratospheric emission has cooled dramatically poleward of the sharp temperature gradient near 75 Â°S (by approximately - 5 K/yr), coinciding with a depletion in the abundances of acetylene (0. 030 Â± 0. 005 ppm/yr) and ethane (0. 35 Â± 0. 1 ppm/yr), and suggestive of stratospheric upwelling with vertical wind speeds of wâ‰ˆ+ 0. 1 mm/s. The upwelling appears most intense within 5 Â° latitude of the south pole. This is mirrored by a general warming of the northern polar stratosphere (+ 5 K/yr) and an enhancement in acetylene (0. 030 Â± 0. 003 ppm/yr) and ethane (0. 45 Â± 0. 1 ppm/yr) abundances that appears to be most intense poleward of 75 Â°N, suggesting subsidence atwâ‰ˆ- 0. 15 mm/s. However, the sharp gradient in stratospheric emission expected to form near 75 Â°N by northern summer solstice (2017, Ls= 90 Â°) has not yet been observed, so we continue to await the development of a northern summer stratospheric vortex. The peak stratospheric warming in the north occurs at lower pressure levels (p 1 mbar). Vertical motions are derived from both the temperature field (using the measured rates of temperature change and the deviations from the expectations of radiative equilibrium models) and hydrocarbon distributions (solving the continuity equation). Vertical velocities tend towards zero in the upper troposphere where seasonal temperature contrasts are smaller, except within the tropospheric <b>polar</b> <b>cyclones</b> where wâ‰ˆÂ± 0. 02 mm/s. North polar minima in tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures were detected in 2008 - 2010 (lagging one season, or 6 - 8 years, behind winter solstice); south polar maxima appear to have occurred {{before the start of the}} Cassini observations (1 - 2 years after summer solstice), consistent with the expectations of radiative climate models. The influence of dynamics implies that the coldest winter temperatures occur in the 75 - 80 Â° region in the stratosphere, and in the cool polar zones in the troposphere, rather than at the poles themselves. In addition to vertical motions, we propose that the UV-absorbent polar stratospheric aerosols entrained within Saturn's vortices contribute significantly to the radiative budget at the poles, adding to the localised enhancement in the south polar cooling and north polar warming poleward of Â± 75 Â°...|$|R

Tropospheric temperature contrasts between the cool polar zones (near 80 â€“ 85 Â°) and warm polar belts (near 75 â€“ 80 Â°) have varied in both hemispheres, resulting in changes to the vertical windshear on the zonal jets in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The extended region of south polar stratospheric emission has cooled dramatically poleward of the sharp temperature gradient near 75 Â°S (by approximately âˆ’ 5 K/yr), coinciding with a depletion in the abundances of acetylene (0. 030 Â± 0. 0050. 030 Â± 0. 005 ppm/yr) and ethane (0. 35 Â± 0. 10. 35 Â± 0. 1 ppm/yr), and suggestive of stratospheric upwelling with vertical wind speeds of wâ‰ˆ+ 0. 1 wâ‰ˆ+ 0. 1 mm/s. The upwelling appears most intense within 5 Â° latitude of the south pole. This is mirrored by a general warming of the northern polar stratosphere (+ 5 K/yr) and an enhancement in acetylene (0. 030 Â± 0. 0030. 030 Â± 0. 003 ppm/yr) and ethane (0. 45 Â± 0. 10. 45 Â± 0. 1 ppm/yr) abundances that appears to be most intense poleward of 75 Â°N, suggesting subsidence at wâ‰ˆ- 0. 15 wâ‰ˆ- 0. 15 mm/s. However, the sharp gradient in stratospheric emission expected to form near 75 Â°N by northern summer solstice (2017, Ls= 90 Â°Ls= 90 Â°) has not yet been observed, so we continue to await the development of a northern summer stratospheric vortex. The peak stratospheric warming in the north occurs at lower pressure levels (p 1 p> 1 mbar). Vertical motions are derived from both the temperature field (using the measured rates of temperature change and the deviations from the expectations of radiative equilibrium models) and hydrocarbon distributions (solving the continuity equation). Vertical velocities tend towards zero in the upper troposphere where seasonal temperature contrasts are smaller, except within the tropospheric <b>polar</b> <b>cyclones</b> where wâ‰ˆÂ± 0. 02 wâ‰ˆÂ± 0. 02 mm/s. North polar minima in tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures were detected in 2008 â€“ 2010 (lagging one season, or 6 â€“ 8 years, behind winter solstice); south polar maxima appear to have occurred {{before the start of the}} Cassini observations (1 â€“ 2 years after summer solstice), consistent with the expectations of radiative climate models. The influence of dynamics implies that the coldest winter temperatures occur in the 75 â€“ 80 Â° region in the stratosphere, and in the cool polar zones in the troposphere, rather than at the poles themselves. In addition to vertical motions, we propose that the UV-absorbent polar stratospheric aerosols entrained within Saturnâ€™s vortices contribute significantly to the radiative budget at the poles, adding to the localised enhancement in the south polar cooling and north polar warming poleward of Â± 75 Â°.

40|$|<b>Polar</b> {{mesoscale}} <b>cyclones</b> {{over the}} subarctic {{are thought to}} be {{an important component of the}} coupled atmosphereâ€“ocean climate system. However, the relatively small scale of these features presents some concern as to their representation in the meteorological reanalysis datasets that are commonly used to drive ocean models. Here polar mesocyclones are detected in the 40 -Year European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis dataset (ERA- 40) in mean sea level pressure and 500 -hPa geopotential height, using an automated cyclone detection algorithm. The results are compared to polar mesocyclones detected in satellite imagery over the northeast Atlantic, for the period October 1993 â€“ September 1995. Similar trends in monthly cyclone numbers and a similar spatial distribution are found. However, there is a bias in the size of cyclones detected in the reanalysis. Up to 80 % of cyclones larger than 500 km are detected in MSL pressure, but this hit rate decreases, approximately linearly, to 40 % for 250 -km-scale cyclones and to 20 % for 100 -km-scale cyclones. Consequently a substantial component of the associated airâ€“sea fluxes may be missing from the reanalysis, presenting a serious shortcoming when using such reanalysis data for ocean modeling simulations. Eight maxima in cyclone density are apparent in the mean sea level pressure, clustered around synoptic observing stations in the northeast Atlantic. They are likely spurious, and a result of unidentified shortcomings in the ERA- 40 data assimilation procedure. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{shown that the}} shear fields {{on either side of}} the {{westerlies}} are dynamically unstable and will roll up to form discrete eddies. A study of the stable vortex systems into which these eddies might collect shows that a "vortex street" is stable for a certain range of the ratio of width to vortex spacing. It is also shown that a formation with vortices placed on the corners of a regular polygon is stable if the number of vortices is less than seven. This still holds if the effect of the shear field north of the westerlies is stimulated by a fixed <b>polar</b> <b>cyclone.</b> It further appears that with a strong general circulation, i. e. strong westerlies, only two or three high pressure cells should be found while the numbers, up to six, should be found with weaker circulations. This conclusion is verified by Northern Hemisphere mean pressure charts...|$|E
40|$|Recent work {{concerning}} {{the use of}} microwave radiometers in space to provide views of the water content of clouds is reported. Recently, theoretical algorithms were refined and the sampling by microwave radiometers for polar orbiting satellite became more commensurate in resolution and coverage with {{the scale of the}} meteorological phenomena. Parameters available from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) include total integrated water vapor (kg/sq m), integrated cloud liquid water (kg/sq m), rain rate (mm/hr), and an index for the presence and concentration of large ice particles; this so called scattering index can also be converted to a rain rate, although conversion is still rather uncertain. The hydrologic aspects of climatically important cloud systems on the Earth such as subtropical stratus decks, tropical convection, and midlatitude and <b>polar</b> <b>cyclone</b> can thus be monitored with the SSM/I parameters. The diagnostic as well as prognostic potential of these satellite derived water content properties of cloud systems are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{of a sudden}} stratospheric warming event which occurred spontaneously during a general circulation model simulation of the global atmospheric circulation. Two separate warming pulses exhibit the same dynamical evolution with a 'cycle' of about two weeks. Two distinct phases of the warming cycle are apparent: (1) the generation of an intense localized warm cell in conjunction with significant adiabatic heating associated with cross-isobar flow which has been induced by vertically propagating long wave disturbances; and (2) the northward transport of that warm cell via advection by the essentially geostrophic windfield corresponding to an intense, offset <b>polar</b> <b>cyclone,</b> {{in conjunction with a}} strong Aleutian anticyclone. During the first warming pulse in January, a moderate Aleutian anticyclone was in place prior to the warming cycle and was intensified by interaction with an eastward traveling anticyclone induced by the differential advection of the warm cell. The second warming pulse occurred in early February with a strong Aleutian anticyclone already established. In contrast to the January event, the warming in February culminated with reversal of the zonal westerlies to easterlies over a significant depth of the stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|A {{complete}} {{theory of}} the linear initial-value problem for Rossby waves on a class of smooth circular vortices in both f-plane and polar-region geometries {{is presented in the}} limit of small and large Rossby deformation radius. Although restricted to the interior region of barotropically stable circular vortices possessing a single extrema in tangential wind, the theory covers all azimuthal wavenumbers. The non-dimensional evolution equation for perturbation potential vorticity is shown to depend on only one parameter, G, involving the azimuthal wavenumber, the basic state radial potential vorticity gradient, the interior deformation radius, and the interior Rossby number. In Hankel transform space the problem admits a SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s equation formulation which permits a qualitative and quantitative discussion of the interaction between vortex Rossby wave disturbances and the mean vortex. New conservation laws are developed which give exact time-evolving bounds for disturbance kinetic energy. Using results from the theory of Lie groups a nontrivial separation of variables can be achieved to obtain an exact solution for asymmetric balanced disturbances covering a wide range of geophysical vortex applications including tropical <b>cyclone,</b> <b>polar</b> vortex, and cyclone/anticyclone interiors in barotropic dynamics.

40|$|Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) {{are major}} {{disturbances}} in the polar {{region of the}} winter hemisphere that cause major changes in stratospheric temperature and circulation. SSWs are characterized by a temperature increase of tens of degrees Kelvin, averaged over 60 Â°- 90 Â° latitude, and a weakening of the polar vortex that persists for {{the order of a}} week at the 10 hPa level (roughly 32 km) [Labitzke and Naujokat, 2000]. The <b>polar</b> vortices are <b>cyclones</b> centered on both of the Earthâ€™s poles that are present from the mid-troposphere to the lower stratosphere. Eastward zonal winds define the strong polar vortices in the winter. Increased planetary wave (PW) activity in the winter hemisphere leads to increased PW breaking in the polar stratosphere and the deposition of the PWâ€™s westward momentum in the polar vortex. This weakens, {{and in the case of}} major SSWs, can reverse the zonal wind direction to westward. The reversal of the stratospheric jet allows more eastward propagating gravity waves (GWs) to travel up into the mesosphere where, in normal winter conditions, westward propagating GWs dominate [Liu and Roble, 2002]. The atypical wintertime GW filtering and the resulting dominating westward GWs induce an equatorward circulation in the mesosphere, which leads to the cooling of the upper mesosphere. While these mesospheric coolings have been observed in the polar regions for several decades [Labitzke, 1972], they have only recently been observed at mid-latitudes [Yuan et al., 2012]...|$|R
40|$|Quasi-Lagrangian {{budgets of}} mass, {{vorticity}} and heat are calculated following disturbances that form within polar air streams. Observed cases are {{extracted from the}} European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts analyses during the First GARP Global Experiment. Model-generated cases are extracted from the simulations of extratropical cyclogenesis by Sandgathe. These polar lows grow primarily through basic baroclinic instability processes and exhibit many features of larger maritime extratropical <b>cyclones.</b> <b>Polar</b> lows that originate on the poleward (or Cyclonic - Type C) side of the jet and have considerable midtropospheric positive vorticity advection at formation time are contrasted with lows that form on the equatorward (or Anticyclonic - Type A) side of a nearly straight upper-level jet. The midtropospheric positive vorticity advection must be present to enhance the vertical circulation when the large surface fluxes {{that are associated with}} strong outbreaks act to damp the thermal wave amplification. Although latent heat release {{is an important factor in}} both types, it is an essential energy source for the Type A low developments on the equatorward side. Although the vorticity balance is initially different for the two types of polar lows, the vorticity budgets during later stages are similar. The heat budget and the thickness tendency equation demonstrated that the self-development process that is present in larger maritime cyclones is also important for polar low intensification. The absence of favorable coupling to a jet stream is the missing factor in a model-generated Type A polar low that failed to develop. Consequently, the mid- and upper-tropospheric wind fields determine which polar lows will intensify to significant amplitudes...|$|R
