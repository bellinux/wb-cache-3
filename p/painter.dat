5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding <b>Painter</b> of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus <b>Painter,</b> the Kleophon <b>Painter</b> and the late work of the Achilles <b>Painter.</b> Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon <b>Painter</b> of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 5th century BC until 480 BC at the latest, all painters of repute were using the red-figure style. But black-figure vases continued to be produced for some 50 additional years, with their quality progressively decreasing. The last painters producing acceptable quality images on large vases were the Eucharides <b>Painter</b> and the Kleophrades <b>Painter.</b> Only workshops which produced smaller shapes like olpes, oenoches, skyphos, small neck amphoras and particular lekythos increasingly used the old style. The Phanyllis <b>Painter</b> used the Six technique, among other methods, and both the Edinburgh <b>Painter</b> and the Gela <b>Painter</b> decorated the first cylindrical lekythos. The former primarily produced casual, clear and simple scenes using a black-figure style on a white ground. The white ground of the vases was quite thick and no longer painted directly on the clay foundation, a technique which became the standard for all white-ground vases. The Sappho <b>Painter</b> specialized in funerary lekythos. The workshop of the Haimon <b>Painter</b> was especially productive; over 600 of their vases have survived. The Athena <b>Painter</b> (who is perhaps identical with the red-figure Bowdoin <b>Painter)</b> and the Perseus <b>Painter</b> continued to decorate large, standard lekythos. The scenes of the Athena <b>Painter</b> still radiate some of the dignity inherent {{in the work of the}} Leagros Group. The Marathon <b>Painter</b> is primarily known for the funerary lekythos found in the tumulus for the Athenians who died in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The last significant lekythos <b>painter,</b> the Beldam <b>Painter,</b> worked from around 470 BC until 450 BC. Except for the Panathenaic prize amphoras, the black-figure style came to a close in Attica at this time.|$|E

The album {{is made up of}} songs from the same recording sessions for Rollercoaster.|$|R
50|$|The next {{generation}} of late Archaic vase <b>painters</b> (c. 500 to 480 BC) brought an increasing naturalism to the style {{as seen in the}} gradual change of the profile eye. This phase also sees the specialization of <b>painters</b> into pot and cup <b>painters,</b> with the Berlin and Kleophrades <b>Painters</b> notable in the former category and Douris and Onesimos in the latter.|$|R
5000|$|Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck, {{written in}} 17th century Dutch and {{published}} in Haarlem in 1604 by Passchier van Wesbusch, describes the life and work of more than 250 <b>painters,</b> both historical and contemporary, and explains contemporary art theory for aspiring <b>painters.</b> During his travels and stay in Italy, van Mander had read and was influenced by Giorgio Vasari's famous biographical accounts of <b>painters</b> in his book Lives of the Most Excellent <b>Painters,</b> Sculptors, and Architects, {{often referred to as}} the Vite. It was published in 1550 and republished in 1568 with woodcuts, which is the version van Mander probably studied. He set about translating this work into Dutch and it was during this project that he was offered the commission to inventory Haarlem's art collection, a job that resulted in the chapters of his book on Early Netherlandish <b>painters.</b> In both books, the lives of the <b>painters</b> are told in the standard [...] "Vita di ..." [...] manner of Catholic saints, extolling the virtues of the <b>painters</b> one by one in several chapters. In van Mander's book many entries on Italian <b>painters</b> were simply translated or adapted from the Italian Vite, but the biographical details on early Netherlandish <b>painters</b> and, in particular the Haarlem <b>painters,</b> are unique and gathered during van Mander's commission.|$|R
25|$|The {{first group}} is {{represented}} by the Kassandra <b>Painter</b> from Capua, still under Sicilian influence. He was followed by the workshop of the Parrish <b>Painter</b> and that of the Laghetto <b>Painter</b> and the Caivano <b>Painter.</b> Their work is characterised by a preference for satyr figures with thyrsos, depictions of heads (normally below the handles of hydriai), decorative borders of garments, and the frequent use of additional white, red and yellow. The Laghetto and Caivano Painters appear to have moved to Paestum later.|$|E
25|$|Other {{members of}} the group {{included}} the two brothers Nicolas-Antoine Taunay, <b>painter</b> of battle scenes, and Auguste Taunay, sculptor; Jean-Baptiste Debret, <b>painter,</b> and Charles-Simon Pradier, engraver.|$|E
25|$|Other {{well-known}} vase {{painters of}} the time are the <b>Painter</b> of the Vatican Mourner, The Princeton <b>Painter,</b> the <b>Painter</b> of Munich 1410 and the Swing <b>Painter</b> (540-520 BC), to whom many vases are attributed. He is {{not considered to be}} a very good artist, but his figures are unintentionally humorous because of the figures with their large heads, strange noses and frequently clenched fists. The work of the Rycroft <b>Painter</b> bears a resemblance to red-figure vase painting and the new forms of expression. He liked to depict Dionysian scenes, horses and chariots, and the adventures of Heracles. He often uses outline drawings. The approximately 50 usually large-size vessels attributed to him are elegantly painted. The Class of C.M. 218 primarily decorated variations of the Nikosthenic amphoras. The Hypobibazon Class worked with a new type of belly amphora with rounded handles and feet, whose decoration is characterized by a key meander above the image fields. A smaller variant of neck amphora was decorated by the Three Line Group. The Perizoma Group adopted around 520 BC the newly introduced form of the stamnos. Toward the end of the century, high quality productions were still being produced by the Euphiletos <b>Painter,</b> the Madrid <b>Painter</b> and the imaginative Priam <b>Painter.</b>|$|E
