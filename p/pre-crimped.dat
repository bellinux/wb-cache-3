2500|$|Shotshell presses {{are most}} {{commonly}} operated in non-batch modes. [...] That is, a single hull will often be deprimed, reshaped, primed, loaded with powder, have a wad pressed in, be loaded with shot, be <b>pre-crimped,</b> {{and then be}} final crimped before being removed and a new hull being placed on the shotshell press at station 1. [...] An alternative, somewhat faster method, often used on a single stage press is to work on 5 hulls in parallel sequentially, with but a single processed hull being located {{at each of the}} 5 stations available on a single stage shotshell press, while manually removing the finished shotshell from station 5 and then moving the 4 in-process hulls to the next station (1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5) before adding a new hull at the deprimer (station 1) location. Both these modes of shotshell reloading are in distinct contrast to the common practice used with reloading pistol and rifle cartridges on a single stage press, which are most often processed in batch modes, where a common operation will commonly be done on a batch of up to 50 or 100 cartridges at a time, before proceeding to the next processing step. [...] This difference is largely a result of shotshell presses having 5 stations available for use simultaneously, unlike a single stage cartridge press which typically has but one station available for use.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: It is {{not clear}} what type of <b>pre-crimped</b> crown is more {{successful}} in achieving greater marginal adaptation following re-crimping. This study aimed to assess the changes in the circumference of 3 M ESPE and MIB <b>pre-crimped</b> stainless steel crowns (SSCs) for the primary maxillary and mandibular first and second molars following re-crimping. Materials and Methods: This was an in-vitro, experimental study. Initial photographs were obtained from the margins of 3 M and MIB SSCs for the upper and lower primary molars using a digital camera. Crown margins were crimped by applying 0. 2 N force using 114 and 137 pliers. Post-crimping photographs were also obtained and the changes in crown circumference after crimping were calculated using AutoCad software. The percentage of reduction in the circumference of crowns for each tooth was statistically analyzed based on the type of crown using student t-test. The effect of crown design and the associated teeth on the decreased circumference percentage was statistically analyzed by two-sided ANOVA. Results: The percentage of reduction in lower E SSC circumference was 3. 71 ± 0. 39 % in MIB and 6. 29 ± 0. 62 % in 3 M crowns. These values were 3. 55 ± 0. 55 % and 7. 15 ± 1. 13 % for the lower Ds, and 3. 95 ± 0. 43 and 6. 24 ± 0. 85 % for the upper Ds, respectively. For the upper Es, these values were found to be 3. 12 ± 0. 65 % and 5. 14 ± 0. 94 %, respectively. For each tooth, a significant difference was found between MIB and 3 M SSCs in terms of the percentage of reduction in crown circumference following crimping. The magnitude of this reduction was smaller in MIB compared to 3 M SSCs (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Considering the significant reduction in the marginal circumference of <b>pre-crimped</b> SSCs following re-crimping, it appears that this manipulation must be necessarily performed for MIB and 3 M <b>pre-crimped</b> SSCs. By using 3 M SSCs, higher marginal adaptation can be achieved following crimping. </p...|$|E
40|$|There?re {{considered}} ways {{to intensify}} {{the process of}} crimping tubular blanks by using the profiled matrices in this work. Results are compared of the traditional crimping in profiled and radiused matrices, and, in the latter case, crimping is carried out both with a cylindrical workpiece or <b>pre-crimped</b> to the cone blank workpiece. Matrix made of profiled consistently angled torus surfaces, which reduces the contact area with the workpiece?s material. There?re obtained {{the distribution of the}} degree of using resource of plasticity, the intensities of the stresses and strains at the bottom of deformed workpieces for each type of crimp in this work. The dependence of crimping?s efforts of punch?s moving is obtained there. There?re shown that using the matrix with profiled surface leads to an increase maximum rate of crimping by theoretical analyze, using the finite element method, on example of the crimping stainless steel tubular workpiece. ? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ?????????, ????? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????. ???????????? ?????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ????????? ? ???????????????? ????????, ??????, ? ????????? ??????, ????? ????????????? ??? ? ????????? ??????????????, ??? ? ? ?????????????? ??????? ?? ????? ?????????. ???????????????? ??????? ????????? ?? ??????????????? ????????????? ??? ????? ??????? ????????????, ??? ????????? ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????????. ?????????? ????????????? ??????? ????????????? ??????? ????????????, ?????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ? ?????? ????? ???????????????? ?????? ??? ??????? ???? ??????. ???????? ??????????? ?????? ????????? ?? ??????????? ????????. ?? ??????? ?????? ????????? ?? ??????????? ?????, ????????? ?????, ? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????, ????????, ??? ????????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ???????? ? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????...|$|E

BackgroundThe JACTAX HD (Boston Scientific) stent consists of a <b>pre-crimped</b> bare-metal Liberté (Boston Scientific) stent coated on its abluminal aspect with an ultrathin (< 1 μm) 1 / 1 mixture of biodegradable polylactide polymer and paclitaxel applied as discrete microdots (nominal totals of 9. 2 μg each of polymer and paclitaxel per 16 -mm stent). MethodsIn this prospective, single-arm, multicenter, first-human-use study (n = 103), the primary end point of 9 -month major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-related target vessel revascularization) was compared with an objective performance criterion (OPC) of 17 % (11 % MACE based on TAXUS ATLAS [TAXUS Liberté-SR Stent for the Treatment of de Novo Coronary Artery Lesions] trial results plus a pre-specified noninferiority margin of 6 %). ResultsThe composite primary end point occurred in 7. 8 % of JACTAX HD patients with an upper 1 -sided 95 % confidence limit of 13. 6 %, thus meeting the pre-specified criteria for noninferiority. There was no death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis through 9 months. In-stent late loss was 0. 33 ± 0. 45 mm, with an in-stent binary restenosis of 5. 2 % and net volume obstruction by intravascular ultrasound of 11. 4 ± 11. 2 %. ConclusionsThe JACTAX HD stent with an abluminal biodegradable polymer showed 9 -month MACE, in-stent late loss, restenosis, and net volume obstruction comparable to that observed with the TAXUS Liberté (Boston Scientific) stent coated with a conformal durable polymer. Further studies are underway to better evaluate the potential of this new PES design, which might allow for more rapid endothelialization and improved vessel healing.
