50|$|Liodor <b>Palmin</b> {{was born}} in 1841 in Yaroslavl region and became {{interested}} in literature through his father, a retired officer, himself a published poet who {{was close to the}} circle of Alexander Voeykov. It was <b>Palmin</b> Senior who's imbued his son with the love to the twin tradition of romantically rhetorical ode and 'rational', polite satire, prevalent at the time in the Russian poetry. Palmin's childhood impressions, concerning literature as a kind of high priesthood for an enlightened modern man, that <b>Palmin</b> has carried all through his life. In 1856, after his father's death, Liodor <b>Palmin</b> enrolled into the 3rd Saint Petersburgh gymnasium and, upon the graduation, joined the law faculty of the Saint Petersburgh University. In 1861 he got involved in students troubles, was arrested and got incarcerated into the Petropavlovskaya fortress - this harrowing experience caused him much anguish which resulted in memoirs, The Fortress.|$|E
5000|$|Liodor <b>Palmin</b> professed {{more or less}} {{abstract}} {{democratic principles}} and had his political agenda described as 'amorphous', but never ceased praising 'fighting for freedom heroics' ("Rendes-Vous", 1865, [...] "Eternal Lives", 1867) and expressed most ardent admiration for zealots and pioneers in social struggle. In his political poetry <b>Palmin</b> denounced halfway house results of the 1861 political reforms ("Common Songs"), deplored the general social apathy in Russia ("Magic Sounds of Mystery Strings", 1865) ridiculed liberals for their lack of principals ("Uncle Midnight", 1866). Arguably the most radical of his poems, Requiem ("Don't mourn dead fighters…", Iskra, No. 11, 1865) became a popular revolutionary song.|$|E
5000|$|Palmin's poetry, having formed {{under the}} Iskra {{influence}} which mixed Nekrasov's [...] "pathos of suffering" [...] with Heine-derived [...] "high-brow irony", amounted rarely {{to more than}} stilted and repetitive commentaries on contemporary issues. All the while <b>Palmin</b> retained his reputation of a [...] "progressive man" [...] and was a popular writer, [...] "one {{of those who were}} being worshiped in Taganrog," [...] according to Anton Chekhov. In 1970s <b>Palmin</b> was enjoying his reputation of the [...] "keeper of revolutionary traditions in Russian poetry" [...] and continued to fiercely attack his [...] "age - dumb, cheap and mercenary in spirit", along with [...] "all-pervading egotism of a mob", the two common evils which could be withstood only by the enormous might of a Poet, as he saw it ("In Memory of Nekrasov"). Seeing poetry as a strong formative moral instrument, <b>Palmin</b> never shied before using ‘lighter’ forms, like fables, feuilletons and couplets. His [...] "Mikhey and the Philanthropist" [...] couplet was considered to be his most successful and well-known.|$|E
5000|$|Liodor (Iliodor) Ivanovich <b>Palmin</b> (Лиодо́р (Илиодор) Ива́нович Па́льмин; May 27 (15), 1841 in Yaroslavskaya gubernia, Russian Empire [...] - [...] November 7 (October 26), 1891 in Moscow, Russian Empire) was a Russian poet, {{translator}} and journalist.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the liberation}} <b>Palmin</b> was {{expelled}} from the University, failed to find himself a regular job (as an address expedition) and settled as a free-lance journalist. <b>Palmin</b> debuted in 1858 as a translator from French in A.O.Ishimova's girl magazine Lutchi (Rays). In 1860-1862 he published poems in magazines Vek (edited by Pyotr Weinberg) and Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya (edited by Aleksey Pisemsky); in the mid-1860s he was actively contributing to publications associated with the literary left (Budilnik, Delo, Zhenski Vestnik). In 1863-1868 he became friends with Vladimir Kurochkin and started to contribute regularly to Iskra magazine which he later regarded his aesthetic and ideological alma mater. All the while <b>Palmin</b> thought real poetry's social meaning had no bearing upon whatever political hue and particular magazine was being marked by. This {{made it possible for}} him to publish his work in the satirical journal Zanoza (Splinter), edited by Mikhail Rosenheim, and Literaturnaya Biblioteka (edited by Yuri Bogushevich). Later in the 1870s and 1880s, he was published in virtually every paper available, including tabloids like Moskovski Listok somehow without losing his political integrity of as mild and generic political satirist, ridiculing [...] "circus, markets and kharchevnyas", maintaining sacred nature of high literature (The Sacked Temple, 1877).|$|E

In France it is marketed as Végétaline and in Germany it is marketed as <b>Palmin.</b> In the United States it is not readily available.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Kuprin {{approached}} the poet Liodor <b>Palmin</b> who {{arranged for the}} story {{to be published in}} the Russian Satirical Leaflet (signed [...] "А. К-rin"), on 3 December 1889. The Junkers were forbidden to publish anything without the consent of the Academy's authorities, so, as the identity of the author became known, Kuprin was arrested and spent two days in custody.|$|E
50|$|The gallery's pool of Russian {{contemporary}} artists encompasses {{a variety of}} styles, which flourished in the Russian photography {{during the last three}} decades, featuring underground artist from the 1980s Sergey Borisov, conceptualist Vadim Guschin, whose simple forms and abstract composition are rooted in Russian avant-garde tradition, one of the forefather of St Petersburg school of photography Alexander Kitaev and contemporary architectural photographers Vladimir Antoschenkov, admirerof St Petersburg, and Igor <b>Palmin,</b> centered on the exploration of Moscow modernism.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the authors}} {{who contributed to}} it {{regularly}} were Pyotr Weinberg (in 1866-1867 the head of its literary section, pen names: Heine form Tambov, The Melancholic), Liodor <b>Palmin,</b> Ivan Dmitriyev (originally the head of its literary section), Gavriil Zhulev (also: The Grieving Poet), Nikolai Zlatovratsky (N.

Petrov, V. Pechkin), Anton Chekhov (Antosha Chekhonte, G. Baldastov, My Brother's Brother, Patientless Doctor).|$|E
50|$|The magazine, {{founded by}} the caricaturist Nikolai Stepanov and poet Vasily Kurochkin was a Socialist publication, {{targeting}} social inequality and the Tsarism. Yet, in its heyday it attracted a host of famost authors from diverse literary factions, including Alexey K. Tolstoy, Alexey Zhemchuzhnikov, Alexey Pleshcheyev, Lev Mei, Viktor Burenin, Liodor <b>Palmin,</b> Vladimir Shchiglev, Gleb and Nikolai Uspenskys, Alexander Levitov, Pavel Yakushkin, Fyodor Reshetnikov, Grigory Eliseev. Iskra became famous for its caricatures, made by the best Russian artists of the time, among them Nikolai Stepanov, Mikhail Mikeshin, Mikhail Znamensky.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{literary}} scholars {{agreed that}} <b>Palmin</b> {{has never been}} a master of sharp political criticism, his verse, full of hints and half-spoken implementations, used spacious declarative monologues, stylistic clichés and borrowed a lot from mythology. Themes of personal tiredness and depression became prevalent in his 1880s work (From Winter Songs, 1882), his declarations becoming more and more repetitive and dour. All the while Palmin's popularity never waned and in Oskolki he remained the leading poet up until the 1880s. In fact, he's always remained [...] "a censor's bane": while 300 of his works were published, 70 were banned.|$|E
5000|$|In 1889 Alexander Kuprin met Liodor <b>Palmin,</b> an {{established}} poet who {{arranged for the}} publication in the Russian Satirical Leaflet of his debut short story [...] "The Last Debut", based on a real life incident, the suicide by poisoning on stage of the singer Yevlalya Kadmina in 1881, a tragedy which also inspired Ivan Turgenev's tale [...] "Clara Milich". Some three years passed between the appearance of [...] "The Last Debut" [...] and {{the publication of his}} second tale [...] "Psyche" [...] in December 1892. Like [...] "On a Moonlit Night" [...] which followed it, the piece showed the aberrations of a deranged mind, investigating the thin line between fantasy and reality.|$|E
5000|$|Nablyudatel (Наблюдатель, The Watcher) was a Russian monthly {{literary}} and political magazine published in Saint Petersburg in 1882—1904. Its {{editor and publisher}} was Alexander Pyatkovsky. There was a supplement to it, a daily newspaper called Glasnost (1897-1904). A right-wing, pro-monarchist publication, particularly harsh on what it perceived as being [...] "Jewish interests", Nablyudatel was unpopular with both Marxist and liberal critics, but its {{literary and}} scientific sections were respectable, and among the authors whose works appeared there, were Vladimir Bezobrazov, Ieronim Yasinsky, Liodor <b>Palmin,</b> Pavel Zasodimsky, Pyotr Boborykin, Daniil Mordovtsev, Vasily Nemirovich-Danchenko, Konstantin Balmont, Nikolai Minsky and Konstantin Fofanov. It was the publication of latter's 1888 poem [...] "The Mistery of Love" [...] (Таинство любви) that brought the journal its biggest trouble with censorship, resulting in six months suspension.|$|E
5000|$|Janonis {{is known}} {{primarily}} as a poet. He learned poetry from older Lithuanian poets, primarily [...] (Janonis knew him personally) and Maironis. His early poems were about nature, personal feelings (e.g. his unrequited love, struggles to reconcile reality with ideals and unreachable life goals), and suffering of the poor. Later, he became a political agitator calling {{for the removal of}} the current regime. According to literary critic Vytautas Kubilius, [...] "he combined precise detail and concrete imagery with intense lyricism and the energy of strongly felt experience." [...] Several Janonis' poems were turned into songs by composers Mikas Petrauskas, Stasys Šimkus, Juozas Gruodis, Nikodemas Martinonis, Jonas Dambrauskas, and others. Janonis translated several poems from Russian, including Requiem ("Don't mourn dead fighters…") by Liodor <b>Palmin</b> which became popular and was sund by the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union. In addition to lyric poems, Janonis also wrote short stories and feuilletons.|$|E

40|$|Astrocaryum jauari is {{the most}} {{frequent}} <b>palmin</b> the floodplains (igapó) of the Rio Negro, in Brazilian Amazonia. It grows to 20 m of height and is rarely found isolated. More commonly, 4 - 6 individuals of different sizes stand together which originate from the same rhizome. Fruit abscission occurs at highest water levels and dispersal occurs by fish. The palm has commercial value: until 1998, for 20 years 'palmito' was {{the basis of the}} industrial production in Central Amazonia. In the present study, seasonal dynamics and biomass of fruit production in A. jauari are described in relation to water level and annual flood duration. Systematic studies were performed at the Ecological Station of the Anavilhanas Archipelago, with an inventory area covering 5. 000 m 2. Fruit production was monitored at weekly intervals and biomass was determined. Data on the dispersing fishes was obtained by collection in the field and by interviews of local people. A. jauari occurs from the higher levels to the lowest in the flooding gradient, being waterlogged up to 270 - 340 days/year. 125 individuals of A. jauari occorred in the sampled 5. 000 m 2, which is equivalent to a density of 250 ind/ha in the Anavilhanas. Only adult trees which were directly exposed to light produced fruits. 16 species of fish feed on the fruits of A. jauari. Ten of these act as possible dispersers, 3 as predators. The high contents of vitamine A may be attractive for the fishes. Since the fruits do not have structures enhancing floatation, hydrochoric dispersal does not occur and the seeds succumb to the hypoxic conditions under water. In habitats with short periods of flooding, the fruits may be accumulated near the adult plant (barochory). Other trees occurring in the habitats colonized by A. jauari have hydrochoric and ichthyochoric dispersal syndromes and show high flooding tolerance. In the main area of extractivism of the past, in the Município Barcelos, the density of the species varied between the islands, and had densities between 250 and 2. 000 ind/ha. Here, one worker could fell up to 90 palms at high water (May, June) and up to 25 in the low water period (december, january). For each tree, 0. 5 to 1 bin of processed bin of "palmito" is produced. Assuming a mean number of ten workers in the area, 900 to 250 palms are exploited per day, corresponding to 1 - 0. 5 ha destroyed forest. If we consid the densities of the palm and its productivity as calculated for the Anavilhanas islands (whcih was 165 kg), extractivism without replacement of new palm trees implies a fast extinction and exclusion of this ressource for the ichthyofauna of the archipelago with all consequences for the local peopl...|$|E
