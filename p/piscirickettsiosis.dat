Current strategies to control infection are i) indiscriminate antibiotic use and ii) vaccination with predominantly P. salmonis bacterin vaccines that do not provide acceptable levels of protection against <b>piscirickettsiosis.</b> Areas covered: This review covers the basic biology of P. salmonis, clinical <b>piscirickettsiosis</b> and disease control, the development of current P. salmonis vaccines, innate and adaptive immunity and a 5 -year plan to develop new <b>piscirickettsiosis</b> vaccines. Expert commentary: Fundamental knowledge is lacking on the complexities of P. salmonis-host interactions, relating to bacterial virulence and host innate and adaptive immune responses, which needs to be addressed. The development of new P. salmonis vaccines needs the application of comprehensive ‘omics’ technologies to identify candidate vaccine antigens capable of stimulating long-lasting protective immune responses...|$|E

Bacterial-free supernatants, obtained from cultures of three isolates of Piscirickettsia salmonis, were inoculated in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., and in three continuous cell lines {{in an effort to}} determine the presence of secretion of extracellular products (ECPs) by this microorganism. Although steatosis was found in some liver samples, no mortalities or clinical signs occurred in the inoculated fish. Clear cytotoxicity was observed after inoculation in the cell lines CHSE- 214 and ASK, derived from salmonid tissues, but not in MDBK, which is of mammalian origin. The degree of cytotoxicity of the ECPs was different among the P. salmonis isolates tested. The isolate that evidenced the highest cytotoxicity in its ECPs exhibited only an intermediate virulence level after challenging fish with bacterial suspensions of the three P. salmonis isolates. Almost complete inhibition of the cytotoxic activity of ECPs was seen after proteinase K treatment, indicating their peptidic nature, and a total preclusion of the cytotoxicity was shown after their incubation at 50 °C for 30 min. Results show that P. salmonis can produce ECPs and {{at least some of them}} are thermolabile exotoxins that probably play a role in the pathogenesis of <b>piscirickettsiosis.</b> This work was supported by Grant Fondecyt (Chile) 1080692...|$|E

The pathogenesis {{of the disease}} has not been fully characterized. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the hepatic lesions associated with experimental P. salmonis infection in Atlantic salmon juveniles. Fish were maintained in fresh water and inoculated intraperitoneally (IP), orally, or on the gill surface with P. salmonis. A group of uninfected fish was kept as control. Liver samples from 5 fish in each inoculated group and 3 controls were collected weekly and processed for histological and immunohistochemical examination. Thickening of the liver capsule by inflammatory cells was a characteristic histologic feature of IP inoculated fish. Three weeks post-IP inoculation, 8 fish had died and 2 fish were sampled. Histological changes at this time consisted of vasculitis, presence of fibrin thrombi, vacuolated hepatocytes and focal areas of necrosis. Leukocytes containing intracytoplasmic basophilic microorganisms were seen within hepatic sinusoids. Vasculitis and intracytoplasmic vacuoles were prominent features in fish inoculated orally and on the gill surface. The presence of P. salmonis within hepatocellular vacuoles, endothelial cells, and leucocytes was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The intracellular location of P. salmonis and the vascular damage seen in infected fish are characteristic of rickettsial infections. Histological lesions induced by experimental infection with P. salmonis using the oral and gill surface routes were similar to those observed in natural outbreaks of <b>piscirickettsiosis.</b> The tropism of P. salmonis for endothelial cells explains the vascular lesions observed in SRS, whereas hepatic lesions are due to ischemic necrosis and direct injury by intracytoplasmic organisms.

In this report, we describe a novel procedure to purify in vitro-grown bacteria with iodixanol as the substrate to run differential centrifugation gradients which, combined with DNase I digestion, yield enough pure bacteria to do DNA analysis. The efficiency of the purification procedure relies on two main issues: semiquantitative synchrony of the P. salmonis-infected Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE- 214) tissue culture cells and low osmolarity of iodixanol to better resolve bacteria from the membranous structures of the host cell.

40|$|Piscirickettsia salmonis is an {{aggressive}} fish pathogen that causes <b>Piscirickettsiosis,</b> a systemic disease that threatens {{the sustainability of}} salmon production in Chile. To date, the infection strategies of this bacterium are poorly characterized, a Dot/Icm Type IV Secretion System homolog for intracellular multiplication and survival in macrophages is suggested. Since an invading pathogen and its host develop a complex interaction in which the pathogen strives to survive and replicate, while the host tries to eliminate infected cells and the invading pathogen, we decided to evaluate how the bacterium enters macrophages, its preferred target in vivo, and to follow its fate while struggling with its host using actin cytoskeleton as a molecular marker. We were able to demonstrate that clathrin is required for internalization and that actin cytoskeleton plays a demonstrative role throughout the infective process. Indeed, unlike other fish pathogens, P. salmonis fully exploits the actin monomers both from the disorganized cytoskeleton and an apparently pathogen-induced de novo synthesis of actin, generating tridimensional vacuoles that are increasingly detected at later stages of infection.

A comparative genomics strategy was used on a genomic library of Piscirickettsia salmonis in order to select optimal candidates for a recombinant subunit vaccine to protect fish from rickettsial septicaemia (SRS). Based on this information, 15 P. salmonis ORFs encoding heat shock proteins, virulence factors, membrane bound and other surface exposed antigens, were isolated and expressed. Seven {{of the most promising}} antigens were formulated in three mixtures (V 1 –V 3) containing two or three recombinant proteins each and injected into salmon to test their protective efficacy.

Comparative analysis with models of different bacterial pathogens revealed a lower flexibility in P. salmonis metabolic network. Through constraint-based analysis, we determined essential metabolites required for its growth and showed that it can benefit from different carbon sources tested experimentally in new defined media.

To improve on existing knowledge for the pathogenicity-associated functions of P. salmonis MVs, we studied the proteome of purified MVs from the P. salmonis LF- 89 type strain using multidimensional protein identification technology. Initially, the cytotoxicity of different MV concentration purified from P. salmonis LF- 89 was confirmed in an in vivo adult zebrafish infection model. The cumulative mortality of zebrafish injected with MVs showed a dose-dependent pattern. Analyses identified 452 proteins of different subcellular origins; {{most of them}} were associated with the cytoplasmic compartment and were mainly related to key functions for pathogen survival.

This investigation was designed to prepare a recombinant library of P. salmonis DNA in a phage lambda vector. P. salmonis LF- 89 was grown in CHSE- 214 and RTG- 2 tissue culture cells and morphological changes monitored by light microscopy and staining. Cytoplasmic vacuoles were visible in infected cells by 5 days post-infection and these expanded in size until cells burst, releasing bacteria into the culture fluid. Within 14 - 17 days the complete cell monolayer showed cytopathic effects and cells detached from the culture surface. Bacteria were collected from large volumes of culture fluid by centrifugation, resuspension and brief homogenisation it disperse the material, low speed centrifugation to remove large cellular debris, followed by purification of bacteria from cell debris by centrifugation on a Percoll density gradient. DNA was extracted from the bacteria, partially digested with EcoRI and ligated into ExCell. The library appeared to contain approximately 1. 79 x 105 recombinants/g DNA, and the recombinant library was screened with rabbit antiserum to purified P. salmonis and antisera raised in fish. No reactive clones were detected in screening with antisera, or with oligonucleotide probes against both P. salmonis 16 S rRNA gene and Legionella pneumophila Mip gene.

40|$|Piscirickettsia salmonis is a {{pathogenic}} bacterial agent {{causing a}} septicaemic disease in salmon. Since its isolation in Chile in 1989, P. salmonis has continually produced {{high levels of}} mortality in salmon farms (Manuel and Miller, 2002). In {{the last few years}} disease outbreaks caused by Rickettsia-like organisms (RLOs) have been reported in non-salmon species such as seabass (Comps et al., 1996; Athanassopoulou et al., 1999; Athanassopoulou et al., 2004). RLOs have been found in the nervous tissue of farmed juvenile seabass (from France and Greece) exhibiting abnormal swimming and whirling behaviour and which exhibit medium to high levels of mortality (20 - 80 %). From 2002 to 2004, three disease outbreaks have been recorded in sea bass fingerlings (140 - 180 d) in an Italian hatchery, characterised by low levels of mortality (1 %) and abnormal behaviour, with infected fish showed signs of spiral swimming and lethargy. The outbreaks lasted for a few days and were always recorded during the spring-summer period (April-July), when water temperatures ranged from between 16 and 19 °C. The hatchery was supplied with filtered sea water. During disease outbreaks a number of fish were collected for histopathological and immunohistological examination. The fish showed no signs of macroscopic lesions, but histological lesions were observed in the brain, liver and pancreas. Meningitis and nervous tissue necrosis were observed in the brain, where strongly basophilic coccoidal organisms, which stained red with Macchiavello's stain, were located in the cytoplasmatic vacuoles of macrophages particularly within the meningis. Multifocal necrosis and inflammation were present in the liver, and macrophages and hepatocytes appeared to be filled with RLOs. All fish sampled during the disease outbreaks were positive for P. salmonis by immunohistochemistry using a rabbit P. salmonis antiserum. The symptoms observed between the different disease outbreaks were all similar, and were comparable with the infection described in seabass by other authors (Comps et al., 1996; Athanassopoulou et al., 1999 and 2004). However the fish size and period of infection were not similar, with Italian outbreaks always characterised by very low levels of mortality. From an epidemiological viewpoint, the annual recurrence of this infection appears very interesting and warrants future investigation. On the basis of this first report of <b>Piscirickettsiosis</b> in Italy and the other RLOs disease outbreaks in Mediterranean areas, it would be favourable to carry out a differential diagnosis for diseases with nervous symptoms (like encephalo-retinopathy) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Piscirickettsiosis</b> (SRS) is an endemic {{bacterial}} disease of high economic importance {{and is the}} primary reason for antibiotic usage in the aquaculture industry in Chile. Understanding the epidemiology of this disease is important in order to develop better control strategies for the Chilean aquaculture industry. The objectives of this project were to 1) describe the epidemiology of SRS on Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout farms, and 2) to identify factors that impact the severity of SRS outbreaks. Special attention was given to vaccine strategies currently used by the industry. Production data from 14 Atlantic salmon farms (252 cages) and 11 rainbow trout farms (216 cages) that had completed their production cycles between 2010 and 2012 were investigated. Regression models were used to evaluate time-to-first outbreak of SRS and total mortality attributed to SRS mortality. The factors evaluated in our models were: vaccine type (control and 5 vaccines), smolt weight and cumulative mortality within the first 4 weeks in saltwater, season of smolt introduction, infection with other pathogens during the production cycle, SRS treatments, and total number of sea lice treatments. The prevalence of SRS-affected cages on infected farms was high for both species; however, outbreaks appeared more severe (i. e. higher mortalities) on rainbow trout farms. Onset of SRS outbreaks was, on average, for fish in different vaccine groups, between 2480 degree-days (dd) and 3829 dd for Atlantic salmon, and between 1696 dd and 2241 dd for rainbow trout. For both species, none of the vaccines evaluated completely prevented SRS, although there were significant variations in the time-to-first outbreak and the severity of SRS outbreaks associated with vaccines after controlling for farm effect and other predictors. Specifically, a booster vaccine strategy in Atlantic salmon had significantly lower mortalities associated with SRS and a delay in the onset of disease compared to several of the other vaccines evaluated. Whether the differences observed between vaccines are economically significant is unknown. In rainbow trout, time-to-first outbreak was significantly delayed for vaccinated fish compared to the unvaccinated fish after we controlled for other factors in our model; however, total SRS mortality of vaccinated rainbow trout was not significantly different than unvaccinated rainbow trout. Consistent for both species was that mortality during the first 4 weeks post-salt water entry was associated with time-to-outbreak of SRS, and this effect was dependent on the vaccine used...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIBackground: <b>Piscirickettsiosis</b> or Salmonid Rickettsial Septicaemia (SRS) is a {{bacterial}} disease {{that has a}} major economic impact on the Chilean salmon farming industry. Despite the fact that Piscirickettsia salmonis has been recognized as a major fish pathogen for over 20 years, the molecular strategies underlying the fish response to infection and the bacterial mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. We analysed and compared the head kidney transcriptional response of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) families with different levels of susceptibility to P. salmonis infection in order to reveal mechanisms that might confer infection resistance. Results: We ranked forty full-sibling Atlantic salmon families according to accumulated mortality after a challenge with P. salmonis and selected the families with the lowest and highest cumulative mortalities for microarray gene expression analysis. A comparison of the response to P. salmonis infection between low and high susceptibility groups identified biological processes presumably involved in natural resistance to the pathogen. In particular, expression changes of genes linked to cellular iron depletion, as well as low iron content and bacterial load in the head kidney of fish from low susceptibility families, suggest that iron-deprivation is an innate immunity defence mechanism against P. salmonis. To complement these results, we predicted a set of iron acquisition genes from the P. salmonis genome. Identification of putative Fur boxes and expression of the genes under iron-depleted conditions revealed {{that most of these}} genes form part of the Fur regulon of P. salmonis. Conclusions: This study revealed, for the first time, differences in the transcriptional response to P. salmonis infection among Atlantic salmon families with varied levels of susceptibility to the infection. These differences correlated with changes in the abundance of transcripts encoding proteins directly and indirectly involved in the immune response; changes that highlighted the role of nutritional immunity through iron deprivation in host defence mechanisms against P. salmonis. Additionally, we found that P. salmonis has several mechanisms for iron acquisition, suggesting that this bacterium can obtain iron from different sources, including ferric iron through capturing endogenous and exogenous siderophores and ferrous iron. Our results contribute to determining the underlying resistance mechanisms of Atlantic salmon to P. salmonis infection and to identifying future treatment strategies.

40|$|This {{research}} characterized some {{outbreaks of}} the ectoparasite Caligus rogercresseyi in Chile and compared them to similar infestations in Australia by Caligus longirostris and Ceratothoa banksii, {{in relation to}} co-infections by <b>piscirickettsiosis</b> and viral infection salmon anaemia (ISA virus (ISAV)) in Chile and/or amoebic gill disease (AGD – both in Australia and Chile), and according to husbandry management practices. Understanding how and why co-infections occur allows the development of preventive integrated strategies. The co-infection of these pathogens could occur because 1) salmon, normally resistant to a pathogen become, more susceptible to it, due to pre-infection with an ectoparasite or vice-versa, and 2) salmon farms have single-pathogen oriented control strategies that are ineffective. To identify the reservoirs for Neoparamoeba perurans (AGD etiological agent) on ectoparasites from farmed salmon in Tasmania, {{the presence of this}} amoeba was investigated on the gill isopod Ceratothoa banksii collected from farmed salmon. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis it was demonstrated that N. perurans was either present in low concentration or absent on the surface, and absent inside the gill isopods from salmon that had not been freshwater bathed for AGD during 200 or more days. Thus it is unlikely that these isopods acted as reservoirs or vectors for the amoeba. In contrast, with the potential advent of alternative (non-freshwater) AGD treatments it is possible that Ceratothoid parasitism will become a potential problem on Tasmanian salmon farms. An investigation of the environmental reservoirs of N. perurans during tank-based experimental infections demonstrated that the concentration of N. perurans was significantly higher in the running water (13 ± 7 cells/L after 16 days) than on the interphase surface air-water-tank (0. 01 ± 0. 1 cells/L). Although the number of N. perurans on fish gills was not determined in this tank-based study, on farmed Atlantic salmon from the Huon estuary chronically affected with AGD, amoebae detected from gill swabs ranged from 0 - 1042 cells/swab, which could indicate that fish themselves are reservoirs of this pathogen. To characterize the outbreaks of the sea lice with the other main pathogens (N. perurans, Piscirickettsia salmonis and ISAV), moribund salmonids were sampled in Chile in 2011 from two neighboring farms.
