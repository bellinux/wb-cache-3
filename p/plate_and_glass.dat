60|$|The Lord Lieutenant's {{wife and}} daughters, {{as well as}} the Ernescliffes, had slept there, and Ethel found them all with Flora in the great hall, which looked like a winter garden, {{interspersed}} with tables covered with <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass,</b> where eating and drinking might go on all day long. But Ethel's heart sank within her at the sight of Flora's haggard face and sunken eyes. 'What is the matter?' she asked Blanche, an image of contented beauty.|$|E

60|$|Miss Deemas hit {{the table}} with her hand, in a {{masculine}} manner, so forcibly, that the <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>glasses</b> rattled, then she resumed, for she was now on a favourite theme, and was delivering a lecture to a select audience.|$|R

Do you think Mr. Lydgate expects it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Tupper and I {{waited a}} good while, and then Bennoch and Tupper came back, without having found Mr. ------. Tupper wished {{very much to}} show the prayer-book used by King Charles at his execution, and some curious old {{manuscript}} volumes; but the servant said that his master always kept these treasures locked up, and trusted the key to nobody. We therefore had to take our leave without seeing them; and I have not often entered a house that one feels to be more forlorn than Wooton,--although {{we did have a}} glimpse of a dining-room, with a table laid for three or four guests, and looking quite brilliant with <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> and snowy napery. There was a fire, too, in this one room. Mr. ------ is making extensive alterations in the house, or has recently done so, and this is perhaps one reason of its ungenial meagreness and lack of finish.|$|E

The perfect and entire {{satisfaction}} of Tom; his surpassing appreciation of the husky sandwiches, which crumbled in his mouth like saw-dust; the unspeakable relish with which he swallowed the thin wine by drops, and smacked his lips, as though it were so rich and generous that to lose an atom of its fruity flavour were a sin; the look with which he paused sometimes, with his glass in his hand, proposing silent toasts to himself; and the anxious shade that came upon his contented face when, after wandering round the room, exulting in its uninvaded snugness, his glance encountered the dull brow of his companion; no cynic in the world, though in his hatred of its men a very griffin, could have withstood these things in Thomas Pinch.|$|E

60|$|When I {{first came}} to Venice, I {{accepted}} the fate appointed to young men on the Continent. I took lodgings, and I began dining drearily at the restaurants. Worse prandial fortunes may befall one, {{but it is hard}} to conceive of the continuance of so great unhappiness elsewhere; while the restaurant life is an established and permanent thing in Italy, for every bachelor and for many forlorn families. It is not because the restaurants are very dirty--if you wipe your <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> carefully before using them, they need not stomach you; it is not because the rooms are cold--if you sit near the great vase of smoldering embers in the centre of each room you may suffocate in comparative comfort; it is not because the prices are great--they are really very reasonable; it is not for any very tangible fault that I object to life at the restaurants, and yet I cannot think of its hopeless homelessness without rebellion against the whole system it implies, as something unnatural and insufferable.|$|E
60|$|It was {{at least}} an hour later, and he was limping on, {{encouraging}} himself with the expectation of resting in warm repletion beside the snapping fire, when he entered a denser growth of timber. Alton had like most of his kind been taught by necessity to hold the weaknesses of his body in subjection, but he was a man with the instincts of his fellows, and the thought of the steaming kettle, smell of roasting meat, glare of flickering light, and snug blankets appealed to him, and just then he would not have bartered the blackened can of smoke-tasted tea for all the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> of Carnaby. His step grew a little steadier, {{and the sound of the}} river louder, until he stopped suddenly near a prostrate fir. There was a gap in the dusky vault above him through which the moon shone down and called up a sparkle from the thin scattering of snow. Beyond it the dark trunks stretched back, a stupendous colonnade, into the shadow again. There was nothing unusual in all this, but the man had seen something that made him check his breathing and set his lips. He knew he might be mistaken, but the glint he had caught for a moment suggested the barrel of a rifle.|$|E
60|$|This was a {{very large}} tree, indeed, and its {{branches}} extended over the road quite to the opposite side. Right {{at the foot of}} the tree was a clear, cold spring, from which a little brook trickled, and lost itself in the grass. A dipper was fastened to a projecting root above the spring, that thirsty travellers might drink. The road by the side of which the oak stood {{was a very}} public one, for it led to a city twenty miles away. So a great many persons passed the tree, and stopped at the spring to drink. And that was the reason why little Harry and his Grandpa were so fond of going there. It was really quite a lively place. Carriages would bowl along, all glittering with <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass,</b> and with drivers in livery; market wagons would rattle by with geese squawking, ducks quacking, and pigs squealing; horsemen would gallop past on splendid horses; hay wagons would creak slowly by, drawn by great oxen; and, best of all, the stage would dash furiously up, with the horses in a swinging trot, and the driver cracking his whip, and the bright red stage swaying from side to side.|$|E
5000|$|In the Heidelbach glassworks, in {{addition}} to simple everyday <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> high-quality <b>glass</b> work was also carried out.

50|$|It's unknown {{how early}} Emma {{developed}} physical shakes {{that the family}} called her 'palsy', but several first hand accounts describe how her brush would shake {{right up to the}} point where brush met canvas and then, suddenly, smooth strokes would appear. Dinner time was also a slightly unusual experience for visitors as Emma's 'shakes' would cause the table to shake at times, rattling silverware, <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|R
60|$|He did {{not finish}} his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate {{was out of}} earshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room. The {{middle of the room}} was {{occupied}} by two square tables placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes <b>and</b> <b>plates,</b> <b>and</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets. At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Joe," [...] said Mr. Lavender to his {{surprised}} chauffeur, [...] "serve my lunch. Give me a large helping, and a {{glass of}} ale." [...] And, paler than his holland dust-coat, he sat resolutely down on the bole of a beech, with Blink on her haunches beside him. While Joe was filling a plate with pigeon-pie and pouring out a glass of foaming Bass, Mr. Lavender stared at the three Germans and suffered the tortures of the damned. [...] "I will not flinch," [...] he thought; [...] "God helping me, I certainly will not flinch. Nothing shall prevent my going through with it." [...] And his eyes, more prominent than a hunted rabbit's, watched the approach of Joe with the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass.</b> The three men also followed the movements of the chauffeur, and it seemed to Mr. Lavender that their eyes were watering. [...] "Courage!" [...] he murmured to himself, transfixing a succulent morsel with his fork and conveying it to his lips. For fully a minute he revolved the tasty mouthful, which he could not swallow, while the three men's eyes watched him with a sort of lugubrious surprise. [...] "If," [...] he thought with anguish, [...] "if I were a prisoner in Germany! Come, come! One effort, it's only the first mouthful!" [...] and with a superhuman effort, he swallowed. [...] "Look at me!" [...] he cried to the three Germans, [...] "look at me! I--I--I'm going to be sick!" [...] and putting down his plate, he rose and staggered forward. [...] "Joe," [...] he said in a dying voice, [...] "feed these poor men, feed them; make them drink; feed them!" [...] And rushing headlong {{to the edge of the}} grove, he returned what he had swallowed--to the great interest of Brink. Then, waving away the approach of Joe, and consumed with shame and remorse at his lack of heroism, he ran and hid himself in a clump of hazel bushes, trying to slink into the earth. [...] "No," [...] he thought; [...] "no; I am not for public life. I have failed at the first test. Was ever so squeamish an exhibition? I have betrayed my country and the honour of public life. These Germans are now full of beer and pigeon-pie. What am I but a poltroon, unworthy to lace the shoes of the great leaders of my land? The sun has witnessed my disgrace." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Pasmer saw {{well enough}} {{out of the}} corner of her eye the joking that went on between Mavering and his friend, and it did not displease her to think that it {{probably}} referred to Alice. While the young man came hurrying back to them she glanced at the girl standing near her with a keenly critical inspection, from which she was able to exclude all maternal partiality, and justly decided that she was one of the most effective girls in the place. That costume of hers was perfect. Mrs. Pasmer wished now that she could have compared it more carefully with other costumes; she had noticed some very pretty ones; and a feeling of vexation that Alice should have prevented this by being away so long just when the crowd was densest qualified her satisfaction. The people were going very fast now. The line of the oval in the nave was broken into groups of lingering talkers, who were conspicuous to each other, and Mrs. Pasmer felt that she and her daughter were conspicuous to all the rest where they stood apart, with the two Maverings converging upon them from different points, the son nodding and laughing to friends of both sexes as he came, the father wholly absorbed in not spilling the glass of claret punch which he carried in one hand, and not falling down on the slippery floor with the plate of salad which he bore in the other. She had thoughts of feigning unconsciousness; she would have had no scruple in practising this or any other social stratagem, for though she kept a conscience in regard to certain matters--what she considered essentials--she lived a thousand little lies every day, and taught her daughter by precept and example to do the same. You must seem to be looking one way when you were really looking another; you must say this when you meant that; you must act as if you were thinking one thing when you were thinking something quite different; and all to no end, for, as she constantly said, people always know perfectly well what you were about, whichever way you looked or whatever you said, or no matter how well you acted the part of thinking what you did not think. Now, although she seemed not to look, she saw all that has been described at a glance, and at another she saw young Mavering slide easily up to his father and relieve him of the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass,</b> with a laugh as pleasant and a show of teeth as dazzling as he bestowed upon any of the ladies he had passed. She owned to her recondite heart that she liked this in young Mavering, though at the same time she asked herself what motive he really had in being so polite to his father before people. But she had no time to decide; she had only time to pack the question hurriedly away for future consideration, when young Mavering arrived at her elbow, and she turned with a little [...] "Oh!" [...] of surprise so perfectly acted that it gave her the greatest pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|No. If your <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> are beautifully bright, your bell quickly answered, and Thomas ready, neat, and good-humored, {{you are not}} {{to expect}} {{absolute}} truth from him. The very obsequiousness and perfection of his service prevents truth. He may be ever so unwell in mind or body, and he must go through his service--hand the shining plate, replenish the spotless glass, lay the glittering fork--never laugh when you yourself or your guests joke--be profoundly attentive, and yet look utterly impassive--exchange a few hurried curses {{at the door with}} that unseen slavey who ministers without, and with you be perfectly calm and polite. If you are ill, he will come twenty times in an hour to your bell; or leave the girl of his heart--his mother, who is going to America--his dearest friend, who has come to say farewell--his lunch, and his glass of beer just freshly poured out--any or all of these, if the door-bell rings, or the master calls out [...] "THOMAS" [...] from the hall. Do you suppose you can expect absolute candor from a man whom you may order to powder his hair? As between the Rev. Henry Holyshade and his pupil, the idea of entire unreserve is utter bosh; so the truth as between you and Jeames or Thomas, or Mary the housemaid, or Betty the cook, is relative, and not to be demanded on one side or the other. Why, respectful civility is itself a lie, which poor Jeames often has to utter or perform to many a swaggering vulgarian, who should black Jeames's boots, did Jeames wear them and not shoes. There is your little Tom, just ten, ordering the great, large, quiet, orderly young man about--shrieking calls for hot water--bullying Jeames because the boots are not varnished enough, or ordering him to go to the stables, and ask Jenkins why the deuce Tomkins hasn't brought his pony round--or what you will. There is mamma rapping the knuckles of Pincot the lady's-maid, and little Miss scolding Martha, who waits up five pair of stairs in the nursery. Little Miss, Tommy, papa, mamma, you all expect from Martha, from Pincot, from Jenkins, from Jeames, obsequious civility and willing service. My dear, good people, you can't have truth too. Suppose you ask for your newspaper, and Jeames says, [...] "I'm reading it, and jest beg not to be disturbed;" [...] or suppose you ask for a can of water, and he remarks, [...] "You great, big, 'ulking fellar, ain't you big enough to bring it hup yoursulf?" [...] what would your feelings be? Now, if you made similar proposals or requests to Mr. Jones next door, {{this is the kind of}} answer Jones would give you. You get truth habitually from equals only; so my good Mr. Holyshade, don't talk to me about the habitual candor of the young Etonian of high birth, or I have my own opinion of YOUR candor or discernment when you do. No. Tom Bowling is the soul of honor and has been true to Black-eyed Syousan since the last time they parted at Wapping Old Stairs; but do you suppose Tom is perfectly frank, familiar, and aboveboard in his conversation with Admiral Nelson, K.C.B.? There are secrets, prevarications, fibs, if you will, between Tom and the Admiral--between your crew and THEIR captain. I know I hire a worthy, clean, agreeable, and conscientious male or female hypocrite, at so many guineas a year, to do so and so for me. Were he other than hypocrite I would send him about his business. Don't let my displeasure be too fierce with him for a fib or two on his own account.|$|E
