30|$|Voltage sag {{compensation}} {{strategy of}} UPQC {{can be divided}} into three types, namely <b>pre-sag</b> compensation, in-phase compensation, and minimum energy compensation [8, 9, 10, 11]. The <b>pre-sag</b> compensation and in-phase compensation are similar to the compensation strategy of dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), which focus on minimum voltage magnitude and phase angle jump. Compare to minimum energy compensation of DVR, Ref. [12, 13] proposed a minimum VA method of UPQC (UPQC-VAmin), which utilizes non-linear optimum algorithm to calculate the injection angle of the voltage compensation so as to minimize the capacity of sag compensation. In addition, Ref. [14] proposed a voltage sag/swell compensation strategy with simultaneous active and reactive power injection by both converters of UPQC (UPQC-S), which can maximize the capacity utilization of series converter and compensate the load reactive power.|$|E
40|$|The Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is {{a commercially}} available, popular device to {{eliminate}} voltage sags and swells {{in the distribution}} fines. Its basic function is to inject the voltage difference (difference between the <b>pre-sag</b> and sag voltage) to the power line and maintains the <b>pre-sag</b> voltage condition in the load side. Different control strategies are available depending on the compensation technique used for compensation. A new control strategy for the single-phase voltage sags based on in-phase compensation technique is described in this paper. In the designed control, the DVR initially tracks the phase angle of the supply voltage and produce a reference voltage signal with the rated load voltage magnitude. If any phase jump occurred at the supply voltage, phase angle of the reference voltage signal is adjusted slowly to track the phase angle of the supply voltage. The difference between the reference and measured voltage is injected by the DVR. Therefore with this DVR control technique, the load will not experience any phase jump or dip. The simulation was carried out using EMTDC/PSCAD software and the results show a very good level of compensation for different voltage sags...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth in}} the use of sensitive equipments in modern power system requires great emphasis {{on the quality of the}} power. The quality related issues like voltage sags, swells, surges, interruptions and harmonic problems lead to a great economic loss in the power industry and needs urgent actions. To ensure the reliable and stable operation of the power system, Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controllers at transmission level and custom power devices at distribution level are employed. In practice, the Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is a key device for mitigation of power quality phenomena at distribution level. DVR is series connected voltage source converter and is used to inject missing voltage of controllable magnitude and phase angle between the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) and the load. Prime goal of this thesis is to optimize energy storage for series connected compensator. Active power injected by DVR is related to its energy storage so optimization of DVR active power leads to optimization of energy storage. Two types of voltage sag mitigating strategies Energy Optimization Compensation (EOC) and <b>pre-sag</b> considering zero phase angle jumps were studied and results were obtained by using simulation tool PSCAD/EMTDC. Two cases were considered depending upon sag depth for analyzing EOC method. When sag is shallow one, active power injected by DVR is equal to zero which reveals the optimization of energy storage. When sag is deep one, active power injected by DVR is minimum as compared to <b>pre-sag</b> but not zero. Eﬀects of phase angle jump on the power and energy requirements by using EOC method were also studied. DVR energy injection increases having voltage sag of positive phase jumps whereas its energy injection reduces when voltage sag is having negative phase angle jumps...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the DVR {{manufacturing}} cost, we had better expand the range of the DVR compensation as far as possible in a certain energy storage capacity under the restricted condition of maximum output compensation voltage of the device. This paper adopted a fast- detection method in which the single-phase voltage is delayed 60 ºso as to structure the virtual three-phase voltage, and ensured the minimum energy output of DVR based on the phasor diagram of the <b>pre-sag</b> load voltage. The characteristics of the fast response and the high conversion of the super conductor magnetic energy storage (SMES) are made full use of. Finally, through simulating MATLAB, this compensation method is proved to be capable of effectively reducing the active power output of DVR, fast compensating the voltage sag, as well as enlarging the compensation scope of DVR...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Voltage sags are voltage {{reduction}} events, followed by {{restoration of the}} normal supply conditions after a short duration. Induction Motors (IMs) constitute {{a large portion of}} the loads in industrial power systems. The loss of their service in a continuous process plant (like a refinery) may result in a costly shutdown. The basic observed effects of voltage sags on induction motors are speed loss and current and torque transients associated with both {{voltage reduction}} and recovery. This paper will focus on the response of the IMs to various parameters of voltage sags; including magnitude, duration, effect of <b>pre-sag</b> voltage, loading percentage, point on the wave of sag occurrence, source harmonics, and three-phase unbalance. Other objectives of this study are to investigate the motors ride through capability during different types of voltage sags, and to establish guidelines for adjusting the protection relays of the IMs. The industrial electrical distribution system of Alexandria National Refining and Petrochemicals Co. (ANRPC) is taken as a case study to investigate such effects through computer simulations using the MATLAB/SIMULINK toolbox. Validity of the simulations is verified by actual performance.

40|$|Problem statement: Process {{continuity}} of industrial plants (like a refinery) {{is subjected to}} several shutdowns due to voltage sags causing large induction motors to trip, either by undervoltage or by overcurrent relays, sometimes by the mechanical protection. These unplanned shutdowns cost the plant {{tens of thousands of}} dollars per shutdown in addition to material damage costs, restart charges and any penalties due to delay in product delivery and shipping. Approach: The behavior of induction motors during voltage sags was investigated. In addition to the well-known parameters of voltage sags (time and duration), other parameters such as three-phase unbalance, point on the wave of sag occurrence, harmonics, loading percentage and <b>pre-sag</b> voltage were also examined through computer simulations using the MATLAB/SIMULINK toolbox. Motors&# 8217; ride-through capability during sags was also studied and guidelines for adjusting the protection relays of the induction motors were highlighted. Results: Results showed that response of induction motor to voltage sags is dependant on sag characteristics, as well as motor and load parameters. Three-phase voltage sags and sags occurring at zero crossing were the most severe events. Transient currents occurring at the instants of voltage sag and voltage recovery are directly proportional to the voltage drop, not to the remaining voltage magnitude. Transient currents and torques induced at the instant of sag recovery are higher than those induced at the instant of sag occurrence. Lightly-loaded motors and motors operated at voltages higher than the nominal voltage are less affected by voltage sags. Conclusion: Manufacturers of induction motors impose strict protection settings to protect their machines from any possible damage. However, the starting process of the motor inherits starting currents and torques much higher than those occurring during voltage sags. Readjusting of the protection relay settings especially the undervoltage relay may be adequate to counteract voltage sags. No conditioning equipment was required...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactive}} eects {{of length}} and stimulus frequency on {{rise and fall}} times and on sag were investigated in fast-twitch feline caudofemoralis at normal body temperature. The length and stimulus frequency ranges studied were 0. 8 – 1. 2 L 0 and 15 – 60 pps. Isometric rise times were shortest under two sets of conditions: short lengths + low stimulus frequencies and long lengths + high stimulus frequencies. In contrast the isometric fall time relationship showed a single minimum at short lengths + low stimulus frequencies. Velocity was shown to have an additional eect on fall time, but only at higher stimulus frequencies (40 – 60 pps) : fall times were shorter during movement in either direction as compared to isometric. The eects of sag were greatest at shorter lengths and lower stimulus frequencies during isometric stimulus trains. Potential mechanisms underlying this last eect were investigated by comparing isometric twitches elicited prior to and immediately following a sag-inducing stimulus train. Post-sag twitches produced less force, reached peak force earlier and initially decayed more quickly compared to <b>pre-sag</b> twitches. However, the final rate of force decay and the initial rate of force rise (during the first 15 ms) were unaected by sag. We construct a logical argument {{based on these findings}} to hypothesize that the predominant mechanism underlying sag is an increase in the rate of sarcoplasmic calcium ion removal. All of the above findings were used to construct a model of activation dynamics for fast-twitch muscle, which was then extrapolated to slow-twitch muscle. When coupled with a previous model of kinematic dynamics, the complete model produced accurate predictions of the forces actually recorded during experiments in which we applied concurrent dynamic changes in length, velocity and stimulus frequency...|$|E
