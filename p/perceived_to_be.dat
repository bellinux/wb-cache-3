5|$|This is not {{say there}} was no popular concern; by 2005 for example a chorus of US {{executives}} along with trade union and mid-ranking government officials had been speaking out about what they <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unfair trade practices by China.|$|E
5|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} {{amphibian}} populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinction, {{have been noted}} since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{one of the most}} critical threats to global biodiversity. In 2004, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported stating that currently birds, mammals, and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.|$|E

Two years later, a controversy arose when she appeared in an advert promoting a L'Oréal product; it showed Pinto in what was <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a lighter skin tone due to make-up or editing.

5|$|Japan Echo was {{the brainchild}} of Kazutoshi Hasegawa, an {{employee}} at the Overseas Public Relations Division of the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry, who was disturbed by what he <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> misinformation and misunderstandings about Japan printed in the foreign press. Hasegawa recruited Yoshihiko Seki, a social scientist teaching at Tokyo Metropolitan University, to be the first editor of the new journal, which was to be published independently by a new company called Japan Echo Inc. founded in June 1974 by Jiji Press reporter Takeshi Mochida.|$|E
5|$|The Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an {{underground}} rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded {{him with his}} own record label, Shady Records, and he embarked on an extensive touring schedule to promote the album. In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the Vans Warped Tour and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> misogynistic and a negative influence on American youth.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{draws on}} the experiences of twelve probation officers who work under the United States' current get-tough movement within the Criminal Justice System. While researchers have studied the effects of zero tolerance policy from policy makers' and offenders' points of view, the perceptions of probation officers have been essentially unheard. This research illuminates the lived experiences of probation officers and examines what they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective strategies and ineffective barriers within the probation system. Findings from the study reveal that the aspects of probation that POs <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective are more congruent with the treatment model of the past than the get-tough approach that has been implemented {{for the last few}} decades. However, POs will implement a geHough approach when dealing with an offender they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> noncompliant. Therefore, POs base their decision to execute either a treatment approach or punishment approach on situations and conditions, rather than on policy. Moreover, the characteristics of the probation system that POs <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ineffective are direct results of get-tough policy implementation, which creates barriers to successful probation policy implementation regardless of which approach a probation officer uses.

5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Middle Eastern were {{as likely to}} be victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} for their joint {{work on behalf of}} women's suffrage, Stanton and Anthony first joined the temperance movement. Together, they were {{instrumental}} in founding the short-lived Woman's State Temperance Society (1852–1853). During her presidency of the organization, Stanton scandalized many supporters by suggesting that drunkenness be made sufficient cause for divorce. But the relationship between the women's suffrage movement and the temperance movement was hardly accidental. The two movements had common interests, with women's suffrage filling the role of cause and prohibition becoming the effect. Later, in state after state, once women gained the right to vote, they could press for various political measures to reduce drunkenness, <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> largely a problem involving the male sex. Thus, the two movements became frequently allied.|$|E

5|$|At the 3 March 1962 election, Askin led the Coalition {{to another}} defeat to the Labor Party, now under Bob Heffron, {{who had become}} Premier {{following}} Cahill's death in October 1959. Morton retained his seat again with 80.76%. Heffron was Premier until his retirement on 30 April 1964. He was succeeded by Jack Renshaw, whose tenure was <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the last days of}} a party which, after almost {{a quarter of a century}} in government, was tired. At the May 1965 election, Askin led the Coalition to its first ever state electoral victory, gaining eight seats and a swing of 5.6% to achieve a majority of two. Askin became the first Liberal Premier. Morton was re-elected with 82.30%.|$|E
5|$|Diệm deposed head {{of state}} Bảo Đại in a {{fraudulent}} referendum in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam). The VNA thus became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Born into a nominally Buddhist family, Đính had converted to Catholicism {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. The change of religion was widely <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a factor in his rapid promotion above more capable officers. A devout member of the Catholic minority, Diệm dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Governors who had {{previously}} been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor. Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the Bank of Indiana. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.|$|E

When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E
5|$|In a {{referendum}} {{called by the}} National Council, and held {{on the same day}} as {{the second round of the}} presidential election, the electorate voted to overturn a law providing for the nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law. After both election and referendum results were announced, the Prime Minister Janez Janša announced that he might resign, following what he <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a heavy defeat for the Government. The Government later won a vote of confidence in the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible.

This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} and tapu (sacred matters) in the Cook Islands {{was controlled by}} ariki (high chiefs), with typically between three and six per island. Each ariki was a ruler of an ivi or ngati (tribe). Lesser noble ranks in the social hierarchy were the mataiapo and rangatira (minor chiefs). The chief's control, which could neither be gained or lost, was established by his mana (power), which derived from his birth, achievements and status. However, an ariki with declining popularity could be <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lacking in mana, which {{might lead to a}} loss of social control.|$|E
