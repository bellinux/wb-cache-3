2500|$|The {{trend of}} {{competing}} shipping lines building four funnel liners encompassed {{a very short}} time span ranging from the SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse in 1897 to the SS Windsor Castle in 1922. As for the number of funnels in some cases the reason for sporting four was a matter of necessity in other cases it was more symbolic. The Cunard Line record holders Lusitania and Mauretania were both laid out with four boiler rooms with one funnel to each room, other slower ships such as the Olympic, Titanic and Britannic only had three operational funnels. [...] However sporting four funnels represented <b>power,</b> <b>safety</b> and prestige, in keeping with the style and fashion of the early 20th century the White Star Line opted to fit the three Olympic-class ships with 'dummy' fourth funnels in order to rival the two Cunard ships. [...] The ideology of four funnels representing size and power rapidly diminished soon after the First World War, later larger flagships including the SS Imperator, SS Normandie and the RMS Queen Mary all sported three funnels to conserve deck space, later still as shipbuilding became more efficient the RMS Queen Elizabeth, RMS Mauretania and the SS America reduced this further down to two funnels, today's modern cruise ships are mostly built with only a single funnel and many military vessels no longer sport them at all.|$|E

50|$|Historically many {{scientists}} and engineers have made decisions on behalf of potentially affected populations about whether a particular level of risk and uncertainty is acceptable for them. Many nuclear engineers and scientists that have made such decisions, even for good reasons relating to long term energy availability, now consider that doing so without informed consent is wrong, and that nuclear <b>power</b> <b>safety</b> and nuclear technologies should be based fundamentally on morality, rather than purely on technical, economic and business considerations.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the year}} 2011 it became clear, that Masaya Yasui, in 2004 {{director}} of the agency's Nuclear Power Policy Planning Division, had instructed his subordinate in April 2004 to conceal the data. This raised questions, because Masaya Yasui was appointed in 2011 as counselor in charge of reform of nuclear <b>power</b> <b>safety</b> regulations. On top of this Masaya Yasui was also involved with splitting off the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency from the Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry and the re-organization of the NISA to an independent entity in April 2012. The fact that the data were deliberately concealed, obliged the ministry to re-investigate the case and to reconsider to punish the officials involved.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} decade, Nuclear energy {{has become one}} of {{important}} energy. Nuclear power systems become more complex and traditional safety methods are hard to be applied. This paper presents a novel approach for nuclear <b>power</b> plant <b>safety</b> analysis which called Bayesian Networks(BN). The BN model is constructed based on the combination of Failure Mode, Effect Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Trees Analysis(FTA). The probability of the model’s root nodes is estimated by Bayesian estimation method and Monte Carlo simulation. Bidirectional inference and sensitivity analysis of the model is also researched. At last, we use a case study to show the method’s advantages compared with traditional methods in nuclear <b>power</b> plant <b>safety</b> analysis...|$|R
