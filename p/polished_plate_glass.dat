Prior to this invention, mirror plates, made from blown [...] "sheet" [...] glass, had been limited in size. De Nehou's process of rolling molten glass poured on an iron table {{rendered}} the manufacture of very large plates possible. This method of production was adopted by the English in 1773 at Ravenhead.

40|$|Abstract. To {{reduce the}} {{environmental}} impact of abrasive polishing, we have investigated using a compact robot and fixed-abrasive polishing. We look at a five-joint closed-link compact robot with a fine diamond stone on its main axis to <b>polish</b> a <b>glass</b> <b>plate.</b> In this method, we measured the chatter vibration in glass polishing motion due to the low stiffness of the robot arm. Therefore, we estimated a dynamic characteristic of the robot arm by a hammering test and measured the friction coefficient between the <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> and the abrasive stone. From these results, we attempted a novel polishing method to prevent its self-vibration using micro-oscillating pressing force with a voice coil motor. As a result, the proposed method of <b>polishing</b> a <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> with a compact robot and a fine diamond stone was found to be effective...|$|R

6000|$|Who will {{declare the}} merits of Lucia--dead in her spring before {{there was even a}} Hickey's Gazette to chronicle the amusements of Calcutta, and publish, with scurrilous asterisks, the {{liaisons}} of heads of departments? What pot-bellied East Indiaman brought the [...] "virtuous maid" [...] up the river, and did Lucia [...] "make her bargain" [...] as the cant of those times went, on the first, second, or third day after her arrival? Or did she, with the others of the batch, give a spinsters' ball as a last trial--following the custom of the country? No. She was a fair Kentish maiden, sent out, at a cost of five hundred pounds, English money, under the captain's charge, to wed the man of her choice, and he knew Clive well, had had dealings with Omichand, and talked to men who had lived through the terrible night in the Black Hole. He was a rich man, Lucia's battered tomb proves it, and he gave Lucia all that her heart could wish: a green-painted boat to take the air in on the river of evenings. Coffree slave-boys who could play on the French horn, and even a very elegant, neat coach with a genteel rutlan roof ornamented with flowers very highly finished, ten best <b>polished</b> <b>plate</b> <b>glasses,</b> ornamented with a few elegant medallions enriched with mother-o'-pearl, that she might take her drive on the course as befitted a factor's wife. All these things he gave her. And when the convoys came up the river, and the guns thundered, and the servants of the Honourable the East India Company drank to the king's health, be sure that Lucia before all the other ladies in the Fort had her choice of the new stuffs from England and was cordially hated in consequence. Tilly Kettle painted her picture a little before she died, and the hot-blooded young writers did duel with small swords in the fort ditch for the honour of piloting her through a minuet at the Calcutta theatre or the Punch House. But Warren Hastings danced with her instead, and the writers were confounded--every man of them. She was a toast far up the river. And she walked in the evening on the bastions of Fort William, and said, [...] "La! I protest!" [...] It was there that she exchanged congratulations with all her friends on the 20th of October, when those who were alive gathered together to felicitate themselves on having come through another hot season; and the men--even the sober factor saw no wrong here--got most royally and Britishly drunk on Madeira that had twice rounded the Cape. But Lucia fell sick, and the doctor--he who went home after seven years with five lakhs and a half, and a corner of this vast graveyard to his account--said that it was a pukka or putrid fever, and the system required strengthening. So they fed Lucia on hot curries, and mulled wine worked up with spirits and fortified with spices, for nearly a week; {{at the end of which}} time she closed her eyes on the weary river and the Fort for ever, and a gallant, with a turn for belles-lettres, wept openly as men did then and had no shame of it, and composed the verses above set, and thought himself a neat hand at the pen--stap his vitals! But the factor was so grieved that he could write nothing at all--could only spend his money--and he counted his wealth by lakhs--on a sumptuous grave.

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of two {{components}} of the average and fluctuating velocities, and of the local self-diffusion coefficients in a flow of granular material. The experiments were performed in a 1 m-high vertical channel with roughened sidewalls and with <b>polished</b> <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> at the front and the back to create a two-dimensional flow. The particles used were glass spheres with a nominal diameter of 3 mm. The flows were high density and were characterized {{by the presence of}} long-duration frictional contacts between particles. The velocity measurements indicated that the flows consisted of a central uniform regime and a shear regime close to the walls. The fluctuating velocities in the transverse direction increased in magnitude from the centre towards the walls. A similar variation was not observed for the streamwise fluctuations. The self-diffusion coefficients showed a significant dependence on the fluctuating velocities and the shear rate. The velocity fluctuations were highly anistropic with the streamwise components being 2 to 2. 5 times the transverse components. The selfdiffusion coefficients for the streamwise direction were an order-of-magnitude higher than those for the transverse direction. The surface roughness of the particles led to a decrease in the self-diffusion coefficients. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{displacement}} devices using piezoceramic sensors play {{an important}} role in many fields. Soft type piezoelectric materials used for such sensors are more appealing because of their lower coercive field, relatively low modulus of elasticity, high electromechanical coupling factors and piezoelectric strain coefficients. We designed a PZT type material doped with niobium and nickel to increase the strain coefficient and still retaining a high coupling coefficient. The chemical formula was Pb 0. 97 Ba 0. 08 Nb 0. 03 Ni 0. 06 Zr 0. 46 Ti 0. 40 O 3. The main piezoelectric parameters were: d 33 = 680 pm/V, d 31 =- 235 pm/V, kp= 0. 64 and k 31 = 0. 42. A unimorph transducer was made from a thin sheet of such a piezoceramic material, tightly bonded on a thin optically <b>polished</b> <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> and mounted as a cantilever. The performance of this transducer was evaluated by means of a new optical method which makes use of the Moiré deflectometry and provides high precision. The method is rather simply and consists mainly in the following: the Moiré fringes rotate when the bimorph bends under the influence of the electric field and by measuring the rotating angle of the fringes one can easily determine the bimorph curvature and the free end displacement...|$|R
