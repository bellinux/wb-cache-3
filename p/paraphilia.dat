25|$|Ray Blanchard, an American-Canadian sexologist {{known for}} his {{research}} studies on pedophilia, addressed (in his literature review for the DSM-5) the aforementioned objections to the DSM-IV-TR, and proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias. This meant namely a distinction between <b>paraphilia</b> and paraphilic disorder. The latter term is proposed to identify the diagnosable mental disorder which meets Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B can be ascertained but not diagnosed as having a <b>paraphilia.</b> Blanchard {{and a number of}} his colleagues also proposed that hebephilia become a diagnosable mental disorder under the DSM-5 to resolve the physical development overlap between pedophilia and hebephilia by combining the categories under pedophilic disorder, but with specifiers on which age range (or both) is the primary interest. The proposal for hebephilia was rejected by the American Psychiatric Association, but the distinction between <b>paraphilia</b> and paraphilic disorder was implemented.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paraphilias</b> {{within the}} Courtship Disorder {{spectrum}} co-occur {{with each other}} more frequently than with <b>paraphilias</b> outside the courtship disorder spectrum. The courtship disorder model offers an underlying common cause for these <b>paraphilias</b> in men to explain this co-occurrence.|$|R
40|$|We {{outline the}} {{difficulties}} in classifying <b>paraphilias</b> as mental disorder and summarise the changes to this diagnostic category in DSM- 5. We review the research on the epidemiology and aetiology of <b>paraphilias,</b> and provide guidance on assessment and referral options for general psychiatrists when they encounter patients who may meet diagnostic criteria for a paraphilic disorder. Empirical evidence for effective treatments for <b>paraphilias</b> is limited, and specific treatment services are scarce, particularly for individuals presenting with legal <b>paraphilias</b> or those who are committing paraphilic sexual offences but {{who have not been}} convicted...|$|R
40|$|<b>Paraphilias</b> are intense urges or {{behaviors}} involving non-normative sexual interests. The newly approved {{diagnostic criteria}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5) have established that, although <b>paraphilias</b> {{should not be}} regarded as inherently pathological, {{they ought to be}} qualified as paraphilic disorders if resulting in distress, impairment, or harm to the affected individual or others. Recent evidence documents that both phenomena can emerge as relatively uncommon iatrogenic consequences in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. To outline the clinical characteristics of <b>paraphilias</b> and paraphilic disorders in PD patients, we summarized the available evidence on these phenomena. The review encompasses all studies on <b>paraphilias</b> in PD patients identified by a search on the Pubmed and Scopus online databases through May 2014. Twenty-two case reports on a total of 31 PD patients with <b>paraphilias</b> or paraphilic disorders were identified. These phenomena were typically associated with dopaminomimetic treatment (with a mean levodopa-equivalent daily dose of 1, 303 [*]±[*] 823 mg/d) in male patients with motor complications, young age at PD onset, and long disease duration. <b>Paraphilias</b> were highly concomitant with impulse-control disorders or dopamine dysregulation syndrome. Although evidence on <b>paraphilias</b> and paraphilic disorders in PD patients remains anecdotal, available data point to these phenomena as likely sequelae of high-dose dopaminomimetic treatment. Accordingly, the intensity of paraphilic urges is typically attenuated by the reduction of dopaminomimetic doses, sometimes in association with atypical antipsychotics. Failure to recognize paraphilic disorders may significantly impair the relational functioning of the affected PD patients. Practitioners should routinely inquire about <b>paraphilias</b> during their clinical assessment of PD patients...|$|R
25|$|Zoophilia is a <b>paraphilia</b> {{involving}} a sexual fixation on non-human animals. Bestiality is cross-species sexual activity between human and non-human animals. The terms {{are often used}} interchangeably, but some researchers {{make a distinction between}} the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).|$|E
25|$|Zoophilia {{may reflect}} {{childhood}} experimentation, sexual abuse {{or lack of}} other avenues of sexual expression. Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is considered a rare <b>paraphilia,</b> and sufferers often have other paraphilias with which they present. Zoophiles will not usually seek help for their condition, and so do {{not come to the}} attention of psychiatrists for zoophilia itself.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{offenders}} with pedophilia {{are more}} likely to be recommended for civil commitment than non-pedophilic offenders. About half of committed offenders have a diagnosis of pedophilia. Psychiatrist Michael First writes that, since not all people with a <b>paraphilia</b> have difficulty controlling their behavior, the evaluating clinician must present additional evidence of volitional impairment instead of recommending commitment based on pedophilia alone.|$|E
5000|$|Stigmatic-eligibilic <b>paraphilias</b> are desires whose objects [...] "become eligible" [...] to {{be desired}} because of, rather than despite, a stigma which they bear.

50|$|Courtship {{disorder}} is a theoretical construct in sexology {{in which a}} certain set of <b>paraphilias</b> are seen as specific instances of anomalous courtship instincts in men. The specific <b>paraphilias</b> are biastophilia (paraphilic rape), exhibitionism, frotteurism, telephone scatologia, and voyeurism. According to the courtship disorder hypothesis, there is a species-typical courtship process in human males consisting of four phases, and anomalies in different phases result {{in one of these}} paraphilic sexual interests. That is, instead of being independent <b>paraphilias,</b> this theory sees these sexual interests as individual symptoms of a single underlying disorder.|$|R
25|$|Beetz {{described}} {{the phenomenon of}} zoophilia/bestiality as being somewhere between crime, <b>paraphilia</b> and love, although she says that most research {{has been based on}} criminological reports, so the cases have frequently involved violence and psychiatric illness. She says only a few recent studies have taken data from volunteers in the community. As with all volunteer surveys and sexual ones in particular, these studies have a potential for self-selection bias.|$|E
25|$|Pedophilia is termed pedophilic {{disorder}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and the manual defines it as a <b>paraphilia</b> involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause {{the person with}} the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) defines it as a sexual preference for children of prepubertal or early pubertal age.|$|E
25|$|Urolagnia is an {{inclination}} to obtain sexual enjoyment {{by looking at}} or thinking of urine or urination. As a <b>paraphilia,</b> urine may be consumed, or the person may bathe in it. Drinking urine is known as urophagia, though uraphagia refers to the consumption of urine {{regardless of whether the}} context is sexual. Involuntary urination during sexual intercourse is common, but rarely acknowledged. In one survey, 24% of women reported involuntary urination during sexual intercourse; in 66% of sufferers urination occurred on penetration, while in 33% urine leakage was restricted to orgasm.|$|E

50|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy, at times, {{can help}} people with <b>paraphilias</b> develop strategies to avoid acting on their interests. Patients are taught to identify and cope with factors that make acting on their interests more likely, such as stress. It is currently the only form of psychotherapy for <b>paraphilias</b> supported by evidence.|$|R
25|$|Defense experts {{argued that}} Dahmer was insane {{due to his}} necrophilic drive- his {{compulsion}} to have sexual encounters with corpses. Defense expert Dr. Fred Berlin testified that Dahmer was unable to conform his conduct {{at the time that}} he committed the crimes because he was suffering from <b>paraphilia</b> or, more specifically, necrophilia. Dr. Judith Becker, a professor of Psychiatry and Psychology, was the second expert witness for the defense; Becker also diagnosed Dahmer with necrophilia. The final defense expert to testify, forensic psychiatrist Dr. Carl Wahlstrom, diagnosed Dahmer with borderline personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, necrophilia, alcohol dependence, and a psychotic disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{rejected the}} defense's argument that Dahmer was insane. Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick testified that Dahmer {{did not suffer}} from primary necrophilia because he preferred live sexual partners as evidenced by his efforts to create unresistant, submissive sexual partners devoid of rational thought and to whose needs {{he did not have}} to cater. Another prosecution expert to testify, Dr. Fred Fosdel, testified to his belief that Dahmer was without mental disease or defect at the time he committed the murders. He described Dahmer as a calculating and cunning individual, able to differentiate between right and wrong, with the ability to control his actions. Although Fosdel did state his belief that Dahmer suffered from <b>paraphilia,</b> his conclusion was that Dahmer was not a sadist.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{activity}} {{can be classified}} into the gender and sexual orientation of the participants, {{as well as by}} the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, intimate partners, casual sex partners or anonymous. Sexual {{activity can}} be regarded as conventional or as alternative, involving, for example, fetishism, <b>paraphilia,</b> or BDSM activities. Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, armpits or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include erotic asphyxiation and self-bondage. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes (choking and bondage, respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.|$|E
50|$|The {{source of}} the arousal in these <b>paraphilias</b> is the victim's terrified {{resistance}} to the assault, and in this respect it {{is considered to be}} a form of sexual sadism. Biastophilia is accepted as potentially lethal, other such <b>paraphilias</b> including, but not being limited to asphyxiophilia, autassassinophilia, hybristophilia, and chremastistophilia.|$|R
5000|$|The DSM-IV (1994) {{retained}} the sexual disorders classification for <b>paraphilias,</b> but added an even broader category, [...] "sexual and gender identity disorders," [...] which includes them. The DSM-IV {{retained the}} same types of <b>paraphilias</b> listed in DSM-III-R, including the NOS examples, but introduced some changes to the definitions of some specific types.|$|R

25|$|Many {{people in}} Western culture, {{both male and}} female, {{consider}} breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic and {{an important aspect of}} femininity and many women use décolletage that exposes cleavage as part of their physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention. During adolescence, some girls become obsessed with breast shape and cleavage. In South Africa, Wonderbra sponsors a National Cleavage Day during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage. The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage has been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism, and atypical <b>paraphilia.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{his trial}} for murder, defence {{witnesses}} provided evidence that Luka Magnotta {{had been diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia as a teenager. Defence expert Dr. Joel Watts testified that Magnotta showed signs of episodic schizophrenia (undifferentiated type), histrionic personality disorder, borderline personality traits and <b>paraphilia</b> not otherwise specified. The prosecution revealed that Magnotta had been using illegal drugs during his teenage years which led to symptoms that mimicked schizophrenia and that Magnotta has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder by Crown expert Dr. Joel Paris at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal in April 2012. Dr. Renée Roy, the forensic psychiatrist who has been treating Magnotta at Rivières-des-Prairies Detention Centre since November 2012, through his preliminary hearing and right up to the murder trial, diagnosed Magnotta with borderline personality disorder with histrionic features. Dr. Gilles Chamberland, another Crown expert who was not able to interview Magnotta, diagnosed Magnotta with anti-social, histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder. A number of psychiatrists over the years noted that Magnotta displayed antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic traits. The prosecution accused Magnotta of pretending to be schizophrenic since his defence pleaded diminished responsibility due to alleged schizophrenia.|$|E
500|$|Concurrent with Bogaert's {{suggestion}} that understanding asexuality {{will lead to}} a better understanding of sexuality overall, he discusses the topic of asexual masturbation to theorize on asexuals and [...] "'target-oriented' <b>paraphilia,</b> in which there is an inversion, reversal, or disconnection between the self and the typical target/object of sexual interest/attraction" [...] (such as attraction to oneself, labelled [...] "automonosexualism").|$|E
50|$|Some <b>paraphilias</b> may {{interfere}} with the capacity for sexual activity with consenting adult partners.|$|R
5000|$|The DSM-IV-TR also {{acknowledges}} that the diagnosis and classification of <b>paraphilias</b> across cultures or religions [...] "is {{complicated by the fact}} that what is considered deviant in one cultural setting may be more acceptable in another setting”. Some argue that cultural relativism is important to consider when discussing <b>paraphilias,</b> because there is wide variance concerning what is sexually acceptable across cultures.|$|R
40|$|The {{compulsive}} behaviors seen {{in sexual}} <b>paraphilias</b> {{may be related}} to those of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Based primarily upon case reports as well as studies indicating the effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatm ent of sexual paraph ilias, it has been speculated that sexual <b>paraphilias</b> lie within the obsessive-com pulsive spectrum. There have been no reports of the use of paroxetine in the treatment of sexual paraph ilias. This is a report of two patients, the first a voyeur and the second an exhibitionist, bo th of whom respon ded to treatm ent with paroxetin e.

500|$|Troy McClure is a stereotypical Hollywood has-been. He {{was a star}} in {{the early}} 1970s, but his career went {{downhill}} due to rumors of a <b>paraphilia</b> involving fish. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often presents educational videos and infomercials. McClure introduces himself by saying, [...] "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [...] as...," [...] mentioning two titles that are similar to his current performance.
