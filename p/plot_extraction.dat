40|$|Complex {{planting}} schemes {{are common}} in experimental crop fields and can {{make it difficult to}} extract plots of interest from high-resolution imagery of the fields gathered by Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). This prevents UAS imagery from being applied in High-Throughput Precision Phenotyping and other areas of agricultural research. If the imagery is accurately geo-registered, then {{it may be possible to}} extract plots from the imagery based on their map coordinates. To test this approach, a UAS was used to acquire visual imagery of 5 ha of soybean fields containing 6. 0 m 2 plots in a complex planting scheme. Sixteen artificial targets were setup in the fields before flights and different spatial configurations of 0 to 6 targets were used as Ground Control Points (GCPs) for geo-registration, resulting in a total of 175 geo-registered image mosaics with a broad range of geo-registration accuracies. Geo-registration accuracy was quantified based on the horizontal Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of targets used as checkpoints. Twenty test plots were extracted from the geo-registered imagery. <b>Plot</b> <b>extraction</b> accuracy was quantified based on the percentage of the desired plot area that was extracted.

50|$|The low-flow-rate {{method is}} {{based on the fact that}} the {{extraction}} efficiency is dependent on the flow-rate. At high flow-rates, the amount of drug diffusing from the sampling site into the dialysate per unit time is smaller (low extraction efficiency) than at lower flow-rates (high extraction efficiency). At a flow-rate of zero, a total equilibrium between these two sites is established (Cout = Csample). This concept is applied for the (low-)flow-rate method, where the probe is perfused with blank perfusate at different flow-rates. Concentration at the sampling site can be determined by <b>plotting</b> the <b>extraction</b> ratios against the corresponding flow-rates and extrapolating to zero-flow.

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that a wind turbine {{has a large}} radar cross-section (RCS) and, due to {{the movement of the}} blades, the wind turbine will generate a Doppler frequency shift. This scattering behavior may cause severe interferences on existing radar systems including static ground-based radars and spaceborne or airborne radars. To resolve this problem, efficient techniques or algorithms should be developed to mitigate the effects of wind farms on radars. Herein, one transponder-based mitigation technique is presented. The transponder is not a new concept, which has been proposed for calibrating high-resolution imaging radars. It modulates the radar signal in a manner that the retransmitted signals can be separated from the scene echoes. As wind farms often occupy only a small area, mitigation processing in the whole radar operation will be redundant and cost inefficient. Hence, this paper uses a transponder to determine whether the radar is impacted by the wind farms. If so, the effects of wind farms are then mitigated with subsequent Kalman filtering or <b>plot</b> target <b>extraction</b> algorithms.

The correlation analysis of the mathematical-regression model indicated that a quadratic polynomial model could be employed to optimize the high pressure extraction of compounds. Only the models developed for total antioxidant activity by DPPH · and for total flavonoids presented coefficient determinations lower than 0. 95.

Our electrostatic analyses characterize the electric field distribution inside the device structure when the ratio of dielectric thickness Tox to Lch (Tox /Lch) ranges from 0. 2 to 50. The molecular channel contains self-assembled monolayer (SAM). These molecules are modeled as rigid dielectric material with relative permittivity of 2 (ref. 2) or 6. 3 (ref. 3).

40|$|Two {{mechanisms}} of conduction were identified from temperature dependent (120 K - 340 K) DC electrical resistivity measurements of composites of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Activation of variable range hopping (VRH) occurred at lower temperatures {{than that for}} temperature fluctuation induced tunneling (TFIT). Experimental data was in good agreement with the VRH model {{in contrast to the}} TFIT model, where broadening of tunnel junctions and increasing electrical resistivity at T > Tg is a consequence of a large difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of PCL and MWCNTs. A numerical model was developed to explain this behavior accounting for a thermal expansion effect by supposing the large increase in electrical resistivity corresponds to the larger relative deformation due to thermal expansion associated with disintegration of the conductive MWCNT network. MWCNTs had a significant nucleating effect on PCL resulting in increased PCL crystallinity and an electrically insulating layer between MWCNTs.

Key findings While the Km of 4 NP was not changed, the Vmax and Eh were reduced at low temperatures. The plasma concentrations of 4 NP after its i. v. administration to rats were significantly increased at 28 °C.

The youngest Ar-Ar age, approx. 162 - 165 Myr is observed at approx. 28 - 40 % Ar- 39 release, which we attribute primarily to the mesostasis.

Differences between actual tree locations and LiDAR-derived tree locations using FUSION, TreeVaW, and watershed segmentation were 2. 05 m (SD 1. 67), 2. 19 m (SD 1. 83), and 2. 31 m (SD 1. 94), respectively, in forested plots. Tree height differences from field measured heights for FUSION, TreeVaW, and watershed segmentation were − 0. 09 m (SD 2. 43), 0. 28 m (SD 1. 86), and 0. 22 m (2. 45) in forested plots; and 0. 56 m (SD 1. 07 m), 0. 28 m (SD 1. 69 m), and 1. 17 m (SD 0. 68 m), respectively, in a plot containing young conifers. The TAGB comparisons included feature totals per plot, mean biomass per feature by plot, and total biomass by <b>plot</b> for each <b>extraction</b> method. Overall, LiDAR TAGB estimations resulted in FUSION and TreeVaW underestimating by 25 and 31 % respectively, and watershed segmentation overestimating by approximately 10 %. LiDAR TAGB underestimation occurred in 66 % and overestimation occurred in 34 % of the plot comparisons...|$|R
40|$|Earthworms {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} soil macrofaunal groups, and they play a major role in agricultural ecosystems. Agricultural practices, such as reduced tillage, the use of green manures and organic fertilization, can be beneficial for earthworm populations in agricultural systems. However, under a Mediterranean climate, not much is known regarding their response to agricultural management. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of tillage type, organic fertilization, and green manures on the density and biomass of earthworms in organic arable dryland. The trial was conducted in a four-year crop rotation with a complete factorial design that combined tillage system (mouldboard ploughing vs. chisel), fertilization (composted farmyard manure vs. no fertilizer) and green manures (green manures vs. no green manures). Earthworms were assessed in each <b>plot</b> by the <b>extraction</b> of all individuals in three soil areas of 33 cm× 33 cm that were excavated to a depth of 25 cm. Only five earthworm species were found in this trial, and the earthworm community was dominated by such endogeic ecotypes as Aporrectodea rosea and Allolobophora georgii, and the anecic ecotype Aporrectodea trapezoides. Endogeic species can benefit from soil inversion because of the incorporation of organic matter, but the anecic ones can be negatively affected by it. The results show that plots with farmyard manure had higher density and biomass of earthworms. We observed that the type of tillage significantly affected earthworm populations: plots that had been ploughed with mouldboard ploughing (soil inversion) the year prior to sampling presented more juveniles. The biomass of earthworms was significantly lower in plots with green manures and chiselling. Our results indicated that the combination of chiselling and green manures were not optimal for earthworm populations, but organic fertilization played a considerably more important role and enhanced their abundances...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Recently {{concerns}} over anthropogenic carbon pollution have received increased global attention {{and research in}} forest biomass and carbon sequestration has gained momentum. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing has {{in the last decade}} demonstrated forest measurement and biomass estimation potential. The project objective was to compare LiDAR forest biomass estimates to traditional field biomass estimates in a conifer predominant forest located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Chapter 2 of this dissertation investigated mapping-grade GPS accuracy in determining tree locations. Results indicated that post processing of coded pseudorange satellite signals is the most accurate of those we tested for GPS surveying under a conifer dominant forest canopy. Chapter 3 compared LiDAR, total station, and GPS receiver discrete point elevations and DEMs across a range of forest settings. Average total station plot elevation differences ranged from - 0. 06 m (SD 0. 40) to - 0. 59 m (SD 0. 23) indicating that LiDAR elevations are higher than actual elevations. Average plot GPS elevation differences ranged from 0. 24 (SD 1. 55) to 2. 82 m (SD 4. 58), and from 0. 27 (SD 2. 33) to 2. 69 m (SD 5. 06) for LiDAR DEMs. Chapter 4 assessed LiDAR’s ability to measure three-dimensional forest structure and estimate biomass using single stem (trees and shrubs) remote sensing. The LiDAR data tree extraction computer software programs FUSION, TreeVaW, and watershed segmentation were compared. LiDAR spatial accuracy assessment resulted in overall average error and standard deviation (SD) for FUSION, TreeVaW, and watershed segmentation of 2. 05 m (SD 1. 67 m), 2. 19 m (SD 1. 83 m), and 2. 31 m (SD 1. 94 m) respectively. Overall average LiDAR tree height error and standard deviations (SD) respectively for FUSION, TreeVaW and watershed segmentation were - 0. 09 m (SD 2. 43 m), 0. 28 m (SD 1. 86 m), and 0. 22 m (2. 45 m) in even-age, uneven-age, and old growth plots combined; and for one clearcut plot 0. 56 m (SD 1. 07 m), 0. 28 m (SD 1. 69 m), and 1. 17 m (SD 0. 68 m), respectively. Biomass comparisons included feature totals per plot, mean biomass per feature by plot, and total biomass by <b>plot</b> for each <b>extraction</b> method. Overall LiDAR biomass estimations resulted in FUSION and TreeVaW underestimating by 25 and 31...|$|R
40|$|Essential oils are {{composed}} {{of a wide range}} of bioactive chemical compounds. They traditionally found application as flavour, fragrances and medicinal aroma. Today, the essential oils are sought-after for innumerable applications starting from markers for plant identifications to base for semi-synthesis of highly complex molecules. The extraction of highly delicate essential oils from plants remains a crucial step in all these applications. By using microwaves to mediate the extraction, it is possible to maintain mild conditions and effect superior extraction. However, apart from laboratory trials, essential oil extraction using microwave energy is largely an unexplored area. In the current work, an integrated procedure for microwave extraction followed by volatiles sampling and analysis from selected botanical raw materials (viz. black pepper, Piper nigrum and coriander Coriandrum sativum) was developed. There are two problems to overcome in the extraction from solid plant materials: that of releasing the essential oil from solid matrix and letting it diffuse out successfully in a manner that can be scaled-up to industrial volumes. Towards this end, an innovative volatiles extraction unit was conceived, designed and developed that used thin layer, for microwave exposure and rotational mixing, to mitigate the effects of thermal gradient and non-uniform exposure of bulk matter. The effect of varying the microwave field on the essential oils extracted was studied. The microwave field that coupled in the region of extraction was estimated from temperature rise measurement using the microwave power equation (with water as reference dielectric). The essential oil extracted under different microwave fields were compared using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and data analysis with SAS statistical software. The microwave field at the site of extraction was sensed by symmetrical placement of biomaterial sample and a reference, in a rotational extractor, such that they both couple the same field during tumbling motion. By measuring the temperature rise in the reference accurately, it is possible to estimate the microwave field present at that position. The rotational extractor has a second degree of freedom, in that it can slide along the axel taking discrete positions. Each position leads to a different microwave exposure of the sample. It is possible to measure the relative variation of microwave field using temperature rise data at each position. It was found that, at position labeled R 4, located at 65. 6 mm from the right extreme of the microwave cavity had the highest effective microwave field strength of value 92. 7 V/m. The volatiles released from the biomaterials, black pepper and coriander, were sampled using solid phase micro extraction and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The highest peaks representing beta-caryophyllene in black pepper and linalool in coriander were identified using mass spectrometric peak matching using NIST library. The extract (in terms of ion count) for each microwave parameter (such as field, water content level and solvent type) was plotted as a trend graph. The current experiment successfully tested the procedure for following the microwave process in the extraction of sensitive spice volatiles (from black pepper and coriander). With the microwave field measured at the region of extraction, it was possible to <b>plot</b> pepper <b>extraction</b> versus the microwave field to which the pepper sample was exposed. The extraction was represented in terms of cumulative value of ion counts obtained in GC-MS analysis. This unique procedure developed in the current research allows for the graphical comparison of the microwave extractions. It was found that black pepper has a better response to microwave extraction than coriander. The pepper extraction was found to increase proportionately with increase in microwave field strength. The extraction was also enhanced proportionately by the incremental addition of water content at constant microwave field...|$|R
