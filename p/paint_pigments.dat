5|$|Solid ionic {{compounds}} {{have long}} been used as <b>paint</b> <b>pigments,</b> and are resistant to organic solvents, but are sensitive to acidity or basicity. Since 1801 pyrotechnicians have described and widely used metal-containing ionic compounds as sources of colour in fireworks. Under intense heat, the electrons in the metal ions or small molecules can be excited. These electrons later return to lower energy states, and release light with a colour spectrum characteristic of the species present.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} <b>paint</b> <b>pigments</b> were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, iron oxides, hematite, limonite, gypsum, and azurite. Twined sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W. Postlethwaite, who had for three seasons directed Hewett's excavation of Chetro Ketl's great kiva, oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the University of New Mexico and the School of American Research.|$|E

5000|$|Realgar was, {{along with}} orpiment, a {{significant}} item of {{trade in the}} ancient Roman Empire and {{was used as a}} red <b>paint</b> <b>pigment.</b> Early occurrences of realgar as a red <b>painting</b> <b>pigment</b> are known for works of art from China, India, Central Asia, and Egypt. It was used in European fine-art painting during the Renaissance era, a use which died out by the 18th century. [...] It was also used as medicine.|$|R

5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in <b>paint</b> <b>pigments,</b> with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|The French book, Le Buste de Nefertiti– une Imposture de l'Egyptologie? (The Bust of Nefertiti– a Fraud in Egyptology?) by Swiss art {{historian}} Henri Stierlin {{and the book}} Missing Link in Archaeology by Berlin author and historian Erdogan Ercivan both claimed that the Nefertiti bust was a modern fake. Stierlin claims that Borchardt may have created the bust to test ancient pigments and that when the bust was admired by Prince Johann Georg of Saxony, Borchardt pretended it was genuine to avoid offending the prince. Stierlin argues that the missing left eye of the bust {{would have been a}} sign of disrespect in ancient Egypt, that no scientific records of the bust appear until 11 years after its supposed discovery, and while the <b>paint</b> <b>pigments</b> are ancient, the inner limestone core has never been dated. Ercivan suggests Borchardt's wife was the model for the bust, and both authors argue that it was not revealed to the public until 1924 because it was a fake. Another theory suggested that the existing Nefertiti bust was crafted in the 1930s on Hitler's orders, and that the original was lost in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Untitled 1950, {{which the}} New York-based Knoedler Gallery had sold in 2007 for $17 million to Pierre Lagrange, a London hedge-fund multimillionaire, {{was subject to}} an {{authenticity}} suit before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Done in the painter’s classic drip-and-splash style and signed “J. Pollock”, the modest-sized painting (15 by 281 1/2 in) was found to contain yellow <b>paint</b> <b>pigments</b> not commercially available until about 1970. The suit was settled in a confidential agreement in 2012.|$|E

25|$|Once {{deadwood}} {{has been}} shaped to the designer's plan, the exposed area is treated with a bleaching preservative. The most common is a horticultural combination of lime and sulfur, available from many garden outlets. The preservative protects the wood from rot and pest infestation, and provides a uniform bleaching that resembles weathered, aged wood. If the lime-sulfur mixture used, it is usually colored {{with a small amount}} of dark paint to make it look more natural. Without <b>paint</b> <b>pigments,</b> the lime-sulfur solution bleaches wood to a bone-white color that takes time to weather and become natural-looking.|$|E
25|$|Pro-authenticity {{journals}} {{have declared}} this hypothesis to be unsound, stating that X-ray fluorescence examination, {{as well as}} infrared thermography, did not reveal any pigment. It was also found that 25 different solvents, among them water, do not reduce or sponge out the image. The Shroud Center of Colorado argues that <b>paint</b> <b>pigments</b> came from painted copies that were overlaid by artists during the Middle Ages in order to validate them as accurate copies of the Shroud. The non-paint origin has been further examined by Fourier transform of the image: common paintings show a directionality that is absent from the Turin Shroud. However, analyzing fragments of the shroud brought to the US, McCrone and others observed the presence of pigments, of types commonly used in medieval paints, on the shroud.|$|E
