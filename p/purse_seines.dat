5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in <b>purse</b> <b>seines</b> and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, the short-tail {{stingray}} {{is caught}} incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> longlines and set lines, and drag and set nets. It is also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), spears, and harpoons. Most individuals caught are released alive; often fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice {{does not seem}} to have a significant impact on the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a small number are also kept for display in public aquariums, and it has reproduced in captivity. As it survives fishing activities well and remains common throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as Least Concern. Within most of this species' range off New Zealand, targeting it commercially is prohibited.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{selective}} properties of gillnet fishing, alternative methods of harvest {{are currently being}} studied. Recent WDF reports suggest that purse seine is the most productive method with having highest catch per unit effort (CPUE), but has little information {{on the effectiveness of}} selectively harvesting hatchery-reared salmon. More conclusive research has been conducted jointly between the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and Bonneville Power Administration on a 10-year study on selective harvest methods of hatchery origin salmon in the Upper Columbia River by purse seine and tangle net. Their 2009 and 2010 findings show that <b>purse</b> <b>seines</b> have a higher percentage of survivability and higher CPUE than does tangle nets. A Colville Tribe biologist reports that during these two years the tribe harvested 3,163 hatchery Chinook while releasing 2,346 wild Chinook with only 1.4% direct or immediate mortality using <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> whereas the tangle net was far less productive but had an approximate 12.5% mortality. Researchers commented that the use of recovery boxes and shortened periods between checking the nets would have likely decreased mortality rates. While there is data that shows success of selective methods of harvest at protecting wild and ESA listed salmon, there still must be social acceptance of new methods of fishing.|$|E
25|$|Mobile oceanic {{species such}} as tuna can be {{captured}} by travelling long distances in large fishing vessels. A simpler alternative is to leverage off the fascination fish have with floating objects. When fishermen use such objects, they are called fish aggregating devices (FADs). FADs are anchored rafts or objects of any type, floating on the surface or just below it. Fishermen in the Pacific and Indian oceans set up floating FADs, assembled from all sorts of debris, around tropical islands, and then use <b>purse</b> <b>seines</b> to capture the fish attracted to them.|$|E
25|$|While gillweed nets are a {{principal}} concern, {{other types of}} nets also pose a problem: trawl nets, <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> beach seines, longline gear, and driftnets. Driftnets are known for high rates of bycatch and they affect all cetaceans and other marine species. They are fatal for small toothed whales (Odontocetes) and sperm whales, {{as well as other}} marine mammals and fish such as sharks, sea birds and sea turtles. Many fisheries routinely use driftnets exceeding the EU size limit of 2.5km/boat. This illegal drift-netting is a major issue, especially in important feeding and breeding grounds for cetaceans.|$|E

25|$|The {{blue runner}} {{is a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout parts of its range. Due to its abundance, it {{may be one of}} the primary species in a fishery. The availability of fisheries statistics for the species is variable throughout its range, with the Americas having separate statistics kept for the species, while in Africa and Europe it is lumped in with other carangids in statistics. In the Americas, recent catch data suggests an increased amount of the species is being taken (or reported), with the 2006 and 2007 catch averaging between 6000 and 7000 tonnes, while during the 1980s and 1990s, there was rarely an annual catch greater than 1000 tonnes. Research on the fisheries of local regions has shown how important the fish is to certain fisheries. Artisanal fisheries in Santa Catarina Island have shown blue runner to be third most important and abundant species, making up 5.6% of landings, or 4.38 tonnes. Even subsistence fisheries at the edge of its range in Brazil show a catch of 388kg in two years from beach seines. Throughout its range the blue runner is commercially taken by haul seines, lampara nets, <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> gill nets, and hook and line methods. The fish is sold at market either fresh, dried, smoked or as fishmeal, oil or bait.|$|E
25|$|The {{false scad}} is of major {{importance}} to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with fisheries off Morocco, Senegal {{and in the}} Mediterranean taking the highest numbers of fish. They are fished for primarily with trawls, <b>purse</b> <b>seines</b> and gill nets; although juveniles occasionally turn up inshore nets such as beach seines. The species {{is part of a}} number of fish that live a similar semi-pelagic lifestyle that make up what {{is often referred to as}} a 'small pelagics fishery'. Some of these are the similar Trachurus species, and due to these also being present in the catch, Caranx rhonchus is often not differentiated, leading to lower than accurate catch statistics. Furthermore, vendors are known to fraudulently market C. rhonchus as 'horse mackerel', which is strictly applied to members of Trachurus. To counter this, there has been research into determining fish species later in the marketing process by means of DNA analysis, a technique which has yielded strong results. FAO catch statistics indicate a current annual catch of between 1500 and 3700 tonnes per year from both Africa and Europe between 2002 and 2007. Older catch data indicates much more was taken between 1979 and 1992, with these years having catches between 4000 and 19000 tonnes. The species is sold fresh, frozen, smoked, salted, dried and is used for fish meal and oil.|$|E

25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} is an {{important}} species for commercial and subsistence fisheries throughout its range. Between 1990 and 2010 the FAO reported worldwide catch has ranged between 113,000 and 195,000 t, with a consistent trend towards higher catches. These statistics only include Indonesia, Malaysia and the UAE, suggesting true catch sizes to be higher. Of the countries that report catches to the FAO, Indonesia takes the highest amount, with between 129,000 t and 180,000 t reported each year between 2000 and 2010. Locally yellowstripe scad make up {{a high percentage of}} the catch; in an Indian example, it accounted for up to 36% of total landings in one survey. However, in India overall, yellowstripe scad makes up only 1.5% of total carangid catches. The species is predominantly taken in trawls, however is also caught by gill net, bag net, <b>purse</b> <b>seines</b> or ring nets, and push nets. The species is most abundant during spawning periods in India and consists of 8–13cm individuals. A study on the population dynamics in an Indian fishery during 1994 found there was low fishing pressure on the stocks, however a later assessment found stocks elsewhere in India to be overexploited. The novel use of hydroacoustic sounding to estimate the school size of yellowstripe scad, as well as other scad species, has been trialled with varying levels of effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The {{crevalle jack}} {{is a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with the greatest quantity of the species taken from the eastern Atlantic. In some fisheries, {{it is one of}} the most abundant species and therefore of great importance in these regions. In the Americas, the reported annual catch has ranged between 150 and 1300 tonnes since 1950, with catches since 2000 ranging between 190 and 380 tonnes. Most of the western Atlantic catch is from Florida, although Caribbean fisheries, such as Trinidad, take considerable quantities of the fish. The eastern Atlantic catch statistics do not differentiate longfin crevalle jack from crevalle jack, thus must be considered a composite dataset. This region only comprises catch data from Angola, Ghana, São Tome, and Principe. These catches are much larger than in the east, with hauls of between 1000 and 38 000 tonnes per year recorded since 1950, although catches since 2000 only range between 1900 and 10 200 tonnes. Crevalle jack is taken by a number of fishing methods, including haul seines, gill nets, <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> trawls, handlines and trolling lines. The abundance of the species in Trinidad leads to the fish being taken in several quite different types of fishery; demersal trawls, artisanal gill nets and even beach seines, which illustrates the species' importance. In Trinidad, recreational fishermen also may sell their catch, which adds to the overall quantity of fish sold. Crevalle jack is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil.|$|E
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is of major {{importance}} to commercial fisheries {{in the central}} Indo-Pacific region (including India), and of moderate to minor importance elsewhere. Statistics recorded by the FAO do not include India, however even without this country the annual take of torpedo scad has increased from 70 000 t in 1997 to 107 000 t in 2007. On {{the basis of these}} statistics, the biggest utiliser of the species is Indonesia, with a take of 42 000 t followed by Malaysia with a take of 22 000 t. Thailand and the Philippines also take large quantities of the fish, with around 18 000 t each annually. Middle Eastern countries also record this species in their hauls, but at lower amounts of between 50 and 5000 t. In more southerly regions such as South Africa, it is a rare catch, usually appearing in beach seines. The species is taken by a variety of netting methods such as beach seines, trawls, <b>purse</b> <b>seines</b> and other types of trap including hook and line. It is usually marketed fresh, dried or salted. Torpedo scad are often caught by recreational fishermen throughout their range, however are not considered a target for gamefishing. They readily take small lures and are good sport on light tackle. Torpedo scad are said to have fair to good quality flesh, however are not very popular. Some chefs recommend frying or steaming the fish, although grilling is also acceptable. In polluted waters it has been demonstrated the fish contain higher than acceptable levels of heavy metals, and should be avoided in such regions. Torpedo scad are often used as live baits for larger gamefish.|$|E

This paper attempts to present the current condition of small pelagic fishery in the Makassar Strait. Catch and effort (trip) data between 2004 and 2011 from the three landing sites were used to estimate Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) using Schaefer & Fox models. The results showed a decreasing trend in the catch rate, from 30. 83 tons/trip in 2004 to 12. 27 tons/trip in 2011. The estimated MSY is at the range of 34, 705 - 37, 930 tons with optimum efforts for 2, 234 - 2, 500 <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> trips. Thus the level of <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> fishing effort in 2011, i. e. 3, 078 trips, was exceeding the optimum effort. The decreasing trend in the catch rate may indicate overfishing is occurring between 2004 and 2011.

40|$|Catch {{regulation}} by slipping {{whole or}} parts of the catch has traditionally been used in NE-Atlantic <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> fisheries for pelagic species if the catches are considered too big or the quality or size of the fish is considered unsatisfactory.

No information is, however, available on the survival rate of herring that is slipped from the <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> or how significant this mortality is in relation to total fishing mortality. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify mortality of herring crowded to different degrees in the <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> and subsequently slipped. Large-scale open-sea survival experiments were carried out in the North Sea in 2008 and in 2009.

500|$|The {{meat and}} {{cartilage}} of the pelagic stingray are sometimes utilized, {{for example in}} Indonesia, {{but for the most}} part this species is considered worthless and discarded when caught. Susceptible to longlines, gillnets, <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> and bottom trawls, it is captured incidentally in large numbers throughout its range. Rays caught on longlines suffer high mortality, as fishers are wary of being stung and remove the rays from the hooks by smashing them against the side of the boat, causing severe damage to the mouth and jaws. The extent of this bycatch has yet to be quantified. Regardless, surveys in the Pacific suggest that pelagic stingray numbers have increased since the 1950s, possibly due to commercial fisheries depleting the dominant predators in the ecosystem, such as sharks and tuna. The lack of population declines, coupled with its wide distribution and high reproductive rate, has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list this species under Least Concern. Recent research has been conducted into reducing pelagic stingray bycatch on longlines by switching to larger and/or [...] "C"-shaped hooks.|$|E
