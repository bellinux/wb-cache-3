However, Gibbons and Murphy (1992) note that when CEOs {{are far from}} retirement, they have career concerns.

Testing this proposition, we find that abnormal returns are negatively related to the percentage of performance-based pay of newly hired CEOs when companies announce CEO successions. Since these newly hired CEOs are likely some distance from retirement, we interpret these results as being consistent with Gibbons and Murphy; it may be better to allow newly hired CEOs to be <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> human <b>capital</b> increases from the managerial labor market than to have their current pay too closely related to performance.
