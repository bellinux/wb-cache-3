5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest}} of the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1950 season, Linde signed a new {{contract}} with the Indians, but was released in February and sent to the Portland Beavers in the PCL. Over the course of the season, Linde won 5 games and lost 13 in 47 appearances, 18 of them starts, and amassed an ERA of 4.66. The following year, in 1951, Linde became a regular starter on the team, and before the end of April he had won as many games as he had won all of last year. He finished the season with a 12–12 record and a 4.29 ERA in 32 starts. In 1952, Linde remained part of the core starting rotation of the <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> years alongside Red Adams and Marino Pieretti. His performances included one against the Angels in which Linde kept the team to five hits as the Beavers won 4–3 in 11 innings. He won 11 games, lost 15, threw 119 strikeouts, and brought his ERA down to 3.10 in 41 season appearances, 28 of them starts. In 1953, Linde started the season strong unlike his fellow pitchers, opening his season with a 2–1 victory against the Angels on April 3. In early May, he ended Ted Beard's streak of hitting safely in 12 straight at-bats, which tied the PCL record at the time. Shortly afterward, Linde won what was considered an odd performance as he allowed 15 hits and 20 runners on base, yet won a game against the Sacramento Solons 8–3. In his final professional season, Linde pitched in 36 games and finished with a 13–10 record and a 3.36 ERA.|$|E

30|$|In this context, {{national}} governments {{can influence the}} distribution of earnings. This could {{take the form of}} enhanced minimum wage legislation, to tackle the problem of “in work poverty”. It could be a lighter touch exercise of moral suasion, as in some incomes policies in the <b>past,</b> <b>coupled</b> with publicity concerning the extent of pay differentials. In between, in degree of intervention, would be the use of government purchasing power to insist on fair pay practices by private contractors, coupled with the active use of shareholdings in companies part or wholly owned by the state.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In the <b>past,</b> <b>coupling</b> {{capacitances}} between conductors was extracted using charge distributions directly. In {{this paper}} {{a set of}} new generalized variational formulas are derived. They are complete since they are valid not only for self-capacitances, but also for mutual capacitances. As for the realistic numerical implementation, elastance matrices become asymmetrical because of numerical method used. Then a more general variational formula is derived {{to account for the}} asymmetrical elastance matrix case. By these novel formulas the computational accuracy can be significantly improved compared to the conventional capacitance extraction method. 1...|$|R
30|$|Consistency {{is related}} to {{transactions}} and, although not universally defined, {{can be seen as}} the guarantee that transactions started in the future see the effects of transactions committed in the <b>past,</b> <b>coupled</b> with the insurance of database constraints [73 – 75]. It is useful to recall that, in the context of the CAP theorem [40, 41], consistency is often seen as the premise that all nodes see the same data at the same time [42] (i.e., the CAP version of consistency is merely a subset of the ACID version of the same property [41]). We have previously seen that consistency and availability are highly related properties of NoSQL systems.|$|R

40|$|At {{the outset}} of this {{contribution}} the question was posed whether the Act has, by couching the crime of rape and compelled rape in a gender-neutral fashion, caused the definition of rape to lend itself to an interpretation {{that it is no}} longer a formally-defined crime, as it was at common law, but rather a materially defined crime. Through an analysis of the definition of the common-law crime and the anomalies presented in the <b>past,</b> <b>coupled</b> with an interpretation that is consistent with the constitutional interests sought to be protected, it is submitted that the crime of rape is and remains a formally-defined crime.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} ongoing influence of retro music cultures on post- 1960 s American artists and their representations of social, political, and economic change. Through a roughly decade-by-decade analysis of poetry, novels, film, and emerging technocultures, I {{make the case}} for a pendular dynamic of nostalgic art {{in the wake of the}} Civil Rights era—namely, a hope for revolutionary futures based on the <b>past</b> <b>coupled</b> with a backward-looking dirge for a Rubicon crossed, a moment of potential irretrievably lost. These twinned poles of optimism and pessimism share a nostalgic center in the music cultures of the past, emblematized in American art as agents of change and revolution, high water marks against which artists measure progressivism or cultural regression...|$|R

Brittle, neurotic, flawed but ultimately sweet Rosie and thoroughly nice and not-unattractive Frazer are one of those Ramsay Street couples that just work, and have been totally right for the show - feeling just as, well, Neighbours-y as pairings such as Madge and Harold, Scott and Charlene and Des and Daphne".|$|R
25|$|Ethnic Russians {{represent}} a significant {{deviation from the}} pattern, with second lowest fertility rate of all major groups, but relatively low median age (37.6 years). This phenomenon is at least {{partly due to the}} fact that children from mixed marriages are often registered as ethnic Russians in the census. The most noticeable trend in the <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of decades is the convergence of birth rates between minorities (including Muslim minorities) and the Russian majority.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} regarding cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for {{childhood sexual}} abuse (CSA) survivors {{tended to focus on}} individual treatments even though {{it has been suggested that}} couples therapy may be beneficial or even necessary for CSA survivors in serious relationships. There is empirical support for CBT treatments for couples impacted by several forms of trauma, but <b>past</b> <b>couples</b> research generally neglected specific issues related to CSA. The purpose of this dissertation is to determine how CBT used for CSA survivors may translate into working with CSA survivors seeking couples therapy. Research on CBT for individual CSA survivors and couples impacted by trauma are reviewed and critically analyzed to determine potential adaptability for couples impacted by CSA. A proposed treatment combining findings from research on individual CSA treatments and couples trauma treatments is presented...|$|R

25|$|The {{structural}} {{economic changes}} have influenced {{specific aspects of}} the family. However, not all families are affected in the same way.

The economic changes in the <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of decades have affected middle-class and lower-class families very differently in many aspects, especially since the 1970s economic recession.

25|$|Over the <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> {{of years}} the college {{has begun to}} offer the {{opportunity}} for international students (usually from Asian countries such as China, Taiwan or South Korea) to study at the school; usually {{with the hope of}} progressing on to an Australian University and then returning to their homeland, being educated in both Australian and Augustinian culture. The fees are often significantly higher for a student coming from overseas compared to a local student because the Australian Government does not subsidise their tuition fees. The college usually accepts entrants from overseas in Years 10-12, so that an appropriate ratio of local to overseas students is maintained.|$|E
25|$|Finnish {{healthcare}} can {{be considered}} a success because of several indicators.

5000|$|Butler's close {{association}} with appeasement was often held against him {{later in his}} career, more so than against Lords Home or Hailsham, his rivals for the party leadership in 1963, who had been more junior. This did not prevent him from holding many further senior ministerial positions, whilst the immediate causes of his failure to achieve the premiership would be (in 1957) his open discontent with Eden’s leadership in general and with the Suez adventure in particular, and his reluctance to pander to the Tory right, and (in 1963) his reluctance to cause a political crisis by refusing to serve under Home. Although Churchill valued his abilities as a minister, {{by the time of}} Suez his <b>past,</b> <b>coupled</b> with his lack of personal military experience, damaged his reputation {{in the eyes of the}} younger generation of Conservative MPs, many of them Second World War veterans. Macmillan, who later recalled Butler as having been [...] "the most cringing of the Munichites", often made sure the point was repeated.|$|R
25|$|Ever {{since the}} over-commercialization of hip hop {{occurred}} between the late 1980s and the mid 1990s (at peak), traditional hip hop supporters {{have been in}} a feud with more progressive hip hop fans, claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building, and that it they are not only building music that steps further and further away from Hip Hop, but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed Hip Hop, and traditional fans of the Hip Hop culture. These views have been narrowed heavily over the <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of years and have experienced change of views from the traditional side, as well as acceptance towards evolution of hip hop.|$|E
25|$|Another {{influential}} {{factor is}} oil revenues. Historically, in periods of {{high oil prices}} and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in crowding out domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After the oil price spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated in the <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of years when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; {{the result is that}} agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable chunk of the household consumption basket. Over the past few years, there have been significant price increases in agricultural products in Iran. This is due both to rising domestic demand and to rising global commodity prices.|$|E
