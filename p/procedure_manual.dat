2500|$|The Columbine High School {{massacre}} in Colorado on April20, 1999 was another seminal event in SWAT tactics and police response. As noted {{in an article}} in the Christian Science Monitor, [...] "Instead of being taught to wait for the SWAT team to arrive, street officers are receiving the training and weaponry to take immediate action during incidents that clearly involve suspects' use of deadly force." [...] The article further reported that street officers were increasingly being armed with rifles, and issued heavy body armor and ballistic helmets, items traditionally associated with SWAT units. The idea was to train and equip street officers to make a rapid response to so-called active-shooter situations. In these situations, it was no longer acceptable to simply set up a perimeter and wait for SWAT. As an example, in the policy and <b>procedure</b> <b>manual</b> of the Minneapolis Police Department, it is stated, [...] "MPD personnel shall remain cognizant of the fact that in many active shooter incidents, innocent lives are lost within the first few minutes of the incident.
