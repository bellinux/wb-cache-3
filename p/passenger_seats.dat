5|$|In October 2010, Pemco World Air Services and Precision Conversions {{launched}} aftermarket conversion {{programs to}} modify 757-200s into 757 Combi aircraft. Vision Technologies Systems launched {{a similar program}} in December 2011. All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for up to ten cargo pallets, while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 <b>passenger</b> <b>seats.</b> This configuration is targeted at commercial charter flights which transport heavy equipment and personnel simultaneously. Customers for converted 757 Combi aircraft include the Air Transport Services Group, National Airlines, and North American Airlines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the active}} {{suspension}} {{control of a}} vehicle model that has five degrees of freedom with a <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> using a fuzzy logic controller is studied. Three cases {{are taken into account}} as different control applications. In the first case, the vehicle model having passive suspensions with an active <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> is controlled. In the second case, active suspensions with passive <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> combination are controlled. In the third case, both the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> and suspensions have active controllers. Vibrations of the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> in the three cases due to road bump input are simulated. At the end of the study, the results are compared in order to select the combination that supplies the best ride comfort...|$|R

25|$|The SH09 {{is offered}} with various {{different}} layout configurations; the default of these options has {{a total of}} four <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> present in addition to a pair in the front for the pilots, all of which are fully adjustable in height and length. In a high density configuration, five seats are installed in the rear position along with two more <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> inline with the pilot's own, which loses the option of the floor window. The use of Kevlar-threaded crashworthy fuel tanks, which are built into the wall and floor of the cargo hold, freed up space to allow for fully adjustable <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> in the cabin. The cargo hold is sized to accommodate 10 items of baggage, while the fuel tanks are sized to provide for an endurance of nearly five hours. The rear clamshell door and high-mounted tail boom is thought to potentially be attractive to North American-based air ambulance operators.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{vibration}} control response of <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> in quarter car model having three {{degrees of freedom}} is studied. Three different control strategies {{are taken into account}} using Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) controller. In first case, ANFIS controller is applied in main suspension of active quarter car model. In second case, <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> suspension is assembled with ANFIS controller. Finally, both main and <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> suspensions are integrated with ANFIS controller. Simulation work under random road excitations is performed using passive and controlled quarter car models for performance comparison of passenger ride comfort. Ride comfort analysis is also compared as per ISO 2631 - 1 criterion. The obtained simulation responses are compared taking <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> acceleration and displacement response in time and frequency domain for the selection of best control strategy in designed quarter car model...|$|R

25|$|The G 31 was {{the first}} Luft Hansa {{airliner}} to feature a flight attendant (Wagner p.264), who served food and drinks (which were not complimentary). This earned the G 31 the nickname 'flying dining car' ('fliegender Speisewagen' in German). Because of its large fuselage it was also called the flying moving van ('fliegender Möbelwagen' in German). Behind the cockpit were compartments for a radio operator, baggage and an APU that provided compressed air for main engine starting and drove a generator for electric power. The cabin was divided into three compartments that held eleven regular <b>passenger</b> <b>seats,</b> four jumpseats for passengers, a jumpseat for the steward, and an enclosed lavatory. Instead of the <b>passenger</b> <b>seats,</b> ten beds could be made up for night flying. There was a baggage and freight hold under the cabin. The wings had trailing edge flaps that reduced the landing speed by ten percent (Wagner p.267).|$|E
25|$|From 1982 onwards the conductor's {{seat was}} removed from all units (from thereon tickets were sold by the driver), and coinciding with this the seating {{arrangements}} of all Nr I trams was standardised to 39 <b>passenger</b> <b>seats.</b> Following the 1993–2004 modernisation process, HKL officially gives the seating capacity of all units as 39, with 106 standing places.|$|E
50|$|The {{headlight}} surrounds {{were white}} {{from the first}} 914s to mid-production of 73 and subsequently black. Cars produced up to early 1972 had a fixed <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> and a removable passenger footrest. Later cars featured a movable <b>passenger</b> <b>seat.</b> Other interior differences included changing vinyl designs, gauge appearance, and air vent configurations in the dash.|$|R

25|$|The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} benefit of requiring upper torso restraints (UTR, i.e., shoulder harnesses) in <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> of aircraft weighing less than 5,670kg in response to a safety recommendation arising from the investigation of a 1999 accident involving a Cessna Titan near Glasgow. As a result of that study, the CAA changed its regulations to require shoulder harnesses for passengers on all aircraft registered after February 1, 1989, if that aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of 5,700 or less and 9 <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> or fewer. The CAA also forwarded a recommendation to the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) of Europe, recommending that European regulators adopt a similar standard. However, {{at the time of the}} Loganair accident, the JAA had not acted on the recommendation. Although the UK regulation covered the accident aircraft (it was first certified in May, 1989), Loganair had obtained an exemption from the CAA concerning this issue.|$|E
