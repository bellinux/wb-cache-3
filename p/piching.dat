40|$|Abstract The {{putative}} chromatin remodeling enzyme Plk 1 -interacting checkpoint helicase (<b>PICH)</b> {{was discovered}} as an interaction partner and substrate of the mitotic kinase Plk 1. During mitosis <b>PICH</b> associates with centromeres and kinet-ochores and, most interestingly, constitutes a robust marker for ultrafine DNA bridges (UFBs) that connect separating chromatids in anaphase cells. The precise roles of <b>PICH</b> {{remain to be}} clarified. Here, we have used antibody micro-injection and siRNA-rescue experiments to study <b>PICH</b> function and localization during M phase progression, with particular emphasis {{on the role of}} the predicted ATPase domain and the regulation of <b>PICH</b> localization by Plk 1. We show that interference with <b>PICH</b> function results in chromatin bridge formation and micronucleation and that ATPase activity is critical for <b>PICH</b> function. Interestingly, an intact ATPase domain of <b>PICH</b> is required for prevention of chromatin bridge formation but not for UFB resolution, and quantitative analyses of UFB and chromatin bridge frequencies suggest that these structures are of different etiologies. We also show that the ATPase activity of <b>PICH</b> is required for temporal and spatial control of <b>PICH</b> localization to chromatin and that Plk 1 likely controls <b>PICH</b> localization through phosphorylation of proteins distinct from <b>PICH</b> itself. This work strengthens the view that <b>PICH</b> is an important, Plk 1 -regulated enzyme, whose ATPase activity is essential for maintenance of genome integrity. Although not required for the spindle assembly checkpoint, <b>PICH</b> is clearly important for faithful chromo-some segregation...|$|R
40|$|<b>PICH</b> (Plk 1 -interacting {{checkpoint}} helicase), a DNA-dependent ATPase, {{was identified}} as a binding partner and substrate of Plk 1. During mitosis, <b>PICH</b> localizes to the centromere/KTs of condensed mitotic chromosomes and to ultra-fine DNA bridges (UFBs) during anaphase. Upon depletion or chemical inhibition of Plk 1, <b>PICH</b> localizes to the chromosome arms, suggesting that the kinase activity of Plk 1 regulates the dynamic localization of <b>PICH.</b> In addition, <b>PICH</b> (bound to Plk 1) has been proposed to function in prometaphase chromosome arm architecture and cohesion. Here, two questions were asked: how is the dynamic localization of <b>PICH</b> regulated and what is the mitotic function of <b>PICH?</b> In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we identify the ATPase activity of <b>PICH</b> as being essential for its correct subcellular localization and show that ATPase-dead mutants of <b>PICH</b> localize to the chromosome arms. Rescue experiments with a mutant of <b>PICH</b> that is unable to interact with Plk 1 imply that the kinase activity of Plk 1 is only indirectly required to delocalize <b>PICH</b> from the chromosome arms. This suggests that an unknown Plk 1 substrate regulates the localization of <b>PICH.</b> PICH-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified the uncharacterized protein BEND 3 as a binding partner. BEND 3 localizes to mitotic chromosomes and its depletion results in the loss of <b>PICH</b> and Plk 1 from the centromere/KTs. BEND 3 depleted cells are unable to align their chromosomes at the metaphase plate and undergo apoptosis within a short time, suggesting that BEND 3 regulates not only the localization of <b>PICH</b> and Plk 1 but has additional functions. In the second part of this thesis, we demonstrate that <b>PICH</b> does not function in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Instead, we show that neutralization or depletion of <b>PICH</b> results in chromatin bridges during anaphase. We identify the ATPase activity of <b>PICH</b> as indispensable to prevent the formation of these bridges and show that they most likely arise from non-centromeric chromatin. <b>PICH</b> was previously shown to interact with the BTR complex (composed of BLM, TOP 3 A and RMI 1) that has been linked to the faithful separation of chromosomes during mitosis. It is of great interest, therefore, that we discovered an association of <b>PICH</b> with Rif 1, which has recently been shown to provide a DNA-binding interface for the BTR complex. In contrast to the colocalization of <b>PICH</b> and the BTR complex to non-centromeric UFBs, Rif 1 localizes to centromeric UFBs in a PICH-dependent manner. Thus, we speculate that <b>PICH,</b> Rif 1 and the BTR complex act together to prevent chromatin bridges during mitosis...|$|R

40|$|The DNA-dependent {{adenosine}} triphosphatase (ATPase) Plk 1 -interacting checkpoint helicase (<b>PICH)</b> {{has recently been}} implicated in spindle checkpoint (SAC) signaling (Baumann et al., Cell 128 (1) : 101 - 114, 2007). Depletion of <b>PICH</b> by siRNA abolished the SAC and resulted in an apparently selective loss of Mad 2 from kinetochores, suggesting a role for <b>PICH</b> in the regulation of the Mad 1 -Mad 2 interaction. An apparent rescue of SAC functionality by overexpression of <b>PICH</b> in PICH-depleted cells initially seemed to confirm a role for <b>PICH</b> in the SAC. However, we have subsequently discovered that all PICH-directed siRNA oligonucleotides that abolish the SAC also reduce Mad 2 mRNA and protein expression. This reduction is functionally significant, as <b>PICH</b> siRNA does not abolish SAC activity in a cell line that harbors a bacterial artificial chromosome driving the expression of murine Mad 2. Moreover, we identified several siRNA duplexes that effectively deplete <b>PICH</b> but do not significantly affect SAC functionality or Mad 2 abundance or localization. Finally, we discovered that the ability of overexpressed <b>PICH</b> to restore SAC activity in PICH-depleted cells depends on sequestration of the mitotic kinase Plk 1 rather than ATPase activity of <b>PICH,</b> pointing to an underlying mechanism of ``bypass suppression. `` In support of this view, depletion or inhibition of Plk 1 also rescued SAC activity in cells harboring low levels of Mad 2. This observation suggests that a reduction of Plk 1 activity partially compensates for reduced Mad 2 levels and argues that Plk 1 normally reduces the strength of SAC signaling. Collectively, our results question the role of <b>PICH</b> in the SAC and instead identify Mad 2 as a sensitive off target for small RNA duplexes. In support of the latter conclusion, our evidence suggests that an off-target effect on Mad 2 may also contribute to explain the apparent role of the Tao 1 kinase in SAC signaling (Draviam et al., Nat Cell Biol 9 (5) : 556 - 564, 2007) ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Spontaneuos {{intracranial}} haemorrhage—that is, mainly {{subarachnoid haemorrhage}} (SAH) and primary intracerebral haemorrhage (<b>PICH)</b> —constitutes {{an important part}} of all strokes. As previous epidemiological studies have demonstrated highly variable incidence rates, we conducted a large prospective investigation of all haemorrhagic strokes during a 1 year period.  METHODS—Twelve hospitals serving a defined population of 1. 14 million in southern Sweden registered all cases with spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage, including those found dead outside hospitals, during 1996. All patients were examined with CT of the brain or underwent necropsy. Incidence rates adjusted to the Swedish population for age and sex, as well as location of haematoma and prevalence of risk factors were calculated.  RESULTS—A total of 106 patients with SAH and 341 patients with <b>PICH</b> were identified. The annual incidence/ 100 000 was 10. 0 (6. 4 for men and 13. 5 for women) for SAH and 28. 4 (32. 2 for men and 24. 7 for women) for <b>PICH</b> when adjusted to the Swedish population. Subarachnoid haemorrhage affected twice as many women as men. The incidence of both types of haemorrhage increased with advancing age, but in particular, this was the case for supratentorial <b>PICH.</b> Lobar haematomas were the most common (51. 6 %) type of <b>PICH.</b> Among patients with <b>PICH,</b> 37 % had hypertension, 41 % other vascular disease, and 12 % were on oral anticoagulation. Among patients with SAH, 28 % had hypertension and 18 % vascular disease before the haemorrhage but no one was on treatment with oral anticoagulation.  CONCLUSIONS—The incidence of <b>PICH</b> was high, especially for the older age groups. <b>PICH</b> was, on average, three times as common as SAH. The study underscores the importance of <b>PICH</b> and SAH as significant stroke subgroups. ...|$|R
