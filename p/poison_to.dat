5|$|Detectives traced three {{distinct}} polonium trails {{in and out}} of London, at three different dates, which according to the investigation suggests Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun made two failed attempts to administer polonium to Litvinenko before the final and successful one. The first attempt took place on 16 October 2006, when radioactive traces were found in all places visited by the FSB operatives before and after their meeting with Litvinenko. They administered the <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> his tea, but he did not drink it.|$|E
5|$|Guiscardo was {{a servant}} and {{page in the}} court of Sigismunda's father, Prince Tancred of Salerno. When Sigismunda's father {{discovered}} that Guiscardo and Sigismunda had wed secretly, he angrily ordered his men to murder the low-born Guiscardo, and had Guiscardo's heart delivered to Sigismunda in a golden cup. Despite having committed to die without shedding a tear, she weeps as she realises her father has murdered her husband.

5|$|Meanwhile, in Jakarta, an {{epidemic}} of the flu is underway. Among those who fall ill is President Sukarno, who writes to Chairman Mao Zedong to request some doctors. Mao sends doctors, who give Sukarno <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> paralyze him and aid the 30 September Movement in overthrowing the government. The slow acting poison causes Sukarno to faint after he and his ministers have a large party with haraam events, including the consumption of pork and frog and zina (sex outside of marriage).|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} the coup, Rainivoninahitriniony {{informed}} Lambert that {{he could}} not guarantee the support of the army and that the plot should be aborted. One of the officers believed the brothers had betrayed them and sought to exonerate himself by notifying the queen of the failed conspiracy. She reacted by expelling the foreigners from the island and subjecting all the implicated Merina officers to the tangena ordeal in which they were forced to swallow a <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> determine their guilt or innocence. Rainilaiarivony and his brother were excepted from this and remained, like her son Radama, in the queen's confidence for the few remaining years of her life.|$|E
5|$|His {{policies}} and tactics highlighted {{and increased the}} separation between the king and his subjects. Andrianjaka transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom. He made a demonstration of royal power by appropriating the local tradition of sampy (talismans), previously created by village chiefs and others for personal or local spiritual ends, restricting their number to twelve and declaring their creation a strictly royal prerogative. The king also imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice, the trial by ordeal: Andrianjaka ordered that rather than administering tangena <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> an accused person's rooster to determine their innocence by the creature's survival, the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself.|$|E
5|$|That same {{evening the}} Senate convened at the Temple of Concord and summarily {{condemned}} Sejanus to death. He was led from prison and strangled. His body was cast onto the Gemonian stairs, where the crowd tore it to pieces. Riots ensued, in which crowds hunted and killed anyone they could link to Sejanus. The Praetorians also resorted to looting, {{when they were}} accused of having conspired with the former prefect. Following the issue of damnatio memoriae by the Senate, his statues were torn down and his name obliterated from all public records. On October 24, Sejanus' eldest son Strabo was arrested and executed. Upon learning of his death, Apicata committed suicide (October 26), after addressing a letter to Tiberius, claiming that Drusus had been poisoned with the complicity of Livilla. The accusations were further corroborated by confessions from Livilla's slaves, who, under torture, admitted to having administered the <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> Drusus.|$|E

5|$|The Master {{spends most}} of his time {{drinking}} alcohol, and people begin trying to convince him to move into a nursing home, where no dogs are allowed. One summer, an outbreak of rabies spreads through the fox population. After one infected fox attacks a group of human children, the same people approach the Master and ask his help in killing the foxes. He uses traps and <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> try to kill as many foxes as possible; however, the poison also kills domestic animals. After a human child dies from eating it, the humans remove all of the poison, then the Master organizes a hunt in which large numbers of people line up and walk straight into the woods, flushing out foxes to be shot. The aging Tod escapes all three events, as well as an attempt at coursing him with greyhounds.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another use}} of philodendrons is for {{catching}} fish. A tribe in the Colombian Amazon {{is known to}} use Philodendron craspedodromum to add <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> the water, temporarily stunning the fish, which rise up to the surface, {{where they can be}} easily scooped up. To add the <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> the water, the leaves are cut into pieces and tied together to form bundles, which are allowed to ferment for a few days. The bundles are crushed and added to the water into which the poison will dissipate. Although the toxicity of Philodendron craspedodromum is not fully known, active ingredients in the poisoning of the fish possibly are coumarins formed during the fermentation process.|$|E

Betel nuts were widely chewed and the lower classes rarely wore clothing more substantial than a loincloth. Every spring, a fertility festival was held which featured huge parties and sexual abandon. Religion consisted of primitive animistic cults.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the years}} {{factories}} {{on the banks}} of the Indus River have increased levels of water pollution in the river and the atmosphere around it. High levels of pollutants in the river have led to the deaths of endangered Indus River Dolphin.

Death of the Indus River Dolphin has also been attributed to fishermen using <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> kill fish and scooping them up. As a result, the government banned fishing from Guddu Barrage to Sukkur.|$|E
25|$|Retainer {{sacrifice}} was practised {{within the}} royal tombs of ancient Mesopotamia. Courtiers, guards, musicians, handmaidens and grooms were presumed to have committed ritual suicide by taking poison. A new examination of skulls from the royal cemetery at Ur, discovered in Iraq {{almost a century}} ago, appears to support a more grisly interpretation of human sacrifices associated with elite burials in ancient Mesopotamia than had previously been recognized, say archaeologists. Palace attendants, as part of royal mortuary ritual, were not dosed with <b>poison</b> <b>to</b> meet death serenely. Instead, they were put to death by having a sharp instrument, such as a pike, driven into their heads.|$|E
