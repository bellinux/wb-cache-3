40|$|M. Ed. This {{investigation}} {{is part of}} the group project that a research team from the Department of Educational Sciences of the Rand Afrikaans University conducted. The project investigated the responsibilities of the teachers. The aim of this project was to determine the input by teachers in carrying out their professional responsibilities. The professional responsibilities that were investigated included inter alia the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for learners, building of the learner's self-concept, the learner's cognitive development, the learner's social development, parental guidance, career orientation and the view of the future of learners, evaluation responsibilities, lesson preparation and presentation, maintenance of authority and discipline as well as remedial work. Each member of the team has investigated the input made by teachers with respect to <b>a</b> particular aspect <b>of</b> the teachers' responsibilities. This particular investigation focuses on the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for learners as <b>an</b> aspect <b>of</b> the teachers' responsibilities. Teachers from both primary and secondary schools were asked to complete the questionnaire. They were specifically chosen because the research topic focused on the teachers' responsibilities. With those involved, {{it would be possible to}} determine the input that they make in carrying out their professional responsibilities. The results of the empirical research indicate that the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for learners is regarded as very important by teachers. This is one responsibility that is attended to by teachers. The following specific findings have been made: • No statistically significant relationships were found with respect to viewpoints on the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for learners between teachers of different age groups, teachers who use different languages in teaching, teachers who occupy different professional ranks and teachers with different marital status. Statistically significant relationships have been detected between teachers with different teaching experience, teachers whose mother tongue differs, teachers with different educational qualifications, teachers who teach in different subject fields and also between teachers who have high and low average number of children in their classes. No statistically significant difference was found regarding viewpoints on the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for learners between the proportion of teachers who have their own children and the proportion of teachers who have no children of their own. Statistically significant differences were found regarding viewpoints on the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for learners between the proportion of male and the proportion of female teachers, and also between the proportion of primary and the proportion of secondary school teachers. <b>A</b> larger proportion <b>of</b> female teachers than male teachers gives <b>a</b> larger proportion <b>of</b> input with respect to the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for learners. It was also found that <b>a</b> larger proportion <b>of</b> primary school teachers than secondary school teachers give <b>a</b> larger proportion <b>of</b> input with respect to the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for learners. The study finally revealed that the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for learners is one of the responsibilities to which teachers give <b>a</b> high proportion <b>of</b> their input...|$|R

40|$|The IP-based Internet of Things {{refers to}} the {{interconnection}} of smart objects in a Low-power and Lossy Network (LLN) with the Internet by means of protocols such as 6 LoWPAN or CoAP. The <b>provisioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> end-to-end <b>security</b> connection {{is the key to}} ensure basic functionalities such as software updates or network access. This is, however, very challenging due to the asymmetry of the devices in the system (smart objects are resource constrained when compared with traditional Internet devices), and the interaction of possibly different security protocols such as TLS and DTLS. This paper describes the security and threat model for this scenario to arrive at the following conclusion: end-to-end security in the IP-based Internet of Things is more than a simple end-to-end handshake and requires additional measures to protect the LLN while performing the handshake. We further describe some simple solutions and give hints for further work. 1...|$|R
40|$|Once {{radioactive}} waste is emplaced in the repository, {{the challenge of}} monitoring the continued integrity of the excavated openings (e. g., emplacement drifts) escalates tremendously. We envision a seismic monitoring array installed on the surface at Yucca Mountain, which operates automatically to monitor repository opening stability in the long term. The objective is to monitor and validate the structural integrity of the emplacement drifts through identifying and localizing rock falls that could compromise drift access, hinder waste retrievability, and potentially reduce the effective life of waste canisters. Collateral benefits of the system include the ability to address some outstanding uncertainties regarding seismic wave attenuation {{in the vicinity of}} the repository, and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tool for <b>security</b> monitoring of the repository in guarding against unauthorized access and entry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in argument based reasoning for access control, for example in the context of agents negotiating access to resources or web services in virtual organizations. We use a logical framework which contains agents with objectives concerning access to <b>a</b> resource or <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> service, including <b>security</b> objectives. The access control mechanism is described by <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> policy rules, that specify that access to a resource or service requires <b>a</b> specific set <b>of</b> credentials. Our contribution is <b>a</b> formalization <b>of</b> the reasoning about access control using a planning theory formalized in Dung’s abstract argumentation framework. We build on Amgoud’s argumentation framework for plan arguments, which is based on <b>an</b> adaptation <b>of</b> Dung’s notion of defence. Our formal argumentation framework allows arguments about the backward derivation of plans from objectives and policy rules (abduction), as well as arguments about the forward derivation of goals from general objectives. We show that reasoning about the feasibility of goals requires mixed goal-plan arguments, and we show how to formalize the plan arguments in Dung’s framework without adapting the notion of defence. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the hopes}} {{of the people in}} South Africa that the new {{democracy}} would bring significant changes to the many impoverished people in the country, this has not happened. In relation to security, crime has risen {{to the top of the}} national agenda and is the focus of public and media attention. The government's lacking capacity to deal with the massive problems of crime has led to a gap in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> security. The economically empowered have been able to fill part of this gap by purchasing the services of private security companies, but to the vast majority of South Africans this is not an option. The focus of this study is to locate the different communities' ability to generate local capacity to confront this gap in <b>security</b> <b>provision.</b> <b>A</b> comparative study <b>of</b> three distinct communities in Hout Bay is in this respect suitable because they each contain <b>a</b> different segment <b>of</b> the South African population, and represent very different socioeconomic standards. The relatively affluent white community in the Valley has managed to gather around a collective project to reduce property crime through a newly formed Neighbourhood Watch, and network extensively with the police and private security companies to achieve their goals. In contrast to this, the neighbouring communities have not been successful at developing projects that could enhance their security. Instead, the mainly African township Imizamo Yethu is characterised by internal division and conflict, while the coloured community in Hangberg has sunk into a collective apathy. To explain the communities' varying ability to affect their <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> <b>a</b> focus on social relations, identity formation, and networking is applied, as well as a nodal governance approach to map the existing nodes that seek to impact the governance of security in each community. Though the white community is more able than the others to affect the local <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> security, the contemporary development is increasing the already substantial differences between the communities, and it is likely that this will lead to more distrust and tension. This study seems to indicate that unless the people of Hout Bay are able to build common projects that will enhance the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> security to all communities, they may all stand to lose in the long run...|$|R
40|$|With {{regards to}} social constructivism, this project explores {{the effects of}} private {{military}} and security companies on states’ authority and their <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> <b>A</b> core aspect <b>of</b> legitimate state authority is the monopoly of violence, which the military is understood as being the practical extension of. The effect on states monopolization of violence, and consequently state authority, when the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> security has been outsourced to private military and security companies becomes relevant while working with the security dimension of the social contract. Based on empirical data from the United States, Japan and Sierra Leone, we argue for some observable generalisations regarding the effects on the social contract in relation to security, and consequently states’ authority, when outsourcing the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> security to private military and security companies. We have found that, as such, states’ reliance on private military and security companies does not significantly affect states’ authority, and subsequently the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> security, in neither the United States nor Japan. However, there are some implications within Sierra Leone, in which the social contract in relation to security was affected by the Sierra Leonean state’s use of private military and security companies. Generally, {{it was observed that}} by outsourcing military functions to private military and <b>security</b> companies, <b>a</b> new actor entered into the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> civil society’s security. While the state’s monopoly of violence is partially being eroded, it does not necessarily entail that the authority of states are affected. Rather, <b>a</b> monopsy <b>of</b> violence is established. On the basis of historic and cultural trends within each case study, we argue that the social contract in relation to security needs to be analysed in a country-specific context. By arguing that the social contract in relation to security is country-specific, it is also argued that the use of private military and security companies does not warrant the same effects on states’ authority among all states, but rather that this requires further investigation on a country-by-country basis. Lastly, this project also discusses the implications on states’ authority while part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international society in which states interact with international organisations, non-governmental organisations and private firms. When utilising a social constructivist framework, it is argued that states are becoming increasingly international and, as such, should be investigated in a national as well as in an international context...|$|R
