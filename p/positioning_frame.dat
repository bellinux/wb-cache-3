However in the ptotic breast shape, which {{is seen in the}} majority of cases, the sub-mammary fold remains obscured when the breast is captured in an upright body posture. Method A self-designed <b>positioning</b> <b>frame</b> for 3 D breast capture was utilized as a safe positioning aide. Six volunteers stood on an adjustable standing step, leaning with the hips against a soft-coated hip roll while stretching forward with the upper body extending to a nearly horizontal position and reaching with the arms forward resting on arm pads. 3 D breast capture was conducted simultaneously with eight digital cameras that were positioned to capture the right, left, anterior and inferior views {{of the breast}}. Capture was repeated three times at different time intervals. The reproducibility of the pose, captures and 3 D measurements were investigated.

40|$|Otologic surgery often {{involves}} a mastoidectomy procedure, in {{which part of}} the temporal bone is milled away in order to visualize critical structures embedded in the bone and safely access the middle and inner ear. We propose to automate this portion of the surgery using a compact, bone-attached milling robot. A high level of accuracy is required to avoid damage to vital anatomy along the surgical path, most notably the facial nerve, making this procedure well-suited for robotic intervention. In this study, several of the design considerations are discussed and a robot design and prototype are presented. The prototype is a 4 degrees-of-freedom robot similar to a four-axis milling machine that mounts to the patient’s skull. A <b>positioning</b> <b>frame,</b> containing fiducial markers and attachment points for the robot, is rigidly attached to the skull of the patient, and a CT scan is acquired. The target bone volume is manually segmented in the CT by the surgeon and automatically converted to a milling path and robot trajectory. The robot is then attached to the <b>positioning</b> <b>frame</b> and is used to drill the desired volume. The accuracy of the entire system (image processing, planning, robot) was evaluated at several critical locations within or near the target bone volume with a mean free space accuracy result of 0. 50 mm or less at all points. A milling test in a phantom material was then performed to evaluate the surgical workflow. The resulting milled volume did not violate any critical structures...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In orbital reconstruction, {{the optimal}} {{location}} of a predefined implant can be planned preoperatively. Surgical results can be assessed intraoperatively or postoperatively. A novel method for quantifying orbital implant position is introduced. The method measures predictability of implant placement: transformation parameters between planned and resulting implant position are quantified. METHODS: The method was tested on 3 human specimen heads. Computed Tomography scans were acquired at baseline with intact orbits (t 0), after creation of the defect (t 1) and postoperatively after reconstruction of the defect using a preformed implant (t 2). Prior to reconstruction, the optimal implant position was planned on the t 0 and t 1 scans. Postoperatively, the planned and realized implant position were compared. The t 0 and t 2 scans were fused using iPlan software and the resulting implant was segmented in the fused t 2 scan. An implant reference frame was created (Orbital Implant Positioning Frame); the planned implant was transformed to the reference position using an Iterative Closest Point approach. The segmentation of the resulting implant was also registered on the reference position, yielding rotational (pitch, yaw, roll) as well as translational parameters of implant position. RESULTS: Measurement with the Orbital Implant <b>Positioning</b> <b>Frame</b> proved feasible on all three specimen. The positional outcome provided more thorough and accurate insight in resulting implant position than could be gathered from distance measurements alone. Observer-related errors were abolished from the process, since the method is largely automatic. CONCLUSION: A novel method of quantifying surgical outcome in orbital reconstructive surgery was presented. The presented Orbital Implant <b>Positioning</b> <b>Frame</b> assessed all parameters involved in implant displacement. The method proved to be viable on three human specimen heads. Clinically, the method could provide direct feedback intraoperatively and could improve postoperative evaluation of orbital reconstructive surgery...|$|E

In this article, we characterize the binding of purified suGF 1 to 11 contiguous Gs in the H 1 -H 4 intergenic region of a sea urchin early histone gene battery in vitro. It is shown that suGF 1 -DNA binding is dependent on ionic strength and requires divalent cations. Purified suGF 1 forms discrete protein-DNA multimers, consistent with suGF 1 -suGF 1 interactions. In a model for the suGF 1 -DNA complex derived from our footprinting and methylation interference data, suGF 1 contacts the Gs in the major groove as well as one of the bordering phosphate backbones. The data are consistent with the direction of curvature of the DNA in the suGF 1 -DNA complex being the same as that preferred by the free DNA and exhibited by the DNA when bent around a positioned nucleosome core in vitro. However, on the basis of steric considerations, the binding of suGF 1 and that of the histone octamer are predicted to be mutually exclusive. We show that suGF 1 is indeed unable to bind to the G string when occupied by a histone octamer located in the major in vitro <b>positioning</b> <b>frame</b> in the H 1 -H 4 intergenic region...|$|E

40|$|Background Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause of death worldwide; a prompt intervention is needed to restore blood flow. Sonothrombolysis with or without addiction of thrombolytic drugs seems to be a promising solution, thanks to the non-invasiveness, precision and quickness of its action. Mechanical effects, rather than thermal, are employed. Even if the mechanisms involved are not completely understood, acoustic cavitation is credited to play a significant role. Materials and Methods An experimental setup to detect acoustic cavitation during in-vitro sonothrombolysis tests has been developed. A Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD), able to record pressure fluctuation of oscillating bubbles, is mounted confocally to a 1 MHz focused ultrasound transducer. Confocality has been verified by a 0. 2 mm needle hydrophone to map the pressure fields of both devices. A LDPE tube containing the thrombus is placed at the foci thanks to a 3 axis <b>positioning</b> <b>frame.</b> A constant flow of 2 ml/min is established. To detect inertial cavitation (broadband emission with an increase in white noise), the original signal from the PCD has been filtered analogically at 5 MHz in order to remove harmonic frequencies which could saturate the acquisition system. Results In-vitro sonothrombolysis tests have been carried out on human blood clots. Clots were exposed for two minutes to an acoustic field of 65 W (focal length 25 mm, focal diameter 3 mm), with pulse length of 450 μs and a duty cycle of 1 : 10. Acquisition of PCD signal was synchronized with the burst; two windows per second at a sampling frequency of 40 MHz were acquired. Power spectral density was calculated in the 5 - 12 MHz band, with digital notch filters at the super-harmonic frequencies, in order to quantify the cavitation dose. Figure on the left shows the results of two tests with the same acoustic parameters. Blue line refers to a test in which there was no evidence of thrombolysis. When complete thrombus disruption took place a temporal correlation between thrombolysis inception and the increment of white noise can be observed (red line). Conclusion The proposed setup demonstrated the ability to detect inertial cavitation while performing in-vitro sonothrombolysis tests; a correlation between thrombolysis inception and increment of white noise was found. Statistically significant analysis will be performed in order to verify this correlation, thus allowing the optimization of sonothrombolysis parameters and protocols in order to enhance cavitational effects...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Numerous methods {{exist for}} the {{assessment}} of the female breast. Traditionally, a subjective approach was taken for surgical planning and evaluation of the postoperative outcome. Several objective methods have been developed to support this procedure, among which are laser scanning, MRI, mammography, ultrasound and photography. Recently, 3 D imaging technology has been developed. Material & Method: 3 D breast assessment by multiple stereophotogrammetry was examined. A custom-made imaging system with eight digital cameras arranged in four camera pods was utilised. This system was used for breast capture, resulting in eight images obtained by the cameras. The merging of these images and 3 D image construction was carried out by C 3 D software and the volume assessment of the 3 D images was made using breast analysis tool (BAT) software, developed by Glasgow University. A validation study was conducted. Nine plaster models were investigated and their volume determined by 3 D stereophotogrammetry and water displacement method. Water displacement was considered to be the gold standard for comparison. The plaster models were specially made in order to represent a variety of shapes and sizes of the female breast. Each plaster model was examined 10 times by each method. Further, the volumes of the breasts of six female volunteer live models were investigated by the same two methods and the results compared. A special focus was placed on the reproducibility of the assessment. Each live model was captured with the 3 D capture system three times at two different time points after retaking a special pose in a custom-made <b>positioning</b> <b>frame.</b> Altogether, each live model was captured six times, resulting in six 3 D images, each of which was measured three times with BAT software. A patient study was conducted in 44 patients after unilateral immediate breast reconstruction with Latissimus dorsi flap and no contra-lateral surgery. Each patient underwent 3 D imaging with the multiple stereophotogrammetry system. During capture, the special pose in the custom-made <b>positioning</b> <b>frame</b> was taken by the patient’s leaning forward almost horizontally with the upper body for the breasts to rise off the chest wall to enable full breast coverage by the cameras. 3 D images were constructed with C 3 D software and volumes measured with BAT. For each patient, one 3 D image was constructed and measured four times with BAT software. In addition to the volume determination, a shape analysis was conducted. For this purpose, 10 landmarks were determined according to recommendations in the literature. Two landmarks, sternal notch and xiphoid, were marked, forming an imaginary midline between each other and four landmarks on each breast, i. e. the medial and lateral ends of the infra-mammary fold, and the most prominent and most inferior breast points were utilised for symmetry assessment between the right and left breasts. Each landmark was recorded four times by the operator on the 3 D image and three-dimensional coordinates obtained. By assessment of the left and right breasts a breast asymmetry score was calculated. Firstly, breast asymmetry was assessed objectively on the 3 D images through the centroid size, which was determined as the square root of the sum of squared Euclidian distances from each landmark to the centroid. The centroid was the geometric mean of the landmarks. Secondly, asymmetry was assessed through breast volume by application of BAT software. Thirdly, asymmetry was examined through the landmarks themselves by investigation of the mismatch of the landmark configuration of one breast and its relabelled and matched reflection. The non-operated and reconstructed sides were compared and landmarks were recorded by the operator in three dimensions in four repeated tests. A decomposition of the total landmark asymmetry into its factors was conducted by fixation of the surface of the non-operated side and translation, rotation and scaling of the surface of the reconstructed side. For comparison, a subjective breast assessment was conducted by six expert observers who rated the results after breast reconstruction by subjective qualitative assessment of the symmetry in 2 D images of the same 44 patients in six poses. For this purpose the Harris scale was utilised, providing a score of 1 to 4 for poor to excellent symmetry. Results: The results revealed that differences in the obtained volumes in the plaster models were not significant. In contrast, differences in the breast volumes measured in the live models were significant. The examination of the reproducibility revealed that overall reproducibility obtained by stereophotogrammetry was better than that obtained by water displacement. No correlation between breast size and reproducibility of the measurements was found. The results of the patient study demonstrated that the reproducibility of the landmarks was within 5 mm. There was a non-significant difference of the centroid sizes between both breasts. There was a significant difference of the volumes between the two breasts, with the non-operated side being larger than the reconstructed side. Volume was considered to be a more accurate measure for comparison of both breasts than centroid size as it was based on thousands of data points for the calculation as opposed to only four points of the centroid size. The statistical analysis of the landmark data provided a mathematical formula for determination of the breast asymmetry score. The average asymmetry score, derived by landmark assessment as the degree of mismatch between both sides, was 0. 052 with scores ranging from 0. 019 (lowest score) to 0. 136 (highest score). The decomposition of the landmark-based asymmetry revealed that location was the most important factor contributing to breast asymmetry, ahead of intrinsic breast asymmetry, orientation and scale. When investigating the subjective assessment, the inter-observer agreement was good or substantial. There was moderate agreement on the controls and fair to substantial intra-observer agreement. When comparing the objective and subjective assessments, {{it was found that the}} relationship between the two scores was highly significant. Conclusion: We concluded that 3 D breast assessment by multiple stereophotogrammetry was reliable for a comparative analysis and provided objective data to breast volume, shape and symmetry. A breast asymmetry score was developed, enabling an objective measurement of breast asymmetry after breast reconstruction. 3 D breast assessment served as an objective method for comparison to subjective breast assessment...|$|E
