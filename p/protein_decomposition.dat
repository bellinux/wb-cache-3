Fresh carrots and carrots stored five months were pressed to raw juice and heat-treated at 70 degrees C for 20 minutes in the aim of destroy the undesirable microorganisms. Carrot juices were inoculated with lactic acid bacteria isolated from epiphytic microbiota at the concentration of 4 x 105 UFC/ml and fermented in a thermostat for 96 hours. During the fermentation the following analytical parameters were established: reducing sugars, total acidity, pH, amino acids content, nitrites content, ascorbic acid content. During fermentation the pH of carrot juices decreases from 6, 15 to 3, 99, while the total acidity increases from 0, 06 to 1, 62 % (as lactic acid). Less than 25 % of the initial content of ascorbic acid rests in the juices after 96 hours of fermentation. The amino acids content of juices, expressed as g N 2 / 100 g, increase with a middle of 50 % in 96 hours, due of the <b>proteins</b> <b>decomposition.</b> The pre-digestion of these compounds improve the nutritional quality of the lactofermented juices.

The quality of the raw materials, especially concerning the sugars content and the total acidity at the beginning of the fermentation process is important because a rapidly increase of acidity minimizes the influence of spoilage bacteria.

40|$|Abstract Background How {{antibodies}} {{recognize and}} bind to antigens {{can not be}} totally explained by rigid shape and electrostatic complimentarity models. Alternatively, pre-existing equilibrium hypothesis states that the native state of an antibody is not defined by a single rigid conformation but instead with an ensemble of similar conformations that co-exist at equilibrium. Antigens bind {{to one of the}} preferred conformations making this conformation more abundant shifting the equilibrium. Results Here, two antibodies, a germline antibody of 36 – 65 Fab and a monoclonal antibody, SPE 7 are studied in detail to elucidate the mechanism of antibody-antigen recognition and to understand how a single antibody recognizes different antigens. An elastic network model, Anisotropic Network Model (ANM) is used in the calculations. Pre-existing equilibrium is not restricted to apply to antibodies. Intrinsic fluctuations of eight proteins, from different classes of proteins, such as enzymes, binding and transport proteins are investigated to test the suitability of the method. The intrinsic fluctuations are compared with the experimentally observed ligand induced conformational changes of these proteins. The results show that the intrinsic fluctuations obtained by theoretical methods correlate with structural changes observed when a ligand is bound to the <b>protein.</b> The <b>decomposition</b> of the total fluctuations serves to identify the different individual modes of motion, ranging from the most cooperative ones involving the overall structure, to the most localized ones.

40|$|Objective: The Wegscheider {{conditions}} {{follow from}} {{the principle of}} detailed balance and the second law of thermodynamics. They constrain possible values of the kinetic parameters in reaction networks. A mathematical model that violates these conditions describes a thermodynamically impossible system. Large reaction networks contain usually {{a large number of}} Wegscheider conditions. This makes the thermodynamically consistent, kinetic modeling of such networks difficult. For this reason we developed the Thermodynamic-Kinetic Modeling (TKM) formalism, that provides a structurally consistent parameterization of kinetic models (Ederer & Gilles, Biophys J, 92 (6), 2007). The parameters of the TKM approach are capacities of species and resistances of reactions. Networks that model the formation of multi-protein complexes contain a particularly high number of Wegscheider conditions. Since the formation of protein complexes is a central motif of cellular signal transduction, we will show how the TKM formalism can be applied to such networks. Results: The thermokinetic capacities of protein complexes can be written by a product of a base capacity with interaction factors. The interaction factors depend on the binding energies of the proteins. Higher order interaction factors are possible, if more than two proteins interact. In a similar way, thermokinetic resistances can be decomposed into a base resistance and interaction factors that describe the influence of the binding state of the participating <b>proteins.</b> This <b>decomposition</b> of capacities and resistances allows us to formulate a thermokinetic model in a rule-based manner. Conclusions: Kinetic models that describe the formation of protein complexes are prone to a violation of the Wegscheider conditions. The Thermodynamic-Kinetic Modeling (TKM) formalism provides a thermodynamically consistent and intuitive parameterization of such networks by capacitive and resistive interaction factors. It allows for a rule-based formulation of thermokinetic models. This is important since due to the combinatorial complexity of protein complexation, the number of occurring species and reactions increases exponentially with the number of proteins. © 2008 University of Göteborg [accessed December 22, 2008...|$|R

A retrospective evaluation of intra-laboratory precision using ANOVA is given, and results from an inter-laboratory proficiency study, evaluated as estimates of bias, are summarised (paper submitted). The final sections look at uncertainty from existing archaeological site data, including sampling effects. A model is proposed that utilises decomposition correlations between amino acids to provide a priori uncertainty estimates. These are then used to update observed site data using a Bayesian approach to derive posterior uncertainty estimates and D/L values. A further model is tentatively presented which could potentially be used to derive quantitative age estimates once uncertainty within the kinetic and temperature models have been characterised and accounted for. ...|$|E

Therefore, in this study, anatase thin films were N-doped during reactive pulse magnetron sputtering, and the respective modifications were investigated for red-shifting, hydrophilization, and efficiency of photocatalytic organic decomposition upon UV-A compared to irradiation at the UV-A/VIS threshold around 400 nm wavelengths. Generally, with increasing nitrogen flow during anatase sputtering, the ability of gaining superhydrophilicity or decomposing methylene blue decreased. Anatase sputtered under lowest nitrogen flow rates ≤ 1 sccm decomposed human serum albumin films more efficiently upon 405 nm irradiation than anatase variants sputtered under higher nitrogen flow rates. Furthermore, undoped anatase could be activated similarly to low-doped variants even upon irradiation at 405 nm peak wavelength enabling significant <b>protein</b> <b>decomposition.</b> These findings open the way for clinical applications of undoped and low-doped anatase modifications in cases where biocompatibility requires longer wavelengths than UV-A. Further research is still needed to clarify possible functional advantages of undoped and low-doped anatase modifications for specific biomedical applications at the UV-A/VIS threshold region around 400 nm...|$|E
40|$|Exposure of amino acids, {{peptides}} and proteins to radicals, in {{the presence}} of oxygen, gives high yields of hydroperoxides. These materials are readily decomposed by transition metal ions to give further radicals. We hypothesized that hydroperoxide formation on nuclear <b>proteins,</b> and subsequent <b>decomposition</b> of these hydroperoxides to radicals, might result in oxidative damage to associated DNA. We demonstrate here that exposure of histone H 1 and model compounds to gamma-radiation {{in the presence}} of oxygen gives hydroperoxides in a dose-dependent manner. These hydroperoxides decompose to oxygen- and carbon-centred radicals (detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy) on exposure to Cu(+) and other transition metal ions. These hydroperoxide-derived radicals react readily with pyrimidine DNA bases and nucleosides to give adduct species (i. e. protein-DNA base cross-links). Product analysis has demonstrated that radicals from histone H 1 -hydroperoxides, and other protein and amino acid hydroperoxides, can also oxidize both free 2 '-deoxyguanosine and intact calf thymus DNA to give the mutagenic oxidized base 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine, 8 -oxodG). The yield of 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine is proportional to the initial protein-hydroperoxide concentration, and corresponds (for histone H 1 -hydroperoxide, 280 microM) to approx. 1. 4 % conversion for free 2 '-deoxyguanosine (200 microM), and 0. 14 % for 2 '-deoxyguanosine in DNA (70 microgram/ml). Evidence has also been obtained with DNA for reaction at cytosine and thymine, but not adenine; the lack of damage to the latter may result from damage transfer to 2 '-deoxyguanosine residues. These studies demonstrate that initial radical-induced damage to nuclear proteins can give rise to subsequent DNA damage; the latter includes both DNA-protein cross-links and formation of oxidized DNA bases...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Engenharia Biológica, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2008 Streptococcus pneumoniae is the causative {{agent of}} pneumonia, bacteraemia, {{meningitis}} and otitis [1]. The {{first stage of}} infection by the pneumococcus is nasopharyngeal colonisation {{and it is a}} prelude to dissemination to the lower respiratory tract [2]. Protecting the host against the invasion by microorganisms there is mucus coating the apical epithelial surfaces of the nasopharynx and lungs. In contrast, mucus also is a rich source of potential nutrient for colonising microorganisms. Mucin is the main glycoprotein found in mucus and its carbohydrates may be a major source of energy for the pneumococcus. Several glycosidic enzymes such as neuraminidase A and B, β-D-galactosidase, and N-acetyl-β-D-galactosaminidase have been found in pneumococcal cell lysates and it had been demonstrated that S. pneumoniae can utilise mucin as carbon and nitrogen source for growth. Furthermore, the analysis of sequenced strains of the S. pneumoniae genome revealed more ORFs whose products can, potentially, act on the carbohydrate of mucin. The present study carried out an investigation of these pneumococcal glycosidase’s role. The genes encoding these enzymes were mutated and the ability of the pneumococcal mutants to grow in mucin as the sole carbon and nitrogen source was determined. Several of these knock out mutants were impaired in their capacity to utilise mucin, indicating their importance for mucin degradation. One such strain bears a mutation at gene SPR 0059, which encodes for a putative beta-galactosidase, and another one with a mutation at the SPR 0244 gene, encoding for a putative 6 -phospho-beta-glucosidase. The referred mutants had lowered cellular growth in Sicard’s medium supplemented with mucin when compared with the wild type, suggesting that in the absence of those <b>proteins</b> the mucin <b>decomposition</b> was compromised, and so the carbon source provider. These facts lead us to the importance of the SPR 0059 and SPR 0244 encoded proteins study by its isolation and characterization...|$|R
40|$|In the {{pathogenesis}} of infectious diseases, a certain host factor should {{play a significant role}} as well as a pathogenic microorganism. Cholera, an infection with Vibrio cholerae, is not an exception. The clinical manifestation of cholera should be influenced by a certain condition of the host infected with Vibrio cholerae. In the experimental cholera of mice by oral challenge with Vibrio cholerae which has been developed by Ujiie and others, the incidence of the disease is closely related to the age of mice; only infantile mice younger than one week old of age are susceptible to oral challenge with Vibrio cholerae, and in mice older than one month, neither symptom nor multiplication of Vibrio cholerae in the intestine is seen. Therefore, it is understood that the infancy of mice should be one of the host factors as far as the experimental cholera in mice is concerned. It is presumed that characteristics of the infancy of mice may consist of uncompleted intestinal flora, deficiency of digestive enzymes, simplicity of intestinal content, particular immunological condition, abnormal absorptive ability of the intestine, etc. In this study, the morphological structure, histochemical behavior and function of the intestinal mucosa were investigated to compare the differences between infantile and adolescent mice. The characteristics of the infancy were as follows. 1). The surface of villi was lacking in enzyme layer. 2). The intercellular space in the epithelium was wide and conjunction between the cells is lax except apical region. 3). There were a lot of vesicles and vacuoles of various size or phagosomes and pinocytotic indentations in {{the upper part of the}} absorptive cells. 4). A large number of phagolysosomes were found in the middle part of the cytoplasm. 5). The plasma membrane of microvilli was lacking in trilaminal structure. 6). Polysaccharides and alkaline phosphatase were not or poorly found in the brush border. 7). Epithelial cells ingest <b>protein</b> (ferritin) without <b>decomposition.</b> The above mentioned characteristics which were found in the infantile mice suggest that toxin or toxin-like substances produced in the intestine by multiplying Vibrio cholerae will be able to be absorbed through the intestinal wall. So far, no exact knowledge on the host factor in human cholera has been obtained. However, it can be presumed that some of the factors which were indicated by the present study may be a homologous condition in the pathogeny of human cholera. 感染症において,病原体が病因として決定的な役割を演ずるのは当然であるが,同時に宿主側の条件が発症機序に大きく関与する. コレラについても例外ではなく,感染個体の発症如何は宿主生体側の条件に左右されるとが大きい. 氏家らが開発した幼若マウスにおける実験コレラでは,コレラ菌経口感染による発症率が,生後日数と確実に相関する. すなわち,生後 1 週間頃を境として発症率が著明に異なり,生後 1 ケ月以後のものでは全く発症が認められない. この実験コレラの成績に関しては,マウスの幼若性を発症のための宿主側条件の一つとして理解することが出来る. 実験コレラ発症要因としての幼若性を分析すれば,腸内細菌叢の未完成,消化酵素の欠如,腸内容の単純性さらに免疫の異常などとともに腸粘膜細胞の構造ならびに機能の未熟さを挙げることが出きよう. この研究においては,腸粘膜の構造および機能を,生后 1 週間前後ならびに 1 カ月前後のマウスについて比較し,幼若性という特質を両者の相異からみいだそうと試みた. 幼若マウスに認められた特徴は次のようであった. 1,絨毛上皮の表面はenzyme layerを欠いている. 2,絨毛上皮層の細胞間隙が広く,細胞間の結合が弱い. 3,細胞質内には大小多数の空胞,液胞あるいはPhagosomeを有し,同時に多数のpinocytotic identationを認める. 4. 細胞質内には極めて多数のPhagolysosomeが存在する. 5. Microvilliにおいては,限界膜の三層構造が不明瞭である. 6. 刷子縁における多糖類の存在およびアルカリフォスファターゼの活性は極めて乏しい. 7. 上皮細胞は蛋白質(フェリチン) を未消化(原形) のままとり込む. 以上のように,幼若マウスが示した腸膜粘の構造ならびに機能上の特異性は,腸管内においてコレラ菌が増殖した場合,その毒素または毒素様物質が容易に吸収される可能性を示している. ヒトにおけるコレラ発症の生体側要因は今日全く不明であるが,ここに幼若性を分析して得たいくつかの条件の個々あるいはそのいくつかが重さなり合って,ヒトのコレラ発症に相似の条件を呈供することもありうると思われる...|$|R
