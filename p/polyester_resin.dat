25|$|Fill {{materials}} {{are used to}} fill in missing parts or breaks in a ceramic piece in order to stabilize the piece. A wide range of materials and techniques {{have been used to}} restore losses in ceramics. Today the most common filling {{materials are}} made from calcium-sulphate-based fillers or synthetic resins based on epoxy, acrylic, or <b>polyester</b> <b>resin.</b> These new resins are stronger and do not harm the object. Removing previous filling materials, either mechanically or chemically, and replacing them with new fillers can help keep the piece strong and stable.|$|E
50|$|While it {{is common}} to {{associate}} <b>polyester</b> <b>resins</b> and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. <b>Polyester</b> <b>resins</b> are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, <b>polyester</b> <b>resins</b> are much cheaper.|$|R

25|$|A {{thermoplastic}} synthetic wax resin mixture {{developed by}} John W Burke and Steve Colton in 1997 {{can be used}} to compensate losses in objects from translucent materials such as alabaster, marble, calcite, diorite, and anhydrite. The mixture consists of polyvinyl acetate (PVAC) AYAC, ethylene acrylic acid (EAA) copolymers A-C 540, and 580, antioxidants Irganox 1076 or 1035, dry pigments, marble powder, and other additives which were all melted together. This wax resin is a better substitute to wax-resins because wax collects dust and dirt and make the fill noticeable. <b>Polyester</b> <b>resin</b> and epoxies are toxic and noxious. The wax-resin is fast and easy to use, making it a possible new alternative to fill materials in the conservation field. The wax-resin works best on losses that allow for large contact with the original, primed surface and on losses that are thicker than 1/16in. Shallow losses and small gaps are more difficult due to the ease in which the fill is pulled out.|$|E
500|$|The Honda Juno {{had been}} the first scooter to use <b>polyester</b> <b>resin,</b> or {{fiberglass}} reinforced plastic (FRP), bodywork, and even though production of the Juno had stopped in 1954 as a result of Honda Motor's financial and labor problems at the time, Fujisawa continued to encourage research in <b>polyester</b> <b>resin</b> casting techniques, and these efforts bore fruit for the Super Cub. The new motorcycle's fairing would be polyethylene, the most widely used plastic, which reduced weight over FRP, but Honda's supplier had never made such a large die cast before, so the die had to be provided by Honda. The Super Cub was the first motorcycle ever to use a plastic fairing. Motorcycling historian Clement Salvadori wrote that the plastic front fender and leg shields were, [...] "perhaps the Cub's greatest contribution; plastic did the job just as well as metal at considerably lower cost." [...] The technology developed in the Isle of Man TT racing program was equally vital to the new lightweight motorcycle, making possible [...] from a 50cc four-stroke Honda engine, where the first engine the company built a decade earlier, a [...] "fairly exact copy" [...] of the 50cc two stroke war-surplus Tohatsu engine Honda had been selling as motorized bicycle auxiliary engine, had only a [...] output.

2500|$|Most modern {{surfboards}} {{are made}} of fiberglass foam (PU), {{with one or more}} wooden strips or [...] "stringers", fiberglass cloth, and <b>polyester</b> <b>resin</b> (PE). An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.|$|E
2500|$|Scipionyx was {{discovered}} {{in the spring of}} 1981 by Giovanni Todesco, an amateur paleontologist, in the small Le Cavere quarry {{at the edge of the}} village of Pietraroja, approximately seventy kilometers northeast of Naples. The specimen was preserved in the marine Pietraroja limestone formation or Plattenkalk, well known for unusually well-conserved fossils. Todesco thought the remains belonged to an extinct bird. He prepared the strange discovery in the basement of his house in San Giovanni Ilarione near Verona, removing, without the use of any optical instrument, part of the chalk matrix from the top of the bones and covering them with vinyl glue. He strengthened the stone plate by adding pieces to its rim and on one of these he added a fake tail made from <b>polyester</b> <b>resin</b> as that of the fossil was largely lacking because he had failed to recover it completely. In early 1993 Todesco, who had nicknamed the animal cagnolino, [...] "little doggie", after its toothy jaws, brought the specimen to the attention of paleontologist Giorgio Teruzzi of the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano, who identified it as the juvenile of a theropod dinosaur and nicknamed it Ambrogio after the patron saint of Milan, Ambrose. Not being an expert in the field of dinosaur studies himself, he called in the help of colleague Father Giuseppe Leonardi. In Italy such finds are by law State property and Todesco was convinced by science reporter Franco Capone to report the discovery to the authorities: on 15 October 1993 Todesco personally delivered the fossil to the Archaeological Directorship at Naples. The specimen was added to the collection of the regional Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici di Salerno, Avellino, Benevento e Caserta in Salerno, to which it officially still belongs; on 19 April 2002 it was given its own display at the Museo Archeologico di Benevento.|$|E

40|$|For {{unsaturated}} <b>polyester</b> <b>resins</b> {{combined with}} thermoplastic resins, microstructure nd volume changes were observed {{both before and}} after curing. The shrinkage-reduction (so-called low profile mechanism) of unsaturated <b>polyester</b> <b>resins</b> was studied in relation to miscible single-phase and immiscible two-phase systems. In the case of a two-phase system, shrinkage-reduction is due to formation of voids in the dispersed phase. These voids are generated by both the volume expansion of the dispersed phase and the difference in thermal contraction between the matrix phase and the dispersed phase. On the other hand, shrinkage-reduction of a single-phase system is due to the generation of continuous voids among granulated cross-linked polymers. The granulation is caused by incompatibility between the cross-linked polymer and shrinkage-reducing additives. The size of granulated resins is one of the important factors for shrinkage-reduction. A single-phase system has optimum curing temperature for low profile, and does not always require high reactivity for unsaturated <b>polyester</b> <b>resins.</b> It is suggested that the shrinkage-reducing effect depends on both the glass transition temperature and the difference in solubility parameter between unsaturated <b>polyester</b> <b>resins</b> and shrinkage-reducing additives for various thermoplastics. Therefore, the shrinkage ratio can be approximately estimated by using the expansion coefficient of shrinkage-reducing additives and a parameter determining the ratio of the two phases...|$|R
