25|$|Spironolactone has weak <b>progestogenic</b> <b>{{activity}}</b> in bioassays. Its {{actions in}} this regard {{are a result of}} direct agonist activity at the PR, though with a very low half-maximal potency. Spironolactone's <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> has been suggested to be involved in some of its side effects, including the menstrual irregularities seen in women and the undesirable serum lipid profile changes that are seen at higher doses. It has also been suggested to augment the gynecomastia caused by the estrogenic effects of spironolactone, as progesterone is known to be involved in mammary gland development.|$|E
25|$|Pincus {{asked his}} {{contacts}} at pharmaceutical companies {{to send him}} chemical compounds with <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> Chang screened nearly 200 chemical compounds in animals and found the three most promising were Syntex's norethisterone and Searle's noretynodrel and norethandrolone.|$|E
25|$|Many 19-nortestosterone derivatives, {{including}} nandrolone, trenbolone, ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), metribolone (R-1881), trestolone, 11β-MNT, dimethandrolone, and others, are potent agonists of the progesterone receptor (AR) {{and hence}} are progestogens {{in addition to}} AAS. Similarly {{to the case of}} estrogenic activity, the <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of these drugs serves to augment their antigonadotropic activity. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as s and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility).|$|E
30|$|Tibolone [(7 _, 17 _)- 17 -hydroxy- 7 -methyl- 19 -norpropen- 5 (10)-en- 20 -yn- 3 -one] is a steroid that {{exhibits}} weak estrogenic, <b>progestogenic,</b> and androgenic <b>activity</b> and {{has been}} shown to have a beneficial effect on climacteric vasomotor symptoms and on depressed mood [12]. Combined estrogenic, androgenic, and <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activities</b> exert a positive synergistic effect on certain target organs, e.g., the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and antagonistic or complementary effects on others, e.g., endometrium. The effect of tibolone on endometrium is inhibitory as progestogenic-androgenic activity is dominant. Tibolone, being a non-bleeding form of hormone replacement therapy, is recommended in postmenopausal symptomatic women who had hormone-dependent tumors such as endometriosis in the past [13]. The drug is used to treat the vasomotor symptoms of women with endometriosis, as it is presumed to show minimal stimulative effect on ectopic endometrial tissue [14]. However, Davies et al. reported a postmenopausal case that showed exacerbation of adenomyosis while receiving tibolone [15].|$|R
50|$|Although the {{reduction}} of sex steroid levels with CPA is predominantly mediated by its <b>progestogenic</b> and antigonadotropic <b>activities,</b> inhibition of steroidogenic enzymes by the drug may also contribute to this to some extent.|$|R
40|$|Red clover Trifolium pratense L., Fabaceae, {{contains}} four isoflavones, mainly formononetin and biochanin A, and {{in smaller}} concentrations, daidzein and genistein. These compounds have gained a lot interest {{due to its}} human health benefits, such as estrogenic and <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activities,</b> antioxidant, anti-cancer and others. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine in vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of red clover dry extract. The in vitro anti-inflammatory activity was assayed by the technique using the Boyden chamber method, evaluating the leukocyte migration inhibition (chemotaxis). The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity was tested by a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test. The results of anti-inflammatory in vitro test showed that there was a significant inhibition of leukocyte migration at the concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 10 and 5 µg/mL of red clover dry extract, these doses resulted in 94. 73, 95. 39, 94. 73, 84. 68 and 78. 75 % of inhibition for each dose, respectively. The anti-inflammatory in vivo test resulted in a significant activity in both tested doses (100 and 50 mg/kg of red clover dry extract) and at each tested time. The average percentage of edema inhibition was 63. 37 %. The findings of this study suggested that red clover extract might be suitable for the treatment of inflammatory diseases...|$|R
25|$|Norethisterone (NET), {{also known}} as norethindrone, is a {{medication}} that is used in combination with estrogen or alone in hormonal contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and {{in the treatment of}} gynecological disorders. It is a synthetic progestogen (or a progestin) of the 19-nortestosterone group and has similar effects to those of natural progesterone, including suppression of gonadotropins, ovulation inhibition, and endometrial transformation. In addition to its <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity,</b> NET also has weak androgenic and estrogenic effects at high dosages. In addition to NET itself, several prodrugs of NET, such as norethisterone acetate (NETA), norethisterone enanthate (NETE), and others, have been marketed and have similar effects and uses.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{endogenous}} {{testosterone levels}} may {{also contribute to}} differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. AR agonists are antigonadotropic – that is, they dose-dependently suppress gonadal testosterone production and hence reduce systemic testosterone concentrations. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body {{with that of the}} exogenous AAS, the myotrophic-androgenic ratio would be expected to be further increased, and this hence may be yet an additional mechanism contributing to the differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio. In addition, some AAS, such as nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> might further increase the myotrophic-androgenic ratio for a given AAS.|$|E
25|$|NET {{displays}} 8 {{times higher}} progestational activity than progesterone. It {{is also a}} potent progestogen and binds to the PR with approximately 150% of the affinity of progesterone. In contrast, its parent compounds, testosterone, nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), and ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), have 2%, 22%, and 44% of the relative binding affinity of progesterone for the PR. Unlike NET, its major active metabolite 5α-dihydro-NET (5α-DHNET), which is formed by 5α-reductase, {{has been found to}} possess both progestogenic and marked antiprogestogenic activity, although its affinity for the PR is greatly reduced relative to NET at only 25% of that of progesterone. NET produces similar changes in the endometrium and vagina and is similarly thermogenic in women compared to progesterone, which is in accordance with its <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|NET, {{also known}} as 17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethynylestra-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically a derivative of testosterone in which an ethynyl group has been added at the C17α position and the methyl group at the C19 position has been removed; hence, it is a combined derivative of ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). These modifications result in gaining <b>progestogenic</b> and oral <b>activity</b> and reducing androgenic activity.|$|R
50|$|Medrysone (INN, USAN) (brand names HMS, Medrocort, others; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} NSC-63278), {{also known as}} hydroxymethylprogesterone, methylhydroxyprogesterone, or hydroxymesterone, as well as 6α-methyl-11β-hydroxyprogesterone or 6α-methyl-11β-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic glucocorticoid that is or {{has been used in}} the treatment of inflammatory eye diseases. It has been discontinued in the United States. Although it is very similar in structure to progesterone, neither <b>progestogenic</b> nor androgenic <b>activity</b> has been demonstrated for or attributed to medrysone.|$|R
50|$|OHPC {{has been}} used to treat benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} in men, although evidence of effectiveness is marginal and uncertain. The mechanism of action of OHPC in this use is suppression of testicular androgen production via suppression of luteinizing hormone secretion, which are the result of the <b>progestogenic</b> and antigonadotropic <b>activity</b> of OHPC. However, symptoms of hypogonadism may develop when OHPC is used for this indication, with two-thirds of men reportedly experiencing impotence.|$|R
25|$|Spironolactone, {{also known}} as 7α-acetylthiospirolactone, is a steroidal 17α-spirolactone, or more simply a spirolactone. It can most {{appropriately}} be conceptualized as a derivative of progesterone (itself also a potent antimineralocorticoid) in which a hydroxyl group has been substituted at the C17α position (as in 17α-hydroxyprogesterone), the acetyl group at the C17β position has been cyclized with the C17α hydroxyl group to form a spiro 21-carboxylic acid γ-lactone ring, and an acetylthio group has been substituted at the C7α position. These structural modifications of progesterone confer increased oral bioavailability and potency, potent antiandrogenic activity, and greatly reduced <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> The C7α substitution is likely responsible for or involved in the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone, as 7α-thioprogesterone (SC-8365) is a potent antiandrogen with similar affinity to the AR as that of spironolactone.|$|E
25|$|In women, menstrual {{disturbances}} {{are common}} during spironolactone treatment, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses {{and almost all}} experiencing them at a high doses. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop amenorrhea, and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an irregular, anovulatory pattern of menstrual cycles. It is also associated with metrorrhagia and menorrhagia (or menometrorrhagia) in {{a large percentage of}} women. It has no birth control effect. It has been suggested that the weak <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of spironolactone is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and spironolactone has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{has been}} widely stated that the menstrual {{irregularities}} associated with spironolactone are due to its <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity,</b> and although animal studies (involving both rabbits and rhesus monkeys) have shown clear progestogenic effects, the dosages of spironolactone used in animals to produce progestogenic effects were very high, and no evidence of progestogenic nor antiprogestogenic effects (as assessed by endometrial changes) have been observed in women even with high clinical dosages of spironolactone treatment. As such, {{it has been}} stated that the progestogenic potency of spironolactone is {{below the level of}} clinical significance in humans and that the menstrual abnormalities associated with the drug must have a different cause. Other possible mechanisms of the menstrual disturbances associated with spironolactone that have been suggested include interference with the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, inhibition of enzymatic steroidogenesis, and mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity.|$|E
40|$|Here, we {{analyzed}} the transcriptional {{effects of the}} antiprogestin mifepristone (MIF, RU 486) and progesterone (P 4) in zebrafish {{as well as their}} in vitro activities in yeast-based reporter gene assays. This study is associated with the reproduction study in adult zebrafish and embryos exposed for 21 days to 5, 39, 77 ng/L MIF, and 25 ng/L P 4 (Blüthgen et al., 2013 a). The in vitro activities of MIF and P 4 were investigated using a series of recombinant yeast-based assays (YES, YAS, YPS) and compared to transcriptional alterations obtained in fish tissues and embryos from the exposure study. MIF elicited antiestrogenic, androgenic and <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activities</b> in recombinant yeast, similar to P 4, and no antiprogestogenic activity in vitro. The transcriptional alterations of steroid hormone receptors were similar in adult males and females, and more pronounced in embryos. MIF tended to transcriptionally down-regulate the androgen (ar), progesterone (pgr) and glucocorticoid (gr) receptors in adult fish and embryos. Transcripts of the estrogen receptor (esr 1) and vitellogenin (vtg 1) were not significantly altered. A trend for down-regulation was observed for transcripts of genes belonging to steroidogenic enzymes including 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (hsd 17 b 3), 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsd 3 b), P 450 aromatase A (cyp 19 a) and 11 β-hydroxylase (cyp 11 b). P 4 resulted in similar transcriptional alterations as MIF. The data indicate that gene expression changes (here and later gene expression is taken as synonym to gene transcription) and in vitro activities match only in part including the lack of antiprogestogenic activity of MIF. Additionally, effects on reproduction and gonad histology described in the associated report (Blüthgen et al., 2013 a) can only partly be explained by gene expression data presented here...|$|R
50|$|Via its weak <b>progestogenic</b> and {{androgenic}} <b>activity,</b> through {{activation of}} the PR and AR in the pituitary gland, danazol produces antigonadotropic effects. Although its does not significantly affect basal luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in premenopausal women (and hence does not profoundly suppress gonadotropin or sex hormone levels like other, stronger antigonadotropins do), the drug prevents the mid-cycle surge in the levels of these hormones during the menstrual cycle. By doing this, it suppresses increases in estrogen and progesterone levels at this time and prevents ovulation.|$|R
5000|$|DIMP (developmental {{code name}} Ro 7-8117), or N-(3,5-dimethyl-4-isoxazolylmethyl)phthalimide, is a nonsteroidal {{antiandrogen}} (NSAA) structurally related to thalidomide (which also binds to and antagonizes the androgen receptor (AR)) that was first described in 1973 {{and was never}} marketed. Along with flutamide, {{it was one of}} the earliest NSAAs to be discovered, and for this reason, has been described as a [...] "classical" [...] NSAA. The drug is a selective, competitive, silent antagonist of the AR, although it is described as an [...] "only relatively weak competitor". DIMP possesses no androgenic, estrogenic, <b>progestogenic,</b> or antigonadotropic <b>activity,</b> but it does reverse the antigonadotropic effects of testosterone, indicating that, like other pure AR antagonists, it is progonadotropic.|$|R
25|$|Dydrogesterone is {{a highly}} {{selective}} progestogen, and due to its unique structure, unlike progesterone and many other progestins, binds almost exclusively to the progesterone receptor (PR). The affinity of dydrogesterone for the PR is relatively low at about 16% of that of progesterone. However, in vivo, dydrogesterone is much more potent in comparison, with an equivalent dose, in terms of endometrial proliferation, that is 10 to 20 times {{lower than that of}} progesterone. This is due to pharmacokinetic differences between the two drugs, namely improved bioavailability and metabolic stability with dydrogesterone as well as additional <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of its metabolites. Although dydrogesterone binds to both isoforms of the PR and has similar activity as an agonist of the PRB as progesterone, its agonistic activity is weak {{in the case of the}} PRA. Hence, dydrogesterone shows selectivity for activation of the PRB. This could potentially confer a therapeutic advantage, as the two receptor isoforms induce different physiological responses in target tissues.|$|E
2500|$|As an AAS, {{methyltestosterone}} is an agonist of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is a substrate for 5α-reductase like testosterone, {{and so is}} potentiated analogously in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland via transformation into the more potent AR agonist mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT). As such, methyltestosterone has a relatively low ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS. Due to efficient aromatization into the potent and metabolism-resistant estrogen methylestradiol (17α-methylestradiol), methyltestosterone has relatively high estrogenicity and hence potential for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia and fluid retention. The drug possesses negligible <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Whereas 11-ketoprogesterone and 11β-hydroxyprogesterone are {{virtually}} devoid of <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> (although 11β-hydroxyprogesterone {{has been reported}} to possess about 1% of the <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of progesterone), the <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of BKP is restored and is in fact relatively high. In contrast, 9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxyprogesterone has much lower <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> with only about 8 times that of 11β-hydroxyprogesterone. In addition, whereas 9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxyprogesterone has pronounced mineralocorticoid effects, BKP lacks such effects.|$|E
50|$|Due to its progonadotropic {{effects in}} males, unlike CPA, {{cyproterone}} has been found, in male rodents, to increase testicular weight, increase {{the total number}} of type A spermatogonia, increase {{the total number of}} Sertoli cells, hyperstimulate the Leydig cells, and to have almost no effect on spermatogenesis. Conversely, it has also been reported for male rodents that spermiogenesis is inhibited and that accessory sexual gland weights (e.g., prostate gland, seminal vesicles) and fertility were markedly reduced, although with rapid recovery from the changes upon cessation of treatment. In any case, the drug is said to not be an effective antispermatogenic agent, whereas CPA is effective. Also unlike CPA, due to its lack of <b>progestogenic</b> and antigonadotropic <b>activity,</b> cyproterone does not suppress ovulation in women.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of gestrinone is complex and multifaceted. It shows high affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), as well as lower affinity for the androgen receptor (AR). The drug has mixed <b>progestogenic</b> and antiprogestogenic <b>activity</b> - that is, it is a partial agonist of the PR or a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) - and is a weak agonist of the AR, or an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS). Similarly to danazol, gestrinone acts as a weak antigonadotropin via activation of the PR and AR in the pituitary gland and suppresses the mid-cycle surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) during the menstrual cycle without affecting basal levels of these hormones. It also inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis and, via activation of the AR in the liver, decreases circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby resulting in increased levels of free testosterone. In addition to the PR and AR, gestrinone {{has been found to}} bind to the estrogen receptor (ER) with relatively [...] "avid" [...] affinity. The drug has functional antiestrogenic activity in the endometrium. Unlike danazol, gestrinone does not appear to bind to SHBG or corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG).|$|R
5000|$|Flutamide {{has been}} found to be {{similarly}} effective in the treatment of prostate cancer to bicalutamide, although indications of superior efficacy, including greater compensatory increases in testosterone levels and greater reductions in PSA levels, were observed with bicalutamide. Flutamide, at a dosage of 750 mg/day (250 mg three times daily), has also been found to be equivalent in effectiveness to 250 mg/day oral cyproterone acetate as a monotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer in a large-scale clinical trial of 310 patients, though its side effect and toxicity profile (including gynecomastia, diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, and liver disturbances) was regarded as considerably worse than that of cyproterone acetate. In contrast to the case of men, flutamide {{has been found}} to be significantly more effective than cyproterone acetate (as well as another steroidal antiandrogen, spironolactone) in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions such as acne and hirsutism in women. This sex difference in effectiveness may be related to the fact that flutamide significantly increases androgen levels in men, which counteracts its antiandrogen efficacy, but does not increase androgen levels in women. (In contrast to flutamide, cyproterone acetate, due to its <b>progestogenic</b> and antigonadotropic <b>activity,</b> does not increase and rather suppresses androgen levels in both sexes.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... 11-Ketoprogesterone is {{reportedly}} devoid of androgenic, estrogenic, and <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> 11β-Hydroxyprogesterone {{has also been}} reported to be devoid of <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity,</b> but has subsequently been reported to possess about 1% of the <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of progesterone. A halogenated derivative of 11-ketoprogesterone, 9α-bromo-11-ketoprogesterone, possesses relatively high <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> Similarly to 11α-hydroxyprogesterone and 11β-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-ketoprogesterone is reported to act as an inhibitor of the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

Its analogue, SC-5233, possesses similar but less potent <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> In addition, SC-5233 has been assessed and found to possess some antiandrogen activity, antagonizing the effects of testosterone in animals, and SC-8109 may as well.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Postmenopausal {{women are}} prone to develop {{functional}} disabilities {{as a result of}} reduction in muscle strength and muscle mass caused by diminished levels of female sex hormones. While hormone replacement therapy may counteract these changes, conventional hormone replacement therapy is associated with potential harmful effects, such as an increased risk of breast cancer, and its prescription is not recommended. For this reason newer alternative drugs, such as tibolone, a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, <b>progestogenic</b> and androgenic <b>activity,</b> and raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, may be more appropriate. This trial investigates the effect of tibolone and raloxifene on muscle strength. Methods We recruited 318 elderly women in our single-center randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized to tibolone 1. 25 mg (Org OD 14, Organon NV, the Netherlands) plus placebo, raloxifene 60 mg (Evista ®, Eli Lilly, United States) plus placebo or two placebo tablets daily for 24 months. The primary aim is to determine if {{there is a difference between}} tibolone and placebo or if there is a difference between raloxifene and placebo. Primary endpoints are muscle strength and bone mineral density. The secondary endpoints are postural balance, body composition, cognitive function, anxiety, mood and quality of life. The secondary aim is to determine if there is a difference between tibolone and raloxifene. The measure of effect is the change from the baseline visit to the visits after 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. A follow-up measurement is planned at 30 months to determine whether any effects are sustained after cessation of the study. By December 2007 the blind will be broken and the data analyzed.

40|$|Objectives: Sarcopenia, {{the loss}} of muscle mass with age, has {{a great impact on}} {{physical}} function, and especially in postmenopausal women, who experience a greater decline in muscle strength than do men of similar age. Conventional hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may diminish this loss of muscle strength and may even increase muscle strength. However, HRT is not currently promoted for this indication because of its negative side effects, which is why tibolone, a synthetic steroid with oestrogenic, <b>progestogenic,</b> and androgenic <b>activity,</b> may be an alternative option. The aim of this article was to review data on the effect of HRT and tibolone on muscle strength and body composition in postmenopausal women. Methods: Medline, Pubmed, Embase, and Sumsearch were searched for articles on the effect of HRT and tibolone on muscle strength and body composition, using the Mesh terms hormone replacement therapy and clinical trial combined with muscle strength or body composition. Tibolone was added as search term with clinical trial and muscle strength or body composition. Results: Three of five randomized controlled trials reported a significant positive effect of HRT on muscle strength but not on body composition. Tibolone significantly increased handgrip strength and isometric knee extension strength in one randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind trial and increased mean knee extensor strength in one cross-sectional study. Tibolone also increased the lean body mass and decreased the accumulation of body fat. Conclusions: HRT and tibolone increase muscle strength. Unlike HRT, tibolone also increases lean body mass and significantly reduces the total body fat content. Further research is recommended to determine whether tibolone is a safe treatment for sarcopenia. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|For decades, {{hormone therapy}} (HT) {{has been the}} {{mainstay}} for managing menopausal symptoms. However, the prolonged use of either single estrogen therapy (ET) or a combination therapy of estrogen and progestogen (EPT) might {{be associated with a}} slightly increased risk of breast cancer. Alternative therapies that are effective in the prevention and/or treatment of menopause, having associated morbidities but no unwanted effects, are of primary interest in clinical practice. Tibolone (Livial; NV Organon, Oss, The Netherlands) is structurally related to 19 -nortestosterone derivatives and is a new postmenopausal regimen with a unique pharmacological profile, licensed for the relief of climacteric symptoms and the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Tibolone exhibits weak estrogenic, <b>progestogenic,</b> and androgenic <b>activities,</b> which in theory might influence the breast. The effect of tibolone on breast tissue, however, is obscure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effects of tibolone on breast safety, and the collected data include preclinical models, clinical observation, and epidemiologic study. Although in vitro studies showed conflicting results (with the majority being favorable effects) regarding the effects of tibolone on breast cells, in vivo studies showed favorable effects of tibolone on the breast in animal models. Similarly, an epidemiologic study indicated an increased risk of breast cancer when tibolone was used to manage climacteric symptoms of postmenopausal women, but accumulated data obtained from radiologic studies (mammography) showed a possible protective effect of tibolone on the breast. Taken together, we conclude that tibolone, if not superior to conventional HT, may be more acceptable to clinicians as a therapeutic drug option for use with symptomatic menopausal women. Only time will tell whether tibolone will be the preferred option...|$|R

It was first synthesized in 1944 {{in the form of}} a mixture that also included unnatural stereoisomers (probably C14 (β) and C17 (α)) of progesterone, and this mixture was found to be at least equivalent to progesterone in terms of <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> Subsequent investigations revealed that 17-isoprogesterone and 14-iso-17-isoprogesterone are devoid of <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> 19-Norprogesterone was resynthesized in 1951 with an improved method, and was confirmed to be the component of the mixture synthesized in 1944 that was responsible for its <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> In 1953, a paper was published showing that 19-norprogesterone possessed 4- to 8-fold the activity of progesterone in the Clauberg assay in rabbits, and at the time of this discovery, 19-norprogesterone was the most potent progestogen known.|$|E
50|$|Spironolactone has weak <b>progestogenic</b> <b>{{activity}}</b> in bioassays.

40|$|The uterus {{is a major}} hormone-responsive {{reproductive}} organ in primates. Hormones promote their effect via different pathways. Receptors involved in steroid hormone, thyroid hormone and insulin signaling {{have been found in}} the endometrium. Several lines of evidence suggest that endocrine and metabolic disturbances may affect the endometrium adversely, leading to abnormalities and reproductive failure. This has stimulated research on factors and potential mechanisms that are related to endometrial dysfunction. The overall aim of this project was to increase the understanding of hormone receptor regulation of the primate uterus, and in particular to investigate the effects of different hormone treatments and lifestyle intervention on endometrial receptor expression. In paper I and II, 88 ovariectomized cynomolgus macaques were treated with conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), a combination of CEE + medroxyprogesterone acetate or tibolone (TIB), a compound with estrogenic, <b>progestogenic</b> and androgenic <b>activity.</b> At the end of the treatment period uterine tissues were collected and the presence and localization of receptors for steroid hormone and thyroid hormone signaling were investigated. In contrast to conventional hormone treatment, TIB treatment did not decrease the immunostaining of estrogen receptors in the endometrium of macaque uterus. However, androgen receptor expression in endometrial stroma in this group was higher as compared to controls, which could be one mechanism to explain the endometrial atrophy and beneficial bleeding profile that is associated with TIB treatment. Immunostaining of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor and thyroid hormone receptors was detected in all compartments of macaque uterus. Their expression was affected in a specific way by long-term sex hormone treatment. Thus, TRH, TSH and thyroid hormones may have direct effects on the endometrium and thereby influence its function. In paper III and IV, 20 overweight/obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (OBPCOS) were recruited to a three months lifestyle intervention, aiming at weight reduction. Endometrial biopsies were collected at mid-proliferative and mid-secretory phases of the menstrual cycle. The endometrial expression of receptors involved in insulin and estrogen signaling was evaluated. Gene and protein expression of molecules involved in insulin signaling was up-regulated following lifestyle intervention, indicating improvement of glucose homeostasis and thereby endometrial functioning in these women. Moreover, lifestyle intervention influenced estrogen receptor expression towards normalization in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. In six OB-PCOS women ovulation was confirmed. Despite restored ovulation, endometrial expression of the proliferation marker Ki 67 was higher in the secretory phase of OB-PCOS women as compared to controls. The elevated endometrial expression of the non-genomic estrogen receptor, G-protein coupled estrogen receptor- 1, may be proposed as one mechanism behind the high proliferation activity in PCOS women...|$|R

Along with ethisterone (1938) and 19-norprogesterone (1951), 17α-MP {{was one of}} the earliest derivatives of progesterone to be identified as possessing <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity.</b> Similarly to progesterone and derivatives like 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 19-norprogesterone, 17α-MP was found to possess poor (though not negligible) oral bioavailability, but showed improved <b>progestogenic</b> <b>activity</b> relative to progesterone when administered via other routes (e.g., subcutaneous or vaginal). In addition to its activity as a progestogen, 17α-MP has also been found to possess some antiglucocorticoid activity.|$|E
