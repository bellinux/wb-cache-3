50|$|The depositional {{profile of}} the {{northern}} Banc d'Arguin describes a flat-topped platform, on which extensive carbonate deposits developed largely in water depths <10 meters below sea level (mbsl).

These sediments accumulate into extensive shoals, occasionally causing water depths below 5 mbsl several dozens kilometers offshore the present shoreline.

40|$|A {{structural}} map of Oscar I 1 Land compiled using {{black and}} white, stereo-pair air photos and other available information sources suggests {{the existence of}} three structural zones within the deformed <b>platform</b> <b>cover</b> strata. The western zone consists of basement involved overthrusts of complex geometry {{in the north and}} large-scale folds of <b>platform</b> <b>cover</b> strata with a stepped, down to the east profile in the south. The central zone consists primarily of folds within Kapp Starostin Fm. and overlying Triassic strata that likely formed above a subhorizontal dkcollement within Gipshuken Fm. strata. Farther to the east thrusts cmplace Permian Kapp Starostin Fm. strata over Triassic strata. This zone probably represents stratigraphic climb of the basal decollement. Conservative estimates of shortening for the central and eastern zones are in the 15 - 25 % range. The contribution of the western zone structures to overall Tertiary shortening depends on the geometry of faults underlying the stepped folds and is uncertain at present. Changes along strike are in part due to differential levels of erosion and changes in transport direction, but also probably important was variable thickness of the <b>platform</b> <b>cover</b> strata involved (less to the north) and the availability of incompetent horizons along which thrust-flats could form.

40|$|Air photo {{interpretation}} {{along with}} limited field {{work is the}} basis of a compilation map of Tertiary structures in the Upper Paleozoic through Mesozoic <b>platform</b> <b>cover</b> strata of Nordenskiold Land. Permian Kapp Starostin Formation strata form a continuous marker horizon delineating both a large NE-verging fold complex, which involves the basement (Hecla Hoek sequence) through basal Tertiary strata, and somewhat smaller scale folds, some of which may have formed in association with detachments and thrusts within the <b>platform</b> <b>cover</b> sequence. The map pattern is both a function of local structural plunge and changes in fold geometry along strike. Regional considerations suggest that subsurface basement-involved thrusts exist. In S Nordenskiold Land, to the E of folded Kapp Starostin Formation strata, a 3. 5 km wide zone of folding and thrusting in Triassic and Jurassic strata above a subhorizontal decollement is inferred to occur.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{structural}} geology and geomorphology of the fault zones in the junction area of the Angara-Lena uplift and the Predbaikalsky trough. We have analyzed faults and folds and reconstructed paleostresses for this junction area named the Irkutsk amphitheatre. Our study shows that syn-fold (Middle Paleozoic) faults include thrusts, reverse faults and strike-slip faults with reverse components, that occurred due to compression from the neighbouring folded region. Recently, contrary to compression, faulting took place under the conditions of extension of the sedimentary cover: most of these recent faults have been classified as normal faults. In the Late Cenozoic, the <b>platform</b> <b>cover</b> was subjected to brittle and partly plicative deformation due to the NW–SE-trending extension that is most clearly observed in the adjacent Baikal rift. Thus, the divergent boundary between the Siberian block of the North Eurasian plate and the Transbaikalia block of the Amur plate is a zone of dynamic influence, which occupies the area considerably exceeding the mountainous region on the Siberian platform. Important factors of faulting are differentiated vertical movements of the blocks comprising the platform. Such vertical movements might have been related to displacements of brine volumes.

40|$|Meta-peridotites {{outcropping}} {{at different}} structural levels within the Alpine metamorphic complex of the Cycladic island of Naxos were studied to re-examine their metamorphic evolution and possible tectonic mechanisms for emplacement of mantle material into the continental crust. The continental margin section exposed on Naxos, consisting of pre-Alpine basement and c. 7 km thick Mesozoic <b>platform</b> <b>cover,</b> has undergone intense metamorphism of Alpine age, comprising an Eocene (M 1) blueschist event strongly overprinted by a Miocene Barrovian-type event (M 2). Structural concordance {{with the country}} rocks and metasomatic zonation at the contact with the felsic host rocks indicate that the meta-peridotites have experienced the M 2 metamorphism. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} similarity between metamorphic temperatures of the ultrabasic rocks and those of the host rocks. Maximum temperatures of 730 – 760 °C were calculated for the upper-amphibolite facies meta-peridotites (Fo–En–Hbl–Chl–Spl), associated with sillimanite gneisses and migmatites. Relict phases in ultrabasics of different structural levels indicate two distinct pre-M 2 histories: whereas the cover-associated horizons have been affected by low-grade serpentinization prior to metamorphism, the basement- associated meta-peridotites show no signs of serpentinization and instead preserve some of their original mantle assemblage. The geochemical affinities of the two groups are also different. The basement-associated meta-peridotites retain their original composition indicating derivation by fractional partial melting of primitive lherzolite, whereas serpentinization has led to almost complete Ca-loss in the second group. The cover-associated ultrabasics are interpreted as remnants of an ophiolite sequence obducted on the adjacent continental shelf early in the Alpine orogenesis. In contrast, the basement-associated meta-peridotites were tectonically interleaved with the Naxos section at great depth during the Alpine collision and high P/T metamorphism. Their emplacement {{at the base of the}} orogenic wedge is inferred to have involved isobaric cooling from temperatures of c. 1050 °C within the spinel lherzolite field to eclogite facies temperatures of c. 600 °C...|$|E
