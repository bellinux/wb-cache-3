5|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen present in {{seawater}} depends primarily upon its temperature and the photosynthetic organisms living in it, particularly algae, phytoplankton, and {{plants such as}} seagrass. During the day, their <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>activity</b> produces oxygen, which dissolves into the seawater and is used by marine animals. The water's oxygen saturation is lower during the night and much lower in the deep sea. Below a depth of about , there is insufficient light for photosynthesis and consequently little dissolved oxygen. Below this, anaerobic bacteria break down falling organic material, producing hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). It is projected that global warming will reduce oxygen both in surface and deep waters, due to oxygen's decreased solubility as temperatures increase and increased oceanic stratification.|$|E

40|$|While photosystem II (PSII) {{of plants}} {{utilizes}} light for photosynthesis, {{part of the}} absorbed energy may be reverted back and dissipated as long-term fluorescence (delayed fluorescence or DF).

30|$|The heat {{pretreatment}} completely inhibited {{the light}} reaction of photosynthesis (Figure  2 A).

40|$|In Zea mays (maize), <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>activities</b> are {{partitioned}} {{between two}} morphologically and biochemically distinct cell types, mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (BS). These cells are organized as concentric files around the vasculature and functionally cooperate in fixing carbon for photosynthesis. Partitioning of <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>activities</b> between M and BS cells is mediated by cell-specific localization of transcripts and proteins. However, regulation {{of this process}} is poorly understood. Here, we utilize two mutants, hcf 136 and bsd 2, which are selectively disrupted in M or BS cell development, respectively, to dissect the relative importance of sugar, energy metabolites and photosystem II protein complex formation in establishing functional M and BS transcriptional networks. RNA transcript profiling was performed on isolated M and BS cells of WT and mutant siblings, followed by comparative analysis between the two mutants. The results suggest that M and BS transcripts are autonomously regulated by different signals. National Science Foundation (grant no.

However, its reproductive characteristics, especially those of oogenesis and the concomitant changes in <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>activities,</b> remained uncertain.

Thalli of S. horneri were dioecious, the oogonial conceptacles maturing acropetally on the axillary receptacles. Conceptacles were originated from the epidermal cells, the cells lining the inner surface of the cavity ultimately differentiating into either sterile unbranched paraphyses or oogonia. The PSII <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>activities</b> of oogonia continuously diminished with increasing maturation. The value of F v/ F m decreased from 0. 55 ± 0. 01 for recently initiated oogonia to 0. 27 ± 0. 05 for mature oogonia.

5|$|The ocean can be {{conceptualized}} as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and {{presence or absence}} of sunlight.

The level of total chlorophyll (Chl) and soluble proteins, on a unit fresh weight basis, showed a progressive decrease upon increase in iron deficient condition. When various <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>activities</b> were followed in isolated thylakoids, iron deficiency caused inhibition of whole chain and PS II activity. Smaller inhibition of PSI activity was observed even in severely chlorotic leaves.

40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} antimycin on various <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>activities</b> were invest-igated with Chromatium vinosum chromatophores. Photophosphorylation and proton uptake under continuous illumination, the slow {{phase of the}} flash-induced proton uptake, and re-reduction of flash-oxidized cytochrome C 555 and the reaction center bacteriochlorophyll dimer were half inhibited at about 5 x 10 ~ 7 M antimycin and almost completely inhibited at about 2 x 10 ~ 5 M. JV-Methyl-phenazonium methosulfate (100 /UM) restored the inhibited activities of photophosphoryla-tion and proton uptake to the original levels. These results indicated that antimycin, as it inhibits the cyclic electron transfer in non-sulfur purple bacteria, inhibits the cyclic electron flow involving cytochrome C 555 and hence inhibits the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>activities</b> coupled to the electron flow. On the other hand, antimycin had little inhibitory effect on the proton release by whole cells of Chromatium under continuous illumination.
