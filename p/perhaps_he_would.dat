500|$|The {{historian}} Peter Hunter Blair summarises Wilfrid's life as follows: [...] "Wilfrid left {{a distinctive}} {{mark on the}} character of the English church in the seventh century. He was not a humble man, nor, so far as we can see, was he a man greatly interested in learning, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been more at home {{as a member of the}} Gallo-Roman episcopate where the wealth which gave him enemies in England would have passed unnoticed and where his interference in matters of state would have been less likely to take him to prison." [...] R. W. Southern, another modern historian, says that Wilfrid was [...] "the greatest papal enthusiast of the century". James Campbell, a historian specialising in the Anglo-Saxon period, said of him [...] "He was certainly one of the greatest ecclesiastics of his day. Ascetic, deemed a saint by some, the founder of several monasteries according to the rule of St Benedict, he established Christianity in Sussex and attempted to do so in Frisia. At the same time, his life and conduct were in some respects like those of a great Anglo-Saxon nobleman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps to {{demonstrate}} more clearly {{the inability of}} music to express absolute evil, Verdi therefore attaches to Francesco Moor's terrible words a melody which would eminently suit the tenderest of loves. [...] He could have used abstruse harmonies, jagged rhythms etc. etc. but he chose not to; <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have done better not to set these unfortunate words at all.|$|E
2500|$|Descartes also concedes {{two points}} that might {{allow for the}} {{possibility}} of his ability to make errors. [...] First, he notes that it is very possible that his limited knowledge prevents him from understanding why God chose to create him so he could make mistakes. [...] If he could see the things that God could see, with a complete and infinite scope, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> judge his ability to err as the best option. [...] He uses this point to attack the Aristotelian structure of causes. The final cause described by Aristotle are the [...] "what for" [...] of an object, but Descartes claims that because he is unable to comprehend completely the mind of God, it is impossible to understand completely the [...] "why" [...] through science — only the [...] "how".|$|E
6000|$|... "Show your pass," [...] {{said the}} Federal soldier, a trifle more imperiously <b>perhaps</b> than <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have thought {{necessary}} {{if he had}} not been under the eye of his commander, who with folded arms looked on from the roadside.|$|R
60|$|If only Sir Andrew Ffoulkes {{had been}} there, and Armand had had some {{one to talk}} to, <b>perhaps</b> then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have found {{sufficient}} strength of mind to wait with outward patience, even though his nerves were on the rack.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} that I cry up Brooke on any {{personal}} ground?" [...] said Will Ladislaw, nettled, and turning sharp round. For {{the first time he}} felt offended with Lydgate; not the less so, <b>perhaps,</b> because <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have declined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr. Brooke.|$|R
60|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{never get}} nearer to this mysterious jungle life {{than he was}} now.|$|E
60|$|We had an inexcusable dread that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{make a mess}} of the meeting.|$|E
60|$|She {{thought that}} even then God might reconsider it--see her point of view. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> send her a sign.|$|E
6000|$|With {{the receipt}} of this letter carpet-pattern {{projects}} would seem [...] to have suddenly {{ceased to be a}} factor in Mark Twain's calculations. [...] Such a letter {{in the early days of}} the type-machine would have saved [...] him a great sum in money and years of disappointment. But <b>perhaps</b> [...] <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have heeded it then.|$|R
60|$|She looked towards Epimetheus, as she spoke, <b>perhaps</b> {{expecting that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> commend {{her for her}} wisdom. But the sullen boy only muttered that she was wise a little too late.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{people whom}} I like," [...] she declared, [...] "I speak frankly. I give away no secrets. I say what I believe. And now I must leave {{you for a}} much subtler person and a much subtler conversation. Prince Herschfeld is waiting to talk to me. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he,</b> too, <b>would</b> like {{to know the answer}} which will go to his master, but how can I tell?" ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY TEAZLE. I am sure I wish He {{would let}} Maria marry him-- and then <b>perhaps</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> be convinced--don't you--Mr. Surface? ...|$|E
60|$|She hoped {{this would}} shock the {{stranger}} and that now, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go. It irritated her {{to hear him}} only laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We all have, have we not?' {{returned}} the stranger, looking up. 'If we were fewer in number, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> give better wages.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Villiers gazed in angry {{surprise}} at the young ensign; then thinking, <b>perhaps,</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> put himself in the wrong, and as his interferences in military matters with Sir John Cradock had not met with the success he desired for them, he checked the words that rose to his lips, and said, shortly: [...] "The convoy {{will be ready to}} start from the treasury at daybreak to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|He beckoned {{to the man}} who {{had held}} the horse and handed him half-a-crown. He glanced at Prothero as one might glance at a stranger. [...] "Check!" [...] he said. The horse went on gravely. Benham lifted out his whip. He {{appeared}} to have clean forgotten Prothero. <b>Perhaps</b> presently <b>he</b> <b>would</b> miss him. <b>He</b> went on past Trinity, past the ruddy brick of St. John's. The curve of the street hid him from Prothero's eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I <b>would.</b> If <b>he</b> turns upon you, as like enough he may, and abuses you, {{that will}} help us in one way. If he should consent, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> may, that <b>would</b> help us in the other way. I'm told he's been over and upset the whole coach at the palace." ...|$|R
60|$|Bottles agreed. Could he {{have seen}} the little scheme that was dawning in his brother's brain, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have assented so readily.|$|E
60|$|Louisa {{only thought}} of Luke and that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> feel happier {{in his mind}} if she allowed him to make this {{temporary}} sacrifice.|$|E
60|$|If Harold {{had known}} all the {{consequences}} of his neglect, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been more sorry for it than as yet he had chosen to be.|$|E
60|$|He {{was indeed}} lost, and more {{completely}} so, in {{the feeling of}} lonely isolation, <b>perhaps,</b> than <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been if lost in the backwoods of America. Yet he was not utterly lost, for the tender Shepherd was on his track. Some such thought seemed to cross his mind; for he suddenly began to pray, and thoughts about the old home in Blackby, and of the Grove family, comforted him a little until he fell asleep on his hard bed.|$|R
50|$|The Cubs {{purchased}} Gene Baker's {{contract and}} he made his major league debut September 20, 1953. A few days after acquiring Baker, the Cubs acquired another shortstop, future Hall of Famer Ernie Banks, and moved Baker to second base, <b>perhaps</b> believing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able {{to adapt to a}} different position more easily than the younger Banks. He primarily played second base for the Cubs and Pirates during eight seasons. He was a reserve infielder for the 1960 World Series champion Pirates and made three pinch-hit appearances during the Series.|$|R
60|$|But {{the future}} lay ahead after all; {{and if he}} could only be so {{fortunate}} as to get into good employment <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{put up with the}} inevitable. So he thanked God for his health and strength, and took courage. For the present he was outside the gates of everything, colleges included: <b>perhaps</b> some day <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be inside. Those palaces of light and leading; he might some day look down on the world through their panes.|$|R
60|$|And {{the little}} fellow came {{nestling}} {{up to his}} friend's breast in an access of tenderness, such as <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have disdained save in the darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} thinks of that," [...] said Marian--"I mean <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not think of your caring for the mere sight {{of him as a}} pleasure." ...|$|E
60|$|Oliver cried lustily. If {{he could}} have known {{that he was an}} orphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have cried the louder.|$|E
60|$|He {{believed}} {{it was better to}} go without explanations than be utterly cast off by the little woman whom he was rapidly beginning to love, and, in addition, forfeit her friendship forever. So long as she could only guess at the reasons for his flight, she might think of him kindly, and, <b>perhaps,</b> in time, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to prove that he was worthy of confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't {{matter if}} you disbelieve me; this is what happened," [...] Daly rejoined. [...] "My friend--we'll call him the man--went to the office {{late in the evening}} and after some talk, covered Hulton with his pistol. The lad had had some trouble about his debts, because the old man would have fired him out of the {{business}} if he'd heard of them, and his nerve wasn't good. He opened the safe when he was told and the man took the bonds and went out of the office, leaving Hulton in his chair. We don't know what the lad thought, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> saw <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be suspected or was ashamed of not showing more grit. Anyhow, when the man was on the stairs Hulton came up behind and told him to stop. He had a pistol, but looked strained and nervous, and the other, who had put his away, made a rush at him. Hulton slipped on the steps, his pistol went off, and when he rolled to the bottom the other saw he was dead." ...|$|R
5000|$|His 1989 film La noche oscura {{was entered}} into the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.Saura {{considers}} his film on surrealist master Luis Buñuel to be his best cinematic work. In an interview to an online film magazine, he says about Buñuel y la mesa del rey Salomón (Buñuel and the table of King Solomon -2001): “That’s the greatest film I’ve ever made. I like the film but nobody else seems to like it. I’m sure Buñuel would have loved this film. But <b>perhaps</b> only <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have loved it. Everything {{you see in the}} film is actually based on conversations I had with him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "N-no, I don't think so," [...] {{she said}} slowly, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{have succeeded in}} {{soothing}} her, had not a sudden thought brought back the terror to her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! Didn't he tell you? Well, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be afraid}} of its {{worrying}} you. It would be like Charley Leland, and here I have been giving him away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By all means, Sir Andrew! How should I {{venture to}} thwart the love-god again? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> mete out some terrible chastisement against my presumption. Burn your love-token, by all means!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Joe Goodman {{had long}} since {{returned}} to California, it being clear [...] that nothing could be gained by remaining in Washington. On receipt [...] of {{the news of the}} type-setter's collapse he sent a consoling word. [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> thought Clemens <b>would</b> rage over the unhappy circumstance, [...] and possibly hold him in some measure to blame. But it was [...] generally the smaller annoyances of life that made Mark Twain rage; [...] the larger catastrophes were likely to stir only his philosophy.|$|R
50|$|During his consulship, Quintus Caecilius Metellus {{was given}} the proconsular command against the pirate-infested Crete; his co-consul, Quintus Hortensius Hortalus. had refused it. Metellus {{captured}} several cities and made great progress before the island appealed to Pompey the Great. They did this in 67 BC, when Pompey had control over the Mediterranean to eliminate piracy under the proposal of Gabinius. The Cretans offered to surrender to Pompey, <b>perhaps</b> believing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be less harsh than Metellus. Pompey ignored Metellus' command over the island and accepted the Cretan's surrender. Pompey ordered Metellus to leave the island with his troops, but Metellus persisted. Metellus then defeated the island of Crete {{and made it a}} province of Rome.|$|R
40|$|This {{photo is}} {{taken at the}} top of Masada, a horst that was used as a {{fortress}} by many ancient people. King Herod, in the first century BC, built an elaborate palace here, <b>perhaps</b> fearing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to go into isolation because of his unpopularity with the Jews. A little over a century later Masada was the last stand for the Zealots, a band of Jewish rebels who lived here for seven years until they were at last over taken by the Romans. A Roman road leads to the top of Masada which can still be traveled today. In this photograph the ruins of ancient structures and a group of visitors can be seen. [URL]...|$|R
