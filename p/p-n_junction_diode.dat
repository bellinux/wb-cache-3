25|$|A <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> <b>diode</b> {{is made of}} {{a crystal}} of semiconductor, usually silicon, but {{germanium}} and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an n-type semiconductor, and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type semiconductor. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check valve.|$|E

2500|$|There are, however, {{components}} of electrical circuits {{which do not}} obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their I–V curve) is nonlinear (or non-ohmic). [...] An example is the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> <b>diode</b> (curve at right). [...] As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. [...] One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of [...] "resistance" [...] is not constant {{as a function of}} applied voltage. [...] Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. [...] The ratio V/I for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the static, or chordal, or DC, resistance, but as seen in the figure the value of total V over total I varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. [...] This means the [...] "DC resistance" [...] V/I at some point on the curve {{is not the same as}} what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the dynamic, small-signal, or incremental resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the derivative of current with respect to voltage). [...] For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.|$|E

50|$|The {{forward-bias}} and the reverse-bias {{properties of}} the p-n junction imply {{that it can be}} used as a diode. A <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> <b>diode</b> allows electric charges to flow in one direction, but not in the opposite direction; negative charges (electrons) can easily flow through the junction from n to p but not from p to n, and the reverse is true for holes. When the p-n junction is forward-biased, electric charge flows freely due to reduced resistance of the p-n junction. When the p-n junction is reverse-biased, however, the junction barrier (and therefore resistance) becomes greater and charge flow is minimal.|$|E

The first IMPATT oscillation {{was obtained from}} a simple silicon <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> <b>diode</b> biased into a reverse avalanche break down and mounted in a microwave cavity. Because of the strong dependence of the ionization coefficient on the electric field, most of the electron-hole pairs are generated in the high field region.

The time required for the hole to reach the contact constitutes the transit time delay.|$|E

The fabrication of electronic devices based on conducting polymers, especially Schottky diodes, can be simple and of low cost compared with devices based on inorganic semiconductors. The photoelectrical properties of metal–semiconductor (MS)—have been studied as photovoltaic cells, photodiodes and Schottky diodes {{by a number of}} authors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Schottky diodes are playing an important role in modern electronic devices. Although Schottky diodes have the simplest structure, they are the base of a great number of compound semiconductor electronic devices [23, 24]. Schottky diodes are less expensive to fabricate than <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> <b>diodes</b> and the device performance is better due to faster response, low resistance, very small transient reverse current during switching and the reverse saturation current of Schottky barrier diodes is higher than that of the conventional <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> <b>diodes</b> [25, 26, 27]. The Schottky diode requires lower forward bias voltage to deliver a given current compared to a <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> <b>diodes.</b> The operation of Schottky barrier diodes relies upon the device characteristics of the MS junction. Therefore, the understanding of the electronic properties of the surface between metal and the organic layer is important for device applications. Series resistance (R s), formation of Schottky barrier, insulating layer between metal and semiconductor and also the interface states can affect the properties of the junction.|$|R
