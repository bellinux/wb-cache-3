40|$|Despite {{the crucial}} role of concerted action to {{collusion}} among rival firms, few elements are more perplexing than the design of evidentiary standards to determine whether parallel conduct stems from collective or from unilateral decision making. Courts allow a collusive agreement to be established by circumstantial evidence, but the evidence must show additional evidence — “plus factors” — beyond parallel movement in price. Chief <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> identified by courts have included actions contrary to each defendant’s self-interest unless pursued {{as part of a}} collective plan, phenomena that can be explained rationally only as a result of concerted action, evidence that defendants created the opportunity for regulation communication, industry performance data that suggests successful coordination, and the absence of a plausible legitimate business rational for suspicious conduct. The frailties of the existing analytical tests for assessing <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> impede the economically sensible resolution of many high-stakes antitrust cases where decisions made on the issue of conspiracy are decisive and such inadequacies may be magnified in the future. No cases have offered useful operational means for determining when the defendants have engaged in something more than consciously parallel conduct. It is possible to improve on existing approaches by focusing more precisely on the forms of behavior that firms use to communicate their intentions and to execute the tasks needed to achieve coordination on pricing, output, and other dimensions of effective collusion. Case law addressing <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> has not established a methodology for ranking <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> according to their probative value. The authors believe that the actions of an explicit cartel, and the outcomes of those actions, should illuminate the path to identifying <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> and that any of those actions that surely do not result from unilateral conduct should be given special attention. Further, courts and enforcement agencies cannot address the agreement in question without awareness of remedial issues that stand in the background. Courts are left with a conundrum because they cannot meaningfully instruct firms not to react to their rivals’ pricing. When firms in an industry are players in a repeated game with substantially incomplete and asymmetric information, courts can examine buyer actions to attempt to distinguish between conduct that is an agreement in violation of the Sherman Act and conduct that is not. This Article offers a way to increase understanding of <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> and to improve the manner in which enforcement agencies and courts interpret them in individual cases by advocating the use of basic probability theory to rank <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> in terms of their probative value. It proposes a formal definition of <b>plus</b> <b>factors,</b> a taxonomy of <b>plus</b> <b>factors,</b> and a coherent methodology for ranking them in terms of their probative values. It also proposes that <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> should be considered in constellations whenever such groups are present because the probative value of the group can be far greater than the individual <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> in the group...|$|R

40|$|Section 13 (d) of the Williams Act {{requires}} {{all persons}} and groups that acquire 5 {{percent or more}} of an issuer’s outstanding stock to disclose their holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Whether a group is formed under section 13 (d) often is unclear. The legal precedent is ambiguous; courts give more weight to certain forms of circumstantial evidence than others without explaining why. With the substantial increase of hedge fund activism—in particular, the wolf pack tactic—further clarity or uniformity is necessary. A “wolf pack” is a loose association of hedge funds that employs parallel activist strategies toward a target corporation while intentionally avoiding group status under section 13 (d). Rather than develop a new rule, courts should apply the antitrust conspiracy framework from section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The antitrust precedent identifies conscious parallelism and <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> as evidence of price-fixing conspiracies. It is based on statutory language, and courts are familiar with the precedent, largely because the case law is similar to section 13 (d) law.

At the time, Michigan, like most American law schools, was a training place for white males. In 1966, the law school faculty adopted a new admissions policy that took race into account as a <b>plus</b> <b>factor</b> in the admissions process. This policy of affirmative action has taken many forms over the years, but, across the decades of the 19702 ̆ 7 s, the 19802 ̆ 7 s and the 19902 ̆ 7 s, about 800 African Americans, 350 Latinos, 200 Asian Americans and 100 Native Americans have graduated from the law school.

These formula patterns are intended to become best practice guidelines for a future pragmatic randomised controlled trial with the ultimate goal of evaluating the possibility of integrating Chinese medicine treatment strategies for menopausal symptoms into the UK National Health Service. Data from a clinical study that had demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicine in treating 117 perimenopausal women at the Westminster University Polyclinic in London was analysed for symptom occurrence and herb use. The frequency of occurrence of different presenting symptoms and the frequency of use of individual herbs is described, and the patterns of combined herb use and the correlations between these patterns and the presenting symptoms is analysed by means of factor analysis.

While there is some overlap between these formulas and their associated symptom patterns and those described in Chinese medicine textbooks, some formula patterns appear to be unique to London women.

Promoter region A binds Steroidogenic Factor- 1 (SF- 1); region B binds cAMP-regulatory element binding protein (CREB) and two other factors (designated X and Y). Mutations were generated {{within the context of the}} intact promoter to selectively eliminate the binding of either SF- 1, CREB, CREB <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> X and Y, or all of the above. When expression vectors that failed to bind either CREB alone or CREB <b>plus</b> <b>factors</b> X and Y were transfected into granulosa cells, cAMP-dependent chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was reduced 65 % indicating that CREB alone, and not factors X and Y, mediates the cAMP response of this cAMP response element-like domain.

40|$|The {{effects of}} AM on {{expression}} of muscarinic (M) receptors from P 19 -derived cardiomyocytes were examined. RT–PCR experiments revealed expression of M 1 –M 4 receptor genes. Immuno-histochemistry indicated that M 2 expression {{is restricted to}} contractile cells. Carbachol inhibition of isoprenaline-induced increase in beating rate was prevented by atropine and methoctramine (pA 2 : 8. 1). Inhibition of [3 H]-NMS binding by atropine (pKi: − 8. 4 ± 0. 2) and methoctramine (pKi: − 8. 3 ± 0. 2) suggests that M 2 is the functional expressed isoform. [3 H]-NMS binding and semiquantitative RT–PCR studies showed a dome shaped time course of M 2 expression with a maximum at 7 days of differentiation followed by a progressive decline. AM concentration-dependently upregulated M 2 receptor mRNA during late differentiation stages in P 19 cells but also in rat atrial cardiomyocytes. This effect was potentiated by factor H. AM (100 nM) <b>plus</b> <b>factor</b> H (50 nM) treatment of P 19 cells for 24 h significantly increased [3 H]-NMS-specific binding (Bmax: 81 ± 7 vs 31 ± 6 fmol mg− 1 prot).

40|$|How much deference—or what kind—should courts give to longstanding agency {{interpretations of}} statutes? Surprisingly, courts and {{scholars}} lack a coherent {{answer to this}} question. Legal scholars long have assumed that longstanding agency statutory interpretations are treated with heightened deference on judicial review, and federal courts sometimes have made statements suggesting {{that this is the}} case. But in practice, federal court review of longstanding agency interpretations—at both the U. S. Supreme Court and courts of appeals—turns out to be surprisingly erratic. Reviewing courts sometimes note the longevity of an agency’s statutory interpretation as a <b>plus</b> <b>factor</b> in their deference analysis but at other times completely ignore or dismiss an agency interpretation’s longevity. Moreover, judicial rhetoric about the relevance of longevity in the review of agency statutory interpretations is inconsistent from case to case. What makes this doctrinal incoherence particularly remarkable is that courts usually care much more about the predictability of statutory interpretations and about upsetting settled institutional practices. In fact, in two analogous contexts—judicial interpretations of statutes and historical executive branch practice in the constitutional arena—courts accord strong precedential effect, or a presumption of correctness, to established legal constructions. This Article provides the first detailed study of federal court treatment of longstanding agency statutory interpretations, illuminating doctrinal inconsistencies and examining longevity-related factors that both favor and disfavor deference. The Article also compares federal courts’ chaotic treatment of longstanding agency statutory interpretations with the precedential effect that courts give to longstanding judicial interpretations of statutes and the historical “gloss” effect that courts give to past executive practice in constitutional interpretation. Ultimately, the Article argues that longstanding agency interpretations of statutes are at least as deserving of heightened judicial deference and that, at a minimum, federal courts’ disparate treatment of such interpretations—without acknowledging or justifying the distinction—is troubling. The Article advocates that longstanding agency interpretations should be entitled to precedential effect by reviewing courts and outlines how such an approach might work...|$|E
