This paper studies the same phenomenon from Natural Language Processing (NLP) application, and proposes an automatic prefixing model which can later be used to perform NLP tasks such as pattern matching and automatic extraction. The focus of this paper is the phenomena of meN- prefixing in Indonesian. The machine readable linguistic resources built in this paper is expected to transform the linguistic description pertaining to the morphophonemic constraints to an applicable mean for NLP. To accomplish this goal, Local Grammar (<b>LG)</b> <b>approach</b> is employed since this approach is very powerful to describe and formalize a linguistic phenomenon. A corpus processing software, UNITEX, is also employed to apply LG in carrying NLP tasks. It demonstrates how morphophonemic prefixing in Indonesian can be carried out automatically to generate an inflected form machine readable dictionaries as lexical resources and how the resources are used for pattern matching and automatic extraction.

40|$|The Linguistic Geometry (<b>LG)</b> <b>approach</b> to {{discrete}} systems {{was introduced}} B. Stilman in early 80 s. It employed competing/cooperating agents for modeling and controlling of discrete systems. The approach {{was applied to}} a variety of problems with huge state spaces including control of aircraft, battlefield robots, and chess. One of the key innovations of LG is the use of almost winning strategies, rather than truly winning strategies for the playing agents. There are many cases where the winning strategies have so high time complexity that they are not computable in practice, whereas the almost winning strategies can be applied and they beat the opposing agent almost guaranteed. Independently of LG the idea of competing/ cooperating agents was employed in the late 80 s by A. Nerode, A. Yakhnis, and V. Yakhnis (NYY) within their approach to modeling concurrent systems and, more recently, within the “Strategy Approach to Hybrid Systems ” developed for continuous systems by A. Nerode, W. Kohn, A. Yakhnis, and others. In order to enlarge the range of applications of Stilman's results as well as to understand why they work, we introduce a new notion of a multi-agent graph-game.

40|$|A {{technique}} is presented for polarization analysis of three-component seismic array data. The process {{is applied to}} a large suite of regional events recorded on the three-component sensors in the NORESS array in southern Norway. Polarization properties of the regional seismic phases <b>P,,</b> S,, and <b>Lg</b> are examined in detail. The analysis {{technique is}} based on a time-domain algorithm originally proposed by Flinn (1965). The polarization ellipse is computed within sliding time windows by solving the eigenproblem for the covariance matrix. Various attributes characterizing the particle motions are extracted from the motion ellipse. This technique is extended to multiple three-component sensors in an array configu-ration by averaging covariance matrices for the different sensors. In this case a 1 /M reduction in the estimation variance is obtained (M is the number of sensors), when the noise and local scattering effects are uncorrelated. An important feature of this approach is that the phase velocities of coherent wavefronts across the array are not required to a high degree of accuracy. Significant results of the data analysis are the well-defined polarization of P, and Sn waves across the entire short-period band, the source azimuth estimates obtained from <b>P,</b> and <b>Lg</b> motions, and the distinct polarization for S, and Lg waves allowing these phases to be distinguished in most cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify {{differences}} in the kinematic and kinetic profiles of the trunk and lower extremities during baseball pitching in collegiate baseball pitchers, in relation to differences in the pitched ball velocity. The subjects were 30 collegiate baseball pitchers aged 18 to 22 yrs, who were assigned to high- (HG, 37. 4 ± 0. 8 m·s- 1) and low-pitched-ball-velocity groups (LG, 33. 3 ± 0. 8 m·s- 1). Three-dimensional motion analysis with a comprehensive lower-extremity model was used to evaluate kinematic and kinetic parameters during baseball pitching. The ground-reaction forces (GRF) of the pivot and stride legs during pitching were determined using two multicomponent force plates. The joint torques of hip, knee, and ankle were calculated using inverse-dynamics computation of a musculoskeletal human model. To eliminate any effect of variation in body size, kinetic and GRF data were normalized by dividing them by body mass. The maxima and minima of GRF (Fy, Fz, and resultant forces) on the pivot and stride leg were significantly greater in the HG than in the <b>LG</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). Furthermore, Fy, Fz, and resultant forces on the stride leg at maximum shoulder external rotation and ball release were significantly greater in the HG than in the <b>LG</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). The hip abduction, hip internal rotation and knee extension torques of the pivot leg and the hip adduction torque of the stride leg when it contacted the ground were significantly greater in the HG than in the <b>LG</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). These results indicate that, compared with low-ball-velocity pitchers, high-ball-velocity pitchers can generate greater momentum of the lower limbs during baseball pitching...|$|R

Our analysis models the job scheduler as the thread scheduler’s adversary, challenging the thread scheduler to be robust to the system environment and the job scheduler’s administrative policies. We analyze the performance of A-STEAL using “trim analysis, ” which allows us to prove that our thread scheduler performs poorly on at most a small number of time steps, while exhibiting near-optimal behavior on the vast majority.

A key capability of race detectors is to determine whether one thread executes logically in parallel with another thread or whether the threads must operate in series.

For a fork-join program with T 1 work and a critical-path length of T[infinity], the serial SP-Maintenance algorithm runs in O(T 1) time. The parallel algorithm executes in the nearly optimal O(T 1 /P + PT[infinity]) time, when run on P processors and using an efficient scheduler. These SP-maintenance algorithms can be incorporated into race detectors to get a provably good race detector that runs in parallel.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} bifocal sampling, a {{new technique}} for estimating {{the size of an}} equi-join of two relations. Bifocal sampling classi es tuples in each relation into two groups, sparse and dense, {{based on the number of}} tuples with the same join value. Distinct estimation procedures are employed that focus on various combinations for joining tuples (e. g., for estimating the number of joining tuples that are dense in both relations). This combination of estimation procedures overcomes some well-known problems in previous schemes, enabling good estimates with no a priori knowledge about the data distribution. The estimate obtained by the bifocal sampling algorithm is proven to lie with high probability within a small constant factor of the actual join size, regardless of the skew, as long as the join size is (n lg n), for relations consisting of n tuples. The algorithm requires a sample of size at most O (<b>p</b> n <b>lg</b> n). By contrast, previous algorithms using a sample of similar size may require the join size to be (n p n) to guarantee an accurate estimate. Experimental results support the theoretical claims and show that bifocal sampling is practical and e ective. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{technical}} feasibility and both early and 5 -year clinical outcomes of laparoscopic-assisted and open radical subtotal gastrectomy for distal gastric cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The role of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of gastric cancer has not yet been defined, and many doubts remain about the ability to satisfy all the oncologic criteria met during conventional, open surgery. METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective, randomized clinical trial with a total of 59 patients. Twenty-nine (49. 1 %) patients were randomized to undergo open subtotal gastrectomy (OG), while 30 (50. 9 %) patients were randomized to the laparoscopic group (LG). Demographics, ASA status, pTNM stage, histologic type of the tumor, number of resected lymph nodes, postoperative complications, and 5 -year overall and disease-free survival rates were studied to assess outcome differences between the groups. RESULTS: The demographics, preoperative data, and characteristics of the tumor were similar. The mean number of resected lymph nodes was 33. 4 +/- 17. 4 in the OG group and 30. 0 +/- 14. 9 in the <b>LG</b> (<b>P</b> = not significant). Operative mortality rates were 6. 7 % (2 patients) in the OG and 3. 3 % (1 patient) in the <b>LG</b> (<b>P</b> = not significant); morbidity rates were 27. 6 % and 26. 7 %, respectively (P = not significant). Five-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 55. 7 % and 54. 8 % and 58. 9 % and 57. 3 % in the OG and the <b>LG,</b> respectively (<b>P</b> = not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic radical subtotal gastrectomy for distal gastric cancer is a feasible and safe oncologic procedure with short- and long-term results similar to those obtained with an open approach.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for comparing the detections and non-detections of Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies in large HI {{surveys to the}} predictions of a suite of n-body simulations of the <b>LG.</b> This <b>approach</b> depends primarily {{on a set of}} empirical scaling relations to connect the simulations to the observations, rather than making strong theoretical assumptions. We then apply this methodology to the Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI Compact Cloud Catalog (GALFA-HI CCC), and compare it to the ELVIS suite of simulations. This approach reveals a strong tension between the naïve results of the model and the observations: while there are no LG dwarfs in the GALFA-HI CCC, the simulations predict ∼ 10. Applying a simple model of reionization can resolve this tension by preventing low-mass halos from forming gas. However, and if this effect operates as expected, the observations provide a constraint on the mass scale of dwarf galaxy that reionization impacts. Combined with the observed properties of Leo T, the halo virial mass scale at which reionization impacts dwarf galaxy gas content is constrained to be ∼ 10 ^ 8. 5 M_, independent of any assumptions about star formation.

40|$|Plasmids are {{components}} of many bacterial genomes. They enable {{the spread of}} a large pool of genetic information via lateral gene transfer. Many bacterial strains contain mega-sized replicons and these are particularly common in Alphaproteobacteria. Considerably less is known about smaller alphaproteobacterial plasmids. We analyzed the genomes of 14 such plasmids residing in 4 multireplicon carotenoid-producing strains of the genus Paracoccus (Alphaproteobacteria) : P. aestuarii DSM 19484, <b>P.</b> haeundaensis <b>LG</b> P- 21903, <b>P.</b> marcusii DSM 11574 and P. marcusii OS 22. Comparative analyses revealed mosaic structures of the plasmids and recombinational shuffling of diverse genetic modules involved in (i) plasmid replication, (ii) stabilization (including toxin-antitoxin systems of the relBE/parDE, tad-ata, higBA, mazEF and toxBA families) and (iii) mobilization for conjugal transfer (encoding relaxases of the MobQ, MobP or MobV families). A common feature {{of the majority of}} the plasmids is the presence of AT-rich sequence islets (located downstream of exc 1 -like genes) containing genes, whose homologs are conserved in the chromosomes of many bacteria (encoding e. g. RelA/SpoT, SMC-like proteins and a retron-type reverse transcriptase). The results of this study have provided insight into the diversity and plasticity of plasmids of Paracoccus spp., and of the entire Alphaproteobacteria. Some of the identified plasmids contain replication systems not described previously in this class of bacteria. The composition of the plasmid genomes revealed frequent transfe...|$|R

Given a set V of n points in k-dimensional space R k, k 2. The points are the vertices of a complete weighted graph G = (V; E).

40|$|Pup {{directed}} maternal licking and grooming (LG) {{increases with}} corticosterone (CORT) supplimentation (Rees et al 2004). Increases in LG {{lead to an}} attenuation of the adult offspring's HPA response to stress (Liu et aI 1997). Similarly, Neonatal increases in glucocorticoids lead, in adulthood, to the same attenuation of the HPA stress response (Catalani et aI 1993). We hypothesize that dams exhibiting increased LG will have increased circulating CORT, and this increase will be reflected in their offspring. This thesis characterizes the HPA hormone profile adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), CORT & Corticosterone Binding Globulin (CBG) in High LG (H) and Low LG (L) litters, 5 days postpartum (P 4). Furthermore pup plasma CORT levels are determined at (P) 3, 4, 6, 10 & 14. Finally P 10 Hand L LG ACTH, CORT & CBG will be assessed after stress. RESULTS: H compared to L LG dams have significantly increased plasma CORT (p= 0. 03). At <b>P</b> 4, H <b>LG</b> offspring have significantly increased plasma CORT (p= 0. 03) and significantly decreased plasma ACTH (p= 0. 04) as compared to L LG offspring. Plasma CBG levels are significantly lower in H compared to L LG offspring (p= 0. 01) at the same age. Across the Stress Hyporesponsive Period (SHRP) H LG offspring had significantly increased plasma CORT (p= 0. 00) compared to L <b>LG</b> offspring at <b>P</b> 3. Challenged with a stressor at <b>P</b> 10, H <b>LG</b> offspring have an exaggerated plasma CORT response (p= 0. 00). This data suggests increases in plasma CORT in the dams leads to increased CORT in the high offspring, contributing perhaps to a more mature stress response at P 10.

SS 7. 7 BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The {{objective of}} this study is to evaluate the outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic gastrostomy (SILG) and compare with standard laparoscopic gastrostomy (LG). METHODS: Paediatric patients (age < 18 years) with gastrostomy placement (+/-concomitant fundoplication) in the past 3 years were reviewed. Demographic data, intraoperative and post-operative events (minor/major complications, initiation of feeding) were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were identified (LG : SILG = 25 : 13). There was no significant differences between (LG vs SILG) age (5. 7 vs 4. 2 years, p= 0. 45) and body size at operation (15. 3 vs 12. 4 kg, p= 0. 36). The median operative durations for LG group (after excluding concomitant fundoplication if necessary) and SILG group were 38 mins vs 45 mins, p= 0. 21. There was one major complication in the LG group but none was reported in the SILG group. Seven patients (28 %) in the LG group suffered from minor complications while 2 (15. 4 %) in the SILG group did. Gastrostomy feeding was initiated on POD 1 in majority of patients in both groups (LG: 92 % vs SILG: 100 %, p= 0. 18). CONCLUSIONS: SILG is technically feasible in paediatric patients and outcomes were comparable to <b>LG.</b> This <b>approach</b> should be considered when concomitant procedure is not required to minimize surgical trauma...|$|R
