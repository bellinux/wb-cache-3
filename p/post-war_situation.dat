25|$|During Japan's {{invasion}} of Singapore in January 1942, the then-Colonial Secretary Stanley Jones was revoked {{from his position}} due to alleged ineffective defence coordination. The position was taken over temporarily by FMS Federal Secretary Hugh Fraser, who retreated to Singapore. Both Fraser and Sir Shenton Thomas, Governor of the Straits Settlements, stayed in Singapore until the last moment; they were imprisoned following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese. The post of Colonial Secretary was vacant due to the fall of Singapore. Following the unconditional surrender of Japan in 1945, the United Kingdom set up a provisional military government without restoring the post, so as {{to prepare for the}} dissolution of the Straits Settlements, in response to the <b>post-war</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the peace}} {{negotiations}} Poland did not maintain all the territories it had controlled {{at the end}} of hostilities. Due to their losses in and after the Battle of Warsaw, the Soviets offered the Polish peace delegation substantial territorial concessions in the contested borderland areas, closely resembling the border between the Russian Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth before the first partition of 1772. Polish resources were exhausted, however, and Polish public opinion was opposed to a prolongation of the war. The Polish government was also pressured by the League of Nations, and the negotiations were controlled by Dmowski's National Democrats. Piłsudski might have controlled the military, but parliament (Sejm) was controlled by Dmowski: Piłsudski's support lay in the territories in the East, which were controlled by the Bolsheviks {{at the time of the}} elections, while the National Democrats' electoral support lay in central and western Poland. The peace negotiations were of a political nature. National Democrats, like Stanisław Grabski, who earlier had resigned his post to protest the Polish–Ukrainian alliance and now wielded much influence over the Polish negotiators, cared little for Piłsudski's vision of reviving Międzymorze, the multicultural Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This <b>post-war</b> <b>situation</b> proved a death blow to the Międzymorze project. More than one million Poles, living mostly in the disputed territories, remained in the Soviet Union, systematically persecuted by Soviet authorities because of political, economic and religious reasons (see the Polish operation of the NKVD).|$|E
500|$|Those who {{drafted the}} Action Programme were {{careful not to}} criticize {{the actions of the}} post-war Communist regime, only to point out {{policies}} that they felt had outlived their usefulness. For instance, the immediate <b>post-war</b> <b>situation</b> had required [...] "centralist and directive-administrative methods" [...] to fight against the [...] "remnants of the bourgeoisie." [...] Since the [...] "antagonistic classes" [...] were said to have been defeated with the achievement of socialism, these methods were no longer necessary. Reform was needed, for the Czechoslovak economy to join the [...] "scientific-technical revolution in the world" [...] rather than relying on Stalinist-era heavy industry, labour power, and raw materials. Furthermore, since internal class conflict had been overcome, workers could now be duly rewarded for their qualifications and technical skills without contravening Marxism-Leninism. The Programme suggested it was now necessary to ensure important positions were [...] "filled by capable, educated socialist expert cadres" [...] in order to compete with capitalism.|$|E

40|$|This report {{addresses}} governance {{issues in}} <b>post-war</b> <b>situations</b> {{as these are}} dealt with in three sets of literature: •the growing case-based knowledge arising from the experience in internationally-assisted transitions from war to peace since the early 1990 s. •insofar as these transitions typically intended to establish a democratic post-war order, important insights {{can be drawn from}} the more general literature on democratic transitions. •there is increasing evidence that the direction of developments in the post-war phase in important ways is shaped not only by the conflict itself, but {{by the nature of the}} peace settlement and the international commitment to the agreement and its implementation As a result, the context of political and economic reconstruction will vary significantly. The report outlines the key institutional components of the relationship between a post-war context and the implementation of a democratic system of governance. After noting the importance of differentiating between types of <b>post-war</b> <b>situations,</b> the report reviews experiences from what is considered to be the most critical governance interventions. These include constitution-making and constitutional design; establishment of watchdog institutions; truth commissions and criminal justice procedures; local governance; security sector reform; elections, forming of electoral systems and political parties; supporting human rights organisations; empowerment projects, and cooperation among divided communities and peace committees. Lastly, major cross-cutting issues are considered, such as pace, sequencing and portfolio mix of governance interventions, building trust and generating reconciliation, and coordination of external actors.

He argues that people's movements need to reclaim peacebuilding, nation-building and state-building, and confront the corporate neo-liberalism and the militarist agenda of the USA and its allies. He asks that we work for peace by supporting of democratic gender sensitive democratization with economies based on solidarity not profit.

40|$|In {{countries}} where civil war has formally ended, not all refugees return. Nor does emigration {{come to a}} halt. Why? We argue that three specific features of <b>post-war</b> <b>situations</b> explain the varying levels of outward migration: the quality of peace, the quality of political institutions, {{and the quality of}} economic livelihoods. We test our hypotheses using a mixed-method research design that combines a series of statistical models with evidence from two case studies, Nepal and El Salvador. Our findings suggest that, cross-nationally, postwar violence and repression as well as exclusion from economic opportunities are the major drivers of outward migration after civil war. Complementary evidence from the two case studies shows that the effects of violence and of the lack of decent economic livelihoods on post-war emigration are enhanced by insufficient or dysfunctional political reforms...|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: The {{foundation}} of the Empire to the present day, the German company has gone through phases of "militarization" and " Zivilisierung "posing the question of relations and interactions between civil and military authorities. How can they go awry {{in times of crisis}} or restructuring in peacetime? Different contributions consider the relationship between state, society and military power in the nexus of domestic and foreign policy perspectives. They focus on the ideological, social and cultural factors {{as well as on the}} representation of fact and related military memorial cultures. They analyze the ways in which power and the military have been interfering in the political and social sphere. They show how the army could become a factor of change in political culture, both in opposition in support of the civil power, or not being anchored in people's minds and collective representations. These articles deal with the reconfiguration of the relationship between civil and military authorities during the imperial period, the Weimar Republic and the "Third Reich" and, for the <b>post-war</b> <b>situations</b> in the FRG and the GDR of the Cold War and now in the reunified Germany...|$|R
