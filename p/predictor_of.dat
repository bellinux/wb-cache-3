5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> the horn circumference.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a rationale for}} considering <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> growth in a treatment group as inadequate to identifying <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> treatment response. When we interpret <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> growth in a treatment group as synonymous with <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> treatment response, we implicitly attribute all of the treated children’s growth to the treatment, an untenable assump-tion under most conditions. We also contend {{that the use of}} standard scores in <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> growth studies does not allow us to differentiate growth from treatment, from growth from other factors. We present two research methodologies that are appropriate methods of identifying pre-dictors of treatment response: (a) single-subject experimental logic utilized to identify the specific participants in which treatment responses (not just growth) were found, combined with follow-up group comparison logic to identify the characteristics on which responders and nonresponders differ, and (b) statistical interactions among child/family/context characteristics and randomly assigned group membership.

5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

30|$|While {{our main}} {{goal was to}} find <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> search accuracy, we also {{investigated}} how these factors were related to reaction time and false alarm rates. The reason we did this {{was to investigate the}} potential mechanisms by which the predictors influence target detection rates. If the <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> good target detection are also <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> slower search reaction times, the data would be consistent with the mechanism being the individual’s quitting threshold; <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> a high quitting threshold should be associated with both slower reaction times and better target detection. By contrast, if the mechanism was simply a change in the decision criterion for the responding target present, then <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> higher target detection rates should also be predictive of more false alarms. In short, investigating these two additional dependent variables provides preliminary evidence about the potential underlying mechanism by which the predictors influence low prevalence search rates.|$|R

Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pulmonary {{rehabilitation}} (PR) is efficacious {{in chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As completion rates of PR are poor, we wished to assess <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> attendance and adherence. METHODS: We performed {{a retrospective analysis}} of 711 patients with COPD, who were invited to attend PR. Data were compared to allow predictors (gender, smoking status, attending partner, referral route, employment status, body mass index, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), oxygen therapy (LTOT), oxygen saturations, chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ), shuttle walk distance, travel distance and time) of attendance (0 or > 0 attendance) and adherence (63 % attendance) to be identified. RESULTS: 31. 8 % of patients referred for PR did not attend and a further 29. 1 % were non-adherent. <b>Predictors</b> <b>of</b> non-attendance were female gender, current smoker, and living alone. <b>Predictors</b> <b>of</b> non-adherence were extremes of age, current smoking, LTOT use, FEV(1), CRQ score and travelling distance. Multiple logistic regression revealed that LTOT and living alone were independent <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> poor attendance and current smoking, poor shuttle walking distance and hospitalisations were independent <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> poor adherence.

5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E
