40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate <b>premilking</b> teat disinfectant efficacy with the use of a novel diagnostic protocol against a positive control. The evaluation of efficacy was based on establishing noninferiority of a new <b>premilking</b> teat disinfectant compared with an existing <b>premilking</b> teat disinfectant. Approximately 200 cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups. Study personnel were blinded as to cow allocation and identification of the <b>premilking</b> disinfectants. Quarters were disinfected using a dip cup before milking with either the control or experimental product. The disinfectant was left on the teat for approximately 30 s before being wiped off in preparation for milking. Quarter-level bacteriological infection status was established at the beginning of the study and quarter milk samples were collected biweekly thereafter. Bacteriological analyses were performed only when somatic cell counts in milk samples crossed a parity-specific threshold. Poisson regression models were used to analyze data. The difference in the rate of new intramammary infections was small and the upper bound of the 95 % confidence interval of the rate difference was smaller than a predefined noninferiority limit. Based on the observed difference in new intramammary infections rate between the experimental and control product, it was concluded that the experimental disinfectant was not inferior compared with the positive control. The protocol used in this study proposes a valid and economically attractive methodology to evaluate the efficacy of teat disinfectants relative to a positive control...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional {{dyspepsia}} {{in childhood}} is commonly triggered by food allergen in sensitised individuals. We investigated the topography of eosinophils and mast cells in gastric antral lamina propria, {{the interaction of}} mast cell products with mucosal nerve fibres, and changes in gastric antral muscle slow wave activity in children with atopy and non-atopy-related functional dyspepsia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Open label study of gastric mucosal cow's milk challenge in 10 atopic and 6 nonatopic children (ages 2 - 12 years) investigated consecutively with gastroscopy for functional dyspepsia. Simultaneous surface electrogastrography and milk challenge were undertaken and laser scanning fluorescence microscopy {{used to examine the}} association of mast cell tryptase with mucosal nerves in the gastric mucosa before and after challenge. RESULTS: Eosinophils and mast cells within the lamina propria were increased in number in children with atopic functional dyspepsia and degranulated rapidly after cow's milk challenge in the atopic group. For degranulating eosinophils, median = 13. 0 % (interquartile range = 3. 7 - 31. 0) <b>premilk</b> versus 32. 0 % (12. 0 - 42. 0) after milk biopsies (P < 0. 05); for degranulating mast cells, 5. 35 % (2. 7 - 10. 9) <b>premilk</b> biopsies versus 18. 75 % (12. 9 - 22. 1) after milk biopsies (P < 0. 05). No such differences were seen in nonatopic patients. Mast cells were closely associated with mucosal nerve fibres and released tryptase, which colocalised with proteinase-activated receptors on mucosal nerve fibres. The gastric antral slow wave became abnormal within 2 minutes of antigen challenge in atopics with an increase in dominant frequency instability coefficient (P < 0. 005), decrease in 3 cycles per minute myoelectrical activity (P < 0. 01), and increase in bradygastria (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Automatic milking systems (AMS) offer a {{potential}} solution {{for some of}} the labour issues faced within the dairy industry, replacing manual labour typically dedicated to milk harvesting with robotics. Subsequently, AMS is able to achieve milkings which are voluntary and distributed (Chapter 2), offering farmers the potential to increase milking frequency and milk yield without increasing labour. Critical to the success of voluntary AMS and the attainment of acceptable milking frequency is the ability to motivate cows to return to the milking stall regularly and evenly throughout the entire 24 hour day, to which feed is commonly used as an incentive to achieve this movement. However, pasture-based systems typically have reduced cow traffic and milk yield, and introduce new challenges to the management of voluntary cow traffic, which have not been experienced in indoor-housed systems where the technology originated. Furthermore, variation in milking frequency and milking interval exists, leading to variation in the utilisation, and therefore demand, of the milking stall throughout the day, with this variation particularly evident in pasture-based operations (Chapter 2). Peaks in demand for the milking stall can increase the risk of congestion and subsequent adverse effects on aspects of cow welfare and system performance, which may be further exacerbated when operating with the newly developed high-throughput robotic rotary (RR) milking stall, to which there is no published research exploring the management of voluntary cow traffic within a RR system. Consequently, the overall objective of this thesis was to increase understanding of factors which may influence voluntary cow traffic, as well as investigate management practices which can be used to encourage cows to volunteer for milking, within a pasture-based RR system. In Chapter, 3 it was demonstrated that the offering of feed at milking on the RR to cows accustomed to being offered feed at milking resulted in these cows more rapidly exiting the <b>premilking</b> area (i. e., being milked), spending approximately half the waiting time they did when feed was not on offer. Similarly, the offering of feed following milking encouraged cows to more quickly volunteer for milking and spend less time in the <b>premilking</b> area than the offer of feed before milking (Chapter 4). Conversely, Chapter 5 reported a lack of response to a shortterm feed incentive in cows that were not accustomed to receiving feed at milking, nor did the offer of a palatable and preferred forage crop grazed at pasture positively ii influence <b>premilking</b> waiting times (Chapter 6). Thus, one of the key findings from this thesis is that the training of cows without a feed incentive at milking is likely to still result in acceptable <b>premilking</b> waiting times. However, reverting away from offering feed at milking once cows are accustomed to feed could lead to significant, adverse effects on congestion, <b>premilking</b> waiting times, cow welfare and system performance and is not a recommended management practice. Chapters 3 and 4 identified that prolonged waiting times still existed despite the offer of feed incentives, and so Chapter 5 also explored the possibility of using a priority area in which cows could be automatically sent to in order to gain direct access to the RR without moving through the queue of cows within the main waiting area. It was observed that <b>premilking</b> waiting times in the priority area were half that of the average waiting time in the main area, providing evidence to support the introduction of priority areas {{in the design of the}} dairy facility. Throughout this thesis, several factors were consistently observed to effect <b>premilking</b> waiting times, including; cow age and production (Chapters 3 to 6), the time of day (Chapters 5 and 6), fetching and forcing cows to wait (Chapters 3 to 6), and the clear presence of a negative effect of increasing queue length (Chapters 3 to 6). Thus, in summary, this thesis contributes significantly to our current understanding of the management of voluntary, pasture-based RR systems, and has also identified factors which can influence <b>premilking</b> waiting times and, subsequently, the risk of congestion. Results from the studies contained within this thesis can be used to co-develop useful, practical and scientifically-based strategies suited to the management of the RR in pasture-based operations.

40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{examined}} the relation between a wide range of factors and quarter milk somatic cell count (qSCC), including physical characteristics of the teat and changes in teat tissue due to milking, the effect of short-term, milking-induced changes in teat dimensions on somatic cell count has not yet been investigated. To identify teat dimensions and milking-induced changes in teat dimensions associated with qSCC, we conducted a longitudinal study (n(herds) = 6, n(cows) = 72, n(measurements) = 12). Parity, stage of lactation, teat barrel diameter, and changes in teat barrel diameter during milking were identified as factors associated with qSCC. Teats with wider barrels had higher qSCC. Negative changes in the diameter of the teat barrel during milking (i. e., thinner teats postmilking compared with <b>premilking)</b> were associated with lower qSCC, whereas positive changes (i. e., thicker teats postmilking compared with <b>premilking)</b> were associated with higher qSCC. Selection toward more optimal teat characteristics may therefore result in improved milk quality and udder health. However, a threshold might exist for the maximum reduction in teat barrel diameter below which udder health is negatively influenced. If so, changes in teat barrel diameter might serve as an indicator for suboptimal milking and incorrect choice of teatcup liner or milking machine settings and thus help improve management of the herd...|$|E
40|$|Master of Science in Veterinary ScienceThe thesis {{presents}} an original {{investigation into the}} feasibility and operational efficiency of a novel prototype robotic rotary (RR) incorporated into a low-input, pasture-based Australian dairy farming system. A world’s first high throughput automatic milking system was installed, co-developed and tested at the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute site (Camden, NSW, Australia). Being the first farm internationally to tackle voluntary distributed cow traffic (cf. batch milking) the challenges and learnings were specific to the system utilisation and the stage of technological development of the Camden installation. The thesis focuses on the challenges associated with application of the technology, of which learnings will have an immense level of importance for the first commercial installations on farm and further development of the system. These challenges were; (1) investigating a coping mechanism (with and without extra feed) to ensure and maintain high quality milk collection and storage for periods of underutilisation of the systems’ capacity (with voluntary cow traffic) {{in the absence of}} an automatic plant cleaning function, (2) understanding the impact of <b>premilking</b> teat preparation on the incidence of unsuccessful milkings, to ensure that farmers make an informed decision prior to commencement of the RR (as purchase of the teat preparation module will be optional), and (3) potential implications of management strategies for incompletely milked cows on dairy layouts. During periods of underutilisation the operator can deactivate a proportion of bails to better match the demand and availability of milk harvesting bails. Thus, investigations were conducted to understand the impact of bail activation sequence, availability of feed and cow queue size on voluntary cow traffic and robotic throughput efficiency. It was found that overall the availability of a feed reward as cows entered the RR had a larger effect on cow traffic than bail activation sequence, although the number of cows present (voluntarily) at the yard also played a role. Furthermore, having a greater number of consecutive bails activated resulted in more robot operations being conducted simultaneously resulting in an increased harvesting efficiency. <b>Premilking</b> teat preparation is also known to impact on milk harvesting efficiency, and as this component of the technology will be optional an investigation was conducted to assess the effects of not using a <b>premilking</b> teat preparation device on attachment accuracy and milk removal characteristics. The teat cup attachment was more successful and faster when cows were subjected to the teat cleaning treatment. Cows milked after being exposed to teat cleaning treatment, with a short milking interval (< 8 h), had a higher peak milk flow, however no difference was observed in the average milk flow rate of individual cows. Whilst there was an impact on attachment success by the use of the <b>premilking</b> treatment, the overall level of success was still lower than desirable. With this in mind a study of different management practices of incompletely milked cows was conducted. The system showed no difference in attachment success between milking incomplete cows after a one- or three-hour interval. This suggested that there is a level of flexibility available in designing the dairy layout and that no significant advantage or disadvantage (with regard to subsequent success level) exists in drafting incomplete cows directly back to the pre-milking yard compared to offering them an opportunity to spend time on a feedpad prior to the second attempt. The results presented in this thesis will be invaluable in furthering industry understanding of management practices with the new milk harvesting technology, the RR. The contribution of these scientific investigations will be extremely important to the success of the development of the system, which is progressing closer to commercialisation...|$|E

The experiment was conducted with 12 clinically healthy Black-and-White cows, 3 years of age, with body weight 350 – 450 kg. Ultrasonography was performed on 48 teats using ultrasound SonoScape A 5 v (SonoScape, China) with multifrequency linear transducer (5 – 12 MHz). The potential of the imaging technique to visualize teat structures as well as teat canal length and diameter, the diameter in the area of the rosette of Furstenberg, teat wall thickness, teat cistern diameter in its middle part and teat cistern diameter in teat base was evaluated. Scans were conducted before milking, immediately after milking, and 1 and 2 hours after milking. The average teat canal length measured by ultrasound was 8. 48 ± 1. 41 mm before milking, and until the 2 nd post milking hour its size became statistically significantly (p< 0. 001) lower (7. 48 ± 0. 93 mm). Teat canal diameter showed a significant difference (p< 0. 01) only immediately after milking compared to the size before milking. The diameter of the middle part and the base of the teat cistern also tended to decrease considerably after milking (p< 0. 001) as compared to <b>premilking</b> values. The teat wall thickness immediately after milking and 1 hour after milking were statistically significantly higher (p< 0. 001) compared to the <b>premilking</b> size.

Sterile composite milk samples were collected at the initiation of the trial and on an approximately bimonthly basis throughout the duration of the trial. There was no difference in the prevalence of isolation of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. from composite milk samples obtained during the 6 herd cultures.

40|$|Treatment of {{mastitis}} is {{the most}} common reason for use of antimicrobial agents in dairy cattle. The responsible use of antimicrobials could be strengthened by knowledge of predictors for cure, which would help to tailor treatment decisions. Ideally, to allow for widespread uptake, this would be achieved using data that are routinely available. To assess whether this is feasible in practice, farmers were invited to submit milk samples from mastitis cases to their veterinary practice for bacteriological culture. Among 624 culture-positive samples, 251 were positive for Streptococcus uberis. Using cow-level data, cases were classified as severe, first nonsevere, repeat, or subclinical. Additional data were collected at the cow level [somatic cell count (SCC), parity, lactation stage, milk yield, fat and protein contents, treatment] and at the herd level (housing, bedding, <b>premilking</b> teat disinfection, postmilking teat disinfection). Severe cases were overrepresented among heifers and animals in early lactation, and repeat cases were overrepresented in cows with 3 or more lactations. The probability of cure was higher among first- and second-parity animals than among older cows, and was higher in animals with a single elevated cow-level SCC than in animals with multiple high SCC records.

The viable cell counts levels of SPC，lactic acid bacteria，thermotrophilic bacteria and anaerobe (group A) which contaminated on teat skin were over 10 ³ cfu/cm²，whereas psychrotrophilic bacteria and coliforms (group B) were less 10 ² cfu/cm². After TCD with AEW and HClO，viable cell counts levels of the microorganisms of group A and group B were decreased to 2. 8 - 7. 6 % and 10. 0 - 14. 5 % respectively. On the other hand，the efficacy of AEW or HClO for TCD was almost constant throughout one year. The microorganisms of group A and coliforms decreased gradually from summer to winter，but only psychrotrophilic bacteria increased gradually from summer to winter.

Data for on-farm risk factors were collected via a mail-out survey which consisted of 4 main sections: (1) general farm demographics and management, (2) cow cleanliness and hygiene, (3) milking procedures and mastitis control, and (4) equipment maintenance and cleaning. Of 235 producers, 153 completed the mail-out survey giving a response rate of 65 %.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of milk products, especially made from raw milk, {{have been reported}} to be associated with food borne diseases. Since most sheep’s milk products are made from raw milk, it is clear how udder health is an important prerequisite to produce hygienic milk. Ewes with mastitis, particularly in their subclinical form, serve as reservoir of pathogens that can be shed into the milk and constitute a potential risk for human health. Milk somatic cell count (SCC) is not a public health concern itself but it is an indicator of the general state of udder health in a dairy sheep flock and can be used as an indication of hygienic milk and to improve safety of dairy products.

This characteristic was similar in the herds where washing with clean water or wiping with a towel soaked with a disinfectant were practiced (10. 89 and 11. 00, respectively). The highest value of log e TMC was in the herds in which washing with water containing a disinfectant was practiced (11. 28). For SCC, a significant interaction was found between both pre-milking procedures. In the case of wiping with either a dry or wet towel, significantly lower values of log e SCC were observed in the herds in which forestripping was performed prior to cleaning. However, in the herds in which udders and teats were washed with water, a better option was to perform forestripping after udder and teat cleaning...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that milk ejection rate decreases during milking, thereby causing insufficient refill of the cistern and decreasing milk flow rate towards the end of milking. In a first series of experiments machine milking of the left front quarters of 11 cows was interrupted for 2 min after removal of 25, 50 or 75 % of expected total milk yield, while milking was continued in the other three quarters. Milk flow was recorded during machine-on times. Intramammary pressure (IMP) was recorded during <b>premilking</b> teat stimulation and during interruption of milking. IMP during interruption of milking decreased with decreasing amounts of milk remaining in the udder. The IMP did not change during these interruptions when they occurred after 25 and 50 % of expected total milk yield was removed. Thus, the ejection rate could keep up with the milk flow or removal rate. However, IMP increased during interruption of milking following removal of 75 % of total yield, although significantly so only in cows with a high milk flow rate. Obviously, more milk was removed than was transported to the cisternal cavity. It is likely that a reduced ejection rate caused the decreased milk flow rate. In a second series of experiments the pulsation ratio of the milking machine was changed from the usual 70 : 30 to 50 : 50 with the aim of reducing the milk flow rate and thus adapting to the ejection rate at the end of milking. The changed pulsation ratio caused a reduced peak flow rate and a prolonged high milk flow period, whereas the main flow rate did not change significantl...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{contribution}} of management practices, herd characteristics, and seasonal variables to the herd somatic cell count (SCC) was quantified in herds with low (200, 000 cells/mL) herd SCC (HSCC). Selection of the variables was performed using a linear mixed effect model; HSCC was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the individual cow’s SCC. The data concerning management practices were derived from 3 questionnaires on mastitis prevention and management practices on 246 Dutch dairy farms. The monthly Dairy Herd Improvement test data of these 246 farms were {{used to calculate the}} herd characteristics and seasonal effects. None of the management practices were associated with HSCC in all 3 HSCC categories. Some variables only had a significant association with HSCC in one HSCC category, such as dry <b>premilking</b> treatment (− 9, 100 cells/mL in the low HSCC category) or feeding calves with high SCC milk (11, 100 cells/mL in the medium HSCC category). Others had an opposite effect on HSCC in different HSCC categories, such as average parity (− 6, 400 and 11, 000 cells/mL in the low and medium HSCC category, respectively) and feeding calves with fresh milk (10, 300 and − 9, 700 cells/mL in the low and high HSCC category, respectively). We conclude that, given the individual Dairy Herd Improvement data and information on management practices of an individual farm, it is possible to provide quantitative insight into {{the contribution}} of these different variables to the HSCC of an individual farm. Being able to provide such insight is a prerequisite for interpretation, prediction, and control of HSCC on individual dairy farms...|$|E

The occurrence of B. cereus spores in the housing environment of dairy cows was investigated and the routes of contamination elucidated also measures to improve hygiene in cubicles and alleys were tested. High numbers of spores were found in deep sawdust bedded cubicles hence a source of contamination of milk via soiled teats. In laboratory tests, type of different bedding material, pH, {{and the availability of}} nutrient in form of faeces in the beds were shown to be important factors for the growth of B. cereus. In deep sawdust bedded cubicles more frequent adding of fresh bedding and entire bed replacement had a limited effect on reducing spore content in the beds. It was shown by experimentally feeding spores to cows that highly contaminated feed could be a potential source of contamination via faeces and soiled teats. The effects of different <b>premilking</b> teat-cleaning methods were evaluated on experimentally spore contaminated teats. The most effective method in reducing the milk spore content (96 % reduction) was the use of a moist washable towel with or without soap followed by drying with a dry paper towel. Mechanical scrapers on top of the slatted floor reduced the amount of manure on alley floor, hence reducing the faecal contamination in the cubicles, and improving the hygiene score of udder and teats.

40|$|Eight cows were machine milked {{either in}} an {{operating}} theatre {{or in their}} familiar barn. During the experiments, milk flow curves were recorded and blood samples were taken for determination of concentrations of oxytocin, prolactin, cortisol and β-endorphin. The milking cluster was attached without udder preparation. After cessation of milk flow, air was blown into the vagina for 2 min. When milk flow had stopped again, 1 i. u. oxytocin and finally 10 i. u. oxytocin were injected to remove the remaining milk. After the start of milking, oxytocin remained basal in unfamiliar, but increased in familiar surroundings. Therefore, during normal milking only 9 % of total milk was removed in unfamiliar, whereas 79 % was available in familiar surroundings. In response to subsequent vaginal stimulation in the operating theatre, oxytocin increased transiently in five cows and 15 - 71 % of the milk was removed in these animals. In the other three cows in the operating theatre, oxytocin remained basal during vaginal stimulation, and no more milk was available. After injection of 1 i. u. oxytocin, 56 and 11 %, and after injection of 10 i. u. oxytocin, 13 and 8 % of milk was removed in unfamiliar and familiar surroundings respectively. Concentrations of prolactin increased {{during the course of}} milking in both treatments. <b>Premilking</b> concentrations of cortisol and β-endorphin were elevated in unfamiliar as compared with familiar surroundings. During the course of milking, cortisol increased slightly and β-endorphin decreased in unfamiliar, whereas both hormones increased markedly during milking in familiar surroundings. We conclude that disturbed milk removal in unfamiliar surroundings is due to central inhibition of oxytocin release during normal milking and partly also to a response to vaginal stimulation.

A concentration of 1. 6 % phenol + phenate was chosen as experimental teat dip, and 0. 5 % iodine served as control. The field study was conducted at Beltsville (n = 185) and Clarksville (n = 100) dairy herds using a split herd design. Teat dips were used <b>premilking</b> and postmilking for 12 mo.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the relationship between cow and udder cleanliness scores and the risk of isolation of Klebsiella spp. from lower hind legs and teat ends, respectively. The distribution of Klebsiella species was compared among isolates from teat ends, legs, and cases of clinical mastitis obtained from 2 dairy farms in New York State, with 850 and 1, 000 cows, respectively. Farms were visited twice approximately 4 wk apart in August and September 2007 to obtain cleanliness scores and swabs from legs and teats. Isolates of Klebsiella clinical mastitis from each farm were collected from July through October 2007. Two studies were conducted. In the first study, whole-cow cleanliness of a purposive sample of 200 lactating cows was scored using a 4 -point scale, and swabs were taken from their lower hind legs. In the second study, udder cleanliness of a separate convenience sample of 199 lactating cows was scored in the milking parlor, and swabs were taken from their teat ends before and after <b>premilking</b> udder preparation. Prevalence of Klebsiella spp. on legs and teat ends before udder preparation was 59 and 60 %, respectively. Logistic regression was used to explore the association between isolation of Klebsiella spp. and cleanliness scores. Cow cleanliness scores and udder cleanliness scores were not associated with detection of Klebsiella on legs and on teats before udder preparation, respectively. After udder preparation, 43 % of previously Klebsiella positive teat end samples remained positive, with significant differences between farms and months. Teats from dirty udders {{were significantly more likely to}} test positive for Klebsiella after udder preparation than teats from clean udders. The proportion of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates was similar for isolates from teat end swabs and clinical mastitis cases, supporting the notion that the presence of Klebsiella on teat ends may lead to opportunistic intramammary infections. Udder cleanliness scores could be used as a management tool to monitor the risk of exposure to Klebsiella spp. on teat ends...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{method of}} spread for S agalactiae and S aureus is from cow to cow, so {{prevention}} focuses on {{within and between}} herd biosecurity to reduce or eliminate the reservoir of infection. S agalactiae is an obligate pathogen of the mammary gland, whereas S aureus is more widespread on other cow body sites and in the environment. Both organisms cause persistent infections, with S agalactiae typically causing higher SCC and bacteria counts in milk. Conventional methods of detection through culture perform well at the cow level. In bulk tanks, augmented procedures should be considered. PCR methods show promise of high sensitivity and specificity, at both the cow and bulk tank level. In developed dairy industries, prevalence of infection has decreased dramatically over the past 30 years for S agalactiae. For S aureus, the herd level of infection remains very high, although with rigorous, consistent application of control measures, within-herd prevalence has decreased. Because the milking time is the primary period for new IMI, it {{is the focal point}} of most prevention activities. <b>Premilking</b> and postmilking teat disinfection and proper stimulation and milk-out with adequately functioning equipment are key factors. There is growing evidence that the use of milking gloves {{is an integral part of}} contagious mastitis control and the production of high-quality milk. Treatment success is dramatically different between the 2 pathogens. For S agalactiae, eradication can be completed rapidly through a culture and treatment program with minimal culling. For S aureus, treatment success, particularly during lactation, is often disappointing and depends on cow, pathogen, and treatment factors. These factors should be reviewed prior to initiating any treatment to determine the potential for cure. Blanket dry cow therapy and strategic culling are important control procedures for contagious mastitis pathogens. Maintaining a closed herd or, at minimum, adhering to clearly defined biosecurity protocols is critical to reduce risk of reintroduction of S agalactiae or the addition of new, potentially more virulent strains of S aureus to endemic herds.

40|$|The {{effects of}} manual teat {{stimulation}} compared with stimulation by the liner {{of a conventional}} milking machine {{and the influence of}} milk ejection on the course of milk flow during the entire milking were investigated. Twelve cows were milked with or without prestimulation on three quarters and milk flow was recorded while intramammary pressure (IMP) was recorded in the left front quarter and blood samples for the determination of oxytocin (OT) were taken at 1 min intervals. OT concentrations increased very similarly in response to manual teat stimulation or liner stimulation and remained elevated during the entire milking procedure. Milk flow curves were generally bimodal without stimulation and not bimodal during milking after prestimulation. Milk yield was not significantly lower in milkings without than with stimulation, whereas machine-on time was prolonged and peak milk flow rate was reduced during milking without stimulation. Time to reach milk flow plateau, time to reach peak flow rate and IMP profiles were similar in both treatments if time was calculated from the start of stimulation. IMP increased similarly in response to manual or liner teat stimulation. In milkings with and without prestimulation IMP did not reach its maximum until the start of milking. In bimodal milk flow curves the second increase of milk flow occurred concomitantly with the start of IMP increase; ejection IMP generally occurred concomitantly with the milk flow plateau. In some cases during milking without prestimulation only small and transient OT release was observed. In response, IMP did not increase to its maximum and increased further in response to a stripping-related OT release. During the course of milking IMP decreased slightly because of the emptying of the three milked quarters. After the end of milking, and with OT concentrations decreasing to the <b>premilking</b> values, IMP again decreased slightly to another plateau, probably owing to myoepithelial relaxation. Thus the course of milk ejection, i. e. the IMP profile, influenced milk removal markedly during early milkin...|$|E

40|$|Mastitis is {{the main}} disease entity {{affecting}} dairy farms in the Colombian High Plains of northern Antioquia, Colombia. However, no previous epidemiologic studies have determined the characteristics that {{increase the risk of}} infection in this region, where manual milking is still the prevailing system of milking. A 24 -mo longitudinal study was designed to identify the predominant mastitis pathogens and important herd- and cow-level risk factors. Monthly visits were made to 37 commercial dairy farms to collect herd- and cow-level data and milk samples. Herd size varied from 6 to 136 cows (mean 37. 0, median 29). Herd-level factors included type of milking system (manual or mechanical) and a range of management practices recommended by the National Mastitis Council (Madison, WI) to prevent mastitis. Individual cow-level risk factors included parity, stage of lactation, breed, udder hygiene, and lameness. A logistic regression analysis was used to investigate associations between herd- and cow-level risk factors with the presence of subclinical mastitis and infection caused by Streptococcus agalactiae at the quarter level. A quarter was considered to have subclinical mastitis if it had a positive California Mastitis Test and was subsequently confirmed to have a somatic cell count of ≥ 200, 000 cells/mL. Any cow with one or more quarters with subclinical mastitis was considered to have subclinical mastitis at the cow level. Using 17, 622 cow observations, the mean prevalence of subclinical mastitis at the cow level was 37. 2 % (95 % confidence interval: 31. 2, 43. 3) for the first month and did not substantially change throughout the study. The predominant microorganisms isolated from quarters meeting the subclinical mastitis definition were contagious pathogens, including Strep. agalactiae (34. 4 %), Corynebacterium spp. (13. 2 %), and Staphylococcus aureus (8. 0 %). Significant variables associated with subclinical mastitis risk at the quarter level included being a purebred Holstein cow, higher parity, and increased months in milk. Variables that were protective for mastitis risk included being a crossbreed cow and adequate <b>premilking</b> udder hygiene. Significant variables associated with Strep. agalactiae infection were higher parity, increased months in milk, and manual milking. Variables that were protective were postmilking teat dipping and adequate cleaning of the udder.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{intramammary}} infections (IMI) are a {{major cause}} of mastitis on farms worldwide. Incidence and elimination rates are the key determinants of prevalence of Staph. aureus, and risk factors associated with these rates must be identified, prioritized, and controlled to obtain long-term reduction in prevalence. The objectives of this study were to identify manageable risk factors associated with the lactational incidence, elimination, and prevalence of Staph. aureus IMI. A cohort of 90 Canadian dairy farms was recruited and followed in 2007 and 2008. Quarter milk samples were collected repeatedly from a selection of cows, and bacteriological culture was realized to assess incidence, elimination, and prevalence of Staph. aureus IMI. Practices used on farms were measured using direct observations and a validated questionnaire. A linear regression model was used to explore the relationship between herd IMI prevalence and incidence and elimination rates. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to compute measures of associations between practices used on farms and IMI incidence, elimination, and prevalence. The herd incidence rate was the most important predictor of herd IMI prevalence: a reduction of the incidence rate equivalent to its interquartile range (0. 011 new IMI/quarter-month) was associated with a prevalence reduction of 2. 2 percentage points; in comparison, an equivalent increase of the elimination rate by its interquartile range (0. 36 eliminated IMI/quarter-month) resulted in a prevalence reduction of 0. 4 percentage points. Postmilking teat disinfection and blanket dry-cow therapy were already implemented by most herds. Most of the practices associated with Staph. aureus IMI incidence were related to milking procedures. Among these, wearing gloves during milking showed desirable associations with IMI incidence, elimination, and prevalence. Similarly, adequate teat-end condition and use of <b>premilking</b> teat disinfection were associated with lower IMI incidence and prevalence. The initial herd prevalence of Staph. aureus IMI was positively associated with subsequent IMI incidence. This indicates that, in some situations, an initial reduction of the pool of infected quarters could be justified. Some housing practices were associated with IMI incidence, elimination, or prevalence. The effects of these latter practices, however, were often influenced by specific cow characteristics such as parity or days in milk. These results highlight the importance of good milking practices to prevent Staph. aureus IMI acquisition and, therefore, reduce their prevalence. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) {{have become}} the main {{pathogens}} causing bovine mastitis in recent years. A huge variation in species distribution among herds has been observed in several studies, emphasizing the need to identify subgroup- and species specific herd-level factors to improve {{our understanding of the}} differences in ecological and epidemiological nature between species. The use of bulk milk samples enables the inclusion of a large(r) number of herds needed to identify herd-level risk factors and increases the likelihood of recovering enough isolates per species needed for conducting subgroup- and, eventually, species-specific analyses at the same time. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and distribution of CNS species in bulk milk samples and to identify associated subgroup- and species-specific herd-level factors. Ninety percent of all bulk milk samples yielded CNS. Staphylococcus equorum was the predominant species, followed by Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. A seasonal effect was observed for several CNS species. Bulk milk samples from herds with a loose-pack or a tiestall housing system were more likely to yield CNS species compared with herds with a freestall barn, except for S. epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans, and Staphylococcus cohnii. In September, herds in which udders were clipped had lower odds of yielding Staphylococcus chromogenes, S. simulans, and Staphylococcus xylosus, the CNS species assumed to be most relevant for udder health, in their bulk milk than herds in which udder clipping was not practiced. Bulk milk of herds participating in a monthly veterinary udder health-monitoring program was more likely to yield these 3 CNS species. Herds always receiving their milk quality premium or predisinfecting teats before attachment of the milking cluster had lower odds of having S. equorum in their bulk milk. Herds not using a single dry cotton or paper towel for each cow during <b>premilking</b> udder preparation {{were more likely to have}} S. cohnii-positive bulk milk. Herds in which flushing with hot water or steam of the milking cluster after having milked a cow with a (sub) clinical mastitis was applied, were less likely to yield S. simulans, S. haemolyticus, and S. cohnii in their bulk milk. Always wearing gloves during milking decreased the odds of having Staphylococcus devriesei-positive bulk milk. Tap water from the public drinking system used as drinking water increased the odds of yielding S. simulans in the bulk milk. In conclusion, CNS are highly prevalent in bulk milk and might originate from the environment for some species (we hypothesize this is true for S. equorum or S. cohnii), or from within the udder (e. g., for S. simulans). Studies collecting bulk milk and quarter milk samples at the same time along with environmental samples are needed to determine the exact origin of the different (subgroups of) CNS species present in bulk milk using strain-typing techniques...|$|E
