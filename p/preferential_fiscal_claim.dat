The {{results show that the}} return of migrant workers is mainly attributed to personal factors, while social factors are also very important. The major difficulties facing return migrant workers is the funding difficulties, complicated formalities to start a business, difficulty in safeguarding their rights and interests, their own low quality and so on. The support needed by the return migrant workers from the government is manifested in five aspects, say, to improve the service and management for the entrepreneurship of migrant workers, to provide financing policy support, to increase the <b>preferential</b> <b>fiscal</b> and taxation policies, to enhance the entrepreneurship training and to provide preference for the return migrant workers to use land.

By using a special sample design and panel data from 1996 - 2006, this paper provides empirical evidence to support the argument that China’s ethnic policy does allocate more resources to Minority Autonomous Counties through the Transfer Payments system. However, due to different expenditure preferences, governments in Minority Autonomous Counties do not always devote these extra resources to development-related expenditure. Instead, Transfer Payments largely flow into administration and wage compensation. This different expenditure structure provides an explanation for the paradox of the simultaneous occurrence of higher fiscal revenue, poor public goods provision, and slower economic development in minority areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{enactment}} of the Code of Fiscal Procedure in 2003 represents a major step toward the unification of the Romanian fiscal legislation. Unfortunately, the Romanian Fiscal Law continues to be scattered by the {{enactment of}} a plethora of legislative acts and regulations which intend to complete or modify the Code of Fiscal Procedure. This paper studies chapter I of the Third Title of the Code of Fiscal Procedure entitled “General Procedural Provisions”. This chapter provides for the general jurisdiction of the fiscal bodies (Art. 32 to 36 of the Code of Fiscal Procedure). The authors define concepts such as jurisdiction of the fiscal bodies, general jurisdiction (Art. 32 of the Code), territorial jurisdiction (Art. 33 of the Code), jurisdiction on the secondary seats (Art. 34 of the Code), territorial jurisdiction of the fiscal branches of the local public administration (Art. 35 of the Code) as well as special jurisdiction (Art. 36 of the Code) by inference from the same notions used by the Civil Procedure Law (that is the common law for the interpretation and completion of the Code of Fiscal Procedure).

Therefore, this research was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effect of the proposed fiscal terms on upstream petroleum investment, in which the IOCs are involved. Hence, document analysis and economic indicators of investment profitability were employed in the conduct of this study. The results show that, even though petroleum projects remain profitable under the proposed fiscal terms, the lack of fiscal stability will negatively affect investment at least in the short term. This study should be of assistance to policy makers, legislators, industry regulators and other stakeholders to better appreciate the implications of the PIB-proposed fiscal system and terms on investment in the upstream petroleum sector...|$|R

40|$|Background: Minnesota was {{the first}} state in the USA to {{implement}} a large state funded tobacco control programme (in 1985). Despite evidence of effectiveness, it was dismantled in 1993. Objective: To describe and analyse how and why these events transpired and identify lessons for tobacco control advocates facing similar challenges in the 21 st century. Design: Case study based on previously secret tobacco industry documents, news reports, research reports, official documents, and interviews with health advocates and state government officials. Results: Unable to defeat funding for this campaign in 1985, the tobacco industry organised groups which eliminated it later. Despite the programme's documented effectiveness, it was dismantled based on <b>claims</b> of <b>fiscal</b> crisis. These <b>claims</b> were not true; the real debate was {{what to do with}} the state's surplus. Health advocates failed to challenge the <b>claim</b> of <b>fiscal</b> crisis or mobilise public support for the programme.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{conventional}} wisdom has held that fixed rates provide more fiscal discipline than do flexible rates. In this paper we show that this wisdom need not hold in a standard model in which fiscal policy is endogenously determined by a maximizing <b>fiscal</b> authority. The <b>claim</b> that fixed rates induce more discipline stresses that sustained adoption of lax fiscal policies must eventually lead to an exhaustion of reserves and thus to a politically costly collapse of the peg. Hence, under fixed rates bad behavior today leads to punishment tomorrow. Under flexible rates bad behavior has costs as well. The difference is in the intertemporal distribution of these costs: flexible rates allow the effects of unsound fiscal policies to manifest themselves immediately through movements in the exchange rate. Hence, bad behavior today leads to punishment today. If fiscal authorities are impatient, flexible rates - by forcing the costs to be paid up-front - provide more fiscal discipline and higher welfare for the representative private agent. The recent experience of Sub- Saharan countries supplies some preliminary evidence that matches the predictions of the model. ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{conventional}} regulatory approaches {{can affect}} prices {{in much the}} same way, while lacking the revenue-recycling potential of ecotaxes. Moreover, correctly assessing distributive impact of any tax shift requires an analysis of the specific instrument design features. For example, tax revenue could be redistributed on a per capita basis as part of a basic income scheme; in this case, the poorest would gain what the average citizen pays as ecotaxes, minus their own small contribution (no car, small apartment, ...). This design would be highly progressive. Alternatively, an ecotax can have a [...] "lifeline" [...] design, in which modest consumption levels are priced relatively low (even zero, in the case of water), and higher consumption levels are priced at a higher rate. Furthermore, an ecotax policy package can include revenue recycling to reduce or eliminate any regressivity; an increase in an ecotax could be more than offset by a decrease in a (regressive) payroll or consumption tax. Some proponents claim a second benefit of increased employment or lower health care costs as the market and society adjust to the new <b>fiscal</b> policy (these <b>claims,</b> as with the claim [...] "tax cuts create jobs," [...] are often difficult to prove or disprove even after the fact).|$|R
40|$|In {{the growing}} {{literature}} {{that shows that}} higher levels of trade lead to a larger public sector, politics remains prominently absent. As openness increases, the state, acting as a social planner, adopts a salient role to minimize the risks of higher economic integration as well as secure social peace. Given the highly redistributive nature of both trade and <b>fiscal</b> policies, we <b>claim,</b> however, that {{the interaction of the}} international economy and domestic politics may lead to three distinct political-economic equilibria. First, nations may embrace protectionist policies to shore up the welfare of key domestic sectors [...] without having to engage, therefore, in substantial public spending. Second, to maintain trade openness in democratic settings, policymakers have to develop publicly-funded compensatory schemes to muster the support of the losers of higher economic integration. Finally, given the tax burden of public compensation, pro-free trade sectors may resort to impose an authoritarian regime to exclude (instead of buying off) their opponents. After exploring, through a formal model, the conditions under which each of these three regimes emerges, we successfully test the implications of the paper on a sample of around sixty developing and developed nations for the period 1950 - 1990. In this literature, different institutional structures may distort or slow down the current balance of power of socioeconomic actors (yet without contradicting them permanently). See Garrett and Lange (1996) and also Alt et al. (1996). 1 In exploring the interaction of the international economy and domestic politics, two research agendas stand out in the last years. On the one hand, a first avenue of inquiry has examined how domestic politics determines trade policy and the degree of econo [...] ...|$|R
