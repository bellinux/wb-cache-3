50|$|In the UK, the {{pantographs}} {{of older}} vehicles are raised by air pressure, and the graphite contact strips cover some vents in the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> which release the air if a graphite strip is lost, automatically lowering the pantograph to prevent damage. Newer electric traction units may use more sophisticated methods involving microprocessors which detect the disturbances caused by arcing {{at the point}} of contact if the graphite strips are damaged. There are always at least two pantographs so the other one can be used if one is damaged. The rearmost pantograph in relation to the direction of travel is often, though not always, used to preclude damage to the other in case of entanglements.|$|E

40|$|Some {{domestic}} flight routes in Norway {{rank among the}} busiest in Europe. Experience has shown that, {{in countries such as}} France and Germany, high velocity trains can be preferable to flying, given that the distance is not too great (usually under 1000 km). The {{domestic flight}} routes mentioned are all under that limit and therefore, there is great interest for increasing velocities of trains travelling in Norway. The biggest barrier for this purpose is the dynamic behaviour of the catenary [...] pantograph system, which is the system supplying power to the train. This thesis covers the modelling of that system, experimentally and numerically. The catenary [...] pantograph system mainly consists of a messenger wire, contact wire and a pantograph. Electrical power is transmitted from the contact wire through the pantograph to the train's engine. Consistent contact between the <b>pantograph's</b> <b>head</b> and contact wire is vital for the train to operate at high velocities. Too much or too little contact leads to increased wear in the system. In order to examine the performance of the system, the contact force is defined, i. e. the force at the point of contact. This force {{is one of the most}} important property of the system and the aim of this thesis is to find out which of the system's parameters affect it. These parameters are related to the overhead wires and the pantograph. Many researches and studies have focused on the pantograph and it is a well defined part of the system, however the overhead lines are less known and will therefore be the main focus of this thesis. </p...|$|R
50|$|The four cars couldn't be {{separated}} in normal operation. Because {{there was no}} traction voltage cable running through the train, both power heads (front and back cars) were equipped with a <b>pantograph.</b> Both power <b>heads</b> had a driver's cab and automatic +GF+-couplers. The trainsets featured multiple unit train control, whereby technically all four units could have been run together (but platforms usually were too short). The couplers mechanically fit onto those of the RABDe 12/12.|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of new types of {{electric}} train, one of the design criteria used in the UK is a limit on the displacement in high wind conditions between the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> (which collects the electrical current) and the overhead conductor wire to prevent the process known as dewirement.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common way to collect the {{traction}} current needed for the underground vehicle operation is by using the pantograph-overhead line system. The periodically check of pantographs and overhead lines is important to assure the correct interaction between the two systems in terms of good current collection quality. The main diagnostic tools are the monitoring of the vertical force between the overhead line and the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> and the vertical acceleration on the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head.</b> The pantograph system works under high voltage (1500 V DC in our tests) and high electromagnetic disturbances are present. For this reason, traditional electrical sensors can be used only with particular precautions that complicate the measurement set up. Fibre optic sensors, and in particular fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, are particularly suitable for this application. In this paper, the application of the FBG sensors on a pantograph for the monitoring of underground pantograph-catenary system is presented. FBG sensors are used to measure both the contact force and the vertical acceleration of the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head.</b> The same measurements are also gathered with a traditional electrical system, allowing a comparison. The result is a very good agreement between electrical and optical measurements, except in particular frequency ranges where the different positioning of the sensors influences the output limiting the comparison. Moreover, some interesting results on the dynamic behaviour of the pantograph and its interaction with the overhead line are presented. Finally a method to point out the main defects on the overhead line is shown...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA crucial {{system for}} the {{operation}} of high-speed trains is the pantograph catenary interface {{as it is the}} sole responsible to deliver electrical power to the train. Being the catenary a stationary system with a long lifespan it is also less likely to be redesigned and upgraded than the pantographs that fit the train vehicles. This letter proposes an optimization procedure for the improvement of the contact quality between the pantograph and the catenary solely based on the redesign of the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> suspension characteristics. A pantograph model is defined and validated against experimental dynamic characteristics of existing pantographs. An optimization strategy based on the use of a global optimization method, to find the vicinity of the optimal solution, followed by the use of a deterministic optimization algorithm, to fine tune the optimal solution, is applied here. The spring stiffness, damping characteristics and bow mass are the design variables used for the pantograph optimization. The objective of the optimal problem is the minimization of the standard deviation of the contact force history, which is the most important quantity to define the contact quality. The <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> suspension characteristics are allowed to vary within technological realistic limits. It is found that current high-speed railway pantographs have a limited potential for mechanical improvements, not exceeding 10 %– 15 % on the decrease of the standard deviation of the contact force...|$|E
30|$|In {{high-speed}} rail vehicle systems, {{the main problem}} {{is related to the}} interaction between the train pantograph and the catenary. Indeed, when the train runs, the pantograph deforms the catenary and oscillatory motions are induced. Moreover, when the train speed increases, these oscillations may become larger and the loss of contact between the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> and the collector wire could occur. Thus, when the pantograph moves along the catenary, it is fluctuated due to propagation and reflection of the wave on the catenary, which leads to a modification in its dynamics depending on the position [1].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a diagnostic system mainly aimed at overhead line continuous monitoring. The main idea {{is the use}} of <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> accelerations to identify the behaviour of contact force, so as to develop a non intrusive maintenance free system able to recognize relevant defects and installable on an ordinary fleet of trains. The proposed set-up is aimed at improving the present-day scheduled catenary and pantograph maintenance, leading towards condition-based maintenance. Meaningful indications about pantograph-catenary interaction are obtained by the processing and analysis of collector accelerations; summary indexes are computed in real time during the train run and compared with alarm limits...|$|E
40|$|Trains current {{collection}} for traction motors is obtained {{by means of}} a sliding contact between the overhead line (OHL) and the collector strips mounted on the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head.</b> The normal force by which the collector presses against the contact wire ensures the contact pressure for the electrical contact. As the train speed increases, the variation of contact force between pantograph and catenary increases, and the pantograph-OHL dynamic interaction becomes greater. This condition causes excessive mechanical wear and contact wire uplift (for high values of contact forces), and leads to high percentage of contact loss, arcing and electrically related wear...|$|E
30|$|At present, the {{coupling}} relationship between the pantograph and catenary is not ideal for straddle-type monorail. The power collection quality is poor, and the wear of the contact strip of a pantograph is uneven. Therefore, the key problem of coupling {{relation between the}} pantograph and catenary is the dynamics of a pantograph–catenary system. This paper analyzed the modal of catenary through simulation with finite element model and the vibration modal of pantograph multi-rigid-body dynamic model by simulation in multi-body danamics software ADAMS. A rigid-flexible coupling dynamic model of pantograph–catenary system is established. Finally, extensive research has been made on the influence of <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> parameters on the power collection quality.|$|E
40|$|The current {{collection}} for the traction motor of trains is obtained {{by means of}} a sliding contact between the overhead line (OHL) and the collector strips mounted on the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head.</b> As the train speed increases, the variation of contact force exchanged between the pantograph and the OHL, dependent on their dynamic interaction, becomes greater. This condition causes excessive mechanical wear and contact wire uplift (for high values of contact forces), and leads to high percentage of loss of contact, arcing and electrically related wear if too low values of contact forces occur. The topic of actively controlled pantograph is gaining more interest as a tool to increase the performance of {{current collection}}.

40|$|Contacts between {{pantograph}} and catenary are {{the most}} critical parts in the transmission of electrical energy for modern high-speed trains. Contact wire oscillations change combined force between pantograph and catenary, and the contact may even get lost. Therefore special pantographs and catenaries have been developed and further constructive changes are under development. A design criterion includes the permanent contact of <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> and contact wire at high speed and the reduction of both aero acoustic noise and wear. Because of complicated dynamic behaviour and very high costs for prototypes, all modifications and new design concepts for the pantograph/catenary system are essentially based on dynamical simulation. Traditional approaches focus on the catenary, which is modelled as set of coupled strings and/or beams, whereas simplified lumped mass models are {{used to describe the}} pantograph. Nowadays increased computer power allows considering applications with more refined pantograph modes (e. g. the elasticity of the pantograph) and active control components in innovative pantograph concepts...|$|E
40|$|As is well known, the {{external}} disturbance (especially the stochastic wind load) has nonnegligible {{effect on the}} operation of pantograph-catenary system, which may cause the strong fluctuation in contact force {{as well as the}} increased occurrence of contact loss. In order to improve the current collection quality of a high-speed railway pantograph-catenary system under a strong stochastic wind field, a sliding mode controller with a proportional-derivative (PD) sliding surface for a high-speed active pantograph is proposed. The nonlinear finite element procedure is employed to establish the catenary model. The fluctuating wind speeds along catenary are simulated using empirical spectrums. The buffeting forces exerted on contact and messenger wires are derived to construct the stochastic wind field along the catenary. A PD sliding surface is properly determined to guarantee that the mechanical impedance of <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> at the dominant frequencies of contact force decreases when the sliding surface approaches zero. Through several numerical simulations with different wind velocities and wind angles, the control performance of two popular control laws (proportional switching law and constant switching law) is evaluated...|$|E

The topic of actively controlled pantograph is gaining more interest as a tool to increase the performance of the {{current collection}} at high speed. In the last few years, it appears possible to transfer the knowledge based on numerical experiments, to the real operating condition. An important step in this direction is the set up of a laboratory hardware in the loop test-rig in which the control strategies and the actuation can be tested, before tests performing in real life conditions, in order to demonstrate their actual feasibility. The present paper describes an hardware in the loop (HIL) test-rig developed by the authors, which allows to reproduce the dynamical interaction between overhead lines and pantograph in high speed railways. Using the described laboratory set-up, experimental investigation on the problems related with pantograph-OHL interaction can be performed, very similarly to the real life operating conditions, with the advantage of varying test parameters and conditions easily...|$|E
