5|$|Douglas Seale as The Sultan, the <b>pompous,</b> but kind {{ruler of}} Agrabah, who desperately {{tries to find}} a suitor for his {{daughter}} Jasmine. Some aspects of the character were inspired by the Wizard of Oz, to create a bumbling authority figure. The Sultan's supervising animator was David Pruiksma.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{begins with}} and is regularly visited by a broad, ceremonial and somewhat <b>pompous</b> melody (D), played on brass and woodwind. In between these formal-sounding statements are a cheerful cornet solo and various elaborations and {{variations on the}} Kijé theme, which together give the movement a celebratory feel, both boisterous and sentimental.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{representative}} {{measures for}} embracing the German-Japanese partnership were sought {{and the construction}} of a new Japanese embassy building in Berlin was started. After the preceding embassy had to give way to Hitler's and Albert Speer's plans of re-modeling Berlin to the world capital city of Germania, a new and more <b>pompous</b> building was erected in a newly established diplomatic district next to the Tiergarten. It was conceived by Ludwig Moshamer under the supervision of Speer and was placed opposite the Italian embassy, thereby bestowing an architectural emphasis on the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis.|$|E
5|$|Maggie {{attends a}} junior high school called Buzzdale Academy with her best friend Rayna Cartflight (Cree Summer) and nemesis Dawn Swatworthy (Strong). The school's staff include the sneaky Principal Peststrip (Jeff Bennett), <b>pompous</b> Mr. Bugspit (Curtis Armstrong) and gruff Mrs. Wingston (Candi Milo). The Buzz on Maggie uses a slapstick comedy style and relies {{slightly}} on gross-out humor. It also includes several insect aspects, such as flies' appetite for spoiled and rotten food. The show features various references to pop culture and common themes, such as sibling rivalry and peer pressure, from a fly's point of view.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the main}} characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is <b>pompous,</b> complacent, and {{something}} of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a liar and a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.|$|E
5|$|SCE Cambridge {{wanted the}} game to possess a unique lead character, thus Sorrell worked with script doctor Martin Pond whilst {{creating}} an expansive backstory for the lead protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque. Pond {{came up with the}} idea that Sir Daniel could have been a <b>pompous</b> failure in life whose reincarnation was his one shot at redemption. This idea, along with the player-character's unusual appearance, turned appealing to some sectors of the gaming community, as lead designer Wilson later recalled that female gamers considered Sir Daniel to be endearing, and was considered a sex symbol in France.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Espejo's {{first three}} works was the {{intellectual}} improvement of Quito. El Nuevo Luciano de Quito ridiculed the outdated educational system {{maintained by the}} clergy. Espejo argued {{that the people of}} Quito were accustomed to adulation and that they admired any preacher who could quote the Bible in a <b>pompous</b> and insubstantial way. Marco Porcio Catón exposed the ignorance of the pseudointellectuals of Quito. La ciencia blancardina, in which Espejo claimed to be the author of the previous two works, condemned the results of the clergy's educational system: ignorance and affectation. All three works caused polemic.|$|E
5|$|Bilbo Baggins, the titular protagonist, is a respectable, {{reserved}} hobbit. During his adventure, Bilbo often {{refers to}} {{the contents of his}} larder at home and wishes he had more food. Until he finds a magic ring, he is more baggage than help. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves. During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key moments in the story. Thorin Oakenshield, the proud, <b>pompous</b> head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo {{to get him out of}} trouble, but he proves himself a mighty warrior. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{professional}} stage debut in 1983, playing Tim Allgood in Michael Frayn's Noises Off, which {{ran for a}} year at the Savoy Theatre. To broaden his knowledge of working on stage, he joined the National Theatre. He supplemented his stage roles in the 1980s with television roles, appearing in comedies such as the aborted pilot episode of Blackadder, Chelmsford 123, The Lenny Henry Show and the first episode of Red Dwarf. In 1991, he won his first major television role playing Mark Taylor in Steven Moffat's semi-autobiographical BBC sitcom Joking Apart. Although only thirteen episodes were made between 1991 and 1995, the role remains Bathurst's favourite of his whole career. After Joking Apart concluded, he was cast as <b>pompous</b> management consultant David Marsden in the ITV comedy drama Cold Feet, which ran for five series from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the <b>pompous</b> formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with <b>pompous</b> and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|Suter even {{concludes that}} the peasant war of 1653 thwarted a further {{advancement}} of absolutist trends in Switzerland and prevented a development similar to that which occurred in France following the Fronde. The authorities of the Swiss cantons had to act much more carefully and were forced to respect their rural subjects. The Bernese for instance instructed their district sheriffs to employ a far less <b>pompous</b> and less authoritarian attitude to minimize the conflict potential. The city council even opened legal procedures against a few of its district sheriffs against whom there were many complaints from the rural population, accusing them of corruption, incompetence, and unjustified enrichment. The district sheriff of Trachselwald, the same Samuel Tribolet who had captured Niklaus Leuenberger, was dismissed, tried, and exiled in early 1654. Abraham Stanyan, who had been ambassador of England in Bern from 1705 to 1713, published in 1714 an extensive treatise entitled An account of Switzerland, in which he described the authorities' rule as particularly mild, mentioning explicitly the low taxation in comparison to other European states and giving {{as the reason for}} the comparatively soft-gloved government the fear of rebellions.|$|E
25|$|J. K. Simmons as Leodore Lionheart, a lion {{who is the}} noble, but <b>pompous</b> Mayor of Zootopia.|$|E
25|$|The Mayor of Champignac. Petty, <b>pompous,</b> ineffectual and two-faced, he {{is mostly}} memorable for his {{trademark}} speeches {{in which he}} piles up mixed metaphors sky-high.|$|E
25|$|Viktor Sitnikov – A <b>pompous</b> and foolhardy {{friend of}} Bazarov who joins populist ideals and groups. Like Arkady, he is heavily {{influenced}} by Bazarov in his ideals.|$|E
25|$|According to Benny, {{the huge}} laugh {{resulted}} from the long buildup, and the audience's knowledge that Benny, with his <b>pompous</b> persona, would have {{to break into the}} conversation at some point.|$|E
25|$|Frank Welker as Felicia, Ratigan's {{large and}} <b>pompous</b> pet cat. Ratigan calls upon her by ringing a special bell {{to dispose of}} traitors or anyone who makes him angry. She is chased by Toby and eaten by Royal Guard Dogs during {{the climax of the}} film.|$|E
25|$|Mr. William Collins – Mr. Collins, aged 25 {{years old}} as the novel begins, is Mr. Bennet's distant second cousin, a clergyman, and the current heir {{presumptive}} to his estate of Longbourn House. He is an obsequious and <b>pompous</b> man who is excessively devoted to his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.|$|E
25|$|Brooks' {{father died}} in 1874; Reginald Shirley Brooks {{collated}} some of his father's satirical writing for Punch about a <b>pompous</b> middle-class couple called The Naggletons into book form and it was published the following year. A further volume of his father's epigrammatic verses was published under the title of Wit and Humour and reviewed in 1884.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Collins, {{a cousin}} of Mr. Bennet and heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family. He is a <b>pompous</b> and obsequious clergyman, who expects each of the Bennet girls to wish to marry him due to his inheritance. He quickly decides to propose to Elizabeth when he is led to believe Jane is taken.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{learning}} {{the news of}} Kazangap's death, Yedigei observes a rocket launching from the launch site north of the Boranly-Burranyi junction. Launches, though infrequent, are not unusual to Yedigei, but this one in particular is {{because he had no}} prior knowledge of it. Generally, such occasions heralded <b>pompous</b> celebration, but this one had not.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} {{is widely}} recognised for its prominent criticism and lampooning of public {{figures such as}} politicians and media tycoons, and of organisations that it considers incompetent, inefficient, corrupt, <b>pompous</b> or self-important; it has established itself as a thorn {{in the side of}} the British establishment. It is also known for its in-depth investigative journalism into under-reported scandals and cover-ups.|$|E
25|$|Though the <b>pompous</b> school {{principal}} Dr. Crabblesnitch is originally introduced {{as the main}} nemesis, this role is later replaced by Gary Smith, who initially befriends Jimmy. Gary {{is described as a}} sociopath. He admits that he suffers from attention-deficit disorder and is also a narcissist, as he considers himself smarter and better than everyone, and wants to run the school.|$|E
25|$|Bessie Busybody (played by Julie Westwood) is {{an adult}} resident. Although patronizing, she tries {{her best to}} be motherly with the children. She is aware of every new trend and is <b>pompous</b> but fashionable. She likes to talk {{on her cell phone}} and is {{sometimes}} so engaged in a phone call that she is oblivious to the events occurring around her.|$|E
25|$|Hellenistic civilization {{was highly}} cultured and sophisticated. Although the Greeks {{had a strong}} sense of {{aesthetics}}, they were highly <b>pompous,</b> and they viewed aesthetics as an end in itself. They were excessively attached to the quality of Tiferet, beauty. This was also related to an appreciation of the intellect’s transcendence over the body, which reveals the beauty of the spirit.|$|E
25|$|Carey Henderson, Speakeasy (November 5, 2002) — Timothy Hutton, {{along with}} the ever <b>pompous</b> Maury Chaykin, stars in—and directs—this amazing weekly 'who done it' on A … Wolfe takes us {{back to a time}} (or maybe just {{transports}} us to a new one) where television could be good. The bad guys lose, the good guys win, and the suits are sharper than a razor.|$|E
25|$|Media focus {{would fall}} on feminists grading {{each other on}} {{personality}} and appearance, the source of Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem's well-documented antipathy. In February 2006, shortly after Friedan's death, the feminist writer Germaine Greer published an article in The Guardian, in which she described Friedan as <b>pompous</b> and egotistic, somewhat demanding and sometimes selfish, citing several incidents during a 1972 tour of Iran.|$|E
25|$|Snooty Buttoo: A corrupt {{politician}} who hires Rashid to convince constituents that he (Buttoo) should be re-elected. Buttoo is a class-conscious, <b>pompous,</b> arrogant, self-assured person whose chief hold over his constituents {{is that he}} has been re-elected before. To persuade Rashid to sympathise with him, he offers both Rashid and Haroun a stay on a luxurious houseboat called 'The Arabian Nights Plus One'. Ultimately driven from his district by popular demand.|$|E
25|$|Lady Catherine de Bourgh – the {{overbearing}} aunt of Mr. Darcy. Lady Catherine is {{the wealthy}} owner of Rosings Park, where she resides {{with her daughter}} Anne and is fawned upon by her rector, Mr. Collins. She is haughty, <b>pompous,</b> domineering, and condescending, and has long planned to marry off her sickly daughter to Darcy, to 'unite their two great estates', claiming {{it to be the}} dearest wish of both her AND her late sister, Lady Anne Darcy (née Fitzwilliam).|$|E
25|$|It is {{traditional}} in productions of Peter Pan for Mr. Darling (the children's father) and Captain Hook {{to be played}} (or voiced) by the same actor. Although this was originally done simply to make full use of the actor (the characters appear in different sections of the story) with no thematic intent, some critics have perceived a similarity between the two characters as central figures {{in the lives of}} the children. It also brings a poignant juxtaposition between Mr. Darling's harmless bluster and Captain Hook's <b>pompous</b> vanity.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} {{individuals}} clustered with the <b>pompous</b> name of 'Armed Forces' wants to convert themselves into a privileged and all-embracing caste, shielding itself to reach its goals in Title XIII of our fundamental law, from whose trench they are preparing to stab {{the back of the}} Honduran people, having now been converted not only in the devouring octopus of the national budget, but also in a real social threat, in an imminent danger for our own security, and in an enemy of the functioning democracy in which we have dedicated our faith.|$|E
25|$|Pippi is red-haired, freckled, {{unconventional}} and superhumanly strong – able to {{lift her}} horse one-handed. She is playful and unpredictable. She often makes fun of unreasonable adults, {{especially if they are}} <b>pompous</b> and condescending. Her anger comes out in extreme cases, such as when a man ill-treats his horse. Pippi, like Peter Pan, does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a buccaneer captain and has adventure stories to tell about that too. Her four best friends are her horse and monkey, and the neighbours' children, Tommy and Annika.|$|E
25|$|Modernist {{poetry in}} English {{started in the}} early years of the 20th century with the {{appearance}} of the Imagists. In common with many other modernists, these poets wrote in reaction to the perceived excesses of Victorian poetry, with its emphasis on traditional formalism and ornate diction. In many respects, their criticism echoes what William Wordsworth wrote in Preface to Lyrical Ballads to instigate the Romantic movement in British poetry over a century earlier, criticising the gauche and <b>pompous</b> school which then pervaded, and seeking to bring poetry to the layman.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} is the {{conflict}} between Istrăteanu, a sales representative for Buștean's gristmill, and the accountant Lowenstein. Finding that Istrăteanu has been operating an unusual credit system, Lowenstein carries out a formal investigation. The events highlight the ills of a judicial system: an incompetent but <b>pompous</b> counsel, whose many blunders strengthen {{the case of an}} unscrupulous prosecutor. Istrăteanu defies the system, depicting himself as the mill's savior, and proves his case by eventually becoming the new manager. Aderca reuses his narrative framework is retaken, casually depicting Istrăteanu's exotic sexuality and his memoirs of the war.|$|E
25|$|Mr. and Mrs. Darling– George and Mary Darling are the children's loving parents. Mr. Darling is a <b>pompous,</b> blustering {{clerk in}} the City but kind at heart. Mary Darling is {{described}} as an intelligent, romantic lady. It is hinted that she knew Peter Pan before her children were born. Mr. Darling was named after the eldest Llewelyn Davies boy, George, and Mrs. Darling was named after Mary Ansell, Barrie's wife, although their personalities were based on Arthur and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. In the stage version, the roles of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook are traditionally played by the same actor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pompous</b> British {{newspaper}} magnate Lord Rawnsley (Robert Morley) forbids his would-be aviatrix daughter, ardent suffragette Patricia (Sarah Miles), from flying. Aviator Richard Mays (James Fox), a young {{army officer}} and (at least {{in his own}} eyes) Patricia's fiancé, conceives {{the idea of an}} air race from London to Paris to advance the cause of British aviation (and his career). With Patricia's support, he persuades Lord Rawnsley to sponsor the race as a publicity stunt for his newspaper. Rawnsley, who takes full credit for the idea, announces the event to the press, shocking everyone with the amount of the prize.|$|E
