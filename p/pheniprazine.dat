50|$|<b>Pheniprazine</b> (Catron, Cavodil) is an {{irreversible}} and nonselective {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor (MAOI) of the hydrazine chemical class {{that was used}} as an antidepressant in the 1960s. It was also used in the treatment of angina pectoris and schizophrenia. <b>Pheniprazine</b> has been largely discontinued due to toxicity concerns such as jaundice, amblyopia, and optic neuritis.|$|E
40|$|Cocaine, {{imipramine}} and pipradol potentiated the contractions to adrenaline and noradrenaline, {{but not to}} tyramine, on the {{nictitating membrane}} of the spinal cat. <b>Pheniprazine</b> and dexamphetamine potentiated the responses to adrenaline, noradrenaline and tyramine, whereas nialamide only potentiated the response to tyramine. Potentiation of the response to stimulation of either the preganglionic or the postganglionic sympathetic nerve trunks was observed with imipramine, pipradol, <b>pheniprazine</b> and dexamphetamine. Only dexamphetamine and <b>pheniprazine</b> caused substantial contractions of the membrane when the preganglionic nerve was cut (acutely decentralized), or when the superior cervical ganglion was removed (acutely denervated). Cocaine produced contractions of the innervated but not of the acutely decentralized membrane. The significance of the peripheral effects of these antidepressant drugs {{in relation to their}} central actions is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The effects upon {{levels of}} adenine nucleotides, phosphocreatine and {{inorganic}} phosphate of iproniazid, isoniazid, phenelzine, <b>pheniprazine,</b> tranylcypromine, harmine, imipramine, amitriptyline, orphenadrine, diphenhydramine and cocaine have been studied. With {{the exception of}} harmine and diphenhydramine, each of these compounds increased the brain level of adenosine triphosphate and, {{with the exception of}} imipramine and cocaine, the level of adenosine diphosphate decreased. Harmine had no effect on levels of adenine nucleotides and, in the case of diphenhydramine, the level of adenosine diphosphate increased and the level of adenosine triphosphate tended to decrease. There appears to be a relationship between the ability of the drugs to cause behavioural signs of central nervous stimulation and to produce an increase in the adenosine triphosphate/diphosphate ratio. This effect may be a factor in the action of antidepressive drugs...|$|E
40|$|Isolated, atropinized, rat atria {{exhibited}} positive inotropic {{responses to}} bretylium, guanethidine and tyramine. These responses were prevented by {{treatment of the}} animal with reserpine, or by addition of dichloroisoprenaline to the organ bath. The positive inotropic effects of these compounds on atria from reserpinized animals were restored by incubation of the tissue with noradrenaline. On {{the basis of these}} findings it is concluded that the cardiac stimulation by bretylium, guanethidine and tyramine involves the release of catechol amines. The usually reported increase in sensitivity of the myocardium from reserpinized animals to noradrenaline was not observed. The influence of bretylium and guanethidine on cardiac uptake and release of noradrenaline was also studied with the rat. Guanethidine decreased the concentration of catechol amines and inhibited the uptake of exogenous noradrenaline, while bretylium had no effect on either. The decrease in concentration of cardiac catechol amines produced by guanethidine was prevented by treatment of the animal with bretylium or with 1 -phenyl- 2 -hydrazinopropane (<b>pheniprazine),</b> a monoamine oxidase inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|Several known inhibitors of mono-amine oxidase (iproniazid, isocarboxazid, nialamide, phenelzine, <b>pheniprazine</b> and tranylcypromine) {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to (i) inhibit the mono-amine oxidase {{activity}} of a rat brain mitochondrial preparation in vitro; (ii) potentiate the action of tryptamine on the isolated rat fundal strip preparation; and (iii) potentiate the acute toxicity of tryptamine in mice. There was some correlation between the order of potency of the drugs in the three tests, particularly in inhibiting the enzyme activity in the Warburg and in the tryptamine toxicity test in mice. Exceptions to this were isocarboxazid which had unexpectedly high activity on the rat fundal strip preparation, and tranylcypromine which was devoid of tryptamine-potentiation action on the rat fundus preparation although it inhibited rat brain mono-amine oxidase in vitro and potentiated the action of tryptamine in vivo. Tranylcypromine was considerably less active in inhibiting the mono-amine oxidase of rat fundus than rat brain tissue in vitro, while iproniazid and isocarboxazid had about the same potency on the enzyme from the two tissues...|$|E

Ther. 177 : 169 - 176, 1971. Tryptamine. ?’C {{was administered to}} rabbits pretreated with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor <b>pheniprazine.</b> The disposition and metabolism of the radioactive amine was studied. Tryptamine-”C {{was found to be}} present in highest concen-tration in lung and in lowest concentration in heart and brain. The tissue levels of trypta-mine-’C declined exponentially with a half-life of 35 minutes. Three hours after the ad-ministration of tryptamine-’ 4 C, kidney, plasma and duodenum had the highest levels of total radioactivity. In lung, over 50 % of the total radioactivity was present as tryptamine. in marked contrast to other tissues examined. Polar basic metabolites were present in highest concentrations in duodenum, kidney and spleen. When reserpine (1 mg/kg i. m.) was administered one hour after tryptamine-’ 4 C, less radioactivity was found in all tissues except kidney and ileum, when compared to control rabbits. Reserpine decreased the tryp-tamine and polar basic metabolite concentration in several tissues while markedly increas...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in which the {{adrenergic}} neurone blocking activity of xylocholine, bretylium and guanethidine was studied {{by the use of}} the inhibitory responses of the isolated rabbit ileum to lumbar sympathetic nerve stimulation, and the contractions of the nictitating membrane of the anaesthetized cat in response to stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerves. In both these preparations, after blockade of the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation had been produced with xylocholine, bretylium or guanethicdine, the sympathomimetic amines, dexamphetamine, mephentermine, hydroxyamphetamine, ephedrine and phenethylamine, reversed the blockade; if these amines were given first, then the adrenergic neurone blocking agents were ineffective. Tyramine and dopamine were effective on the isolated rabbit ileum but not on the cat's nictitating membrane. Effective antagonism of the adrenergic neurone blocking drugs was also shown by some substances which inhibit mono-amine oxidase but only those which in addition possess sympathomimetic effects. Thus phenelzine, <b>pheniprazine</b> and tranylcypromine were effective whereas iproniazid and nialamide were not. Since xylocholine, bretylium and guanethidine were all antagonized by the same agents, it seems likely that they all produce sympathetic blockade by a similar mechanism. The possibility is discussed that the sympathomimetic amines which antagonize the adrenergic neurone blocking drugs are competing with these substances for the same receptor sites...|$|E
40|$|Large single {{doses of}} {{methoserpidine}} (12 mg/kg) given to rabbits lowered the noradrenaline content of sympathetic ganglia {{but not that}} of brain; no sedation was observed. Cats responded to doses ranging from 12 to 0. 5 mg/kg with loss of noradrenaline from ganglia {{as well as from}} brain, and were sedated by the drug. The effect in man resembles that in the rabbit. Only within the group of reserpine-like drugs do sedation and loss in hypothalamic noradrenaline run parallel. These effects are therefore not causally related. Guanethidine lowers the noradrenaline content of sympathetic ganglia (cats and rabbits), but this effect does not explain the blocking action of the drug on the adrenergic nerve. Effects on the noradrenaline of the brain are variable and may be caused reflexly rather than by direct central action of guanethidine. Repeated intravenous injections of dimethylphenylpiperazinium iodide for a period of 4 hr did not produce any significant change in the noradrenaline content of ganglia or brain of rabbits. In contrast, dexamphetamine (20 mg/kg) produced a small but significant mean fall in noradrenaline content of the superior cervical ganglia and in that of the brain, but the effects were not seen in every rabbit. Prolonged administration of the mono-amine oxidase inhibitors <b>pheniprazine</b> and phenylhydrazinobutane raised the noradrenaline content of the brain of rabbits but not that of cats, whereas it raised the noradrenaline of the ganglia of cats but not (or rarely) that of rabbits. The question of correlation between a rise in the noradrenaline content of the brain and certain clinical signs is discussed. Finally, a comparison is made in rabbits between the changes produced by drugs in the noradrenaline content of the heart and of the superior cervical ganglion. The changes run parallel and are only occasionally more pronounced in the heart...|$|E
