40|$|CHDS State/LocalApproved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere are many potential targets for terrorists in the United States, {{one of which}} is the food supply system. An attack on the food supply system would create great need for information to many audiences, primarily the general public, about the risk resulting from such an attack. The Multi-State <b>Partnership</b> <b>for</b> <b>Security</b> in Agriculture, a collaborative effort of 10 states, has identified the need for development of a strategy for communicating to the public the risk resulting from an agroterrorism incident. Before the Partnership begins development of a strategy, however, it must take into consideration the factors that are important when communicating about agroterrorism risk: recognition that communication of risk about food carries with it specific challenges; the public's level of trust in government will affect how it perceives and accepts risk messages; and Americans' post-September 11, 2001 fear associated with terrorism alters perception and acceptance of risk. Recognition of the existence of these factors is not enough, however. The Partnership must recognize, as well, that these factors may present barriers to effective communication. To overcome these barriers, the Partnership should apply tried-and-true risk communication principles, tailored to specifically address the factors that make agroterrorism risk communication unique.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs the security landscape changes, {{the importance of}} strong and influential <b>partnerships</b> <b>for</b> <b>security</b> cooperation (SC) increases. The process of selecting the best possible partners should not be neglected; tools to accomplish this task may already exist. Recently, the use of social network analysis (SNA) has allowed the military to map dark networks of terrorist organizations and selectively target key elements. SNA {{data collection and analysis}} efforts remain focused on these terrorist networks, whereas friendly or light networks have been relatively neglected. This thesis highlights the importance of analyzing light networks for SC and introduces the concept of dim networks. These are networks that consist of friendly actors whose connections to external organizations may not be public. This thesis has potential to improve partner security force engagement selection through the use of SNA principles, methods, and software, yielding several dividends. First, it provides a commander with a detailed understanding of the foreign units involved in SC, which allows for development of a more focused engagement strategy. Second, it allows SC planners to invest time and resources on the partner security forces that most effectively advance the commander’s engagement priorities. Third, it reinforces the collection of network-related data on organizations the U. S. military cooperates with and the importance of analyzing that empirical data to improve SC.

40|$|September 11 th, 2001 {{marks the}} worst {{terrorist}} action to occur on United States soil and opens a new period in history in which indiscriminate terrorist acts are possible, if not probable. Many of these possible acts, {{as well as}} the actions to prevent and recover, {{will have an impact on}} the supply chain and services in ways that we cannot yet understand. Previous research has focused on theft prevention and the disruptions such thefts might cause, and very little research on the supply chain impacts of September 11 th exist.

Limited examples of public-private <b>partnerships</b> <b>for</b> <b>security</b> exist, however, there are several examples of <b>partnerships</b> <b>for</b> emergency response. Since both emergency response partnerships and security collaboratives share the same objective - to protect and secure the personnel, facilities, and supply chain - this thesis investigates emergency response, early detection, and propose new policies and regulations and the threat of international terrorism continues, corporate America needs to find a method for securing their operations. These methods may post-September 11 th security examples to determine the key factors in establishing successful public-private partnerships. The learnings indicate collaborative partnerships and emergency response cooperatives are the most commonly used <b>for</b> promoting <b>security</b> and that motivation, cooperative goals, communication and trust are the most important factors to creating successful partnerships. Other factors vary by level of importance depending(cont.) on the type of partnership. Public regulation requires private cooperation in order to succeed. Similarly, private sector security relies on public sector concurrence. The greater the recognized interdependence between the public and private sector, the more likely the partnership is to succeed.
