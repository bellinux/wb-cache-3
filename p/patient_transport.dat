40|$|To {{investigate}} the injury characteristics and mortality of <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> by {{emergency medical services}} (EMS) and hospitalized for trauma following a road traffic crash, data obtained from the Trauma Registry System were retrospectively reviewed for trauma admissions between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2013 in a Level I trauma center. Of 16, 548 registered patients, 3978 and 1440 patients injured in road traffic crashes were transported to the emergency department by EMS and non-EMS, respectively. <b>Patients</b> <b>transported</b> by EMS had lower Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores and worse hemodynamic measures. Compared to <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> by non-EMS, more <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> by EMS required procedures (intubation, chest tube insertion, and blood transfusion) at the emergency department. They also sustained a higher injury severity, {{as measured by the}} injury severity score (ISS) and the new injury severity score (NISS). Lastly, in-hospital mortality was higher among the EMS than the non-EMS group (1. 8 % vs. 0. 3 %, respectively; p < 0. 001). However, we found no statistically significant difference in the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for mortality among <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> by EMS after adjustment for ISS (AOR 4. 9, 95 % CI 0. 33 – 2. 26), indicating that the higher incidence of mortality was likely attributed to the patients’ higher injury severity. In addition, after propensity score matching, logistic regression of 58 well-matched pairs did not show a significant influence of transportation by EMS on mortality (OR: 0. 578, 95 % CI: 0. 132 – 2. 541 p = 0. 468) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background. It {{has been}} {{stated that the}} first 60 minutes {{following}} an accident often determines whether a patient will live or die. It is {{the objective of this}} study to determine if the Golden Hour theory is a valid concept that should continue to be applied to pre-hospital transport of the severely injured patient. Hypothesis: This study will test the null hypothesis that patient outcomes are independent of transport times. Methods: Data were obtained from a statewide trauma registry from the years 1993 to 1998 for this non-concurrent cohort study. The study sample consisted of 2, 621 patients 16 year of age or older with injury severity scores of {{greater than or equal to}} 25. <b>Patients</b> with <b>transport</b> times less than or equal to 60 minutes (n = 2121) were compared to <b>patients</b> with <b>transport</b> times greater than 60 minutes (n = 499). The primary dependent variable of this study was mortality. Results: The average mortality rate for severely injured <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> in less than or equal to 60 minutes was higher than the average mortality rate for <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> in greater than 60 minutes (36. 2 % versus 22. 2 %). Furthermore, patients with a penetrating mechanism of injury transported in less than or equal to 60 minutes encountered greater average mortality compared to similarly injured <b>patients</b> with <b>transport</b> times greater than 60 minutes (52. 0 % versus 36. 1 %). <b>Patients</b> with <b>transport</b> times greater than 60 minutes exhibited higher morbidity as evidenced by longer stays in the hospital and intensive care unit. However, morbidity was not significantly different for patients with penetrating injuries transported in greater than 60 minutes versus <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> in less than or equal to 60 minutes. Conclusions: It is apparent from this research that pre-hospital time defined in the terms of a Golden Hour does not significantly decrease mortality. Basing trauma system transport standards only on time is inappropriate...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Dutch {{helicopter}} {{emergency medical}} services are available 24 / 7. Working without daylight brings additional challenges, both in patient care and in-flight operation. We retrospectively evaluated the safety of this nighttime helicopter transportation of patients. METHODS: Our helicopter emergency medical service database was reviewed for all <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> by helicopter during nighttime. Both interhospital <b>transports</b> and <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> from the accident location to a hospital were included. The time traveled by helicopter was compared with the time that road transportation of these patients would have taken. RESULTS: In total, 513 <b>patients</b> were <b>transported</b> by helicopter. Of these <b>patients,</b> 72 were <b>transported</b> during nighttime (14 %); the median age was 25. 3 years (range, 1. 1 - 73. 9 years). The median flight time to the hospital was 16 minutes (range, 5 - 42 minutes). To travel by road, this {{would have taken a}} median of approximately 44 minutes (range, 23 - 100 minutes). When comparing these travel times, a significantly faster transport time by helicopter during nighttime was observed (P <. 001). Three non-flight-specific incidents were noted. CONCLUSION: We conclude that helicopter transportation of patients without daylight is safe and fast in a Dutch setting...|$|R

5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for <b>patient</b> <b>transport</b> or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the differences in}} transport times and costs for <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> by fixed-wing aircraft versus helicopter at ranges of 101 to 150 radial miles, where fixed-wing and helicopter in-hospital transports commonly overlap. Statistical analysis failed to show {{a significant difference between}} the trauma-care <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> by helicopter (n = 109) and those transported by fixed-wing (n = 86) for age, injury severity score, hospital length of stay, hospital mortality, or discharge disability score. The times in returning patients to the receiving hospital by helicopter (n = 104) versus fixed-wing (n = 509) did not differ significantly. Helicopter transport costs per mile ($ 24), however, were 400 % higher than those of fixed-wing aircraft with its associated ground ambulance transport costs ($ 6). Thus, helicopter transport is economically unjustified for interhospital transports exceeding 100 radial miles when an efficient fixed-wing service exists...|$|R
40|$|Background: Trauma {{systems and}} regionalized trauma care {{have been shown}} to improve outcome in {{severely}} injured trauma patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the implementation of a prehospital trauma care protocol and transport directive, and to determine its effects on the number of primary admissions and secondary trauma transfers in a large Scandinavian city. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study based on local trauma registries and hospital and ambulance records in Stockholm County; patients > 15 years of age with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 transported to any emergency care hospitals in the Stockholm area were included for the years 2006 and 2008. We also included secondary transferred patients to the regional trauma center during 2006, 2008, and 2013. Results: A total of 693 primarily admitted trauma patients were included for the years 2006 and 2008. For the years 2006, 2008 and 2013, we included 114 secondarily <b>transported</b> trauma <b>patients.</b> The number of primary <b>patient</b> <b>transports</b> to the trauma center increased during the years by 20. 2 %, (p < 0. 001); <b>patients</b> primarily <b>transported</b> to the trauma center had a significantly higher Injury Severity Score in 2008 than in 2006, and the number of <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> secondarily to the trauma center in 2006 was higher compared to 2008 and to 2013 (p < 0. 001, all 3 years). Discussion: Our data indicate that implementation of a prehospital trauma care protocol may have an effect on transportation of severely injured trauma patients. A decrease in secondarily <b>transported</b> trauma <b>patients</b> to the regional trauma center was noted after 1 year and persisted at 7 years after the organizational change. Patients primarily admitted to the trauma center after the change had more severe injuries than <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> to other emergency hospitals in the area even if 20 % of patients were not admitted primarily to a trauma center. This does not imply that the transport directives or the criteria were not followed but rather reveals the difficulties and uncertainties of field triage. Conclusions: With the introduction of a prehospital trauma transport directive in a large urban city, an increase in <b>patients</b> <b>transported</b> to the regional trauma center and a decrease in secondary transfers were detected, but a considerable number of severely injured <b>patients</b> were still <b>transported</b> to local hospitals...|$|R
