40|$|The Casimir {{force for}} a planar gauge model is studied {{considering}} <b>perfect</b> <b>conducting</b> and <b>perfect</b> magnetically permeable boundaries.

Two different mappings between models are considered for the system under study, where generic boundary conditions can be more easily applied and the Casimir force be derived in a more straightforward way. It is shown that vortex excitations can be an efficient suppressor of vacuum fluctuations. In particular, for the model studied here, a planar Chern-Simons type of model that allows {{for the presence of}} vortex matter, the Casimir force is found to be independent of the choice of boundary conditions, at least for the more common types, like Neumann, <b>perfect</b> <b>conducting</b> and magnetically permeable boundary conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} circuit parameters of vertical wires over a lossy ground in partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) models. The full-wave PEEC formulation of the vertical wires is presented, and formulas of circuit parameters for the vertical wires are derived using the Sommerfeld integral. Frequency responses of circuit parameters are discussed for both poor and good grounds, respectively. The results are validated numerically using the numerical electromagnetic code (NEC 2). It is found that the lossy ground can be replaced with the weighted images in the electromagnetic analysis for the vertical wires. The lossy ground can be even replaced with the <b>perfect</b> <b>conducting</b> ground for the closely spaced vertical wires.
