5|$|After {{exiting the}} Natives tour, Keogh {{continued}} to play for Otago until 1891, but that year was suspended from <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> the ORFU after admitting to have bet on rugby. The ORFU had launched an inquiry after Keogh's Kaikorai club lost to their rivals Alhambra, and several spectators accused some of Kaikorai's players of betting on their opposition. Keogh retired from rugby following the accusations, and along with several of his teammates was banned from playing. He was eventually reinstated into the game in 1895, but his rugby career was over. Outside of sport, Keogh was a brass moulder, and his later life was characterised by mental illness. He died in Seacliff Lunatic Asylum in 1940, after spending {{much of the last}} 20 years of his life institutionalised there.|$|E

5|$|By 1867 the Sheffield Rules was the {{dominant}} code in England. The FA had still not achieved the national dominance it enjoys today. Its membership had shrunk to just 10clubs {{and at a}} meeting of the FA it was reported that only three clubs (No Names Club, Barnes and Crystal Palace) were <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> the FA code. At the same meeting the secretary of Sheffield Club suggested three rule changes at an FA meeting: the adoption of rouges, the one man offside and introduction of a free kick for handling the ball. None of the motions were successful. Later in the same year, they abolished handling and touchdowns. It was stated that this was to bring them closer to non-handling games.|$|E
5|$|Crash {{starts the}} game with four lives. The length of each of Crash's lives is tied to his health meter, which {{decreases}} whenever Crash is damaged from enemy attacks or falls down a bottomless pit. The player can replenish Crash's health meter by instructing Crash to eat Wumpa Fruit. Each time the health meter is fully depleted, Crash loses a life. However, the player can win an additional life for Crash by collecting 25,000 units of the magical substance Mojo or by collecting a rare type of Golden Wumpa Fruit. After the last life is lost, the player can continue <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> restarting the current episode.|$|E

5|$|Byard {{began playing}} professionally on piano {{at the age}} of 16, in bands led by Doc Kentross and Freddy Bates. His early lessons had {{involved}} mostly <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> rote, so his development of knowledge of theory and further piano technique occurred from the late 1930s until 1941, including studying harmony at Commerce High School. In that year he was drafted into the army, where he continued with piano lessons and was influenced by pianist Ernie Washington, with whom he was barracked, although Byard also took up trombone at this time. He also studied Stravinsky and Chopin, and continued studying classical composers into the 1960s. Part of his military service was in Florida, where he was a mentor to the young saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and his brother, Nat. After leaving the army in 1946, Byard's musical education continued, through discussions with others, and using library materials combined with music school syllabuses.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} the game was {{composed}} by Tsuyoshi Sekito, with assistance from Yasuhiro Yamanaka, who composed 10 of the 97 total tracks and co-composed 2. Prior to The Last Remnant, Sekito had spent the previous decade primarily arranging the work of other composers for remakes and re-releases of various Square Enix games such as the Final Fantasy series and the Mana series. The soundtrack features the heavy use of orchestral elements, arranged for orchestration by Natsumi Kameoka, and guitar <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> Sekito. The orchestrated pieces were played by musicians from several different orchestras, rather than by a single group. Unlike most role-playing games, the battle music was designed by Sekito to switch between three songs depending on how well the player was doing in the battle. A soundtrack album was released on December 10, 2008, through Sony Music Distribution. It contains 97 tracks across three discs, and has a total length of 3:10:21.|$|E

25|$|Play is {{included}} as a productive occupation as it is often the primary activity for children. If play becomes difficult due to a disability, like CP, this can cause problems for the child. These difficulties can affect a child's self-esteem. In addition, the sensory and motor problems experienced by children with CP affect how the child interacts with their surroundings, including the environment and other people. Not only do physical limitations affect a child's ability to play, the limitations perceived by the child's caregivers and playmates also impact the child's play activities. Some children with disabilities spend more time <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> themselves. When a disability prevents a child from playing, there may be social, emotional and psychological problems {{which can lead to}} increased dependence on others, less motivation and poor social skills.|$|E
