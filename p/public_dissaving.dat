In this framework, we separate saving and deficits movements into two types of shocks, associated with structural parameters of these economies. Our results suggest that Ricardian Equivalence did not work in our sample of OECD countries, since private saving compensated {{only a small fraction}} of <b>public</b> <b>dissaving.</b> This supports the interpretation that the large budget deficits have been a very important factor behind the significant increase in real interest rates in the eighties and nineties. 1...|$|E
40|$|Emerging market {{countries}} had by early 2009 {{announced that they}} will have remained fiscally conservative during the 2008 â€“ 09 crisis, at least compared with the developed countries, which announced much larger fiscal stimuli. The authors argue that the difference in the pre-announced fiscal stance between those two groups of countries could be at least partly due to the awareness of Ricardian equivalence, that is, a higher offset between private and public saving in emerging market countries. They find that the offset coefficient is almost twice as high in emerging market countries as in developed countries, implying that additional government spending, that is, <b>public</b> <b>dissaving,</b> would be almost completely offset by private saving. private saving, Ricardian equivalence, fiscal policies...|$|E

This paper argued that while better and more environment-friendly economic policy does not automatically follow from greener measures of income, analysis of genuine saving offers a more direct route to policy. First, the sign and magnitude of genuine saving provide a clear indicator {{of the extent to which}} social welfare is increasing, and whether the economy is on an unsustainable path. Second, the decomposition of genuine savings into its component parts permits relatively direct linkages to be established between saving and particular policy levers. Among the components of gross saving, the level of <b>public</b> (government) <b>dissaving</b> is typically the issue, which is directly amenable to alteration by fiscal policies. Policies linked to private saving tend to be more indirect, involving tax incentives, maintenance of positive real interest rates, and the depth and stability of the financial system. For many developing countries a focus on government dissaving is likely to be the most important issue. In extreme circumstances consuming wealth is the correct policy option, when the alternative is starvation. But this should serve as a clear signal that some of these countries are not only poor but are getting poorer...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{a number}} of issues {{relating}} to the policy goal of increasing national savings. The first section considers the measurement and definition of national savings. Comparisons of current US savings rates with those of other countries and with the past US experience are presented. The second section considers possible avenues through which public policy can increase natianal savings. While most discussion has centered on the effects of changes in the rate of return received by savers, this is far from the only channel through which policy can effect savings. I conclude that changes in <b>public</b> savings or <b>dissaving</b> through budget surpluses or deficits are the most potent and reliable policy tool for altering the saving rate. The third section of the paper examines a crucial savings policy question. Where will extra savings go? Both empirical estimates and econometric model simulations suggest will find their way into increased plant and equipment investment. A major effect of increased savings would be to reduce capital inflows and improve American competitiveness. ...|$|R
40|$|Trade, aid, and {{investment}} are more inextricably linked in sub-Saharan Africa {{than anywhere else}} in the world, contends the author, whose survey of sub-Saharan Africa's prospects for trade, aid, {{and investment}} lead to the following broad conclusions. Developing an outward orientation, improving competitiveness, and recapturing its lost share in world markets offers a higher potential payoff than any other strategy for growth and sustainable development in sub-Saharan countries. If the region had maintained internal competitiveness and retained its 1970 share of world exports, successfully defending against new entrants, its 1990 level of exports would have been at least $ 50 billion higher than actual earnings - assuming that the composition of sub-Saharan exports would have changed to reflect changes in world trade. If the region continued to rely on exports of commodity products alone, the relative gains would have been much smaller. In the last decade, sub-Saharan Africa has become increasingly dependent on external resource flows for investment, imports, and development. But there is little chance of sustained high levels of aid because of budget constraints in the OECD countries, competing demands from new claimants, and the new conditionalities imposed by bilateral donors (for democratization, reduced military spending, and improved human rights). Most African countries must mobilize domestic resources and increase domestic savings rates by reducing <b>public</b> sector <b>dissavings,</b> the financial losses of public enterprises, and other nonproductive spending. Certain low-middle-income African countries can attract a significant amount of foreign direct investment, but most resource-poor countries - especially in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa - will continue to depend on foreign aid. There must be a more durable solution to Africa's debt problem. Only half of the debt service due can be paid, suggesting the urgent need to reduce the debt stock and thus debt servicing obligations, in alignment with debt servicing capacity. Many current proposals under discussion, if implemented, can bring considerable relief. Several sub-Saharan countries can attractsignificant investment because of their location, low labor costs, natural resource endowments, and the size of their domestic market. But productive investment levels in most African countries have remained depressed, and even where economic policy reform has been implemented, the investor response - both domestic and foreign - has been poor. Uncertainty, fears of policy reversals, lack of credibility and continuity, the contagion effect, and more attractive opportunities elsewhere reinforce such structural weaknesses in sub-Saharan Africa as poor infrastructure, inefficient services, and a weak human resource base to deprive Africa of new investment.
