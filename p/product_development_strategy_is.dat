40|$|Early {{stages of}} product {{development}} {{are critical to}} success of the final product. Decisions made {{in the early stages}} will affect the design choices available during the entire development cycle. This thesis examines two research and development strategies. One <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> to make critical decisions as early as possible to manage costs and coordinate work. Making decisions early can help controls costs. Early decisions can also limit the potential value of the product. The value of decisions made {{at the beginning of the}} development cycle when the least is known about the problem and the potential solutions are most susceptible to uncertainty. An alternate approach is to employ a parallel research and development strategy. Multiple alternative designs are pursued as if they were the final choice. Decision makers can then make more informed choices for the design of their product. This approach has higher development costs. The net benefit of the project can be higher due to increases in quality and decreases in schedule. Understanding when to apply parallel research and development strategy is an important consideration for those facing uncertainty in their product development cycle. (cont.) A systems dynamics model was used to illustrate how the intensity and commitment to a parallel research and development strategy affects the efficiency and effectiveness of product development. The model shows that the number of alternatives and the time alternatives are developed before one alternative is chosen are both important factors for effectiveness and efficiency. The model also shows that it is important to strive for variety in the alternatives added. by Jeanne A. Kesapradist. Thesis (S. M.)

At Fluid Management Corporation (FMC), Trucks and Equipment (T&E) {{that are used to}} deliver services both onshore and offshore currently follow a single product development model: In-house design; Outsourced prototyping, testing, and manufacturing. The objective of this research work is to challenge the status quo and to provide FMC with a practical framework that helps to determine the optimal development strategy. Rather than following a single development strategy for the entire portfolio of trucks and equipment products, the new methodology recommends a development strategy at a product functionality level and product feature level. <b>Product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> defined here using three dimensions: Design strategy; Manufacturing strategy; and Supply Chain strategy. Each functionality or feature is evaluated using a set of six criteria which then maps that functionality or feature to a specific recommended location on a three dimensional strategy cube. The set of evaluation criteria were derived from exploring and analyzing the current product development process, and from benchmarking world class companies {{from a wide range of}} different industries. The results show that for functionalities and features that differentiate FMC from its competitors and are viewed as core competencies, FMC should consider in sourcing the design, prototyping, and testing processes.

The influence of high-density, small-sized products has placed significant constraints on conventional electrical connections prompting various fabrication methods, e. g. photolithography, being introduced to meet these challenges and ameliorate the rapidly changing demand from consumers. While high-power solid state lasers are fundamental to large scale industrial production, excimer laser on the other hand has revolutionised the manufacturing industry with high precision, easy 3 D structuring and less stringent production requirements. Micro-structuring using excimer laser, best known as laser ablation, is a non-contact micro- and nano-machining based on the projection of high-energy pulsed UV masked beam on to a material of interest such that pattern(s) on the mask is transferred to the substrate, often at a demagnified dimension with high resolution and precision. The use of mask with desired patterns and beam delivery system makes the fabrication in this case accurate, precise and easily controllable. The first part of this chapter introduces the fundamentals of laser technology and material processing. In the second part, optical interconnects as a solution to ‘bottlenecked’ conventional copper interconnections is introduced with emphasis on excimer laser ablation of polymer waveguides and integrated mirrors.

This paper asserts that {{this is due to the}} injection of new process technologies and tools into old <b>product</b> <b>development</b> processes. Globalization and mass customization are also demanding higher levels of productivity. The solution to achieving effective returns in this area of <b>product</b> <b>development</b> lies in designing and implementing strategies that integrate and optimize the new process tools and technologies. Two primary <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> <b>are</b> emerging that integrate and optimize the new process tools; first, reconfiguration of product knowledge, artifacts and data, and second, the product continuum. The gathered data supports two conclusions. One is that product design processes that take advantage of reconfigurable models enjoy significant savings in time and cost in the model creation segment of the design process. The instantiation time for the reconfigurable models averages 3 % of the time to create conventional models. As the size and/or complexity of the product increases, the potential benefit of reconfigurable models also increases. Another observation is that the reconfigurable template is an effective tool for organizing and administering design information in the process. The extra time spent setting up the reconfigurable models in the first design cycle is easily repaid through faster future design cycles, easier design information maintenance, and effective reconfiguration of previous work. Productivity as measured by reduced cycle times and increased throughput must be designed and built into the process. Our experience is showing that the keys are reconfigurable artifacts and product templates...|$|R

My dissertation takes a broad view of innovation by investigating product success among U. S. biotechnology firms across {{various stages of}} innovation including <b>product</b> discovery, <b>product</b> <b>development,</b> and <b>product</b> success. Current explanations of biotechnology product success examine one or two stages of innovation and underscore the importance of strategic alliances. However, current explanations are incomplete. First, they fail to examine whether their explanations hold across the entire innovation process. Second, estimates suggest that up to 70 % of strategic alliances fail to meet their objectives (Kale and Singh 2009) and product develop remains very costly despite {{the high incidence of}} alliances in the biotechnology industry. I propose that success across the stages of innovation is associated with the scope of learning that occurs within the firm, among strategic alliance partners, and from a focal firm's network. That is, product discovery is associated with learning within the firm, <b>product</b> <b>development</b> is associated with learning among strategic alliance partners, and product success is associated with learning from the firm's overall network. While entering strategic alliances to pool resources to defray the costs of innovation is likely a necessary condition for innovation success current research overlooks the role of <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategies.</b> In this study I examine <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> that influence the likelihood of innovation success including exploration, exploitation, and ambidexterity (i. e., the simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation strategies). Moreover, findings from interviews with executives in biotechnology firms provide insight into the strategies firms use to develop new drugs and evaluate them at various stages of innovation. Results from regression models support the general proposition that success at different stages of innovation varies with the scope of learning. Learning at the organizational-level (firm age and absorptive capacity) is likely to increase success at the discovery stage. Alliance partnerships are sources of learning (research alliance and development alliances) that affect <b>product</b> <b>development.</b> Network-level learning (network centrality and network experience) influences sales growth, but only for smaller firms in my sample.

40|$|In today's highly {{competitive}} landscape, new <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> <b>are</b> imperatives {{for companies to}} create and sustain competitive advantages. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop an integrated approach to automate, or aid, the design problem solving process. An Integrated Design System (IDS) is proposed focusing on the parametric and detail design. In this system, generation and evaluation of new design problems occur quickly and easily by changing the inputs for the design model. The IDS provides an integrated platform to incorporate available application programs such as CAD and FEM tools into a single system. Four major frameworks, namely information handling, problem decomposition, design space characterization, and problem solving, are proposed and embedded in it to implement the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> process. The information handling includes five aspects. A naming protocol is devised to organize the historical design cases. A search algorithm is proposed to retrieve a design case. A system-generated report is used to distribute the design information. A constraint definition frame is presented to define the relationships between design parameters. Two schemas, information matrix and constraint tree, are developed to represent information in the IDS. A diagonal-centered decomposition scheme is developed utilizing a Genetic Algorithm to decompose a complex design problem. In addition to the conventional genetic operators, two novel genetic operators, unequal position crossover and insertion mutation, are proposed. To characterize the design space, two methods, Incremental Response Method (IRM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are presented. The IRM is derived from response surface method, while the back-propagated ANN is coded to be self-evaluated. The presented problem solving algorithm constitutes the solving mechanism of the IDS. Based on the assessment of the design objectives, all design parameters are given a priority index to facilitate the parameter selection. An independent recursive method is introduced in this algorithm to handle the design constraints. The case studies are performed on two design problems: a hard disk drive actuator arm and a shaft. The results show that the system can automatically align parameter values towards the objective values in a reasonable manner, and thus verify the feasibility of the embedded frameworks...|$|R

40|$|Pollution, global warming, ozone {{depletion}} and {{the greenhouse effect}} have brought environmental issues to the fore. As a result, consumers, governments and NGOs have pressured firms to develop green products. Green products are those “that strive to protect or enhance the natural environment by conserving energy and/or resources and reducing or eliminating use of toxic agents, pollution, and waste’’. Pressures from those stakeholders {{are not the only}} reasons for firms to become involved in green <b>product</b> <b>development.</b> Other reasons include the opportunities for accessing new markets, enhancing competitive advantages, gaining cost efficiency, and building a better reputation. This dissertation includes three chapters that investigate the effect of development cost, regulations, and co-opetition on green <b>product</b> design and <b>development.</b> The role of green <b>product</b> <b>development</b> cost on <b>product</b> line design decisions is the main focus of the first chapter. I tackle three main research questions in this chapter: (1) How does the environmental quality of the product, in which the research and development costs of green products are crucial and unavoidable, influence a firm’s product line design? (2) What and how many products should the firm offer? Specifically, when should a firm adopt green <b>product</b> <b>development?</b> (3) How does a firm’s product line decisions affect the dual goals of benefiting the environment and increasing profits? The effect of governmental regulations on firms’ product line design decisions is investigated in the second chapter of this dissertation. Governments, by imposing standards, are trying to benefit society by preventing firms from falsely labeling products, and assuring that society will get at least minimum environmental quality by using any available product in the market. By jointly considering the interaction among the consumers’ preferences, firms’ product line design strategies, and regulations from government, I look at possible scenarios which will give insights to both firms and government about the effect of such regulations. In this chapter, I investigate under which conditions both society and the firm will reach a “win-win” outcome in which the firm increases its profit and society gets the advantage of improvements in the environmental quality of products. Also, how strict should the regulations and standards be to drive firms to develop green products, and when will regulations face push-back from the firms? Finally, in the third chapter, I use a game-theoretic approach to understanding how collaboration between competitors, co-opetition, affects the operational decisions such as green product characteristics (quality) and price. Inspired by real market examples, I consider three different <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> to investigate under which conditions do competitors prefer to collaborate with each other rather than developing green products independently, and which collaboration strategy might they choose. Also, I indicate which strategy among those three <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> <b>is</b> preferable for reaching to different managerial goals...|$|R

A frame-work of a fuzzy FMEA (failure modes and rffects analysis) based evaluation approach for new product concepts is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed approach and methodologies, a prototype system named EPDS- 1, which can assist inexperienced users to perform FMEA analysis for quality and reliability improvement, alternative design evaluation, materials selection, and cost assessment, thus helping to enhance robustness of new products at the conceptual design stage. This paper presents the underlying concepts of the development and shows the practical application with the prototype system with a case study...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project <b>is</b> about <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategy</b> {{and practice in}} the automobile industry. Specifically, it concerns the transformation of Rover Group body and tool development capability over four years from 1993 to 1997. A single Rover Body and Pressings organisation was created in 1991. It encompassed the functions of Body Engineering, Press Tool Engineering, and Press Tool Manufacturing. As Engineering Director the Author {{had the opportunity to}} directly influence {{a significant portion of the}} body product creation process. At the start of the research period the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> performance of Rover Body and Pressings was weak. Major investments in new press equipment could not depend on in-house die technology. Quality and cost delivery incurred customer dissatisfaction. Resulting from the research are three innovations: The Engineering Quality Assurance Procedure was implemented as a disciplined stage/gate quality management system. A focused manufacturing <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> implemented for die manufacturing based on die size. A new engineering design methodology was established utilising the scientific principles of metal forming technology as an integrated element in the design process. These innovations were applied within the strategic framework of a new model describing a system view of the product creation process for body, at enterprise level. The new <b>product</b> <b>development</b> process <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> partially applied to two new vehicle programmes. One vehicle has since been initiated and delivered from within the new framework. Strategic targets were defined for <b>product</b> <b>development</b> at Rover Body and Pressings covering <b>product</b> quality, <b>development</b> lead time, press tool cost and programme financial budget. The targets for quality and lead time were met during the research period. Although substantial progress is evident in physical performance the targets for press tool cost and programme budget were not met. The major elements of the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategy</b> applied in this research remain in place. The transfer of the strategic model of concurrent engineering to a wider context was demonstrated by applying it as part of the Rover Group <b>product</b> <b>development</b> reengineering project...|$|R

40|$|How does {{complexity}} influence new <b>product</b> <b>development</b> (NPD) <b>strategies?</b> There <b>are</b> {{many ways}} of managing the challenge of new <b>product</b> <b>development.</b> This {{is especially true for}} new software products where a huge variety of approaches is possible. This study examines how successful New Zealand tech companies manage their NPD and how innovation complexity influences this. The new products are all software-intensive and have the additional pressure of being built for commercialisation. The study found that while there is considerable variation within NPD, the level of innovation complexity determined the approach companies were taking. Companies with complex innovation challenges had more iterative software development; flexible internal processes; nimbleness in decision-making and re-prioritisation. Lower levels of complexity in innovation were linked to more formal and sequential approaches to NPD; less reviewing of process or product experimentation. Overall there were also lower levels of strain. The Cyclic Innovation Model (A. J. Berkhout, Hartmann, & Trott, 2011) provides a useful description of how complexity in innovation is situated within a network of markets, customers, products and science and how innovation is not a linear, sequential process. The study additionally suggests that strong entrepreneurial skills are essential to managing high complexity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} at "Laron" soya company in Tuban is to investigate its marketing information system and to support its marketing information strategies being implemented. One of the marketing strategies currently conducted by the company is employing salesmen to help distribute its products, supported by promotion for customers and distributors. The company is compelled to compete with competitors from other companies in Tuban {{as well as other}} big companies A good marketing information system well supports marketing efforts of companies that undertake it, as the information produced can assist them in selecting the appropriate marketing <b>strategy.</b> The problem <b>is</b> "To what extent is the role played by the marketing information system of the Laron soya company in relation to its decision to determine a marketing strategy?" The theories utilized by this study are concerned with marketing information strategies and marketing strategies. The matrix analysis of Marketing Mix, SWOT, Grand Strategy and evaluation in the form of <b>strategy</b> selection <b>are</b> employed to support the analysis. This research is descriptive in nature and employs qualitative data. The object of the research is the management of "Laron" soya company, its distributors and consumers. The instruments for data collection are documentation, interviews and questionnaires on the company management. The result of measurement and matrix analysis of Marketing Mix indicates that the position of "Laron" soya company is in the quadrant I, meaning that the company is still strong and potential. The matrix analysis using Grand Strategy places the company in quadrant II where there <b>are</b> seven alternative <b>strategies.</b> The result of an analysis on the seven alternative strategies indicates that currently there <b>are</b> only three <b>strategies</b> that can <b>be</b> implemented supported by marketing information strategy. Based on the result of the analysis and discussion, conclusion can be drawn that the marketing information strategy the company has employed can be improved by adding an input subsystem, that is marketing research subsystem and integrate the database from the Marketing Information System so that the needed information is available.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. China is in economic transition, from the resource consuming made in China to an aspirational designed in China. Chinese Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), have {{made significant contributions to}} society and the national economy, their influence determines the success of this economic transition. On the other hand, design-oriented New <b>Product</b> <b>Development</b> (NPD) <b>strategies</b> <b>are</b> generally recognised as beneficial for company survival, but are mostly applied in large companies. Evidence of testing design-oriented NPD strategy in Chinese SMEs is sparse. This research therefore, attempts to introduce design-oriented NPD strategy to Chinese SMEs, and investigates how design-oriented NPD strategy performs in Chinese SMEs. This research adopts a qualitative approach with three stages: the first utilises a scoping study to understand the feasibility of this research, and synthesise knowledge from the literature to construct a customised NPD process model with design-oriented aspects; the second stage focuses on using an experimental method to conduct a parallel implementation: two NPD projects follow different NPD approaches, the conventional NPD process of SMEs and the introduced design-oriented NPD process; the third stage carried out mainly by observation, set out to investigate the changes brought about by the NPD process. Empirical data from three NPD projects is collected and analysed. Evidence from the parallel NPD projects demonstrates that the introduced design-oriented NPD strategy gains internal confidence but is costly when compare with the conventional approach (funds and time). Although the new product from the design-oriented team of the experiment performed less well from a sales perspective, a continuous observation on their follow-up NPD project, the investigation of the changes, discloses that the NPD behaviour of the investigated company is changed, all participants reach consensus regarding the merits of the design-oriented NPD. It concludes that the design-oriented NPD strategy in Chinese SMEs are implementable and beneficial. This research is a single case study, and a qualitative investigation of implementation of the design-oriented NPD strategy in one selected Chinese SME. It requires a wider adoption of the design-oriented NPD strategy in companies across different industries, and to investigate a larger sample of NPD projects, to gather quantitative confirmation...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{and fashion}} {{obsolescence}} {{continue to be}} concerns {{in the design of}} contemporary products. Research shows that consumers dispose of household items even though those are still fully or partly functional, for various reasons. One cause of premature disposal is the lack of emotional attachment between user and product. This paper aims to explore how industrial designers, as initiators of the relationship between products and users, might facilitate the generation and continuation of positive experiences that could potentially lead to the consumer’s enduring attachment to particular products, thereby optimizing the product’s lifetime and detouring it from becoming landfill too soon. This paper contributes to a larger research that seeks to understand the factors that contribute to long-lasting product satisfaction and how industrial designers can be encouraged to consider these in their <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategies.</b> Dining furniture <b>was</b> selected as the product area for this paper. The research starts with a literature review on consumer-product attachment, and on design strategies which promote the optimization of product lifetimes. These were used to inform a studio charette within a third year industrial design course at the University of New South Wales, in which students brainstormed ideas for aftermarket products that could enable consumers into modifying, personalizing, refreshing, repairing or refurbishing existing furniture items and thus bond better with their possessions. The outcomes of this exercise, in turn, provide a basis for formulating some guidelines that would help designers foster long-term product attachment. Furthermore, the charette increased the students’ awareness of the effects of rapid consumption processes, while illustrating the value of lifetime optimization through more responsible design and more emotionally durable products...|$|R

An industry analysis was conducted to assess the market pressures from new entrants, substitution, supplier and buyer powers, and internal rivalry. Three strategies {{as an integral part}} of the market <b>strategy</b> have thus <b>been</b> developed in AsiaÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�s conditioning polymer market for shampoo. The first <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> the differentiation <b>product</b> <b>development.</b> The second <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> cost-leadership. The third <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> to develop a replicate product to market dominating product system by strategic alliance with a local manufacturer. To ensure the successful implementation of the above <b>strategies,</b> people factor <b>is</b> the most important. This implicates the organizational structure, organizational culture reinforcement, human resources management including the adequate appraisal, rewards and career development systems in place. Leadership and ownership is re-emphasized. Tactics and project methodologies are also very important in strategy implementation. The project pipeline methodology (ICPM) should be strictly implemented, especially after the pilot phase. Six sigma can be also applied to the R&D and business process at tactical level. It will help the optimization of business processes in a systematic and statistical way. Its applications will cultivate a result-oriented thinking behavior, as each six sigma project is evaluated with the returns in dollars. With the above market <b>strategy</b> <b>development</b> and their implementation in conditioning polymers, Rhodia Novecare will hold a leading position in this region. This means it is not only strongly positioned in market share and technology, but also in terms of its capability of launching innovative products and solutions or in knowledge creation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the strategies that guide {{the role of}} end-users in new <b>product</b> <b>development</b> (NPD) in UK consumer durable firms. NPD success factor literature identifies {{the involvement of the}} end-user and a focus on their needs as important contributors to product success. The predominantly scientific and industrial focus of these studies means that there is, however, little information on how companies in consumer markets involve users to achieve successful products. This study fills a gap by examining the role of product users in the development of successful consumer durable products in UK firms. The products were identified {{through the use of a}} success scale developed from Griffin and Page 1993, 1996, and the award of the Millennium Product marque. An inductive approach utilising both quantitative and qualitative methods was employed and the study identified discrete groups of users involved for specific purposes in the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> process. Two <b>strategies</b> <b>were</b> identified as guiding userinvolvement: in the Expediency strategy, employees or 'internal users' were involved for rapid testing of designs where speed-to-market was considered to be a key competitive factor. The Risk Reduction strategy involved both external and internal users when products were more complex and a focus on product quality and getting it 'right first time' were important. It was also found that the firms either developed products based on their own interpretation of the users' needs, 'consumer-driven', or driven by retailers' demands and suggestions, 'retailer-driven'. Following further testing with all sixty-five products, it was concluded that the perceived complexity of the product determined which <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> chosen, and the level of market orientation in the firm established the driver. This thesis extends the NPD success-factor literature by establishing that the involvement of users is a contributor to successful consumer durable <b>product</b> <b>development.</b> It also identifies 'internal users' as a previously unrecognised group of users and relates the use of different groups of users to two distinct strategies. The Risk Reduction and Expediency strategies also extend the 'first-mover advantage' literature by concluding that products developed with the Risk Reduction <b>Strategy</b> <b>were</b> more successful than those that used an Expediency Strategy. Although these products were not usually first-to-market they benefited from being of superior quality. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|It {{is implied}} that Functional Products {{fundamentally}} change how the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> process is performed in global settings. An extended product definition {{together with the}} need to evaluate product properties earlier creates new demands on engineering methods and tools needed during the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> process. A trend is for the customer to want to buy extended solutions provided by many companies in a network. The companies are then forced to cooperate as early as possible in the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> phase to minimize the business risks. Functional products increase the amount of design parameters considered in the conceptual phase. Hardware, manufacturing, service and business parameters are all essential. However, {{there is a lack of}} methods to vary the extended set of design parameters in the conceptual design stage. The aerospace industry as well as other manufacturing companies with an increased product complexity develops their offers together globally, meaning that a design parameter can be distributed between several partners. Changing a parameter forces each partner to perform the necessary activities and share the result to gather the overall view. Inserting the functional product perspective into the aerospace industry creates totally new demands on the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> process with a life cycle perspective. Design parameters not normally involved in the early phases should now be considered. The purpose of this research is to develop a method that can enable this extended set of design parameters to be evaluated and manipulated in the early stages of <b>product</b> <b>development.</b> The research <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> to combine participatory action research process with a case study approach and to verify the approach close to technology and <b>product</b> <b>development</b> activities in industries. The research approach is to combine KBE, CAD and CAE technologies to create a more generative product model, which can automate activities in the conceptual phase of the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> process. Using a generative technical product model that adapts different design parameter settings extends the set of product properties to be evaluated. The generative model can also be used globally and distributed, enabling the evaluation of an extended set of design parameters in a global and distributed conceptual phase. With an increased ability to generate different models more product life cycle properties can be simulated and increase the conceptual information basis. This improves the ability to address product life cycle properties for functional product offers already in the conceptual phase.
