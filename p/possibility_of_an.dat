5|$|By 1812, {{advisers}} to Alexander suggested the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{invasion of the}} French Empire and the recapture of Poland. On receipt of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations, Napoleon expanded his Grande Armée to more than 450,000 men. He ignored repeated advice against an invasion of the Russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 June 1812 the invasion commenced.|$|E

5|$|Blackburn {{first became}} {{interested}} in the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eruption at Mount St. Helens in March 1980, when a series of earthquakes rocked the volcano. Having already climbed the mountain, he was intrigued by the situation and was eventually assigned to document the activity of the volcano for his outdoor skills and his meticulousness. By May, he had begun camping out at the volcano as a joint project to take pictures of the volcanic phenomena for The Columbian, National Geographic, and the United States Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|Both Björn Kurtén and Camille Arambourg {{promoted}} an Asiatic origin for the species; Kurtén focussed {{his arguments}} on the Plio-Pleistocene taxon Crocuta sivalensis from the Siwaliks, a view defended by Arambourg, who nonetheless allowed the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Indo-Ethiopian origin. This stance was contested by Ficarelli and Torre, who referred to {{evidence of the}} spotted hyena's presence from African deposists dating from the early Pleistocene, a similar age to the Asian C. sivalensis. Studies on the phylogeographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes indicates three migration events from Africa to Eurasia, though neither the topology of the phylogenetic tree or the fossil record exclude the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Asian origin. The earliest migration of spotted hyenas from Africa to Eurasia began less than 3.5 million years ago, most probably from {{the area where the}} first spotted hyena fossils were discovered, reaching East Asia and most likely also Pakistan. The second migration of spotted hyenas occurred less than 1.3–1.5 million years ago and resulted in the first arrival of hyenas in Europe and a separation of African spotted hyenas into a southern and a northern population. The third spotted hyena migration took place 0.36 million years ago, starting from the northern African population and reaching both Europe and Asia. Unlike other African carnivores, {{with the exception of the}} leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that spotted hyenas underwent a genetic bottleneck during the Pleistocene.|$|E

50|$|In a 2012 {{paper on}} the subject, Bliss argues {{that the source of}} the paradox is that when one mistakenly {{believes}} in the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger payoff that does not, in actuality, exist, one is mistaken by a larger margin than when one believes in the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smaller payoff that does not actually exist. If, for example, the envelopes contained $5.00 and $10.00 respectively, a player who opened the $10.00 envelope would expect the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> $20.00 payout that simply does not exist. Were that player to open the $5.00 envelope instead, he would believe in the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> $2.50 payout, which constitutes a smaller deviation from the true value; this results in the paradoxical discrepancy.|$|R

5|$|By early 1942, {{the colonial}} {{government}} of the Dutch East Indies had become concerned with the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion by the Empire of Japan. This fear reached the general populace, and the February 1942 edition of film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would {{move away from the}} colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Star, though production of 1001 Malam was incomplete, was reported to be preparing to move. When the Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942, Star was closed, never to reopen.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell's programme, {{assisted}} by Anne Boleyn's influence over episcopal appointments, {{was not merely}} against the clergy {{and the power of}} Rome. He persuaded Henry that safety from political alliances that Rome might attempt to bring together lay in negotiations with the German Lutheran princes. There also seemed to be a possibility that Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, might act to avenge his rejected aunt (Queen Catherine) and enforce the Pope's excommunication. It never came to anything but it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alliance.|$|E

5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|E

Following two pre-season storms, the CSU updated their forecast to 13 named storms, 5 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, while the NOAA upped their forecast numbers to 12–17 named storms, 5–8 hurricanes, and 2–3 major hurricanes on August9.
