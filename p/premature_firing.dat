5000|$|Loading {{of shells}} is a {{delicate}} process, and must be done with caution, and a loader must ensure not only the mortar is clean, but also {{make sure that no}} part of their body is directly over the mortar in case of a <b>premature</b> <b>fire.</b> Wiring the shells is a painstaking process; whether the shells are being fired manually or electronically, any [...] "chain fusing" [...] or wiring of electrical ignitors, care must be taken to prevent the fuse (an electrical match, often incorrectly called a squib) from igniting. If the setup is wired electrically, the electrical matches are usually plugged into a [...] "firing rail" [...] or [...] "breakout box" [...] which runs back to the main firing board; from there, the Firing Board is simply hooked up to a car battery, and can proceed with firing the show when ready.|$|R

6000|$|He {{was a man}} {{of strange}} contradictions. Living for many years in his brother's house, the home of many children, a house full of life, of animation, noisy with a {{constant}} coming and going of many guests, he kept his habits of solitude and silence. Considered as obstinately secretive in all his purposes, he was in reality the victim of a most painful irresolution in all matters of civil life. Under his taciturn, phlegmatic behaviour was hidden a faculty of short-lived passionate anger. I suspect he had no talent for narrative; but it seemed to afford him sombre satisfaction to declare that he was the last man to ride over the bridge of the river Elster after the battle of Leipsic. Lest some construction favourable to his valour should be put on the fact he condescended to explain how it came to pass. It seems that shortly after the retreat began he was sent back to the town where some divisions of the French army (and among them the Polish corps of Prince Joseph Poniatowski), jammed hopelessly in the streets, were being simply exterminated by the troops of the Allied Powers. When asked what it was like in there, Mr. Nicholas B. muttered only the word [...] "Shambles." [...] Having delivered his message to the Prince he hastened away at once to render an account of his mission to the superior who had sent him. By that time the advance of the enemy had enveloped the town, and he was shot at from houses and chased {{all the way to the}} river-bank by a disorderly mob of Austrian Dragoons and Prussian Hussars. The bridge had been mined early in the morning, and his opinion was that the sight of the horsemen converging from many sides in the pursuit of his person alarmed the officer in command of the sappers and caused the <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> of the charges. He had not gone more than two hundred yards on the other side when he heard the sound of the fatal explosions. Mr. Nicholas B. concluded his bald narrative with the word [...] "Imbecile," [...] uttered with the utmost deliberation. It testified to his indignation at the loss of so many thousands of lives. But his phlegmatic physiognomy lighted up when he spoke of his only wound, with something resembling satisfaction. You will see that there was some reason for it when you learn that he was wounded in the heel. [...] "Like his Majesty the Emperor Napoleon himself," [...] he reminded his hearers, with assumed indifference. There can be no doubt that the indifference was assumed, if one thinks what a very distinguished sort of wound it was. In all the history of warfare there are, I believe, only three warriors publicly known to have been wounded in the heel--Achilles and Napoleon--demigods indeed--to whom the familial piety of an unworthy descendant adds the name of the simple mortal, Nicholas B.|$|E

40|$|Concrete {{structures}} behave mostly well {{during the}} fire, however, {{in some cases}} collapse is found before the calculated fire resistance is obtained. This <b>premature</b> collapse during <b>fire</b> can be explained when studying the global structure response, as stresses are induced by restraint actions of the thermal deformations. This paper studies the behaviour of a structure consisting of beam-column connections exposed to the ISO 834 fire {{by means of the}} finite element package Diana. It is found that the effects of thermal restraint can be modeled. Internal thermal restraint may cause vertical cracks in the concrete element which do not extend towards the bottom surface of the heated beam. External thermal restraint is found as the gradual development of plastic hinges and the increase of shear forces which first appear well before the fire resistance according to the simplified methods of EN 1992 - 1 - 2 is attained. Due to the thermal deformations, cracks may also occur in building elements not directly exposed to the fire...|$|R

50|$|He {{demonstrated}} his resourceful nature by {{inventing a}} new kind of paper for cannon cartridges. This type of paper did not smoulder after the cannon had fired, which had been the cause of constant accidental explosions in the artillery.

It was said to have been of great value in the battles against Napoleon, increasing the British firing rate while simultaneously reducing <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> accidents.|$|E
50|$|The Brigade HQ finally {{landed at}} Arromanches on 2 October, {{and was not}} {{allocated}} an operational role. The brigade proceeded to Brussels, where it was given the task of setting up a practice camp for training operators on the new Mk VIII centimentric Searchlight Control (SLC or 'Elsie') radar. It was also ordered to begin trials on SLC radar for tracking enemy mortar fire. 41 S/L regiment had been detached from the brigade and was employed in the 'Anti-Diver' role against V-1 flying bombs heading towards Antwerp, while 42 S/L Rgt was under US command in Antwerp itself, and 54 S/L Rgt was still training in England. This meant that apart from its Signals and Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers sections, the only troops under the brigade's command were a detachment of 41 S/L Rgt personnel attached for the counter-mortar trials. On 18 November a <b>premature</b> explosion while <b>firing</b> a captured German 81 mm mortar killed 5 men (including 3 from 41 S/L) and wounded four men of 41 S/L.

6000|$|In a {{very short}} time the battle became general all along the line. This day {{everything}} was favorable to the Union side. We had now become the attacking party. The enemy was driven back all day, as we had been the day before, until finally he beat a precipitate retreat. The last point held by him was near the road leading from the landing to Corinth, on the left of Sherman and right of McClernand. About three o'clock, being near that point and seeing that the enemy was giving way everywhere else, I gathered up a couple of regiments, or parts of regiments, from troops near by, formed them in line of battle and marched them forward, going in front myself to prevent <b>premature</b> or long-range <b>firing.</b> At this point there was a clearing between us and the enemy favorable for charging, although exposed. I knew the enemy were ready to break and only wanted a little encouragement from us to go quickly and join their friends who had started earlier. After marching to within musket-range I stopped and let the troops pass. The command, CHARGE, was given, and was executed with loud cheers and with a run; when the last of the enemy broke.

40|$|Hollow core (HC) slabs {{are made}} of precast {{concrete}} with pretensioned strands. These slabs are popular as floor structures in offices and housing. At ambient conditions, the load bearing capacity can be dominated by four different failure modes, i. e. flexure, anchorage, shear compression and shear tension. As the economic production process {{does not allow for}} the inclusion of mild reinforcement, the slabs rely on the tensile strength of concrete for the shear and anchorage capacity. When exposed to a fire, the HC slabs have to maintain their load bearing and separating function for a certain time in order to facilitate the fire fighting actions and to provide sufficient time for the users of the building to escape and for rescue teams to search the building. Current design codes consider only flexural failure, while fire tests carried out in the past showed that the other failure modes can dominate the fire behaviour as well. As a result, design codes might overestimate the actual performance of fire exposed HC slabs. However, the experiments might represent a worst case compared to the practice. At least, fatalities caused by a <b>premature</b> collapse of <b>fire</b> exposed HC slabs, have never been reported up to the author's knowledge. Because {{there is a lack of}} fundamental understanding of the shear and anchorage behaviour, an optimum design between safety and economics can yet not be achieved. The objective of the research presented in this thesis is to gain a basic understanding of the shear and anchorage behaviour of fire exposed HC slabs and to develop FE models to predict this behaviour. With the models, design measures to improve the behaviour can be evaluated. The field of application is limited to HC slabs in accordance with the European product standard prEN 1168 [1197], exposed to standard fire conditions and simply supported on rigid supports like walls. The results are on the safe side for HC slabs with restraining support conditions. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
5000|$|On June 2, 1861, General Morris {{sent two}} columns of soldiers, one {{under the command}} of Colonel Kelley and one {{under the command of}} Colonel Ebenezer Dumont to attack the Confederates at Philippi. At about dawn on June 3, 1861, the larger Union force {{surprised}} the Confederates under Porterfield's command who were mostly still asleep in their tents in their camp just outside Philippi. The Confederates had few poorly positioned pickets on duty on the rainy night of June 2 - 3 and the Union force was able to approach close to the camp until being discovered because of the <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> of firearms. After the attack began, some Confederates fired a few return shots but soon the entire Confederate force began to flee in disorder without putting up a serious fight, and leaving most of their supplies. Only a few men were wounded during the brief fight, including Union Colonel Kelley, but at least a small number of Confederates were captured. This rout led to the Battle of Philippi being called the [...] "Philippi Races." [...] Porterfield and those of his men who were not dispersed or captured reorganized down the road and retreated to Beverly, Virginia about 30 mi to the south.|$|E

The guns were housed in two round turrets shipped {{fore and aft}} on the centreline. The guns would be reloaded {{under the cover of}} the turret thereby not exposing the gun crew to enemy fire. To load the guns the guns would be trained to approximately 140 degrees {{on either side of the}} centreline then moved to the end of their recoil. The muzzles would be lowered towards the deck; the shell and powder track would be raised from the deck below. On HMS Devastation they would be manually raised whereas on HMS Thunderer they would be raised hydraulically. A rammer would ram first the powder and then the shell into the muzzle of the gun. The gun then would be raise and moved to the firing position. The angle of the guns during reloading would be at an angle that in the event of a <b>premature</b> <b>firing,</b> the shell would exit the hull above the waterline rather than below it. No secondary armament or anti-torpedo boat armament was fitted. In 1879 she was fitted with two Whitehead 14-inch (36 cm) torpedo tubes in fixed mounts, one per broadside below the waterline.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} a single stuck-at fault in a {{non-redundant}} delay-insensitive circuit results in a transition either not taking place or firing prematurely, or both, during an execution of the circuit. A transition not taking place can be tested easily, as this always prevents a transition on a primary output from taking place. A <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> can also be tested but the addition of testing points {{may be required to}} enforce the <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> and to propagate the transition to a primary output. Hence all single stuck-at faults are testable. All test sequences can be generated from the high-level specification of the circuit.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} to test delay-insensitive circuits, using the single stuck-at fault model. These circuits are synthesized from a high-level specification. Since the circuits are hazard-free by construction, {{there is no}} test for hazards in the circuit. Most faults cause the circuit to halt during test, since they cause an acknowledgement not to occur when it should. There are stuck-at faults that do not cause the circuit to halt under any condition. These are stimulating faults; they cause a <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> of a production rule. For such a stimulating fault to be testable, the <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> has to be propagated to a primary output. If this is not guaranteed to occur, then one or more test points have {{to be added to}} the circuit. Any stuck-at fault is testable, with the possible addition of test points. For combinational delay-insensitive circuits, finding test vectors is reduced to the same problem as for synchronous combinational logic. For sequential circuits, the synthesis method is used to find a test for each fault efficiently, to find the location of the test points, and to find a test that detects all faults in a circuit. The number of test points needed to fully test the circuit is very low, and the size of the additional testing circuitry is small. A test derived with a simple transformation of the handshaking expansion yields high fault coverage. Adding tests for the remaining faults results in a small complete test for the circuit...|$|E
40|$|Testing {{asynchronous}} circuits is {{a difficult}} task because of two main reasons; first, {{the absence of a}} global clock does not allow the use of traditional test generation techniques used for synchronous circuits. Second, correct (i. e., hazard-free) operations of asynchronous circuits are usually obtained by introducing redundancies, that is, sacrificing the testability. So test frameworks such as fault simulator for synchronous circuits are not applicable for asynchronous circuits. In this paper we present an efficient fault simulator for template-based asynchronous circuits which is based on checking sequence of signals in templates. Our proposed fault simulator provides higher fault coverage by taking into consideration the detection of a special class of faults called <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> faults without introducing any hardware redundancy in the designed circuit. Experimental results on a set of circuits have shown the effectiveness of the fault simulator. 1...|$|E
40|$|Several {{fiber optic}} {{systems have been}} {{designed}} and implemented for the high energy density experiments at Pegasus II. The main fiber optic system developed for Pegasus II, remotely controls both the charging and discharging of the capacitor discharge unit (CDU). This fiber optic system {{is also used to}} distribute the timing and firing information specific to each experiment to the operators and experimenters. The timing and firing information includes the voltage on the CDU as it is being charged, a confirmation signal indicating the CDU has discharged and common timing signals based on the output signals on the load ring of the CDU. Various fiber optic systems were implemented to transfer diagnostic information related to the discharge of the main capacitor bank to the control room. The diagnostics include the current, electric field, and vacuum pressure at the target area. Not only do these fiber optic systems provide the control and monitor signals for the experiments at Pegasus II, they have the added value of preventing <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> of the capacitor bank, eliminating ground loops between the test area and the control room and providing overall increased operator safety...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic nuclei contain {{regions of}} {{differentially}} staining chromatin (heterochromatin), which remain condensed throughout the cell cycle and are largely transcriptionally silent. RNAi knockdown {{of the highly}} conserved heterochromatin protein HP 1 in Drosophila was previously shown to preferentially reduce male viability. Here we report a similar phenotype for the telomeric partner of HP 1, HOAP, and roles for both proteins in regulating the Drosophila sex determination pathway. Specifically, these proteins regulate the critical decision in this pathway, firing of the establishment promoter of the masterswitch gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl). Female-specific activation of this promoter, Sxl(Pe), is essential to females, as it provides SXL protein to initiate the productive female-specific splicing of later Sxl transcripts, which are transcribed from the maintenance promoter (Sxl(Pm)) in both sexes. HOAP mutants show inappropriate Sxl(Pe) firing in males and the concomitant inappropriate splicing of Sxl(Pm) -derived transcripts, while females show <b>premature</b> <b>firing</b> of Sxl(Pe). HP 1 mutants, by contrast, display Sxl(Pm) splicing defects in both sexes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show both proteins are associated with Sxl(Pe) sequences. In embryos from HP 1 mutant mothers and Sxl mutant fathers, female viability and RNA polymerase II recruitment to Sxl(Pe) are severely compromised. Our genetic and biochemical assays indicate a repressing activity for HOAP and both activating and repressing roles for HP 1 at Sxl(Pe) ...|$|E
40|$|A report {{presents}} {{a proposal to}} reduce the risk of accidental ignition of certain upper-stage rocket motors or other high energy hazardous systems. At present, mechanically in-line initiators are used for initiation of many rocket motors and/or other high-energy hazardous systems. Electrical shorts and/or mechanical barriers, which are the basic safety devices in such systems, are typically removed as part of final arming or pad preparations while personnel are present. At this time, static discharge, test equipment malfunction, or incorrect arming techniques can cause <b>premature</b> <b>firing.</b> The proposal calls for a modular out-of-line ignition system incorporating detonating-cord elements, identified as the donor and the acceptor, separated by an air gap. In the safe configuration, the gap would be sealed with two shields, which would prevent an accidental firing of the donor from igniting the system. The shields would be removed to enable normal firing, in which shrapnel generated by the donor would reliably ignite the acceptor to continue the ordnance train. The acceptor would then ignite a through bulkhead initiator (or other similar device), which would ignite the motor or high-energy system. One shield would be remotely operated and would be moved to the armed position when a launch was imminent or conversely returned to the safe position if the launch were postponed. In the event of failure of the remotely operated shield, the other shield could be inserted manually to safe the system...|$|E
