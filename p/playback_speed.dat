25|$|Turntables allow DJs to play vinyl records. By {{adjusting}} the <b>playback</b> <b>speed</b> of the turntable, either by {{adjusting the}} speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the tempos of different records so their rhythms can be played together {{at the same time}} without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as beatmatching. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a slipmat that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. Direct-drive turntables are the type preferred by DJs, with the Technics SL-1200 being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play hip hop music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for scratching, beat juggling, and other turntablism techniques.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{found the}} social {{guidance}} film Age 13 in the Prelinger Archives, {{which served as}} his main inspiration. He slowed the film down to half its original <b>playback</b> <b>speed</b> to allow a full album to be written around the twenty-five-minute film. With complete creative control over the album, Moore was free to experiment, sometimes writing music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] The deluxe edition of the album contains the film in its full length, played at half speed, with the album as a soundtrack {{in place of the}} original audio.|$|E
500|$|Moore wrote {{music to}} Age 13 slowed down to half its {{original}} <b>playback</b> <b>speed.</b> This {{allowed him to}} write an album's worth of music around the twenty-five minute film and [...] "made [...] flow better". Moore primarily worked alone in his home studio, recording short song ideas. [...] "I would place [...] inside a theme in the film, just sort of audition things that might work, and something would click and I would develop the idea," [...] Moore said. In contrast to Moore's original plan to record an [...] "organic, and less digital" [...] album, all of the sounds on Graveyard Mountain Home are digital.|$|E

50|$|Most {{waveform}} {{viewers can}} read an industrial standard waveform database known as Value Change Dump (VCD) or a proprietary wave format. The proprietary wave formats usually have faster record and <b>playback</b> <b>speeds</b> or require smaller memory store space, or save additional signal information for viewing, such as bus transactions.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{specifications}} of {{the music}} single were set in the late 19th century, when the gramophone record began to supersede phonograph cylinders in commercially produced musical recordings. Gramophone discs were manufactured {{with a range of}} <b>playback</b> <b>speeds</b> (from 16 rpm to 78 rpm) and in several sizes (including 12-inch/30 cm). By about 1910, however, the 10-inch (25 cm), 78 rpm shellac disc had become the most commonly used format.|$|R
2500|$|Most karaoke {{machines}} have technology [...] that electronically {{changes the}} pitch of the music so that amateur singers can choose a key that is appropriate for their vocal range, while maintaining the original tempo of the song. (Old systems which used cassettes changed the pitch by altering <b>playback</b> <b>speed,</b> but none {{are still on the}} market, and their commercial use is virtually nonexistent.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Special vinyl records (or CDs/digital files {{played with}} CDJs) {{can be used}} with DJ {{software}} to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing turntablism techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed on to them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as [...] "timecode", to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the <b>playback</b> <b>speed,</b> direction, and position of the timecode signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing {{in the same way that}} the turntable manipulates the timecode record.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distributor}} of a podcast maintains a central {{list of the}} files on a server as a web feed that can be accessed through the Internet. The listener or viewer uses special client application software on a computer or media player, known as a podcatcher, which accesses this web feed, checks it for updates, and downloads any new files in the series. This process can be automated to download new files automatically, which may seem to users as though new episodes are broadcast or [...] "pushed" [...] to them. Files are stored locally on the user's device, ready for offline use. There are many different mobile applications available for people to use to subscribe and to listen to podcasts. Many of these applications allow users to download podcasts or to stream them on demand {{as an alternative to}} downloading. Many podcast players (apps as well as dedicated devices) allow listeners to skip around the podcast and control the <b>playback</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of records manufactured have been of certain sizes (7, 10, or 12 inches), <b>playback</b> <b>speeds</b> (33, 45, or 78 RPM), and appearance (round black discs). However, since the commercial adoption of the gramophone record (called a phonograph record in the US, where both cylinder records and disc records were invented), {{a wide variety of}} records have also been produced that do not fall into these categories, and they have served a variety of purposes.|$|R
50|$|One common {{issue with}} the PT01 (and similar models) is {{inconsistent}} <b>playback</b> <b>speeds.</b> The most likely culprit is usually dirty, poor quality lubricants around the center spindle. To resolve, remove the C-clip from the spindle, lift the platter (being careful not to damage the belt) and thoroughly clean the spindle. Also clean the surrounding areas and center sleeve of the platter with proper solvents, then apply an even coat of lithium grease. Doing so {{is the most common}} method of resolving these slowdown issues.|$|R

Since a digital bin was capable of <b>playback</b> <b>speeds</b> of 256:1 or better, a single bin could perform as two by splitting the buffer between two different programs. A program could be loaded and looped for production while an additional program could be loaded into the buffer. A real-time monitoring system could play back the audio stored in either buffer to check for potential flaws in the audio while both programs were looping for production.|$|R

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{experience}} of many learners of a foreign language that native speakers (NSs) of that language speak too quickly for them to understand or imitate. Slowing down a segment of speech with older technology results in the familiar deepening of the voice as the pitch drops as well. The result is unpleasant and not particularly instructive. The DITCall-Slow tool slows recorded speech without tonal distortion, so that the learner has – literally – more time to hear what was said by the NS and, especially at slower <b>playback</b> <b>speeds,</b> can attend to {{the manner in which}} the sequence was spoken. While the tool is currently being commercialised for the study of English as a foreign language (EFL), it can be applied to any spoken language.

5000|$|Side 2 of {{the record}} caused consternation at the time. Neu! had quite simply {{run out of money}} to finish {{recording}} the album, so the second side consists entirely of their previously released single [...] "Neuschnee/Super", manipulated at various <b>playback</b> <b>speeds</b> on a record player, or mangled in a cassette recorder. Critics at the time dismissed this as a cheap gimmick and a rip-off. While it was indeed an experiment born of desperation and necessity, it was entirely in keeping with Neu's pop art aesthetics, taking a [...] "ready-made" [...] sound object and re-presenting it with a series of stylized manipulations, and also quite in keeping with the way Neu's music deconstructed and pared down the form of rock music. Dinger subsequently pointed to side 2 as being a prototype of the now ubiquitous multiple remixes which typically accompany any pop single release.|$|R

50|$|Hyperlapse is {{a mobile}} app created by Instagram that enables users to produce hyperlapse and {{time-lapse}} videos. It {{was released on}} August 26, 2014. The app enables users to record videos up to 45 minutes of footage in a single take, which can be subsequently accelerated to create a hyperlapse cinematographic effect. Whereas time-lapses are normally produced by stitching together stills from traditional cameras, the app uses an image stabilization algorithm that steadies the appearance of video by eliminating jitter. Unlike Instagram, the app offers no filters. Instead, the only post-production option available to users is the modification of <b>playback</b> <b>speed</b> which can range from 1x to 40x normal <b>playback</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
40|$|Estimates if {{the visual}} speed of human {{movements}} such as hand gestures, facial expressions and locomotion are important during social interactions {{because they can}} be used to infer mood and intention. However {{it is not clear how}} observers use retinal signals to estimate real-world movement speed. We conducted a series of experiments to investigate adaptation-induced changes in apparent human locomotion speed, to test whether the changes show repulsion of similar speeds or global re-normalisation of all apparent speeds. Participants adapted to videos of walking or running figures at various <b>playback</b> <b>speeds,</b> and then judged the apparent movement speed of subsequently presented test clips. Their task was to report whether each test clip appeared to be faster or slower than a ‘natural’ speed. After adaptation to a slow-motion or fast-forward video, psychometric functions showed that the apparent speed of all test clips changed, becoming faster or slower respectively, consistent with global re-normalisation rather than with repulsion of test speeds close to the adapting speed. The adaptation effect depended on the retinal speed of the adapting stimulus but did not require recognizably human movements...|$|R

40|$|The ready {{availability}} of digital video is revolutionizing {{the way that}} observational science research is performed. Digital video has {{made it easy to}} record, store, and share vast amounts of video data about human activity. However, this vast increase in the {{availability of}} video has not yet been accompanied by equally advanced mechanisms for understanding and analyzing the content of these videos. I propose a project to develop better methods of visualizing the content of videos by first understanding the cognitive issues at play when people view and analyze video. These include questions about episodic memory for video, summarization and segmentation of video data, and perception of video across a range of auditory and visual characteristics and <b>playback</b> <b>speeds.</b> This project will require three stages: First, I will conduct an experiment on video navigation to analyze the strategies that people use to navigate video, which guide further inference about the cognitive factors at play. Second, I will design visualizations to take advantage of strengths and support weaknesses in those factors. Third, I will use similar methods as in the first experiment to evaluate the design of the visualizations against the identified cognitive factors. 1...|$|R
50|$|Another type of dubbing {{device is}} {{designed}} to rapidly produce many copies of a program. It may combine a single playback unit with multiple recording units to simultaneously create two, four, eight, sixteen, or more copies during the playback of a single original program. This type of device can often perform the copying process at many times the standard <b>playback</b> <b>speed.</b> Typical multiplexed dubbing decks of either analog (cassette) or digital (CD) programs can operate at 48 times the standard <b>playback</b> <b>speed,</b> thus producing complete copies of a program in sixty or ninety seconds. Sometimes this high-speed dubbing incurs some loss of quality compared to the best normal (1×) speed dub.|$|E
