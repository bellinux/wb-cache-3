5|$|A {{letter of}} Hadrian written from Egypt to his {{brother-in-law}} Servianus is quoted at length (and {{was accepted as}} genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century). Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136. The letter {{is said to have}} been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the History, in another suspect passage. A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the <b>passage</b> <b>is</b> probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.|$|E
40|$|<b>Passages</b> can <b>be</b> hidden {{within a}} text to {{circumvent}} their disallowed transfer. Such release of compartmentalized information {{is of concern}} to all corporate and governmental organizations. <b>Passage</b> retrieval <b>is</b> well studied; we posit, however, that <b>passage</b> detection <b>is</b> not. <b>Passage</b> retrieval <b>is</b> {{the determination of the}} degree of relevance of blocks of text, namely passages, comprising a document. Rather than determining the relevance of a document in its entirety, passage retrieval determines the relevance of the individual passages. As such, modified traditional information retrieval techniques compare terms found in user queries with the individual passages to determine a similarity score for passages of interest. In <b>passage</b> detection, <b>passages</b> <b>are</b> classified into predetermined categories. More often than not, <b>passage</b> detection techniques <b>are</b> deployed to detect hidden paragraphs in documents. That is, to hide information, documents are injected with hidden text into passages. Rather than matching query terms against passages to determine their relevance, using text mining techniques, the <b>passages</b> <b>are</b> classified. Those documents with hidden <b>passages</b> <b>are</b> defined as infected. Thus, simply stated, <b>passage</b> retrieval <b>is</b> the search for passages relevant to a user query, while <b>passage</b> detection <b>is</b> the classification of <b>passages.</b> That <b>is,</b> in <b>passage</b> detection, <b>passages</b> <b>are</b> labeled with one or more categories from a set of predetermined categories.

5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their <b>passage</b> <b>is</b> associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the area}} along the river, within {{a few miles of}} its banks, is {{irrigated}} farmland, especially in its middle and lower course. Irrigation dams include American Falls Dam, Minidoka Dam, and C.J. Strike Dam. Aside from water from the river, water is also pulled from the Snake River Aquifer for irrigation. Major cities along the river include Jackson in Wyoming, Twin Falls, Idaho Falls, Boise, and Lewiston in Idaho, and the Tri-Cities in Washington (Kennewick, Pasco and Richland). There are fifteen dams in total along the Snake River, which aside from irrigation, also produce electricity, maintain a navigation channel along part of the river's route, and provide flood control.

5|$|Some of the {{information}} contained in the Liber is important to historians. It is in the Liber that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule into Old English is made. The Liber is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal chancery, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Liber describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the <b>passage</b> <b>is</b> unclear. The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in the castle's north wall {{is three}} storeys high; now reached by a static bridge, {{it was originally}} connected to the barbican by a drawbridge. The top of the gatehouse is machicolated, and the approach is overlooked by gun-loops in the gatehouse towers. The gatehouse is {{the only part of}} the castle which has gun-loops, and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military. There are guardrooms on the ground floor and a basement beneath them. The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises. Above the entrance <b>passage</b> <b>is</b> an arch in the gateway, although it leads nowhere. The ceiling of the passage through the gatehouse into the castle is vaulted and pierced with murder-holes. Murder-holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations, or to pour water to extinguish fires.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} partly migratory, northernmost populations deserting their {{breeding}} areas in winter. Birds winter in Europe and Asia {{south of the}} breeding range. Birds in northern Fennoscandia and Russia vacate their territories between late August and early November, with most leaving in late September to mid-October as the first cold weather arrives. Adverse conditions may lead to disorientation, large numbers gathering on ships on overcast or wet nights. Large influxes include 15,000 birds on the Isle of May in October 1982, and nearly 21,000 birds through a single site in Latvia during September and October 1983. Spring migration is complete by late March on the Mediterranean islands, but continues to late April or early May in northern Europe. The spring <b>passage</b> <b>is</b> much lighter than in autumn, suggesting high mortality on migration.|$|E
5|$|Three {{defensive}} {{positions are}} positioned outside the main ramparts of the castle. To the south, reached by an underground <b>passage,</b> <b>is</b> the Half-Moon Battery, constructed in 1793 and redesigned in 1895 and 1941. This has two camouflaged gun houses and 6-inch guns {{dating from the}} Second World War, when it held a team of 99 soldiers. Further south, near the waterline, is the Little Dennis Blockhouse, a D-shaped gun position dating from 1539, altered in the 1540s and then adapted to form {{part of a larger}} fortification covering the whole of Pendennis Point in the late 16th century. Built from Killas rubble, the exterior of the blockhouse and its lookout turret still survive intact. Just along the shoreline to the north-east is the Crab Quay Battery, a set of defences originating in the 16th century, intended to prevent an amphibious landing on the headland, and modernised extensively in 1902.|$|E

5|$|For {{approximately}} five days the armies therefore confronted {{each other across}} the plain of Marathon in stalemate. The flanks of the Athenian camp were protected either by a grove of trees, or an abbatis of stakes (depending on the exact reading). Since every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer, the delay worked in favor of the Athenians. There were ten Athenian strategoi (generals) at Marathon, elected by each of the ten tribes that the Athenians were divided into; Miltiades was one of these. In addition, in overall charge, was the War-Archon (polemarch), Callimachus, who had been elected by the whole citizen body. Herodotus suggests that command rotated between the strategoi, each taking in turn a day to command the army. He further suggests that each strategos, on his day in command, instead deferred to Miltiades. In Herodotus's account, Miltiades is keen to attack the Persians (despite knowing that the Spartans are coming to aid the Athenians), but strangely, chooses to wait until his actual day of command to attack. This <b>passage</b> <b>is</b> undoubtedly problematic; the Athenians had little to gain by attacking before the Spartans arrived, and there is no real evidence of this rotating generalship. There does, however, seem to have been a delay between the Athenian arrival at Marathon, and the battle; Herodotus, who evidently believed that Miltiades was eager to attack, may have made a mistake whilst seeking to explain this delay.|$|E
5|$|IV. Allegro. This {{movement}} {{is written in}} 6/8 and in tarantella style, and is characterised by a relentless galloping rhythm calling on demanding pianistic effects with frequent hand-crossing and leaps across registers. It employs the three-key exposition, a recurrent element in Schubert's style. The first theme shifts from C minor to C major – another Schubertian feature, and contains many allusions to D-flat major, which finally becomes established in a climactic reference to the Adagio's characteristic plagal cadence. The second theme, proceeding with the enharmonic parallel minor of this cadence (C-sharp minor), further develops the cadence in its alternation of tonic and subdominant tonalities. After a series of modulations, the exposition ends in the traditional relative major, E-flat. The development section begins in C-flat with a new theme, derived from the last bars of the exposition. Later on, additional material from the exposition is developed, gradually building up towards a climax. The recapitulation is also written in three keys; the first theme is drastically shortened, {{and this time the}} second theme veers to B-flat minor, the result being that the closing section appears in the traditional tonic. The coda begins with a long anticipatory passage which stresses A-flat, the submediant, and then reintroduces the first theme, restoring the most of the music omitted from its reprise. This last <b>passage</b> <b>is</b> characterized by sweeping arpeggios with violent dynamic contrasts - a series of subito fortissimo decaying to piano, following {{the rise and fall of}} the melody. On the last iteration, the melody hits triple forte at the zenith of its register and then plunges four octaves in a descending arpeggio, poco a poco diminuendo al pianissimo. An emphatic cadence then concludes the piece.|$|E
