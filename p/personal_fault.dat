60|$|The {{struggle}} {{that was at}} hand between Spain and England had long been foreseen as inevitable. The one power was the champion of Roman Catholicism, the other of Protestantism; and yet, although so much hung upon {{the result of the}} encounter, and all Europe looked on with the most intense interest, both parties entered upon the struggle without allies, and this entirely from the <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> of the sovereigns of the two nations.|$|E

Your only fault--your <b>personal</b> <b>fault,</b> I mean--that I can see is that it was a little indiscreet of you to dine alone with a young woman for whom the Prince is known to have a foolish passion. Diplomatically, however, you have {{committed}} every fault possible, I am very sorry, but I think that you had better report in Downing Street as soon as possible. The train leaves, I think, at three o'clock." ...|$|E

Out of the limelight, the plot {{emphasizes}} his <b>personal</b> <b>faults</b> as much as it does his professional successes. Other major characters include his wife Ruby Keeler and his longtime friend and agent Louis Epstein.|$|R
50|$|Fasting {{is said to}} inculcate a {{sense of}} {{fraternity}} and solidarity with the needy and hungry. Most importantly, the fast is also seen as a great sign of obedience by the believer to God.

5000|$|YourGigs website previewed Bob Evans' 2009 {{tour and}} {{described}} Suburban Kid as [...] "an album of youthful introspection, love and loss". Jason Ankeny (Allmusic) felt it [...] "showcased a more intimate, roots-flavored dimension of his songwriting".

[...] "Well, I want you all to understand that I have no <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> to find, and that I don't wish to change the church music by forcible means, or {{in a way which}} should hurt the feelings of any parishioners. Why I have at last spoken definitely on the subject is that a player has been brought under--I may say pressed upon--my notice several times by one of the churchwardens.

60|$|And {{so it may}} be {{with our}} means of {{locomotion}} and intercommunion, and what depends on them. The vast and unprecedented amount of capital, of social interest, of actual human intellect invested--I may say locked up--in these railroads, and telegraphs, and other triumphs of industry and science, will not enter into competition against themselves. They will not set themselves free to seek new discoveries in directions which are often actually opposed to their own, always foreign to it. If the money of thousands are locked up in these great works, the brains of hundreds of thousands, and of the very shrewdest too, are equally locked up therein likewise; and are to be subtracted from the gross material of social development, and added (without <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> of their owners, who may be very good men) to the dead weight of vested selfishness, ignorance, and dislike of change.|$|E

40|$|Many web {{accounts}} are getting hacked everyday {{even though the}} public web servers like Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail utilizes the well-known security techniques. However, attacks usually happen due to <b>personal</b> <b>faults</b> such as users do use a password or PIN {{that can be easily}} determined or bypassed, such as 1234 or 0000, birth date, name, mobile number. Traditional authentication system involves the use of a secret key or password of which user must memorize and recall during authentication, however due to user’s careless, password can be forgotten or read by someone or simply intercepted during communication. Many approaches have been proposed for proper strategies of securing and using passwords. However, this can only reduce the problem of a static password authentication to some certain degree as it still has a lot of shortcomings. So we are proposing Multi-factor authentication to be an improved authentication scheme to overcome <b>personal</b> <b>faults.</b> It increases security by generating a secret hash code using a pre-shared number and user’s current GPS location...|$|R
50|$|In 1980 Westfall {{published}} what {{is widely}} regarded as the definitive biography of Isaac Newton, Never at Rest. Westfall considered Newton a driven, neurotic, often humorless and vengeful individual. Despite these <b>personal</b> <b>faults,</b> Westfall ranked Newton as the most important man in the history of western European civilization. Westfall published a condensed and simplified version of the biography as The Life of Isaac Newton in 1993.|$|R
5000|$|Next to his {{military}} career, Won Gyun {{is perhaps best}} known for his <b>personal</b> <b>faults,</b> which included excessive alcohol consumption and attempts at adultery. In his War Diaries, Yi Sun-Sin recalls reports and rumors about [...] "cruel deeds" [...] committed by Won and even mentions an incident in which Won had unsuccessfully attempted to seduce one of his subordinates's wife, calling him a [...] "wicked man" [...] and (at least partially) blaming him for his degradation ("Won employs all means to entrap me").|$|R
5000|$|Although the Roman Catholic Church {{explicitly}} {{teaches that}} [...] "original sin {{does not have}} the character of a <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> in any of Adams descendants", some Eastern Orthodox nevertheless claim that Roman Catholicism professes the teaching, which they attribute to Saint Augustine, that everyone bears not only the consequence, but also the guilt of Adams sin.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Western Church, [...] "original sin {{does not}} have the {{character}} of a <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> in any of Adam's descendants", and the Eastern Church teaches that [...] "by these fruits and this burden we do not understand actual sin". The Orthodox and the Catholics believe that people inherit only the spiritual sickness (in which all suffer and sin) of Adam and Eve, caused by their ancestral sin (what has flowed to them), a sickness leaving them weakened in their powers, subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and inclined to sin.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{theology}} of the Catholic Church, original sin is regarded as the general condition of sinfulness, that is (the absence of holiness and perfect charity) into which humans are born, distinct from the actual sins that a person commits. This teaching explicitly states that [...] "original sin does not have the character of a <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> in any of Adam's descendants". In other words, human beings do not bear any [...] "original guilt" [...] from Adam's particular sin, which is his alone. The prevailing view, also held in Eastern Orthodoxy, is that human beings bear no guilt for the sin of Adam. The Catholic Church teaches: [...] "By our first parents' sin, the devil has acquired a certain domination over man, even though man remains free." ...|$|E

He cannot be prosecuted for either injury or defamation caused by what {{he says in a}} hearing. <b>Personal</b> <b>faults</b> tied to public service can on the other hand be prosecuted by virtue of the State's power of recourse, but only in front of the civil chamber of the Cour de cassation.|$|R
5|$|There was no {{established}} {{procedure for}} removing an English king. Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Hereford, {{made a series}} of public allegations about Edward's conduct as king, and in January 1327 a parliament convened at Westminster at which the question of Edward's future was raised; Edward refused to attend the gathering. Parliament, initially ambivalent, responded to the London crowds that called for Prince Edward to take the throne. On 12 January the leading barons and clergy agreed that Edward II should be removed and replaced by his son. The following day it was presented to an assembly of the barons, where it was argued that Edward's weak leadership and <b>personal</b> <b>faults</b> had led the kingdom into disaster, and that he was incompetent to lead the country.|$|R
50|$|On a more {{personal}} level, Scrooge and Rockerduck seem to bicker constantly, criticizing each other's ways of life and <b>personal</b> <b>faults.</b> Although his confrontations with Scrooge have often found him defeated or even humiliated, he has commented on at least enjoying the challenge that Scrooge presents to him. At times the two find each other co-operating to achieve common goals. If they are worthy rivals to each other, they also seem to make effective partners - but only on a temporary basis. Some stories portray Rockerduck in a more positive light and portray him as friendly towards Scrooge's associates like Brigitta McBridge and Donald Duck, as he has nothing personal against them. When relaxed he can even be a pleasant companion for them or Scrooge. In all these traits, he differs from Flintheart Glomgold.|$|R
50|$|In December 2009 {{a website}} {{published}} {{a statement by}} Cardinal Lozano Barragán {{in which he said}} that, while the Church regarded homosexuality as an insult to God, this did not justify discrimination against gay and transsexual people. The cardinal quoted Saint Paul's Letter to the Romans as indicating that homosexuals and transsexuals will never enter the kingdom of heaven. He later clarified that this did not mean that no individual homosexual can be saved, since existence of grave fault requires not only grave matter but also full knowledge and consent, and since being homosexual is often due not to <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> but to education and environment. Saying that people are not born homosexual, he attributed homosexuality to reasons such as education and failure to develop one's identity during adolescence.|$|E
5000|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} every human person born {{on this earth}} {{is made in the}} image of God. Within man [...] "is both the {{powerful}} surge toward the good because we are made in the image of God, and the darker impulses toward evil because of the effects of Original Sin." [...] Furthermore, it explicitly denies that we inherit guilt from anyone, maintaining that instead we inherit our fallen nature. In this it differs from the Calvinism/Protestant position that each person actually inherits Adam's guilt, and teaches instead that [...] "original sin does not have the character of a <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> in any of Adam's descendants ... but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man". [...] "In other words, human beings do not bear any 'original guilt' from Adam and Eve's particular sin." ...|$|E
50|$|Romanides {{rejects the}} Catholic teachings on Original Sin. Orthodox theologians trace this {{position}} to having {{its roots in}} the works of Saint Augustine. Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Assyrian Church of the East, and Eastern Catholicism, which together make up Eastern Christianity, acknowledge that the introduction of ancestral sin into the human race affected the subsequent environment for humanity, but never accepted Augustine of Hippo's notions of original sin and hereditary guilt. The Catholic Church did not accept all of Augustine's ideas, at least as these are commonly interpreted outside the Church, such as the idea that original sin deprives man of free will or that God predestines some people to hell, and also his teaching that infants who die without baptism are confined to hell. It holds that original sin does not have the character of a <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> in any of Adam's descendants.|$|E
5000|$|While Heinrich's {{figure that}} 88 {{percent of all}} {{workplace}} accidents and injuries/illnesses are caused by [...] "man-failure" [...] is perhaps his most oft-cited conclusion, his book actually encouraged employers to control hazards, not merely focus on worker behaviors. [...] "No matter how strongly the statistical records emphasize <b>personal</b> <b>faults</b> or how imperatively the need for educational activity is shown, no safety procedure is complete or satisfactory that does not provide for the [...] [...] [...] correction or elimination of [...] [...] [...] physical hazards," [...] Heinrich wrote in his book. [...] Emphasizing this aspect of workplace safety, Heinrich devoted 100 pages of his work {{to the subject of}} machine guarding. Heinrich did safety work across many industries, with published data, which gives guidelines of how to scale up from incidents and near misses to a good estimate of the probability of real accidents.|$|R
40|$|The work Actor and Complexes {{comes from}} the efforts to catch the {{insecurity}} and doubt of a beginning actor. When I have in my mind an actor, I speak about myself and when I write about the complexes, I think about a unique constellation of my <b>personal</b> <b>faults</b> and pains. The intention of this work is not a special psychological work but a detail scrutiny of myself. I do not dare to judge somebody else. Instead I would like the others to judge me or find some resemblance. Complexes form our personality {{as well as a}} sculptor and although they work with different material, the result is undeniably similar. I am their product {{and to be able to}} see myself I need a mirror. 	This work is the mirror of my theatre practice in which I aspire to see not only my reflection but also its essence...|$|R
50|$|The New Church is seen {{by members}} of New Church {{organizations}} as something which the Lord is establishing with all {{those who believe that}} the Lord Jesus Christ is the one God of heaven and Earth, and that obeying his commandments is necessary for salvation. Therefore, it is thought that any Christian holding these beliefs is part of this New Church movement. New Church organizations also acknowledge the universal nature of the Lord's church: all who do good from the truth of their religion will be accepted by the Lord into heaven, as God is goodness itself, and doing good conjoins one to God. Adherents believe that the doctrine of the New Church is derived from scripture and provides the benefit of further enlightenment concerning the truth, and that this leads to diminished doubt, a recognition of <b>personal</b> <b>faults,</b> and thus a more directed and happier life.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to church}} teaching, in an event {{known as the}} [...] "fall of the angels" [...] a number of angels chose to rebel against God and his reign. The leader of this {{rebellion}} has been given many names including [...] "Lucifer" [...] (meaning [...] "light bearer" [...] in Latin), [...] "Satan" [...] and the devil. The sin of pride, considered one of seven deadly sins, is attributed to Satan for desiring to be God's equal. A fallen angel tempted the first humans, Adam and Eve, who then committed the original sin which brought suffering and death into the world. This event, known as the Fall of Man, left humans separated from their original state of intimacy with God, a separation that can persist beyond death. The Catechism states that … The account of the fall in Genesis 3 uses figurative language, but affirms a primeval event, a deed that {{took place at the}} beginning of the history of man. ... CCC § 390 resulting in … original sin does not have the character of a <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> in any of Adam's descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin—an inclination to evil that is called concupiscence. ... CCC § 405 ...|$|E
5000|$|The Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Greek {{translation}} of which uses [...] "προπατορική αμαρτία" [...] (literally, [...] "ancestral sin") where the Latin text has [...] "peccatum originale", states: [...] "Original sin is called 'sin' only in an analogical sense: it {{is a sin}} 'contracted' and not 'committed' - a state and not an act. Although it is proper to each individual, original sin {{does not have the}} character of a <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> in any of Adam's descendants." [...] Eastern Orthodox teaching likewise says: [...] "It can be said that while we have not inherited the guilt of Adam's personal sin, because his sin is also of a generic nature, and because the entire human race is possessed of an essential, ontological unity, we participate in it by virtue of our participation in the human race. 'The imparting of Original Sin by means of natural heredity should be understood in terms of the unity of the entire human nature, and of the homoousiotitos of all men, who, connected by nature, constitute one mystic whole. Inasmuch as human nature is indeed unique and unbreakable, the imparting of sin from the first-born to the entire human race descended from him is rendered explicable: [...] "Explicitly, as from the root, the sickness proceeded {{to the rest of the}} tree, Adam being the root who had suffered corruption" [...] (St. Cyril of Alexandria).|$|E

5000|$|Negative {{views of}} Hollywood marriages take the {{position}} that the divorce rates are indeed unusually high among celebrities and that this is caused by faults within Hollywood as a culture or by <b>personal</b> <b>faults</b> of the celebrities themselves. They point to the usage of weddings as publicity stunts, the egotism or immaturity of celebrities or [...] "celebrity culture", and high rates of infidelity or promiscuity. Bee Wilson, in an article for The Daily Telegraph, critiqued [...] "Hollywood marriages" [...] for often being based on the unrealistic dreams of what she termed [...] "permanent children," [...] although she points to some classic Hollywood couples, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart or Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, as exceptions to these criticisms.

6000|$|... "In that, we are {{perfectly}} of a mind; for, if {{there be any}} thing that betrays a consciousness of inferiority, it is our rendering others of so much obvious importance to ourselves, as to make them the subjects of our constant conversation. We may speak of virtues, for therein we pay an homage to that which is good; {{but when we come}} to dwell on <b>personal</b> <b>faults,</b> it is rather a proof that we have a silent conviction of the superiority of the subject of our comments to ourselves, either in character, talents, social position, or something else that is deemed essential, than of our distaste for his failings. Who, for instance, talks scandal of his grocer, or of his shoemaker? No, no, our pride forbids this; we always make our betters the subject of our strictures by preference, taking up with our equals only when we can get none of a higher class." ...|$|R
50|$|The term {{encompasses}} {{a whole host}} of services; which may include 24-hour vehicle recovery, damage assessment, replacement car provision, arrangement of vehicle repairs, liaising with insurers, uninsured loss recovery, determining <b>fault,</b> <b>personal</b> injury assistance and help with paperwork.|$|R
30|$|The {{key issue}} of {{attributing}} {{the use of}} service robots must be answered by the law: Who is their employment legally to be attributed to, who is legally {{to be viewed as}} the provider of services performed by the service robot: Is it the person whom the service is provided for? The person who put it into operation? Or possibly a third party who encouraged its use and/or paid for its services or made it available, such as the health insurance provider? Or should one possibly consider if the robot has not its own legal personality? Does legal liability ensue from the operation of equipment or from <b>personal</b> <b>fault?</b> The more service robots are incorporated in a system intimately, and thus the more people have access and use, the harder it gets to make an association and the harder it becomes to make an assignment to legal categories.|$|E
40|$|Non-vicarious {{liability}} for {{the acts of}} third parties is distinguishable from the traditional doctrine of vicarious liability insofar {{as it relates to}} a form of primary liability predicated upon the <b>personal</b> <b>fault</b> of the defendant. More conveniently termed 'third party liability', it is a novel category of tortious liability that has evolved from a collection of disparate and isolated judicial decisions setting out, on an entirely ad hoc basis, individualised exceptions to the entrenched common law rules against {{liability for}} omissions and liability for the acts of others. As a result of the improvised nature of its development, the current law on third party liability is unstructured, unprincipled and incoherent. The specific purpose of this book is to seek out the foundational principles governing the various existing instances of third party liability, with a view to identifying a coherent legal basis upon which such liability can develop in the future...|$|E
30|$|On {{the level}} of public regulation, {{liability}} norms are a significant and historically proven mechanism, particularly in technology law. Since disaster prevention can scarcely be left to individuals, especially in relation to systemic effects, this particular task is one that the legislature has to deal with. It must {{strike a balance between}} public welfare and the interests of individuals. This includes establishing a healthy balance between an individual’s interest in not coming to harm and the innovative interest in generally facilitating developments or the interest in a functioning economy or health care system in times of an aging population, high unemployment rates, and an increased number of people in need of care, particularly in cases of dementia. Also, an individual limit of sacrifice can be set. Frequently, this is accomplished by statutorily declaring potentially risky behavior as being principally admissible—such as is the case for placing genetically modified organisms onto the market, but coupling this freedom of action with increased liability sanctions such as strict liability: liability is incurred purely for engaging in potentially dangerous behavior, regardless of <b>personal</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|E
6000|$|You have {{followed}} the right course (especially in a question which [...] directly concerns the House of Commons) in obtaining the opinion [...] of the law officers of the crown....

60|$|Worse in two ways, also, more's the pity. It is perpetually {{increasing}} the personal sense of ignorance and the <b>personal</b> sense of <b>fault.</b> And this last {{is the truth}} {{which is at the}} bottom of the common evangelical notion about conversion, and which the Devil has got hold of, and hidden, until, instead of seeing and confessing <b>personal</b> ignorance and <b>fault,</b> as compared with the sense and virtue of others, people see nothing but corruption in human nature, and shelter their own sins under accusation of their race (the worst of all assertions of equality and fraternity). And so they avoid the blessed and strengthening pain of finding out wherein they are fools, as compared with other men, by calling everybody else a fool too; and avoid the pain of discerning their own faults, by vociferously claiming their share in the great capital of original sin.|$|R
40|$|Dan Leahy’s {{career was}} an example of a man devoting his life to prospecting. An Irishman, from 1862 onwards he prospected on several goldfields, first at Coromandel, where he may have been the first to detect gold in Driving Creek. After some years in Otago, he {{returned}} to the North Island to join the Thames rush in 1867, spending a couple of years mining there before returning to Coromandel. From mid- 1869 onwards he prospected in Ohinemuri, despite the opposition of both the government and the Maori landowners. He may have been the first to discover gold at Waitekauri, and after Ohinemuri was opened to mining in 1875 he mined there for a couple of years. Like all true prospectors, he was {{always on the lookout for}} new fields to explore. After prospecting at Waihi in 1878, briefly, he was equally briefly involved in the Te Aroha rush before turning his attention to Karangahake. A later rumour of his attempting to prospect the King Country was false, and in 1890 he returned to Coromandel and prospected there almost until the end of his life, with little success and becoming regarded as a ‘hatter’. Unlike most other prospectors and miners, it is possible to obtain some impressions of his personality, mostly through his excessive drinking, the probable cause of his marriage breaking up. Whatever his <b>personal</b> <b>faults,</b> in the mining community he was much admired...|$|R
