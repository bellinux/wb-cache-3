5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to this type of}} franking privilege, from time to time (especially during wartimes) governments and/or postal administrations also authorize active duty service members and other designated individuals to send mails for free by writing [...] "Free" [...] or [...] "Soldier's Mail" [...] (or equivalent) on the item of mail in lieu of paid <b>postal</b> <b>franking,</b> or by using appropriate free <b>franked</b> <b>postal</b> stationery. In the United States, unless otherwise designated, such mails are serviced by both the military and civil postal systems that accept them as First Class letter mail.|$|R
5000|$|In 1891, he was {{co-owner}} of Krag & Steen which was registered {{under the name}} of Nils A. Krag in 1896. The company was engaged in wholesale trade. Between 1903-04 the company started the production of mechanical products. Artist Karl Uchermann designed the world's first practical franking machine during 1901 in Kristiania. In 1903, Uchermann and Krag received a patent on a <b>postal</b> <b>franking</b> machine.|$|R
2500|$|The Rural District Councils Association was {{immediately}} {{opposed to the}} proposals which would see their members subsumed in much larger authorities. They started a national campaign with the slogan [...] "Don't Vote for R.E. Mote" [...] (with Mr R.E. Mote depicted as an insensitive bureaucrat), distributing material to all their members. The slogan was used on <b>postal</b> <b>franking</b> from the affected authorities. Swale Rural District Council was forced {{to opt out of}} the campaign due to the similarity of [...] "R.E. Mote" [...] with the local Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate R.D. Moate. By coincidence, Moate had moved the motion opposing Redcliffe-Maud at the Conservative Party conference.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to stamps, postage franking {{can be in}} the form of printed or stamped impressions made in an authorized format and applied directly by a franking machine, postage meter, computer generated franking labels or other similar methods ("Postage Evidencing Systems"), any form of preprinted [...] "postage paid" [...] notice authorized by a postal service permit ("Indicia"), or any other marking method accepted by the postal service and specified by its regulations, as proof of the prepayment of the appropriate fees. <b>Postal</b> <b>franking</b> also includes [...] "Postage Due" [...] stamps or markings affixed by a postal service which designate any amount of insufficient or omitted postage fees to be collected on delivery.|$|R
40|$|Typescript by United States District Judge Sarah T. Hughes recounting her {{experiences}} on November 22, 1963, following President John F. Kennedy's assassination in Dallas. Judge Hughes describes the scene aboard Air Force One at Love Field as she administered the presidential {{oath of office}} to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. She concludes by expressing her confidence in President Johnson's character {{and his ability to}} lead the country {{in the aftermath of the}} assassination. In addition to Judge Hughes's narrative, the first page of the typescript serves as a first day of issue cover of a United States postage stamp featuring Lyndon B. Johnson, first authorized for use on August 27, 1973. The <b>postal</b> <b>frank</b> on the first page, below the stamp, reads "AUSTIN, AUG. 27, 1973, TX" and "FIRST DAY OF ISSUE"...|$|R

25|$|In 1955, Israel's first mobile {{post office}} {{began in the}} Negev. By 1990, Israel ran 53 routes for 1,058 locations, {{including}} Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. Due to hyperinflation, in 1982 and 1984 Israel issued non-denominated stamps. During the 1990s, Israel experimented with vending machines for <b>postal</b> labels (<b>franking</b> labels).|$|R
5000|$|Federspiel {{had chosen}} the name Cordova Vineyards with {{a nod to the}} Cordoba Region in Spain, and wanted to {{preserve}} the Cordova name. Glenn Ahlstrom drove down to San Francisco in his old woodie station wagon and physically brought back the first [...] "post box'. The US Postal Service agreed to let them use the name Rancho Cordova as it was just the right size to fit around the circle of the old <b>postal</b> <b>franking</b> stamp. They named the streets for wine grapes. It is a treat to find some of those old grapes coming back into production again, with wines like Malbec and Barbera. In recognition of that heritage, Elliott Homes named all of the streets in the Villages of Zinfandel at Stonecreek for wineries around the world when they began to build {{at the south end of}} Zinfandel in 2000.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s, Israel {{experimented with}} vending {{machines}} for <b>postal</b> labels (<b>franking</b> labels). The Klussendorf machines and their labels were withdrawn from service in 1999. Twenty-two colorful designs were issued, including 12 tourist sites and seven holiday season designs. Israel Post also provides the Express Mail Service {{in cooperation with}} 143 other postal suthorities.|$|R
5|$|Finally, in {{cooperation}} with the US Postal Service, the mission also carried 260,000 <b>postal</b> covers <b>franked</b> with $9.35 express postage stamps, which were to be sold to collectors, with the profits divided between the USPS and NASA. Two storage boxes were attached to the DFI pallet, with more stored in six of the Getaway Special canisters.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{young child}} at The Mount, Darwin avidly {{collected}} animal shells, <b>postal</b> <b>franks,</b> bird's eggs, pebbles and minerals. He was very fond of gardening, an interest his father shared and encouraged, and would follow the family gardener around. Early in 1817, soon after becoming eight years old, he started at the small local school run by a Unitarian minister, the Reverend George Case. At home, Charles learned to ride ponies, shoot and fish. Influenced by his father's fashionable interest in natural history, {{he tried to make}} out the names of plants, and was given by his father two elementary natural history books. [...] Childhood games included inventing and writing out complex secret codes. Charles would tell elaborate stories to his family and friends [...] "for the pure pleasure of attracting attention & surprise", including hoaxes such as pretending to find apples he'd hidden earlier, and what he later called the [...] "monstrous fable" [...] which persuaded his schoolfriend that the colour of primula flowers could be changed by dosing them with special water. However, his father benignly ignored these passing games, and Charles later recounted that he stopped them because no-one paid any attention.|$|R
50|$|During the Federal Republic of Central America with Mexico (1821-1823), no {{important}} {{changes were made}} to the postal system inherited from Spain. When the Central American Federation was proclaimed, Miguel de Ateaga, Spanish postmaster since 1796, was replaced by Antonio Batres y Naxera. The Federation issued its initial postal legislation on August 7, 1823, and the first definitive postal decree on April 24, 1824.This decree stated the following postal rates for a simple letter of less than one-half Onza: 2 (Central American Republic) reales for any destination in Central America, South America, or the Caribbean; and 4 reales for any destination in Spain, the Philippines, the United States, and any other foreign country. The legislation also granted free <b>postal</b> <b>franking</b> for all federation officials, but these wide exemptions from payment were voted out by the Federal Congress in 1826. The Federation continued the route to Oaxaca, having two trips per month from Guatemala City, and added a third trip south to Leon. According to a post office listing of the Central American Federation, El Salvador had the following 'estafetas' in 1830: Ahuachapán, Cojutepeque, Metapán, San Miguel, San Salvador, San Vicente, Santa Ana, Sonsonate, Suchitoto, and Zacatecoluca.|$|R

50|$|While all affixed {{postage stamps}} and other {{markings}} applied to mail to qualify it for <b>postal</b> service is <b>franking,</b> not all types and methods {{are used to}} frank all types or classes of mails. Each of the world's national and other postal administrations establishes and regulates the specific methods and standards of franking as they apply to domestic operations within their own postal systems. Although {{there are differences in}} the manner that the postal systems of the 191 nations that belong to the Universal Postal Union (UPU) apply and regulate the way their mails are franked, most mails fall under one (and sometimes more) of four major types and/or methods of franking: postage (stamps, etc.), privilege, official business, and business reply mail.|$|R
50|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the committee extended to all proposed legislation relating to the carrying of the mails, both foreign and domestic. It included {{the determination of the}} location, construction, and maintenance of post offices and post roads; the acquisition, lease, or transfer of realty or facilities for postal purposes; and certain aspects of the employment and management of postal employees, such as the pay and leave of letter carriers, and the settlement of claims brought by employees or contractors. It included the regulation of the Postal Service, including <b>postal</b> rates, the <b>franking</b> privilege, and the printing of stamped envelopes. At various times the Railway Mail Service, ocean mail service, pneumatic tube service, postal savings banks, postal telegraphy, the Air Mail Service, and Rural Free Delivery were included in its jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the second}} day of the ground war, General Norman Schwarzkopf {{publicly}} expressed frustration over what he characterized as VII Corps' slow pace, allowing elements of the Republican Guard to escape destruction by fleeing toward Basra. Gen Franks ( [...] then a Lt. Gen [...] ) later gave his reasons for the slow pace to a documentary filmmaker. He said that [...] "I was thinking of forty eight hours ahead. I wanted to be in a posture that when we hit the Republican Guard, that we would hit them with a fist massed from an unexpected direction at full speed, and so what I needed to do was get the corps in a posture that would allow this to happen." [...] He also worried about friendly fire in the fluid opening phase of ground operations. In his memoir, Franks criticized Schwarzkopf as a career infantryman who had little feel for the maneuvering of armoured formations and for being a [...] "chateau general" [...] by trying to run the war from a bunker 400 miles to the south in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. [...] General Franks is credited in United States Air Force history in bringing modern day ISR capabilities to the fight. After witnessing a demonstration of JSTARS in exercise Deep Strike in Germany, <b>Franks</b> positive <b>impression</b> led to him raving about the capability to Gen Schwarzkopf. JSTARS proved indispensable in proving the JFACC with real-time intelligence and targeting information on advancing and retreating Iraqi ground Forces.|$|R
5000|$|On August 17, 1972, an {{informant}} who {{was identified as}} Awad [...] "Tony" [...] Khoury telephoned a <b>postal</b> inspector named <b>Frank</b> L. Barbarick to inform him that one Henry Ogle Watson was {{in possession of a}} stolen Bank of America credit card that belonged to a Syed T. Ahmed. Barbarick told the informant to come to his office to inspect the card. When the informant came to his office, he stated to Barbarick that Watson mailed him the card, so that Khoury could purchase him TWA airline tickets with the card. Prior to the case, the informant provided information to the United States Postal Inspection Service 5 to 10 times, all of them being substantiated. These reports also involved Watson. The inspector and informant agreed to set up a sting operation to catch Watson. Upon learning that Watson agreed to send additional cards, the inspector arranged the informant to meet with Watson. A potential meeting was scheduled on August 22, but Watson canceled the appointment. A second meeting took place the day after at a restaurant that was chosen by the informant. The inspector instructed the informant to give a signal to other inspectors if Watson had indeed possessed additional credit cards. Having confirmed that Watson did have additional cards, the informant signaled the inspectors, and they removed him from the restaurant and arrested him. When the inspectors searched Watson's person, no credit cards were found on him. The inspectors then asked Watson if they can search his car, which was near the restaurant, he consented, replying [...] "Go ahead." [...] When the inspector warned him that,"If I find anything, it is going to go against you," [...] Watson replied with the same answer. After finding Watson's car keys, the inspector opened the car door, and found an envelope under the floor mat, containing two credit cards with different names. He was then charged with four counts involving possession of stolen mail.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} ways to obtain the 3 D {{structure}} (depth) of objects, ranging from laser range scanning to binocular stereovison. In order to reconstruct the 3 D tooth model, the current practice is to make an <b>impression.</b> <b>Frank</b> say more here. One can envision the use of volumetric methods, such as CT or MRI scans, to obtain a 3 D model of the teeth. However, the cost of equipment is beyond the consideration of most private clinics and the texture information cannot be preserved. Given the limitation in the state-of-the art, we are motivated to investigate a fast and expensive method utilizing computer vision (CV) techniques. However this is a particularly challenging problem for CV. To the best of our knowledge, there is has been no published method to reconstruct the full 3 D model of all teeth in-vivo. The difficulties include: (a) constrained working space and (b) specular surfaces that makes feature matching very difficult. We propose the following methods to address these difficulties. 1. 1. Hybrid Imaging System. We will design an novel imaging system that can capture both the inside and outside facet of teeth in a single image. As shown in Figure 1, the basic design is to insert a spherical mirror inside the month. An camera will capture directly the front facet, the back facet will be reflected by the spherical mirror and then be captured by the camera. We are certainly not the first who uses mirrors to capture scenes. Nayar first developed the “Sphereo ” system that uses a conventional camera pointing at two spherical mirrors [9]. The scene depth can be triangulated by establishing the correspondences between the two spherical images reflected by the mirrors. This system has the advantages of a very wide field of view using a single imaging sensor. Different types of reflective surfaces, such as ellipsoidal and paraboloidal, have been studied by Nayar’s group and others (e. g. [13, 10, 12, 4, 8, 6]. Most of these approaches are designed to capture scenes from different perspectives so a single image can be used for depth recovery. In our application we would like to design an imaging system that can capture teeth from two extreme perspectives, i. e., the frond and the back, under the limited space within human month. Most related to our design is the radial imaging system by Kuthirummal and Nayar [6]...|$|R
