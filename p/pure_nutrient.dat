The {{analysis of data}} of the agrochemical soil properities in the vegetation of winter rape in a five year period showed if the fertilization system of Zemědělská společnost Chrášťany s. r. o. is set appropriately and where are the eventual reserves. 	The analysis rates between the yield of winter rape and the individual nutrients content in the soil (P, K, Mg, Ca) and pH were calculated {{with the use of}} the analysis of correlation and regression. The same method was used in the evaluation of <b>pure</b> <b>nutrient</b> dosage in the applied fertilizers. The order of importance of the nutrients for the yield was determined according to the value of the coefficient of the correlation between the yield of rape and the examined elements. The examined period was consisted of the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and the analysed area of winter rape reached averagely 190 ha in each year, which was divided into 10 soil blocks. 	The assumption that N fertilizing is going to have a greater influence on the growth of winter rape yield in soils with worse agrochemical soil properties, then on soils with greater nutrient reserve and a satisfactory soil reaction was confirmed. It is influenced by the fact of which nutrient is in minimal quantities in the soil. With the same N dosage the yield was better on soils with better agrochemical properties. The importance of usage of K fertilizers within years 2013 - 2015 is rising. The analysis pointed towards a strong influence of K on the yield especially in those three years. Greater influence of nutrients (P, K, Mg) from the soil reserve on the yield of winter rape was in years 2013 and 2014 with favourable weather than in other years. The recommendation of adjustment of the reserves of nutrients K, Mg and Ca in the soil according to the results of AZZP seems effective...|$|E

Assim a tecnologia ultrassÃnica tem sido aplicada como alternativa nos processos tecnolÃgicos, pois diversos estudos tÃm demonstrado que esta tÃcnica apresenta vantagens sobre o produto processado como biodisponibilidade, emulsificaÃÃo de sucos, auxiliares de secagem, entre outras. Desta maneira, o objetivo deste trabalho foi o estudo do efeito do ultrassom sobre licopeno, vitamina E e algumas vitaminas do complexo B (Tiamina, Niacina e Ãcido pantotÃnico) nestes nutrientes puros como tambÃm em matrizes orgÃnicas como tomate (licopeno) e Abacate (Vitamina E) submetidos a aÃÃo de um sonificador de ponteira em temperaturas controladas de 23, 40 e 60 ÂC e em potÃncias variando de 100 a 500 W. Foi observado que quando se estudou o licopeno e as vitaminas puras, nÃo houve variaÃÃo alguma de perda desses nutrientes em todas as potÃncias estudadas, jÃ quando se partiu para o estudo nas matrizes orgÃnicas (frutos), no tomate, foi notado que em potÃncias menores (100 a 300 W) uma decomposiÃÃo brusca em alguns tempos estudados. A degradaÃÃo do licopeno atravÃs de efeitos indiretos pode ser atribuÃdo, tais como o ataque de vitamina C ou a perda do efeito de enzimas de proteÃÃo de fruta, que podem ser inativados pela aplicaÃÃo de ultrassom. JÃ quando analisamos no abacate Ã notado que nos primeiros minutos hÃ degradaÃÃo na vitamina E dispersa no meio, como tambÃm apÃs 30 minutos hÃ uma liberaÃÃo deste nutriente (aquela ainda ligada Ã estrutura do abacate) maior do que a taxa de degradaÃÃo inicial. Quando se aumentou a temperatura do sistema verificou-se a liberaÃÃo do componente estudado ainda mais rÃpido, tornando esta vitamina disponÃvel, porÃm concluiu-se que a tecnologia ultrassÃnica em si nÃo possuiu influÃncia na degradaÃÃo da vitamina estudada. No caso das vitaminas do complexo B o processo de sonificaÃÃo nÃo comprometeu as vitaminas estudadas em perdas superiores a 30 %, bem como a amostra controle de cada nÃo apresentou perdas desses nutrientes em todas as condiÃÃes estudadas, porÃm o que observamos no conjunto das vitaminas analisadas Ã que a degradaÃÃo que ocorreu veio por conta do aumento de temperatura introduzido ao meio e pouco pela influÃncia ultrassÃnica. Recently, new {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} by the food industry to ensure process safeness, focusing on the maintenance of their nutritional properties. In this context, the ultrasonic technology has been applied as an alternative in technological processes, since several {{studies have shown that}} this technique has a few advantages over the processed product. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the effect of ultrasound on the antioxidant activity of lycopene, vitamin E and some B-vitamins (Thiamin, Niacin and Pantothenic Acid), both in the <b>pure</b> <b>nutrients</b> and in organic matrices, such as tomato (lycopene) and avocado (Vitamin E). They were subjected to the action of a probe sonicator under controlled temperatures of 23, 40 and 60 ÂC and powers ranging from 100 to 500 W. It was observed that when we studied lycopene and vitamins in theirpure forms, some loss of these nutrients were observed for all the studied powers. However, different results were obtained when we studiedthem in organic matrices (fruits). In tomatoes, itwas noted that at lower powers (100 to 300 W) there was an abrupt breakdown at some time points. Lycopene degradation through indirect effects can be assigned such as the attack of vitamin C or the loss of the protective effect of the enzymes present in the fruit, which can be inactivated by ultrasound employment. When we analyzed avocado, it was noted that there was a degradation of the vitamin E dispersed in the mediumin the first minutes, as well as after 30 minutes there is a release of this nutrient (which is still connected to the avocado structure). When the systemtemperature increased, there was aneven faster release of the studied component, making this vitamin available. However, it was found that ultrasonic technology it self does not present any influences on the degradation of vitamin studied. In the case of vitamin B complex, the process of sonication did not compromised the vitamins studied in greater values than 30 % of loss, as well as the control sample showed no loss of any of these nutrients in all the conditions studied. However, it was observed, in all the vitamins analyzed, the degradations occurred mostly due to the increase in the temperature introduced in the medium and least by ultrasonic influence...|$|R
40|$|Ferric, sulfate, and {{hydrogen}} ions are produced from pyritic minerals associated with coal {{as a result}} of autotrophic bacterial metabolism. Water carrying these ions accumulated behind a porous dam composed of wood dust originating at a log-cutting mill. As water seeped through the porous dam, it was enriched in organic nutrients which then supported growth and metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria in the water downstream from the dam. The heterotrophic microflora within and below the sawdust dam included dissimilatory sulfate-reducing anaerobic bacteria which reduce sulfate to sulfide. The sulfide produced caused the chemical reduction of ferric to ferrous ion, and black FeS precipitate was deposited on the pond bottom. A net increase in the pH of the lower pond water was observed when compared to the upper pond water. Microbial activity in the wood dust was demonstrated, and a sequence of cellulose degradation processes was inferred on the basis of sugar accumulation in mixed cultures in the laboratory, ultimately yielding fermentation products which serve as nutrients for sulfate-reducing bacteria. Some of the microorganisms were isolated and characterized. The biochemical and growth characteristics of pure culture isolates were generally consistent with observed reactions in the acidic environment, with the exception of sulfate-reducing bacteria.

This process occurred in heavily inoculated Lowenstein-Jensen medium cultures, which were at least 8 weeks old and were frequently aerated during incubation. With the atypical mycobacteria it occurred more readily in cultures in Kirschner fluid medium than on solid media. When the cultures containing spores were inoculated on nutrient agar plates, endospore-forming, rapidly growing organisms were obtained, which were not acid-fast. These organisms when obtained from independent cultures of the same strain appeared to be identical in bacillary and colonial morphology at their first isolation on nutrient agar, but the organisms from different strains showed variation in these characters. Thus mycobacteria appear able to grow in two different forms: (a) form 1, which is acid-fast and multiplies by fission only; (b) form 2, which is not acid-fast, produces endospores regularly and can be maintained in <b>pure</b> culture on <b>nutrient</b> agar. A series of phases of development of form 2 cells in the cultures of form 1 organisms in serial smear examination of Lowenstein-Jensen medium cultures is described.

The percentage of nitrogen derived from atmospheric N 2 (% Ndfa) was estimated by comparing the natural 15 N abundance ( 15 N, ‰) in guachapele tissues with that of Eucalyptus grandis, a non-nitrogen fixing species, both with seven years after planting. Decomposition constants (k) and litter half-lives (t 1 / 2) were estimated by fitting a single exponential model to litter bag data.
