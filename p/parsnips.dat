5|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>parsnips</b> has potential health benefits. They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in <b>parsnips</b> is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of <b>parsnips</b> {{may help prevent}} constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|In Roman times, <b>parsnips</b> were {{believed}} to be an aphrodisiac. However, <b>parsnips</b> do not typically feature in modern Italian cooking. Instead, they are fed to pigs, particularly those bred to make Parma ham. In traditional Chinese medicine, the root of Chinese parsnip is used as an herbal medicine ingredient.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, some {{authorities}} {{distinguish between}} cultivated and wild versions of <b>parsnips</b> by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter, or even elevating it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris.

40|$|The {{effect of}} wild <b>parsnip</b> on parasitoids of soybean pests in central Iowa was {{examined}} in three components: {{assessment of the}} possible impact of <b>parsnip</b> on nearby crop-pest populations, confirmation of parasitoid visits at <b>parsnip</b> flowers, and assessment of the possible contribution of <b>parsnip</b> flowers to parasitoid longevity. Larval Lepidoptera in 7 soybean fields with <b>parsnip</b> borders and 4 fields without <b>parsnip</b> were sampled during two growing seasons. Green cloverworms (GCW), Plathypena scabra (F.), were 99 % of the caterpillars present in soybeans. GCW populations were 10 - 50 % higher in soybeans without nearby <b>parsnip</b> than in parsnip-bordered soybeans, but statistical anlyses showed no signficant differences between the numbers of insects in the 2 field types. Presence of <b>parsnip</b> had no significant effect on lepidopteran parasitization rates by the parasitoids tested;Yellow sticky traps caught many families of parasitoids in 7 <b>parsnip</b> plots near or distant from soybeans. Most identifiable Diptera were Tachinidae; 7 species were known GCW parasitoids. More of these species were trapped in the GCW outbreak year. More species, and generally larger numbers, of beneficial Diptera were trapped in soybean-associated wild <b>parsnip</b> than in <b>parsnip</b> alone, but the proximity of soybeans did not significantly affect trap catches of Diptera;More parasitic Hymenoptera were caught in soybean-associated wild <b>parsnip.</b> Five species of braconid GCW parasitoids were trapped in very low numbers, with {{no significant differences in}} numbers caught between plot types. Rogas nolophanae Ashmead, the braconid most commonly reared from GCW, was nearly absent on traps. Among the 14 subfamilies of Ichneumonidae trapped, only Vulgichneumon brevicinctor (Say) was known to attack GCW. More than 20 families of Hymenoptera-Parasitica (excluding Ichneumonoidea) were caught, but no species was a known GCW parasitoid. None of the Diptera and Hymenoptera parasitic on GCW differed significantly in abundance between types of <b>parsnip</b> plots;Live, reared adult GCW parasitoids were held in the laboratory in {{the presence or absence of}} wild <b>parsnip</b> flowers. <b>Parsnip</b> presence failed to significantly enhance survivorship in any species tested;These combined results suggest that wild <b>parsnip</b> fulfills a minor role in maintaining GCW parasitoids; thus, weed management practices directed at <b>parsnip</b> near soybeans should not have a significant impact on natural control of GCW populations exerted by parasitoids...|$|R
5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} <b>parsnips.</b> Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, <b>parsnips</b> and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. <b>Parsnips</b> are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E

500|$|<b>Parsnips</b> {{resemble}} {{carrots and}} can be used in similar ways, but they have a sweeter taste, especially when cooked. [...] They can be baked, boiled, pureed, roasted, fried, or steamed. When used in stews, soups, and casseroles, they give a rich flavor. In some cases, <b>parsnips</b> are boiled and the solid portions are removed from the soup or stew, leaving behind a more subtle flavor than the whole root, and starch to thicken the dish. Roast parsnip is considered an essential part of Christmas dinner {{in some parts of the}} English-speaking world and frequently features in the traditional Sunday roast. <b>Parsnips</b> can also be fried or thinly sliced and made into crisps.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the application of different instrumental methods for measuring the hardness of fresh and cooked <b>parsnip.</b> Research was carried out on two previously prepared commercial <b>parsnip</b> samples, both fresh and cooked for 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. Hardness was measured using a TA. XTPlus Texture Analyzer, equipped with different fixtures and load cells. Penetration test was performed on the <b>parsnip</b> discs, while the instrument was equipped with a 5 kg load cell and a 2 mm diameter stainless steel flat cylinder probe. Shearing test was conducted on the whole <b>parsnip</b> roots with a 30 kg load cell and Warner-Bratzler (WB) flat knife blade. The obtained values of the coefficients of variation for both methods indicated that these methods are more suitable for measuring the hardness of fresh <b>parsnip.</b> The results of analysis of variance showed that penetration test generally expressed better differentiation between the samples A and B. The greatest change of firmness during cooking was observed after the first 5 minutes, as measured by both methods. <b>Parsnip</b> firmness progressively decreased with increasing cooking time, with less pronounced differences between the cooking times obtained by shearing test. Further experiments should include more representative <b>parsnip</b> samples and more repetitions within the sample in order to make general conclusions.

The plant's apical meristem produces a rosette of pinnate leaves, each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins. The lower leaves have short stems, the upper ones are stemless, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The leaves are once- or twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins; they grow up to [...] long.|$|E

Agricultural success in the northern colonies came from following the seasons, with consumption of fresh greens only occurring during summer months. In addition to vegetables, {{a large number of}} seasonal fruits were grown. Fruits not eaten in season were often preserved as jam, wet sweetmeats, dried, or cooked into pies that could be frozen during the winter months. Some vegetables originating in the New World, including beans, squashes, and corn, were readily adopted and grown by the European colonists. Pumpkins and gourds grew well in the northern colonies and were often used for fodder for animals in addition to human consumption.|$|E
