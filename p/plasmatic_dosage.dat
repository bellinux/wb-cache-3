30|$|Conclusion Studying {{the effects}} of diverse TLRs {{agonists}} could make the <b>plasmatic</b> <b>dosage</b> of Endocan more specific and helpful to recognize the nature of pathogenic microorganisms in septic shock.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{the heart}} {{expression}} of cytokines showed a significative increase of inflammation and oxidative stress in WT CLP mice compared with PTP 1 B−/− mice. <b>Plasmatic</b> <b>dosage</b> of insulin before and 15  minutes after glucose injection showed {{an elevation of}} insulin concentration in WT CLP mice showing a functional pancreas.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{the heart}} {{expression}} of TNF-a, IL 1 -b, Gp 91 phox, VCAM- 1, ICAM- 1, and CD 45 showed a significative increase of inflammation and oxidative stress in WT CLP mice compared with PTP 1 B-/- mice. <b>Plasmatic</b> <b>dosage</b> of insulin before and 15  min after glucose injection showed {{an elevation of}} insulin concentration in WT CLP mice showing a functional pancreas.|$|E
30|$|The main {{limitation}} was the non-double-blind {{design of}} the trial protocol. Another pharmacologic limit was the absence of <b>plasmatic</b> <b>dosages</b> of colistin. These dosages could preferentially assert our clinical and biological results of the low systemic diffusion of the inhaled route.|$|R
40|$|The {{preoperative}} {{study of}} an ovarian mass, {{with a negative}} <b>dosage</b> of <b>plasmatic</b> BhCG, mainly has the purpose of discriminating between a benign neoplastic mass and a malignant mass. The aim of our work was to evaluate the validity of preoperative screening including a pelvic ultrasound examination and the <b>dosage</b> of some <b>plasmatic</b> tumor markers. This is a retrospective study conducted on 78 patients who were referred to the III Division of the Department of Gynaecological Sciences, Perinatology and Puericulture of Rome University "La Sapienza" from January 1 st 2001 to December 31 st 2001 with a diagnosis of ovarian tumefaction whose origin was still to be determined. These patients underwent both a transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound scan and biochemical examination of serum levels of Ca- 125, Ca 19 - 9 and CEA. Subsequently these patients underwent surgery or medical therapy according to the suspected diagnosis. We then compared our suspected diagnosis with the precise histological diagnosis. Finally, following this comparison, we judged {{the validity of the}} proposed screening. Ultrasound examination is on its own an excellent method for preoperative screening in cases of adnexal tumefactions. However, its association with <b>plasmatic</b> <b>dosages</b> of Ca 125, Ca 19 - 9 and CEA improves the validity of the screening. The use of pelvic scanning, both transabdominal and transvaginal, associated with <b>plasmatic</b> <b>dosages</b> of Ca 125, Ca 19 - 9 and CEA, represents an excellent method of preoperative screening for the evaluation of benign or malignant ovarian tumefactions and for directing the surgeon towards the best therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the lipemic profile of the population of Arroio do Meio, State of Rio Grande do Sul, to identify alterations and to verify its representativity among local population. The group was consisted of 200 (two hundred) persons, male and female, aged over 18 years. The <b>plasmatic</b> lipid lipoproteins <b>dosages</b> were achieved by collecting blood samples, after 12 hours of fast. The plasmatic lipid concentrations were established through laboratory process. A questionnaire was applied to know the profile of the users of the health centers of Arroio do Meio. The statistical analysis of data was obtained by the BIOESTAT 5. 0 software. It was verified that 26, 75 % of people have lipidic profile with atherogenic risk; 37 % have total cholesterol dosages ¿ 200 mg/dL; 14 % HDL ¿ 35 mg/dL; 31 % LDL ¿ 130 mg/dL and 24 % have triglycerides concentrations ¿ 150 mg/dL. Significative differences of total cholesterol occur between both sexes, with major indexes among women, depending on age and weight of the individuals. Associations with changed lipemic profile with sedentariness nature and tabagism were not verified...|$|R
40|$|Background and objective. Castleman’s disease {{represents}} an atypical lymphoproliferative disorder {{characterized by the}} prevalence of B CD 5 -positive cells in the marginal zone. The occurrence of autoimmune manifestations has often been reported,but the associations of Castleman’s disease with systemic autoimmune syndromes has been rarely described. Otherwise, many authors stressed the difficulties in distinguishing between connective tissue disease and Castleman’s disease in most cases. To clarify this issue, we describe a patient and collected from the literature all cases of Castleman’s disease associated to a connective tissue disease. Case report. A 19 years old woman presented with autoimmune thyroiditis and polimyositis. Seven years after the onset she developed a systemic inflammatory flare and a burst of autoimmunity, followed by generalised lymphoadenopathy. A mediastinal lymph node biopsy led to the diagnosis of Castleman disease of the mixed type. Chemotherapy was performed, with rapid response on the lymphoproliferative disorder but with persistence of underlying autoimmune disorder. The <b>plasmatic</b> <b>dosage</b> of B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) was high (13. 3 ng/mL) at diagnosis of Castleman’s disease. It fell down dramatically after chemotherapy (4. 97 ng/mL), even though it remained only just over the mean BLyS value found in healthy blood donors (3. 37 ± 0. 78 - ng/mL). Comment. Castleman’s disease can present autoimmune traits. In our patient, Castleman’s disease complicated {{the course of a}} connective tissue disorder several years after the onset. We hypothesize that the chronic stimulation of B cell clones, particularly CD 5 +, by BLyS could favour the development of both autoimmune diseases and a broad range of lymphoproliferative disorders (such as Castleman’s disease). This is the first report of increased BLyS levels in a patient with Castleman’s disease, supporting a possible pathogenetic role of BLyS in the development of an autoimmune disorder and of a B lymphoproliferative disorder years later...|$|E
