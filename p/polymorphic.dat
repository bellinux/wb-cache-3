5|$|At {{least seven}} species of millipedes in the genera Apheloria and Brachoria (Xystodesmidae) form a Müllerian mimicry {{ring in the}} eastern United States, in which {{unrelated}} <b>polymorphic</b> species converge on similar colour patterns where their range overlaps.|$|E
5|$|The grove Snail (Cepaea nemoralis) is {{regularly}} eaten by the song thrush, and its <b>polymorphic</b> shell patterns {{have been suggested}} as evolutionary responses to reduce predation; however, song thrushes {{may not be the}} only selective force involved.|$|E
5|$|Besides the nucleolus, {{the nucleus}} {{contains}} {{a number of}} other non-membrane-delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, <b>polymorphic</b> interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.|$|E
5|$|In the phlaeothripids {{that feed}} on fungi, males compete {{to protect and}} mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. Males fight by {{flicking}} their rivals away with their abdomen, and may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small males may sneak in to mate while the larger males are busy fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, males are again <b>polymorphic</b> with large and small forms, and probably also compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.|$|E
5|$|RAFA domains, or <b>polymorphic</b> {{interphase}} karyosomal associations, {{were first}} described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, {{though they were}} not thought {{to be associated with}} active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).|$|E
5|$|The jack jumper ant genome is {{contained}} {{on a single}} pair of chromosomes (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number known (indeed possible) for any animal, a number shared with the parasitic roundworm Parascaris equorum univalens. Jack jumper ants are taxonomically discussed as a single biological species in the Myrmecia pilosula species complex. The ant has nine <b>polymorphic</b> loci, which yielded 67 alleles.|$|E
5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called <b>polymorphic.</b> Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic {{study of}} South American Armillaria species {{concluded}} that A.luteobubalina is in a lineage that includes A.montagnei, {{and these are}} sister to a lineage containing A.paulensis, a species known from a single specimen collected in São Paulo, Brazil. Although they are very similar, specimens of A.luteobubalina have smaller spores than Argentinian specimens of A.montagnei, and their distinctness is well-supported with phylogenetic analysis. Based on analysis of pectic enzymes, A.luteobubalina {{is closely related to}} A.limonea, a species found in New Zealand; this result corroborates phylogenetic analyses reported in 2003 and 2006. Molecular analysis of 27 collections of A.luteobubalina from southwest Western Australia and one from Traralgon revealed four distinct <b>polymorphic</b> groups. The genetic variety suggests it is native to Australia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} both South African and South American plants {{were placed in}} this same genus. By {{the early nineteenth century}} Amaryllis had become a <b>polymorphic</b> (diverse) genus with about 50 species from what we would {{consider}} a dozen genera today, and attempts were made to separate it into different genera. This work commenced in 1819 with the contributions of the English botanist, the Revd. William Herbert in Curtis's Botanical Magazine which he expanded in 1821 in The Botanical Register, identifying 14 species of the new genus of Hippeastrum, and only leaving three species in Amaryllis. The rest of the Amaryllis species he transferred to other genera, several of which he created. Herbert further refined his descriptions of Hippeastrum in his work on the Amaryllidaceae in 1837.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{are often}} <b>polymorphic,</b> and many species {{make use of}} camouflage, mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many {{butterflies}} are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.|$|E
5|$|Michael Moorcock {{was one of}} {{the first}} scifi authors to depict {{positive}} portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, The Final Programme, most of the leading characters, including the central 'hero' Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or gratuitous titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock's fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) sexuality is seen as <b>polymorphic</b> and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles.|$|E
25|$|Whether a {{population}} is evolutionarily stable does not relate to its genetic diversity: it can be genetically monomorphic or <b>polymorphic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} is, how can {{the differences}} between social wasp mimics and bumblebee mimics be explained? Evidently if model species are common, and have overlapping distributions, {{they are less likely}} to be <b>polymorphic.</b> Their mimics are widespread and develop a kind of rough and ready jack-of-all-trades mimicry. But if model species are less common and have patchy distribution they develop polymorphism; and their mimics match them more exactly and are <b>polymorphic</b> also. The issues are currently being investigated.|$|E
25|$|Since {{intrusion}} detection can detect signatures of simple shellcodes being sent over the network, {{it is often}} encoded, made self-decrypting or <b>polymorphic</b> to avoid detection.|$|E
25|$|Mercury is an {{offshoot}} of Prolog geared toward software engineering in the large with a static, <b>polymorphic</b> type system, {{as well as a}} mode and determinism system.|$|E
25|$|The {{genes of}} the major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) are highly <b>polymorphic,</b> and this diversity plays {{a very important role}} in resistance to pathogens. This is true for other species as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{heavy and}} light chains of human IgG {{proteins}} {{are expressed in}} structural <b>polymorphic</b> (allotypic) forms. Human IgG allotype {{is one of the}} many factors that can contribute to immunogenicity.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} terms used to {{describe}} lipid phases: lamellar and non-lamellar phases. Lipids can undergo <b>polymorphic</b> or mesomorphic changes leading {{to the formation of}} lamellar or non-lamellar phases.|$|E
25|$|Current {{interpretation}} of the available evidence is that the peppered moth {{is in fact a}} valid example of natural selection and adaptation. It illustrates a <b>polymorphic</b> species maintaining adaptation to a varied and sometimes changing environment.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} with WPW {{experiences}} episodes of atrial fibrillation, the ECG shows a rapid <b>polymorphic</b> wide-complex tachycardia (without torsades de pointes). This combination of atrial fibrillation and WPW is considered dangerous, and most antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|PGH {{also has}} an {{advantage}} over FISH in that FISH is not usually {{able to make the}} differentiation between embryos that possess the balanced form of a chromosomal translocation and those carrying the homologous normal chromosomes. This inability can be seriously harmful to the diagnosis made. PGH can make the distinction that FISH often cannot. PGH does this by using <b>polymorphic</b> markers that are better suited at recognizing translocations. These <b>polymorphic</b> markers are able to distinguish between embryos that carried normal, balanced, and unbalanced translocations. FISH also requires more cell fixation for analysis whereas PGH requires only transfer of cells into polymerase chain reaction tubes. The cell transfer is a simpler method and leaves less room for analysis failure.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} the female is monomorphic, {{mimicking}} {{species of the}} oriental and Australasian danaid genus Euploea. Eastwards H. bolina is frequently <b>polymorphic</b> and most forms are then non-mimetic. In areas where it resembles Euploea the butterfly has usually been designated a Batesian mimic.|$|E
25|$|Bumblebees form Mullerian {{rings of}} species, {{and they do}} often exhibit polymorphism. The {{hoverfly}} species mimicking bumblebees are generally accurate mimics, {{and many of their}} species are <b>polymorphic.</b> Many of the polymorphisms are different between the sexes, for example by the mimicry being limited to one sex only.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} human blood group systems and {{proteins}} in the 1950s suggested that the Andamanese peoples were {{more closely related to}} Oceanic peoples than African pygmy peoples. Genetic studies on Philippine Negritos, based on <b>polymorphic</b> blood enzymes and antigens, showed that they were similar to their surrounding populations.|$|E
25|$|Genes are {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} basic units transferred through an HGT event. However {{it is also possible}} for HGT to occur within genes. For example, {{it has been shown that}} horizontal transfer between closely related species results in more exchange of ORF fragments, a type a transfer called gene conversion, mediated by homologous recombination. The analysis of a group of four Escherichia coli and two Shigella flexneri strains revealed that the sequence stretches common to all six strains contain <b>polymorphic</b> sites, consequences of homologous recombination. Clusters of excess of <b>polymorphic</b> sites can thus be used to detect tracks of DNA recombined with a distant relative. This method of detection is, however, restricted to the sites in common to all analysed sequences, limiting the analysis to a group of closely related organisms.|$|E
25|$|GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant is {{extremely}} rare. In contrast with both Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease, {{in which many}} mutant <b>polymorphic</b> alleles have been discovered, including pseudodeficiency alleles, very few GM2A mutations have been reported. When AB variant is reported, in often occurs with consanguineous parents or in genetically isolated populations.|$|E
25|$|The major use of CE by a {{forensic}} biologist is typing of STR from biological samples {{to generate a}} profile from highly <b>polymorphic</b> genetic markers which differ between individuals. Other emerging uses for CE include the detection of specific mRNA fragments to help identify the biological fluid or tissue origin of {{a forensic}} sample.|$|E
25|$|The <b>polymorphic</b> {{regions in}} each allele {{are located in}} the region for peptide contact. Of all the {{peptides}} that could be displayed by MHC, only a subset will bind strongly enough to any given HLA allele, so by carrying two alleles for each gene, a much larger set of peptides can be presented.|$|E
25|$|Besides, {{measuring}} the methylation (inactivation) {{status of the}} <b>polymorphic</b> human androgen receptor (HUMARA) located on X-chromosome is considered the most accurate method to assess clonality in female cancer biopsies. A great variety of tumors was tested by this method, some, such as renal cell carcinoma, found monoclonal while others (e.g. mesothelioma) were reported polyclonal.|$|E
25|$|Spa locus typing is also {{considered}} a popular technique {{that uses a}} single locus zone in a <b>polymorphic</b> region of S. aureus to distinguish any form of mutations. Although this technique is often inexpensive and less time-consuming, the chance of losing discriminatory power {{makes it hard to}} differentiate between MLST CCs exemplifies a crucial limitation.|$|E
25|$|Carya ovalis {{has also}} been treated as an {{interspecific}} hybrid between C. glabra and C. ovata. C. ovalis was accepted as a <b>polymorphic</b> species especially variable in {{the size and shape}} of its nuts and possibly a hybrid. The relationships may be more complex after a long and reticulate phylogeny, according to detailed chemical analyses of hickory nut oils.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Dobzhansky and his {{coworkers}} collected Drosophila pseudoobscura and D.persimilis from wild populations in California and neighboring states. Using Painter's technique they studied the polytene chromosomes and discovered that the wild populations were <b>polymorphic</b> for chromosomal inversions. All the flies look alike whatever inversions they carry: {{this is an example}} of a cryptic polymorphism.|$|E
25|$|Only certain subsets of swallowtails {{practice}} mimicry. Species {{differ in}} whether {{one or both}} sexes is mimetic, and whether the mimicry is monomorphic or <b>polymorphic.</b> A phenomenon which has received particular attention is female-limited polymorphism, in which only the females of a species are mimetic and <b>polymorphic,</b> often mimicking different, distantly-related aposematic butterflies. This polymorphism is seen in Papilo dardanus, the African swallowtail butterfly, whose females have three different morphs for wing color pattern: a black-and-white pattern for Batesian mimicry, a black-and-yellow pattern that resembles the males of the species, and a pattern with orange patches that resembles the elderly males of the species. Given that the males of the species, which do not have Batesian mimicry, are preyed upon much more frequently by predators than the females, an ongoing question is why females would exhibit the non-mimetic wing pattern, which would seemingly lower their fitness compared to the mimicry form.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} {{debrisoquine}} hydroxylase (named after the drug {{that led to}} its discovery), CYP2D6 is the most well-known and extensively studied CYP gene. It is a gene of great interest also due to its highly <b>polymorphic</b> nature, and involvement in {{a high number of}} medication metabolisms (both as a major and minor pathway). More than 100 CYP2D6 genetic variants have been identified.|$|E
25|$|Object types {{define the}} object {{procedures}} and any data {{specific to the}} object. In this way, the object manager allows Windows NT to be an object-oriented operating system, as object types {{can be thought of}} as <b>polymorphic</b> classes that define objects. Most subsystems, though, with a notable exception in the I/O Manager, rely on the default implementation for all object type procedures.|$|E
25|$|Polymorphisms at the HLA loci, which encode {{proteins}} that participate in antigen presentation, influence {{the course of}} malaria. In West Africa an HLA class I antigen (HLA Bw53) and an HLA class II haplotype (DRB1*13OZ-DQB1*0501) are independently associated with protection against severe malaria. However, HLA correlations vary, depending on the genetic constitution of the <b>polymorphic</b> malaria parasite, which differs in different geographic locations.|$|E
