Significant decreases in plasma levels of progesterone, estradiol- 17 β, and testosterone were also observed in the fish treated with PCB: the plasma levels of progesterone and estradiol- 17 β in female fish were lowered by 56 % and 35 %, respectively, while that of testosterone in male fish was reduced by 53 %. This reduction in circulating sex hormones is probably attributable to the elevated metabolism of these hormones in the liver microsome. As an exception, the plasma level of cortisol was not reduced by PCB treatment. This {{may be due to}} an influence of stress on fish. The ability of PCB to change the plasma levels of steroid hormones raises the possibility that PCB accumulated in fish at high concentrations could have a deleterious effect on fish reproduction.

40|$|Persistent polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) metabolites were studied {{with respect to}} their interaction with the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR). 3 -Methylsulphonyl- 2, 5, 6, 2 ', 4 ', 5 '-hexachiorobiphenyl (3 -MeSOr-CB 149) was shown to compete with 3 H-dexametbasone for binding to the GR, with an IC 50 (concentration that inhibits 50 %) of approately 1 pM. Using GRAF cells expressing human GR, glucocorticoid responsive element, and a reporter enzyme, we demonstrated that 3 -MeSO 2 -CB 149 fimctionally acts as an antagonist at the GR (IC 50 m 2. 7 pM). In accordance with the receptor binding, the anagoniism mainly appeared to be of a competitive nature. When studying the competitive binding of 24 methylsulfonyl PCBs (relative to dezamethasone) to GR from mouse liver cyrosol, seven compounds had a higher affinity to GR than 3 -MeSO 2 -CBI 49. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the presence of three chlorine atonms in the ortho-position and chlorine and methyl sulfone groups on either end of the molecule (4 and 4 '-position) inased the affinity to GR. The relevce of this finding for human health is not known, but PCB methyl suifones are ubiquitous pollutants present in mother's milk.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a {{class of}} 209 {{synthetic}} compounds (con-geners), in which 1 – 10 chlorine atoms are attached to biphenyl in different com-binations. PCBs are non-volatile, although low-chlorinated congeners have a much higher vapour pressure than high-chlorinated. All PCBs are lipophilic and some are very persistent. For environmental reasons, PCB production and use is nowadays banned or restricted worldwide. PCBs were produced as mixtures with very dif-ferent compositions, consisting of ~ 70 – 100 congeners with dioxin-like PCBs as minor constituents. They were used e. g. as hydraulic oils, as cooling liquids in electrical equipment and in building materials including elastic sealants. Food of animal origin (e. g. fatty fish) is {{the main source of}} environmental PCB exposure. Occupational exposure to PCBs may occur e. g. during renovation work and handling of waste but also in PCB-contaminated buildings such as schools and offices. Limited data indicate that occupationally exposed in the Nordic countries have slightly elevated total PCB plasma/serum levels as compared to pre-exposure values or to control groups. The increase compared to controls may at least in part be due to historical occupational exposure. The total PCB levels in workers are still within the range of those measured in the general population during the last two decades. The plasma/serum concentrations of certain PCB congeners can be used as markers of occupational exposure. As total PCB plasma/serum levels in occupationally exposed seem {{to be in the same}} range as those of the general population, their health risks are presumably similar. Studies on the general population suggest that PCB mixtures may slightly affect sperm motility and possibly contribute to an increased risk for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In offspring, PCB exposure may contribute to subtle developmental changes including neurobehavioural effects (e. g. on cognition), effects on im-mune system, and, possibly, birth weight. Yet, co-exposure to other pollutants hampers interpretation of the data. Many of the effects seen in humans have also been reported in animals. The effects of PCB mixtures in animals occurring at the lowest dose levels (5 – 7. 5 μg/ kg bw/day) are effects on reproduction (resorptions/foetal death) and development (e. g. neurobehavioural effects), immune system, skin/nails and eyelids. Thyroid effects and effects on male fertility have been reported at higher doses, and cancer only at much higher doses. Many of the effects have been attributed primarily to dioxin-like congeners. The most potent dioxin-like PCB congener, PCB 126, has been classified by IARC as a human carcinogen based on animal and mechanistic data. Some data suggest that the non-dioxin-like PCB congeners are important for the neurobehavioural effects in offspring.

The OH-PCB binds in the estrogen binding site with the position of the first phenolic ring in an orientation similar to the phenolic ring of 17 β-estradiol. Interestingly, the OH-PCB does not bind in a planar conformation, but rather with a 30 -degree twist between the phenyl rings. The crystal structure of hEST with the OH-PCB bound gives physical evidence that certain OH-PCBs can mimic binding of estrogenic compounds in biological systems.

However, this problem can turn into a serious one if the pollutant is a POP, even for small concentrations in the WWTP effluent, due to their known high bioaccumulation capacity in biota and sediments.
