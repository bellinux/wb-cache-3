There were other features dedicated to the long-range function; there were two parallel oil filter circuits, allowing one filter to be removed and cleaned while the other remained in operation. The aircraft was even equipped with a pneumatic bed for a reserve pilot.

40|$|Microarray {{technology}} {{permit us}} to study the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. The technique has {{a wide range of}} applications including identification of genes that change their expression in cells due to disease or drug stimuli. The dissertation is addressing statistical methods for the selection of differentially expressed genes in two experimental conditions. We propose two different methods for the selection of differentially expressed genes. The first method is a classical approach, where we consider a common distribution for the summary measure of equally expressed genes. To estimate this common <b>distribution,</b> the Johnson <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> is used. The advantage <b>of</b> using Johnson <b>system</b> is that, there is no need of a parametric assumption for gene expression data. In contrast to other classical methods, in the proposed method, there is a sharing of information across the genes by the assumption <b>of</b> a common <b>distribution</b> for the summary measure of equally expressed genes. The second method is the gene selection using a mixture model approach and Baye 2 ̆ 7 s theorem. This approach also uses the Johnson <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> for the estimation <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> summary measure. Johnson <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> has the flexibility of covering a wide variety of distributional shapes. This system provides a unique distribution corresponding to each pair of mathematically possible values of skewness and kurtosis. The significant flexibility <b>of</b> Johnson <b>system</b> is very useful in characterizing the complicated data set like microarray data. In this dissertation we propose a novel algorithm for the estimation of the four parameters <b>of</b> the Johnson <b>system...</b>|$|R
