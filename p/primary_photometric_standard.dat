In {{preparation}} for James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), {{a set of}} cross calibration programs with HST and Spitzer for suitable <b>primary</b> <b>photometric</b> <b>standards</b> and astrometric fields were developed.

40|$|Stars {{appearing}} in CCD images obtained over 224 nights {{during the course}} of 69 observing runs have been calibrated to the Johnson/Kron-Cousins BVRI photometric system defined by the equatorial standards of Landolt (1992, AJ, 104, 340). More than 15, 000 stars suitable for use as <b>photometric</b> <b>standards</b> have been identified, where "suitable" means that the star has been observed five or more times during photometric conditions and has a standard error of the mean magnitude less than 0. 02 mag in {{at least two of the}} four bandpasses, and shows no significant evidence of intrinsic variability. Many of these stars are in the same fields as Landolt's equatorial standards or Graham's (1982, PASP, 94, 244) southern E-region standards, but are considerably fainter. This enhances the value of those fields for the calibration of photometry obtained with large telescopes. Other standards have been defined in fields containing popular objects of astrophysical interest, such as star clusters and famous galaxies, extending Landolt-system calibrators to declinations far from the equator and to stars of sub-Solar chemical abundances. I intend to continue to improve and enlarge this set of <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> stars as more observing runs are reduced. The full current database of photometric indices is being made freely available via a site on the World-Wide Web, or by direct request to the author.

Typically this correction is done by observing the object(s) of interest through multiple filters and also observing a number of <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> stars.

40|$|Evidence is {{building}} that remnants of solar systems might orbit {{a large percentage}} of white dwarfs, as the polluted atmospheres of DAZ and DBZ white dwarfs indicate the very recent accretion of metal-rich material. (Zuckerman et al. 2010). Some of these polluted white dwarfs are found to have large mid-infrared excesses from close-in debris disks that are thought to be reservoirs for the metal accretion. These systems are coined DAZd white dwarfs (von Hippel et al. 2007). Here we investigate the claims of Bonnet-Bidaud & Pantin (2008) that Sirius B, the nearest white dwarf to the Sun, might have an infrared excess from a dusty debris disk. Sirius B's companion, Sirius A is commonly observed as a mid-infrared <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> in the Southern hemisphere. We combine several years of Gemini/T-ReCS <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> observations to produce deep mid-infrared imaging in five ~ 10 micron filters (broad N + 4 narrowband), which reveal the presence of Sirius B. Our photometry is consistent with the expected photospheric emission such that we constrain any mid-infrared excess to < 10 % of the photosphere. Thus we conclude that Sirius B does not have a large dusty disk, as seen in DAZd white dwarfs. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, accepted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|Observations of {{celestial}} phenomena {{need to be}} calibrated, to be related, to some measurable quantity. There {{continues to be a}} long-term need for accurate <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> stars, those with known intensities and colors, so that brightness and color measurements made of various celestial phenomena by different observers can be integrated and compared with one another. Toward this end, the author has been emphasizing data collection in recent years for stars of 'intermediate' brightness, those approximately in the magnitude range 11. 5 is less than V is less than 16. 0. Photoelectric data were obtained at the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory's (CTIO) telescopes for stars in certain selected areas near the celestial equator. Stars of extreme color outside the selected areas, but near the equator, also were selected to provide a more broad and complete range in color index. It was proposed to complete the photoelectric phase of the program. The author proposed developing extremely faint sequences of <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> stars useful for both large space-based detectors and for land-based detectors. These data were to be collected via charge-coupled devices (CCD's) at telescopes located at CTIO and at the Las Campanas Observatory (LCO), both observatories being located in Chile.

40|$|ESO's two FOcal Reducer and low {{dispersion}} Spectrographs (FORS) {{are the primary}} imaging cameras for the VLT. Since they are not direct-imaging cameras, the accuracy of photometry which can routinely be obtained is limited by signicant sky concentration and other eects. <b>Photometric</b> <b>standard</b> observations are routinely obtained by ESO, and nightly zero points are computed mainly {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the in-strument performance. The accuracy of these zero points is about 10 %. Recently, we have started a program to investigate, if and how percent-level absolute photometric accuracy with FORS can be achieved. The main results of this project are presented in this paper. We rst discuss the quality of the at elds and how it can be improved. We then use data with improved at-elding to investigate the usefulness of for FORS calibration and the accuracy which can be achieved. The main ndings of the FORS Absolute Photometry Project program are as follows. There are signicant dierences between the sky ats and the true photometric response of the instrument which partially depend on the rotator angle. A second order correction to the sky at signicantly improves the relative photometry within the eld. Percent level photometric accuracy can be achieved with FORS 1. To achieve this accuracy, observers need to invest some of the assigned science time for imaging of <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> elds in addition to the routine nightly photometric calibration. 1...|$|R

40|$|All {{available}} {{observations of}} <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> stars obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at Gemini North {{in the period}} from August 2001 to December 2003 {{have been used to}} establish the calibrations for photometry obtained with the instrument. The calibrations presented in this paper are based on significantly more <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> star observations than usually used by the individual users. Nightly photometric zero points as well as color terms are determined. The color terms are expected to be valid for all observations taken prior to UT 2004 November 21 at which time the Gemini North primary mirror was coated with silver instead of aluminum. While the nightly zero points are accurate to 0. 02 mag or better (random errors), the accuracy of the calibrations is limited by systematic errors from so-called "sky concentration", an effect seen in all focal reducer instruments. We conclude that an accuracy of 0. 035 to 0. 05 mag can be achieved by using calibrations derived in this paper. The color terms are strongest for very red objects, e. g. for objects with (r'-z') = 3. 0 the resulting z' magnitudes will be ~ 0. 35 mag too bright if the color term is ignored. The calibrations are of importance to the large Gemini user community with data obtained prior to UT 2004 November 21, as well as future users of achive data from this period in time.
