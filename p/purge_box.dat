40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) has {{conducted}} research {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of purging of mine refuge alternatives (RAs). Two questions were addressed experimentally: (1) Does the current generation of mobile refuge alternatives meet the requirements of 30 CFR 4 27 7. 508 (c) (2) which requires RAs to be capable of purging the internal atmosphere from 400 ppm of carbon monoxide (CO) to 25 ppm? (2) What is the relationship between the concentration of noxious gases in the mine atmosphere external to the refuge alternative and the concentration that will be present inside the refuge alternative following entry of miners but prior to purging? The goal of the second question was to evaluate the appropriateness of the 400 -ppm criterion, given that ambient post-accident mine concentrations of CO can be in the thousands of ppm. A tent-type and a rigid steel mobile refuge alternative were used to investigate the first question. Carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) were used as contaminant gases as part of this study, and the individual experiments were conducted with the purging area of the RA occupied by zero, one, or seven simulated (when CO was used) or live (when SF 6 was used) occupants. To investigate the second question, the aforementioned RAs were used along with a third airlock constructed for and employed in the experiments. The volume and size of the entry door into the constructed airlock were roughly in the middle of the range of values for the rigid and tent-type RAs. The RAs and constructed airlock were placed in a large sealed reverberation room, and SF 6 gas was released into the reverberation room as a surrogate for CO. Experiments were conducted to determine the gas concentrations inside the airlock after groups of test subjects (representing miners) had entered [...] " [...] NIOSHTIC- 2 [URL] summary [...] Intoduction [...] Background on carbon monoxide toxicity [...] Mini <b>purge</b> <b>box</b> experiments [...] Refuge alternative airlock purging with carbon monoxide [...] Airlock purging with sulfur hexafluoride [...] Airlock contamination research [...] Discussion and recommendations [...] Acknowledgements [...] References [...] Appendix A: Diffusion and tracer gases [...] Appendix B: Protocol for airlock contamination research.

40|$|Spectroscopic {{ellipsometry}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} important tools for thin film metrology. It is now intensively used in microelectronics and especially for the microlithographic applications. Instrumentation for the next generation of UV lithography at 157 nm requires special optical setup since oxygen and water are extremely absorbing below l 9 Onm. The ellipsometer discussed in this paper works into a <b>purged</b> glove <b>box</b> to reduce the oxygen and water contamination in the part per million range. The optical setup has been especially studied for microlithographic applications with a premonochromator in the polariser arm to avoid resist photobleaching. Technical details of the system and measurements results on substrates and thin films are reported hereafter. Results are compared to those obtained with more standard ellipsometers and correlated to other results obtained with grazing x-ray reflectance technique...|$|R
40|$|Spectroscopic {{ellipsometry}} {{has long}} been recognized as the technique ofchoice to characterize thin films and multilayers. Instrumentation {{for the next generation}} of UV lithography at 1 57 nm requires special optical set-up since 02 and H 20 are extremely absorbing below l 9 Onm. The new system works into a <b>purged</b> glove <b>box</b> to reduce the oxygen and water contamination in the part per million range. The optical set-up includes a premonochromator in the polarizer arm to avoid photo bleaching. The system works in rotating analyser configuration to minimize the parasitic polarisations. Ellipsometric and photometric measurement versus wavelength from 145 up to 630 nm and angle of incidence can be performed. The proposed paper will present in details the new system with some first experimental results in the field ofmicro lithography. Results are compared to those obtained with more standard UV ellipsometers and correlated to other measurements obtained with grazing x-ray reflectance technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of the Varestraint test were applied to the evaluation of refractory metal alloys. This required development of a special test apparatus employing a modest specimen size for improved economy and compatible with the high purity inert atmosphere required for welding these alloys. Minimum specimen size is desirable {{because of the high}} cost of these alloys and also to permit timely testing of limited production developmental alloys. The Varestraint apparatus satisfies these requirements by providing a timely and economic test for hot crack sensitivity. This test can be used both for alloy development and production surveillance. The test apparatus was designed for use in vacuum <b>purged</b> dry <b>boxes</b> and is completely compatible with high purity inert atmosphere. Augmented strain can be varied continuously from 1 / 4 % thru 4 %. In addition to varying the augmented strain, the primary Varestraint variable, the effect on hot cracking of varying other weld parameters such as unit weld length heat input have also been studied. Test reproducibility, in terms of bending or strain rate, was demonstrated using high speed photography...|$|R
40|$|A need arose {{to define}} the hazards {{associated}} with the operation of a process. The process involved {{the evolution of a}} hydrogen gas stream from thermal decomposition of uranium hydride at approximately 400 C into the interior of a <b>purged</b> argon-filled glove <b>box.</b> Specific hazards of interest included the potential reaction severity of the evolved hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen, either downstream in the vent system or inside the box in the event of serious air inleakage. Another hazard might be the energetic reaction of inleaked air with the hot uranium and uranium hydride powder bed, possibly resulting in the dispersion of powders into an air atmosphere and the rapid combustion of the powders. This was approached as a problem in calculational simulation. Given the parameters associated with the process and the properties of the glove box system, certain scenarios were defined and the potential for flammable or detonation reactions estimated. Calculation tools included a comprehensive fluid dynamics code, a spreadsheet, a curve-fitting program, an equation solver, and a thermochemistry software package. Results are reported which suggest that the process can be operated without significant hazard to operators or significant damage to equipment, assuming that operators take account of potential upset scenarios...|$|R
