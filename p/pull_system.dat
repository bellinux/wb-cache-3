Pull means that the production system authorizes production based on inventory level; push means that production occurs based on demand (forecasted or present, that is purchase orders). An individual production system can be both push and pull; for example activities before the CODP may work under a <b>pull</b> <b>system,</b> while activities after the CODP may work under a push system.|$|E

This limited {{the size of}} the brakes, and the four-piston calipers used by Nissan were not competitive. After the rules [...] changed to allow 17-inch wheels, the GT-R V-spec (for Victory) emerged in February 1993 wearing 17" [...] BBS mesh wheels (225/50/17) covering larger Brembo calipers. The clutch actuation changed from a push to a <b>pull</b> <b>system</b> and the car had a standard mechanical rear differential (the electronic rear differential did not show up until the R33 V-Spec). A year later, the V-Spec II appeared with a new sticker and wider tires (245/4517).|$|E
5000|$|Dynamic <b>pull</b> <b>system</b> [...] is an {{advanced}} version of <b>pull</b> <b>system</b> which encompasses the best feature of traditional <b>pull</b> <b>system</b> & MRP. The major disadvantage of traditional kanban {{system is the}} fixed kanban size and requirement of at least 2 bins for full operation. In the event of sudden demand decrease, kanban system can result in extra inventory {{and the value of}} unused inventory can go up to 2 bin size.Similarly, In case of unexpected demand increasing, it can result in line down and the issue will be severe if the lead times are not short.Dynamic <b>pull</b> <b>system</b> overcomes this issue by recalculating the bucket size (kanban size/lot size) before creating any supply (requisitions/purchase order/work order). Each time a new supply is created, system automatically decides the best supply size as per the existing actual demand.|$|E

40|$|In {{just-in-time}} (JIT) production systems, {{there is}} both input {{stock in the}} form of parts and output stock {{in the form of}} product at each stage. These activities are controlled by production-ordering and withdrawal kanbans. This paper discusses a discrete-time optimal control problem in a multistage JIT-based production and distribution system with stochastic demand and capacity, developed to minimize the expected total cost per unit of time. The problem can be formulated as an undiscounted Markov decision process (UMDP); however, the curse of dimensionality makes it very difficult to find an exact solution. The author proposes a new neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) algorithm, the simulation-based modified policy iteration method (SBMPIM), to solve the optimal control problem. The existing NDP algorithms and SBMPIM are numerically compared with a traditional UMDP algorithm for a single-stage JIT production system. It is shown that all NDP algorithms except the SBMPIM fail to converge to an optimal control. Additionally, a new algorithm for finding the optimal parameters of <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> is proposed. Numerical comparisons between near-optimal controls computed using the SBMPIM and optimized <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> are conducted for three-stage JIT-based production and distribution systems. UMDPs with 42 million states are solved using the SBMPIM. The <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> discussed are the kanban, base stock, CONWIP, hybrid and extended kanban.

40|$|Production {{systems such}} as the CONWIP (constant work-in-process) <b>pull</b> {{production}} <b>system</b> have been widely studied by researchers to date. The CONWIP <b>pull</b> production <b>system</b> is an alternative to pure push and pure <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> that lowers and controls inventory levels and reduces production lead time. In this study, a CONWIP <b>pull</b> production <b>system</b> was simulated {{in place of the}} current push production system at a food packaging company. ARENA 12. 0 simulation software was used and a production system with two dedicated production lines was proposed to reduce the current system's complexity. A method for obtaining the optimum CONWIP level was determined. Various advantages of the CONWIP <b>pull</b> production <b>system</b> were analyzed and it was found that besides a reduction in planning complexity, the proposed two dedicated lines with CONWIP <b>pull</b> production <b>system</b> can also help the company to greatly reduce their total WIP and achieve inventory holding costs savings of over S$ 38, 000 per month. In addition, the total customer lead time can also be reduced from 12 days to 10 days while still meeting customer demand. by Jean Jingying Liu. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{description}} of an internship project at an aerospace parts distribution company. The goal {{of the project was}} to reduce inventory by applying a <b>pull</b> ordering <b>system</b> to the distributor's value chain. The thesis provides background on the theory of "push " vs. "pull " systems, and a discussion of how <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> can reduce inventory while maintaining or improving service level. Typically, <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> are applied to situations of relatively frequent and constant demand. Using a model developed for the internship company, we demonstrate that a two-bin kanban refill system can be applied to reduce inventory by 50 - 60 %, even given a situation of volatile demand. We describe the pilot project (currently in progress) intended to prove out the kanban system's performance, including the team composition, implementation plan, and perceived barriers to implementation. In conclusion, we reflect on the project's results and presen...|$|R

30|$|A {{final point}} of {{consideration}} is {{with regards to}} data collection. This pertains to the directionality of the communication channel.

Since efficient analytical models for performance evaluation studies of these systems are unavailable, we use simulation experiments for the study. In particular, we investigate the impact of several PICS design parameters such as kanban card limits, target finished goods inventory levels, amount of demand information available, {{and the quality of}} ADI on performance measures such as system throughput, inventory holding costs and customer service levels. Our study shows that in many situations, integrating ADI with <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> provides opportunities for efficiencies that might be significantly greater that that available using <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> alone. Further more, we show that the performance of systems operating under pull-type PICS with ADI could be fairly robust to the quality of information being shared. ...|$|R

30|$|For {{practical}} purposes, please {{also note}} that a bottleneck does not necessarily {{have to be in}} a production process itself.

30|$|In <b>pull</b> <b>systems,</b> a {{relatively}} small inventory of every item necessary is held between processes in so-called kanban stock points (sometimes {{also referred to as}} “supermarkets”).

50|$|CONWIP (CONstant work in process) are pull-oriented {{production}} control systems. Such {{systems can be}} classified as pull and push systems (Spearman et al. 1990).

50|$|Push systems differ markedly.

50|$|Pull (also {{known as}} demand) systems are {{themselves}} {{closely related to}} the aforementioned flow concept. They contrast with push or supply systems.

That initial request in turn triggers a subsequent request (for example, a query to a database to confirm product availability), which in turn triggers additional requests (input of the customer’s credit card information, credit verification, processing of the order by the accounts department, issuance of a shipping request, replenishment through the supply-chain management system, and so on).|$|E

40|$|Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is an {{approach}} {{to the development of}} reactive systems which provides a pure functional interface, but which may be implemented as an abstraction of an imperative event-driven layer. FRP systems typically provide a model of behaviours (total time-indexed values, implemented as <b>pull</b> <b>systems)</b> and event sources (partial time-indexed values, implemented as push systems). In this paper, we investigate a type system for event-driven FRP programs which provide liveness guarantees, that is every input event is guaranteed to generate an output event. We show that FRP can be implemented on top of a model of sets and relations, and that the isomorphism between event sources and behaviours corresponds to the isomorphism between relations and set-valued functions. We then implement sets and relations using a model of continuations using the usual double-negation CPS transform. The implementation of behaviours as <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> based on futures, and of event sources as push systems based on the observer pattern, thus arises from first principles.
