40|$|A {{model of}} the effects of air {{temperature}} on bud dormancy release was developed on the basis of experimental results with two-year-old seedlings of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies and a study of previous models. Bud dormancy is generally released when buds are exposed first to chilling temperatures (e. g. - 5 degrees C to 10 degrees C) and then to forcing temperatures (e. g. > 0 degrees C). Seedlings from a central and a northern Finnish provenance of Pinus sylvestris, and from a central Finnish provenance of Picea abies, were raised in <b>paper</b> <b>pots</b> in a mixture of peat and sand, and grown outside. At {{the end of the second}} growing season, the seedlings were transferred to dark growth chambers and subjected to chilling conditions. In one experiment the chilling took place outside. The seedlings were then subjected to forcing temperatures (12 - 22 degrees C) in growth chambers. Bud burst was said to have occurred if the total growth of the terminal bud exceeded 5 mm. Behaviour of the Finnish material differed from that predicted by models based on studies of more southerly provenances. The new model is described, and further model development outlined...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to tell the story of the {{evolution}} of knowledge exchange (KE) activity within a department in a university in the north west of England and to understand this activity through the lens of actor-network theory. Design/methodology/approach – Applying the sociology of translation to one qualitative interview shows how different actors were enrolled and mobilized into a KE actor-network. The process of translation consists of four stages, problematisation, enrolment, interessement and mobilisation of allies which have been applied to the data to tell the story of the KE actor-network. This is a cross-disciplinary approach using a theoretical framework from sociology and applying it to a management/organizational context. Findings – This framework brings fresh ways of looking at the importance of KE networks within universities. Although limited to one interview, the methodology allows for an in-depth reading of the data and shows how resilient and flexible this actor-network is to withstand and respond appropriately to shifts in policy and subsequent provisions for small- and medium-sized enterprise business support. Originality/value – Building from one case, the paper concludes that this account adds to an historical understanding of how universities become involved with KE activities. The inclusion of non-human actors allows for a deeper understanding of the actor-network and shows the importance of actors such as White <b>Papers,</b> <b>pots</b> of funding and physical buildings to the role of KE within higher education...|$|R

40|$|This <b>paper</b> {{presents}} <b>Pot,</b> {{a system}} that leverages the concept of preordered transactions to achieve deterministic multithreaded execution of programs that use Transactional Memory. Preordered transactions eliminate {{the root cause of}} nondeterminism in transactional execution: they provide the illusion of executing in a deterministic serial order, unlike traditional transactions which appear to execute in a nondeterministic order that can change from execution to execution. Pot uses a new concurrency control protocol that exploits the serialization order to distinguish between fast and speculative transaction execution modes in order to mitigate the overhead of imposing a deterministic order. We build two Pot prototypes: one using STM and another using off-the-shelf HTM. To the best of our knowledge, Pot enables deterministic execution of programs using off-the-shelf HTM for the first time. An experimental evaluation shows that Pot achieves deterministic execution of TM programs with low overhead, sometimes even outperforming nondeterministic executions, and clearly outperforming the state of the art.

The Handless Maiden is a relatively obscure fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm which {{tells the story of}} a young girl who, when betrayed and maimed by her family, takes off into the forest to find her own pathway in the world.

My paper, Curious Maidens, investigates the relationship between the fairy tale, The Handless Maiden, the process of plant dyeing, and the art work to have emerged from my studio research, Curious Maidens (series 1 - 19). The paper identifies the notion of wonderment and curiosity as playing central and dynamic roles within each of these three elements. This emotive link, and the nature of curiosity within fairy tales in general, is explored through an investigation of American artist Kiki Smith’s sculpture Daughter, 1999 and substantiated by the theories by Bruno Bettleheim, Marina Warner and Jack Zipes.

Minimum germination percentage (30. 0 %), germination index (2. 01), germination energy (36. 3), seedling length (3. 3 cm), seedling biomass (10 mg) and seedling vigor index (99. 0) of maize were observed in leaf extract followed by fruit and whole plant extracts of parthenium growing near the field border. Rhizospheric soil collected underneath parthenium growing near a water channel caused maximum reductions in germination index (30. 8 %), germination energy (40. 6 %), seedling length (32. 6 %), seedling biomass (35. 1 %) and seedling vigor index (34. 3 %) of maize compared with that soil without any vegetation. Phytotoxic inhibitory effects of both parthenium plant and rhizospheric soil were more pronounced on maize root than its shoot growth. The higher suppressive action against germination and seedling growth of maize was probably due to higher total phenolic concentrations (6678. 2 and 2549. 0 mg L- 1) and presence of phenolic compounds viz., gallic, caffeic, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy benzoic, p-coumaric and m-coumaric acids; and ferulic, vanillic, syringic and m-coumaric acids in aqueous leaf extract of parthenium uprooted near the field border and its rhizospheric soil collected near a water channel, respectively...|$|R

A few species may do as well without nitrates; cabbage plants grown in peat pots were slightly better than those in clay pots even without nitrates. Wood veneer bands were superior to paper bands except where sodium nitrate solution was applied to the plants in the paper bands. Nitrate applications given too freely and too often may result in producing plants with soft, succulent growth.
