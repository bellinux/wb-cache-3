40|$|Little {{is known}} on which credit {{instruments}} early modern entrepreneurs used to fund and manage their enterprises. By using {{the city of}} Enkhuizen as a case study, this thesis demonstrates that seventeenth-century entrepreneurs used a range of different techniques for this end. Generally, it shows the all-important use of credit in early modern trade. <b>Privately</b> <b>contracted</b> <b>loans</b> and supplier credit {{formed the basis of}} early modern funding, especially for small-scale entrepreneurs. The inherent need for credit caused by early modern trade caused entrepreneurs to resort to the local credit market. On this market also creditors had a lot of different investments options. As a result entrepreneurs had to compete with all other types of securities offered on this market. In Enkhuizen, especially securities of Holland and bonds issued by the local chamber of the VOC at times dominated the financial market. Moreover, this thesis demonstrates that even a large company such as the VOC needed to resort to different credit instruments to solve its liquidity needs. Although the local chamber of the VOC was at first anxious to resort to the local credit market, it started to borrow heavily from 1615, and gradually a consolidated debt arose...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} explores a {{new model}} of staff well-being across UK police custodial services (public and private). These services are unique for the fact that police sergeant custody officers are supported by detention officers who can be publicly or <b>privately</b> <b>contracted,</b> with the latter providing a heterogeneous mix never previously researched. The model informs a survey approach conducted across four English police forces. Drawing on a diverse literature which compares health and criminal justice professions, this study explores the possibility that private sector detention officers will report lower levels of emotional exhaustion and workplace stress and higher levels of personal accomplishment than their public sector counterparts. Multilevel analyses, supplemented by ANOVA and t tests, detected statistically significant differences for private sector detention officers regarding higher levels of emotional exhaustion and lower levels of personal accomplishment and workplace stress (with the stress result {{the only one in the}} predicted direction). However, results should be interpreted as sample specific linked to <b>privately</b> <b>contracted</b> detention officer disquiet with their then employer (since replaced). That said, the results provide a good exploration of the model's utility together with important lessons for model and survey development in the future...|$|R
