5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service <b>propulsion</b> <b>engine</b> was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008 NASA {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with the Ad Astra Rocket Company which may result in the testing on the ISS of a VASIMR plasma <b>propulsion</b> <b>engine.</b> This technology could allow station-keeping to be done more economically than at present.|$|E
25|$|Since the Rolls-Royce RB162 lift engines {{specified}} for the Mirage IIIV {{were not}} expected to be available before 1963, Dassault modified the first Mirage III prototype to serve as an interim VTOL testbed. Eight Rolls-Royce RB108 lift engines were installed, each with an average maximum takeoff thrust of 9.83kN (2,210lbf). The Mirage III's SNECMA Atar G.2 <b>propulsion</b> <b>engine</b> was replaced with an unreheated (non-afterburning) Bristol Siddeley Orpheus BOr 3 with a thrust of 21.57kN (4,850lbf). The lift engines were grouped in tandem pairs around the aircraft's center of gravity {{on either side of the}} propulsion engine's intake duct, with each pair in a row separated by the main undercarriage wheelbays.|$|E

500|$|On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed {{behind the}} Moon and fired its service <b>propulsion</b> <b>engine</b> to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing {{site in the}} {{southern}} Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) about [...] southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E). The landing site was selected {{in part because it}} had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers along with the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extravehicular activity (EVA) challenges.|$|E
500|$|A {{cylindrical}} Service Module (SM) {{supported the}} Command Module, with a service <b>propulsion</b> <b>engine</b> and an RCS with propellants, and {{a fuel cell}} power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants. A high-gain S-band antenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights. On the extended lunar missions, an orbital scientific instrument package was carried. The Service Module was discarded just before re-entry. The module was [...] long and [...] in diameter. The initial lunar flight version weighed approximately [...] fully fueled, while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over [...]|$|E
2500|$|Torpedoes {{consist of}} several {{subsystems}}, and those subsystems evolved over time. Torpedoes are also tailored for their application. Submarine torpedoes, {{such as the}} Mark 14, are constrained by {{the dimensions of the}} submarine's torpedo tubes: 21inches in diameter and a certain maximum length. Submarines are expected to close with their targets, so the torpedoes do not need a long range. In contrast, torpedoes fired by destroyers need greater range because their approach would be under fire from their targets. Improvements in the <b>propulsion</b> <b>engine</b> power output allowed the Mark 14 to have a top speed of 46 knots compared to the Mark 10 Mod 0's 30 knots. Steering is controlled by a gyroscope; the gyro on the Mark 10 Mod 0 was spun up in the torpedo tube and was not powered after launch; the gyro on the Mark 14 was continuously powered by its air flask. The depth control on the Mark 10 was slow [...] the depth would not stabilize quickly; the Mark 14 depth stabilization was improved.|$|E
