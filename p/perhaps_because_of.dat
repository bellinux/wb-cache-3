5|$|Around this time, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the great}} and {{definitive}} works from Cairano, the Sanmicheli left Brescia, never to return. In Casale Monferrato, Bartolomeo died two years later. Matteo, who started alongside his father, continued and ended his career in Piedmont, near Turin, where he left many of his better known works.|$|E
5|$|Karamokho Alfa's {{maternal}} {{cousin was}} Maka Jiba, {{the ruler of}} Bundu, and both men studied in Fugumba under the famous scholar Tierno Samba. However, there are no records of Bundu participation in the Futa Jallon jihad, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the internal troubles in Bundu at that time, or perhaps because Maka Jiba was not greatly interested in the cause.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle {{has demonstrated}} compassion and empathy {{for victims of}} domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has {{a soft spot for}} animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the modest}} {{commercial}} {{success of this}} album, and <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the habit of distancing themselves musically from their most recent work, Tennant and Lowe have since returned to their dance roots. One year {{after the release of}} Release, Pet Shop Boys released Disco 3 which included remixes of some of the songs from Release along with new material that they were working on at the time of writing/producing material for Release.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song vary considerably. British {{versions}} of this rhyme differ significantly, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> the allusions in the rhyme were unknown to British children at the time. Common versions include: ...|$|R
50|$|The Commission {{considered}} {{the establishment of}} new waterfowl refuges. While <b>perhaps</b> unimportant <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Great Depression, the act was an important step for the conservation movement.|$|R
5|$|The Synod of Whitby, which {{debated whether}} the Northumbrian church should follow the Roman or the Celtic method of dating Easter, {{was held in}} 664. Deusdedit {{does not appear to}} have been present, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> an {{outbreak}} of the plague prevalent in England at the time.|$|E
5|$|The set was Haydn's first {{complete}} set of quartets since the Opus 33 set of 1781. While the Opus 33 set was apt for broad public consumption, the Opus 50 set is more serious and experimental. It is <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Opus 50's intellectual character that other sets among Haydn's mature quartets have received more attention from performers.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and {{he received a}} command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, {{he was an old}} man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E
50|$|Fox later {{discontinued}} {{the use of}} {{the term}} on its telecasts. This may have been done to save face among the critics of this practice, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> few <b>of</b> the leaders were non-Sprint Cup Series drivers anymore.|$|R
5000|$|Kendall dismisses his own {{cinematic}} work, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> several <b>of</b> {{his films}} were quota quickies, with the remark that he [...] "commenced film career 1931, and {{has appeared in}} innumerable pictures". But Halliwell notes that his films included: ...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the death}} of his namesake Nicholas, Bishop of Dunblane (and former Abbot of Arbroath), Nicholas de Balmyle was among the canons of Dunblane with the {{responsibility}} of selecting a successor. Bishop Nicholas had died sometime between 1306 (after his last attestation on 26 January) and late 1307. The election was done by compromissarii (a short-list of canons delegated to perform election), with John, Abbot of Arbroath excluded from the vote, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his known pro-English tendencies.|$|E
5|$|In 1254 or 1255, Henry III {{received}} an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his ‘Chronica Majora’. A wooden structure {{was built to}} house the elephant, 12.2m (40ft) long by 6.1m (20ft) wide. The animal died in 1258, possibly because it was given red wine, but also <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the cold climate of England.|$|E
5|$|In spite or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{his role}} in these nuclear tests, Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
50|$|In American English, {{the term}} has evolved to {{describe}} the final event of a sporting season, e.g. in soccer or motocross, <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the popularity of these with television viewers.|$|R

25|$|In spite <b>of</b> (or <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>of)</b> {{the fact}} the two men did not get along, the {{combined}} influence of King and General Douglas MacArthur increased the allocation of resources to the Pacific War.|$|R
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil. Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci may have seen it {{on a visit to}} Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably Holocene age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the large}} income the Abbot was sustaining, Bishop Alnwick {{appears to have}} not taken strong {{measures}} against the Abbot's indiscretions. He ordered {{that the number of}} canons should be increased to 30 and the number of boys in the almonry increased to 16. The Bishop also ordered proper accounts to be kept and forbade the abbot from granting favours without the permission of both the Bishop and the Canons.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{incendiary}} devices had {{decreased by}} the 14th century, {{perhaps due to}} the economic realities of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were undamaged. Moreover, fewer wooden engines and structures were employed in the battlefield after the late 13th century, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the prior success of the incendiary weapons at destroying them.|$|E
50|$|The {{novel was}} not reprinted until 1965. In the 20th century it {{received}} new critical attention, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> the notion <b>of</b> lastness {{had become more}} relevant.|$|R

50|$|The {{motif of}} a dying deity appears within the mythology of diverse {{cultures}} - <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> attributes <b>of</b> deities were derived from everyday experiences, and the ensuing conflicts often included death. These examples range from Baldr in Norse mythology to the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl in Aztec mythology to the Japanese Izanami.|$|R
5|$|Thwarted in the east, Attalus {{now turned}} his {{attention}} westward. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> concern for the ambitions of Philip V of Macedon, Attalus had sometime before 219BC become allied with Philip's enemies the Aetolian League, a union of Greek states in Aetolia in central Greece, having funded the fortification of Elaeus, an Aetolian stronghold in Calydonia, {{near the mouth of}} the river Acheloos.|$|E
5|$|Tournaments and hastiludes {{began in}} the 11th century as both a sport and to provide {{training}} for battle. Usually taking {{the form of a}} melee, the participants used the horses, armour and weapons of war. The sport of jousting grew out of the tournament and, by the 15th century, the art of tilting became quite sophisticated. In the process, the pageantry and specialization became less war-like, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the knight's changing role in war.|$|E
5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stopped and}} laughed. [...] "It's nine years since I've seen it, but I can't get those lines {{out of my}} head. <b>Perhaps</b> it's <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the girl who sang them. Somehow, I felt sorry for her. She had remarkably fine eyes." ...|$|R
50|$|According to this scenario, Agathocleia and Straton I only {{managed to}} {{maintain}} {{themselves in the}} eastern parts of the kingdom, Punjab and at times Gandhara. Paropamisadae and Pushkalavati were taken over by Zoilos I, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> some <b>of</b> Agathocleia's subjects may {{have been reluctant to}} accept an infant king with a queen regent.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, English and German are {{compared}} historically {{along with other}} Indo-Euro-pean languages (henceforth IE languages), focusing on their alignment changes. English and German are often compared, e. g. Hawkins (1986), but alignment is surprisingly not mentioned. This absence is <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> all <b>of</b> the modern IE languages have one typ...|$|R
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert. It is thought that Sir John was a {{descendant}} of either Matthew or Hildebert. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the distance to the}} parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a lack of time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E
6000|$|... "Why? Well, {{perhaps for}} hate's sake, for Sinan does not rule by love; <b>perhaps</b> <b>because,</b> being <b>of</b> a wild blood, I {{am willing to}} set my life at hazard, who care not if I win or die; <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> you saved me from the lioness. What is it to you, Sir Godwin, why a certain woman-spy of the Assassins, whom in your own land you would spit on, chooses to do this or that?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Suppression of {{formulas}} that {{introduce the}} direct {{dialogue with the}} purpose of making the narration more agile, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> some passages <b>of</b> Spanish cantares de gesta were semi-enacted (thereof also its greater realism).|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic review {{awarded the}} album 3 stars, stating: [...] "In {{contrast}} to the hard-edged and aggressive Afro-funk that Kuti and his Africa 70 became synonymous with, both the A-side title track and B-side, 'Colonial Mentality,' are seemingly staid, in light -- or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> -- <b>of</b> the cruel state-sponsored attacks {{that he and his}} extended family suffered." ...|$|R
