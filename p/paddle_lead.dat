40|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} is {{an established}} and safe technique {{for the treatment}} of medically refractory and chronic pain. Electrodes or paddle leads can be used for stimulation. Most complications reported are related to hardware insertion, and the devices are otherwise usually well tolerated. There have been several reports of epidural fibrosis formation around the leads with varying degrees of spinal cord compression, but no descriptions of the technical treatment of these lesions, or of patient outcome after surgery. We describe the interesting case of an 85 -year-old woman with a thoracic spinal cord stimulator implanted 8  years prior to presenting with a 5 -month history of bilateral lower extremity weakness, and myelopathic signs on exam, as well as intractable thoracic pain. Her CT Myelogram revealed significant epidural fibrosis around her thoracic <b>paddle</b> <b>lead</b> with compression of her spinal cord. After surgical removal of the lead and the surrounding fibrosis, she recovered her lower extremity function and her thoracic pain improved. This is an uncommon complication of spinal cord stimulator lead or paddle placement, but can carry a clinically significant impact. Unusual fibrotic scar formation around paddle or percutaneous leads should be suspected in patients experiencing worsening axial pain with decreasing relief from their spinal cord stimulator, especially in the context of progressive myelopathic symptoms...|$|E

For counterclockwise <b>paddles,</b> the <b>lead</b> begins with the usual back left, together right, step left, hold. During the step hold the lead starts turning. The lead then turns with a step right - step left - step right - step left. The lead continues turning with this pattern, until he changes to another variation. Clockwise paddles begin by starting with the hold on counts 7-8. From a pure-bal point of view, a paddle is just two steps turning either left or right.|$|R

Some were built with paddle clutches that disengage one or both paddles so they can turn independently. However, wisdom gained from early experience with sidewheelers deemed that they be operated with clutches out, or as solid shaft vessels. Crews noticed that as ships approached the dock, passengers moved {{to the side of}} the ship ready to disembark. The shift in weight, added to independent movements of the <b>paddles,</b> could <b>lead</b> to imbalance and potential capsizing.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{surgical}} therapy of Parkinson’s disease has been considerably revalued and electrical stimulation techniques have taken the place of neurolesive techniques. Surgical therapy objective is not a direct solution of the illness cause but to control the symptoms responsible for serious daily life limitations. Electrical stimulation techniques actually used in PD are Deep Brain Stimulation [1] and Motor Cortex Stimulation [2] Advantages of such techniques in comparison with neurolesive techniques are reversibility and adaptability. Deep Brain Stimulation is indicated for patients with PD in which symptoms are not controlled by the pharmacological therapy or that suffer from L-Dopa serious collateral effects. Stimulation system determines high frequency stimulation of anatomic-target structure of motor circuit with consequent functional block. Implanted system is formed by lead and pulse generator. Lead can be stereotactly implanted, monolateral or bilateral, at level of: a) Subthalamic Nucleus for all predominant illness symptom control (tremor, rigidity and akinesia) and L-dopa induced dyskinesias; b) Internal Globus Pallidum for {{the control of the}} rigidity and of the dyskinesias, c) VIM Thalamus Nucleus for the exclusive control of tremor. Motor Cortex Stimulation is a technique alternative to DBS indicated in advanced-complicated PD in cases of exclusion from DBS or of its ineffectiveness. <b>Paddle</b> <b>lead</b> is installed with neuronavigation system in epidural or subdural space beyond the motor area, controlaterally to the side where parkinsonian symptoms are prevailing. Stimulation effects are bilateral and stimulation is made with low frequency. Deep Brain Stimulation allows importing benefits suppressing PD symptoms, extending periods in which patient recovers normal and adequate functionality, reducing collateral effects induced by L-Dopa, improving quality of life and decreasing drugs intake. Despite the still limited experience, Motor cortex stimulation is effective in a special way on axial symptoms and also on cognitive performances and autonomic signs...|$|E
40|$|Summary of the thesis: Computer {{modeling}} of neuromodulation {{in the management}} of chronic pain by: Ljubomir Manola Neuromodulation is an important and frequent therapy applied, among others, {{in the management of}} chronic pain. Neuromodulation is defined as â€œa therapeutic alteration of activity in the central, peripheral or autonomic nervous systems, electrically or pharmacologically, by means of implanted devicesï¿½ï¿½?. It encompasses a focal, minimal invasive and reversible approach. Due to its invasive character with some more risks than other modalities of pain treatment, neuromodulation is generally applied as the last option when all other therapies have failed. The overall success rate of this treatment modality is about 50 %. It is often the only modality that may help a particular patient. However, there are still many chronic pain patients in whom neuromodulation was attempted with suboptimal or even less than satisfactory results. For the sake of this pool of patients it is an imperative to understand the effects occurring during a neuromodulation therapy and to design stimulation {{in such a way that}} a larger number of patients can be treated, while giving them an improved satisfaction with the therapy. This thesis is focused on spinal cord and motor cortex stimulation therapies for chronic, otherwise intractable pain management. The influence of various stimulation and volume conductor parameters on the neural response was investigated by means of realistic computer models. In Chapter 1 neuromodulation is presented as one of the treatment modalities for the management of various chronic pain syndromes. Further, the clinical methods named spinal cord stimulation and motor cortex stimulation are introduced. Details are given on working hypotheses (when existing), main indications, surgical procedures and technical aspects, difficulties and challenges encountered in the therapies. The chapter is completed by introducing the computer model as an invaluable tool to mimic/simulate the biophysical effects of neurostimulation. The technical performance of two different lead types commonly used in the clinical practice of spinal cord stimulation, the paddle (or surgical) lead and the percutaneous lead has been modeled and evaluated in Chapter 2. In addition to the thickness of the dorsal cerebrospinal fluid and the lead distance from the dura mater, the contact spacing on the lead was identified as the most important parameter influencing the performance. Despite a similar contact spacing and technical performance, a superior clinical performance of paddle leads was observed in clinical practice. This superiority is most likely attributable to the larger volume of a paddle and a consequent ventral displacement of the dura mater. The secure fixation of the paddle in close contact with the dura mater is most likely an additional factor determining the superior clinical performance as discussed in the chapter. In Chapter 3 the technical performance of percutaneous leads for spinal cord stimulation having various contact spacings is modeled and compared. While reducing the contact spacing the recruitment of dorsal column fibers is increased, though with larger energy expenditure. The effect on the recruitment of dorsal root fibers is opposite. Modelling predicts that a displacement of the lead dorsally or laterally in the dorsal epidural space results in a reduction of the ratio of dorsal root and dorsal column fiber thresholds and thereby in less paresthesia coverage (when the stimulus is just at the discomfort threshold). When two leads are connected in parallel modelling predicts that dorsal column recruitment is reduced. This prediction has recently been confirmed empirically. Owing to technical advances the concept of electrical field steering has recently emerged in spinal cord stimulation. A method to electronically shift the electrical field rostrocaudally along the spinal cord, resulting in predictable changes in the population of recruited sensory nerve fibres and thus the position of paresthesia is described in Chapter 4. It is predicted that a smaller contact spacing allows a better control of the stimulation field. This may be crucial in the treatment of pain syndromes such as chronic low-back pain, as discussed in this chapter. In Chapter 5, the first model of electrical stimulation of human motor cortex is introduced. The region of the precentral gyrus and surrounding sulci with an electrode array (<b>paddle</b> <b>lead)</b> on the overlying dura mater represents the core of the modelâ€™s volume conductor. A simple fiber model was taken from the spinal cord stimulation model and used to assess the neural response to the stimulation induced field. It was predicted that the thickness of the cerebrospinal fluid layer underneath the active contact influences the stimulation threshold considerably. In addition, nerve fibers oriented perpendicular to an anode above the cortical surface could be activated at a low amplitude. As a consequence, an anode cannot be considered an indifferent contact in motor cortex stimulation, contrary to common belief. A refined and extended model of motor cortex stimulation is described in Chapter 6. When the myelinated axon model was extended with a frustrum and another cylindrical membrane structure, representing a pyramidal cell and its apical dendrite, respectively, the stimulation threshold was generally reduced. By changing the polarity and/or position of the stimulating contact array, stimulation thresholds of pyramidal cells varied and the population of recruited cells was changed as well. The model predictions have been shown to be qualitatively in accordance with empirical data from the literature. Finally, the thesis is completed in Chapter 7 with a discussion of the most prominent effects in spinal cord and motor cortex stimulation that have been analyzed by computer modeling. In addition, recommendations for future theoretical and empirical studies are proposed...|$|E

6000|$|According to the people, {{beyond the}} small upper fall where {{projections}} {{shut out the}} view, the channel smoothens for a short space and carries canoes. Native travellers from Nkulu usually take the mountain-path cutting across an easterly bend of the bed to Banza Menzi, the Manzy of Tuckey's text and the Menzi Macooloo of his map. It is situated on a level platform 9 miles north of Nkulu, and they find the stream still violent. The second march is to Banza Ninga, by the First Expedition called [...] "Inga," [...] an indirect line of five hours = 15 miles. The third, of about the same distance, makes Banza Mavunda where, 20 to 24 miles above the Yellala, Tuckey found the river once more navigable, clear {{in the middle and}} flowing at the rate of two miles an hour--a retardation evidently caused by the rapids beyond: I have remarked this effect in the Brazilian [...] "Cachoeiras."[FN#32] Above it the Nzadi widens, and canoeing is practicable with portages at the two Sangallas. The southern feature, double like the Yellala, shows an upper and a lower break, separated by two miles, the rapids being formed as usual by sunken ledges of rock. Two days' <b>paddling</b> <b>lead</b> to the northern or highest Sangalla, which obstructs the stream for 22 miles: Tuckey (p. 184) makes his Songo Sangalla contain three rapids; Prof. Smith, whose topography is painfully vague, doubles the number, {{at the same time he}} makes Sanga Jalala (p. 327) the [...] "uppermost fall but one and the highest." [...] Finally, at Nsundi (on the map Soondy N'sanga), which was reached on Sept. 9, a picturesque sandy cove at the opening of a creek behind along projecting point, begins a lake- like river, three miles broad, with fine open country on both banks: the explorer describes it as [...] "beautiful scenery equal to anything on the banks of the Thames." ...|$|R

These lesions frequently cause chronic pain and are conventionally treated with surgical resection and medication. In cases where conventional treatments have failed, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) {{could be considered}} as a potential option for pain relief. The objective of this case was to determine if SCS may have a role in treating pain secondary to neoplastic lesions from HMO. Case presentation: We report a 65 -year-old female who previously received both surgical and pharmacological interventions for treating HMO neoplastic pain in the lumbar, pelvis, femur, and tibial regions. These interventions either failed to offer significant pain relief or caused excessive lethargy. A SCS trial was then offered with a dual 16 -contact lead trial leading to 70 %– 80 % improvement in pain from baseline and 85 % reduction in oxycodone IR intake. This was followed by permanent implantation of two 2 × 8 contact <b>paddle</b> <b>leads</b> (T 7 –T 8 and T 9 –T 10 interspaces). After 8 -week follow-up, settings were further optimized resulting in an additional 30 % improvement in pain compared to last visit. At 6 -month follow-up, the patient reported continued pain relief. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the first successful use of SCS to treat both HMO and nonmalignant neoplastic-related pain. The patient reported pain improvement from baseline, reduced pain medication requirements, and subjective improvement in quality of life. Additionally, this case demonstrates the potential advantage of trialing multiple painful areas with a 16 -contact lead in order to avoid multiple trials and placement.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} work in {{the field}} of distributed exertion games, which are controlled by moving the body. People play these games together while being located at different places in the world. The novel contribution of this paper is the introduction of distributed team play in which both collocated and distributed players participate. In our Distributed Interactive Pong Playground (DIPP) players bounce a ball towards a goal by moving, walking, and running around in a 5. 3 by 5. 3 meter interactive playground. We investigate whether we can increase coordination in movement between players by changing the game to enforce teamwork. This was done by letting the players in a team control one end each of a shared paddle, as opposed to both players having separate paddles. Although the results should be taken with care, the comparisons do indicate that we could steer the amount of coordination between players in this way. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of distributed team play on the level of coordination. The results indicate that coordination goes down if the teammate is at another location. In this distributed team setting, enforced team work through a connected <b>paddle</b> still <b>leads</b> to a higher level of measured coordination. In contrast, our current analysis of self-reported social presence did not show a clear difference, not favoring enforced team work nor a particular team distribution. With the DIPP and this study we provide a new direction for distributed exertion games with a focus on aspects of team play...|$|R
60|$|It was now {{necessary}} to reload the canoes. This {{was done in}} the course of the day, and every arrangement was made, so as to be ready for a start as soon as the darkness set in. Everybody was glad to move, though all were aware of the extent of the hazard they ran. The females, in particular, felt their hearts beat, as each, in her husband's canoe, issued out of the cover into the open river. Pigeonswing took the <b>lead,</b> <b>paddling</b> with a slow, but steady sweep of his arm, and keeping as close as was convenient to one bank. By adopting this precaution, he effectually concealed the canoes from the eyes of all on that side of the river, unless they stood directly on its margin, and had the aid of the shadows to help conceal them from any who might happen to be on the other. In this way, then, the party proceeded, passing the site of the hut, and the grove of Openings around it, undetected. As the river necessarily flowed through the lowest land, its banks were wooded much of the way, which afforded great protection to the fugitives; and this so much the more because these woods often grew in swamps where the scouts would not be likely to resort.|$|R
25|$|Napoleon left Boulogne on 27 August, {{bound for}} Aachen {{to visit the}} tomb of Charlemagne, and to see his wife Joséphine. The army {{remained}} encamped outside Boulogne and the British were initially suspicious that his departure was a ruse, {{and that he would}} double back unexpectedly to take command of the army and launch the invasion. In the meantime the frigate HMS Immortalite was sent under the command of Captain Edward Owen to carry out surveys along the French coast around the port. Fulton subsequently pronounced his inventions ready, and an assault was planned for early October. Working at Portsmouth Dockyard Fulton had built several types of craft and explosive devices. The 'torpedo-catamaran' was a coffer-like device balanced on two wooden floats and steered by a man with a <b>paddle.</b> Weighted with <b>lead</b> so as to ride low in the water, the operator was further disguised by wearing dark clothes and a black cap. His task was to approach the French ship, hook the torpedo to the anchor cable and, having activated the device by removing a pin, remove the paddles and escape before the torpedo detonated. Also to be deployed were large numbers of casks filled with gunpowder, ballast and combustible balls. They would float in on the tide and on washing up against an enemy's hull, explode. Also included in the force were several fireships, carrying 40 barrels of gunpowder and rigged to explode by a clockwork mechanism.|$|R
