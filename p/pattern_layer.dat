40|$|Abstract—The {{two most}} {{important}} abilities for a robot {{to survive in a}} given environment are selecting and learning the most appropriate actions in a given situation. Historically, they have also been the biggest problems in robotics. To help solve this problem, we propose a two-layered action selection mechanism (ASM) which designates an action <b>pattern</b> <b>layer</b> and a reactive behavior plan layer. In the reactive behavior plan layer, a task is selected by comparing behavior motiva-tion values that, in an animal, correspond to external stimuli as well as internal states due to hormones. After a task is selected, its corresponding reactive behavior plan is executed as a set of sequential dynamic behavior motivations (DBMs), each of which is associated with an action pattern. In the action <b>pattern</b> <b>layer,</b> each action pattern can be functionally decomposed into primitive motor actions. Shortest Path-based Q-Learning (SPQL) is incorporated into both the reactive behavior plan and action pattern layers. In the reactive behavior plan layer, relationships between perceptions and action patterns are learned to satisfy a given motivation, as well as the relative priorities of these relationships. In the action <b>pattern</b> <b>layer,</b> the relations between sensory states and primitive motor actions can be learned. To establish the validity of our proposed ASM, experiments with our real designed robot will be illustrated together with simulations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} used models for classification tasks is the Probabilistic Neural Network. Several improvements of the Probabilistic Neural Network have been proposed such as the Evolutionary Probabilistic Neural Network that employs the Particle Swarm Optimization stochastic algorithm for the proper selection of its spread (smoothing) parameters and the prior probabilities. To further improve its performance, a fuzzy class membership function has been incorporated for the weighting of its <b>pattern</b> <b>layer</b> neurons. For each neuron of the <b>pattern</b> <b>layer,</b> a fuzzy class membership weight is computed and it is multiplied to its output in order to magnify or decrease the neuron’s signal when applicable. Moreover, a novel scheme for multi–class problems is proposed since the fuzzy membership function can be incorporated only in binary classification tasks.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This work {{shows that}} the zone casting- a method for the {{solution}} casting based fabrication of oriented anisotropic layers of organic materials- can also be applied to fabrication of <b>patterned</b> <b>layers.</b> In this method, solution is continuously supplied onto the substrate withdrawn at a controlled rate and the solvent evaporates {{from the surface of}} meniscus formed between a flat nozzle and the substrate. Due to the presence of the gradient of the solute concentration, its solidification proceeds within the narrow zone localized in the meniscus. In this way solute molecules can be self-assembled at surfaces into different anisotropic nanostructures (columns, rods, lamellae or crystals) uniaxially aligned parallel to the substrate. Under some conditions various phenomena like e. g. dewetting, fingering instability, stick-slip motion etc come into play leading to various periodic interruptions in the film deposition. Examples of continuous and <b>patterned</b> <b>layers</b> of different materials such as low molecular weight (semi) conductors, chromophores, discotic molecules and block copolymers, which can successfully be processed using this technique, are shown.

40|$|If the {{training}} dataset {{is not very}} large, image recognition is usually implemented with the transfer learning methods. In these methods the features are extracted using a deep convolutional neural network, which was preliminarily trained with an external very-large dataset. In this paper we consider the nonparametric classification of extracted feature vectors with the probabilistic neural network (PNN). The number of neurons at the <b>pattern</b> <b>layer</b> of the PNN {{is equal to the}} database size, which causes the low recognition performance and high memory space complexity of this network. We propose to overcome these drawbacks by replacing the exponential activation function in the Gaussian Parzen kernel to the complex exponential functions in the Fejér kernel. We demonstrate that in this case it is possible to implement the network with the number of neurons in the <b>pattern</b> <b>layer</b> proportional to the cubic root of the database size. Thus, the proposed modification of the PNN makes it possible to significantly decrease runtime and memory complexities without loosing its main advantages, namely, extremely fast training procedure and the convergence to the optimal Bayesian decision. An experimental study in visual object category classification and unconstrained face recognition with contemporary deep neural networks have shown, that our approach obtains very efficient and rather accurate decisions for the small training sample in comparison with the well-known classifiers.
