40|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{similarities}} of broken-line heating curves and heat-penetration curves obtained when a product undergoes a drop in rotational speed during thermal processing in a rotary water cascading retort, a semiempirical method used for handling broken-line heating behaviour is suggested {{as a method of}} dealing with this type of process deviation. For this purpose, the possibility of extrapolating the empirical heating rate parameter f(h), determined on the heat-penetration curve of white beans in brine processed in a still retort to the 'still' conditions associated with a rotational speed drop in a rotary water cascading retort, was investigated. Following this approach, safe product temperature predictions were obtained. The main criterion influencing the quality of the evalution was the determination of the correct empirical <b>parametric</b> <b>value</b> to be used. This means when determining this <b>parametric</b> <b>value,</b> care is required when selecting the correct temperature interval on the heat-penetration curve.

50|$|Using the {{scientific}} method of falsification, the probability value that the sample statistic is sufficiently different from the null-model than {{can be explained by}} chance alone is given prior to the test. Most statisticians set the prior probability value at 0.05 or 0.1, which means if the sample statistics diverge from the parametric model more than 5 (or 10) times out of 100, then the discrepancy is unlikely to be explained by chance alone and the null-hypothesis is rejected. Statistical models provide exact outcomes of the parametric and estimates of the sample statistics. Hence, the burden of proof rests in the sample statistics that provide estimates of a statistical model. Statistical models contain the mathematical proof of the <b>parametric</b> <b>values</b> and their probability distributions.|$|E
50|$|Essynth is a {{mathematical}} model for interactive sound synthesis based on the evolutionary computation which uses genetic operators and fitness functions to create sound. In Essynth, digitally sampled sounds (waveforms) are represented as individuals within a population set that describes an evolutionary path along time in generation steps. Here the evolution is given by the population’s adaptation to another set of individuals, called here as the Target Set, which conveys all psychoacoustic features that steers the population evolution. This process is somehow similar to the “evolution pressure” that dictates the adaptation of populations in biological systems. The “best individual” within the population is the one most similar to the Target set. Unlike others deterministic sound synthesis methods such as the linear methods (i.e. additive synthesis), the non-linear (i.e. frequency modulation synthesis) and the sample-based methods (i.e. sample-based synthesis) Essynth is a non-deterministic method of sound synthesis once that its resulting sound is not fixed for the same <b>parametric</b> <b>values</b> but continuously evolves along time.|$|E

50|$|A {{term used}} in government-binding theory for a {{specification}} {{of the types}} of variation that a principle of grammar manifests among different languages. It is suggested that there are no rules of grammar in the traditional sense, but only principles which can take a slightly different form in different languages. For example, a head parameter specifies the positions of heads within phrases (e.g. head-first in English, head-last in Japanese). The adjacency parameter of case theory specifies whether case assigners must be adjacent to their noun phrases (e.g. to the left in English, to the right in Chinese). The pro-drop (or ‘null subject’) parameter determines whether the subject of a clause can be suppressed. Determining the <b>parametric</b> <b>values</b> for given languages is known as parameter-setting. The overall approach has been called the principles and parameters theory (PPT) of universal grammar, and has since come to be applied outside of syntactic contexts, notably in characterizing phonological relations. Later versions of metrical phonology, for example, recognize a series of parameters governing the way metrical feet should be represented, such as quantity sensitivity and directionality.|$|E
