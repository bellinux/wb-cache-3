2500|$|The third {{discourse}} in Matthew 13 (1-53) provides several <b>parables</b> for <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Heaven {{and is often}} called the Parabolic Discourse. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> this discourse, in [...] takes place outside when Jesus leaves a house and sits near the Lake to address the disciples as well as <b>the</b> multitudes <b>of</b> people who have gathered to hear him.

25|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ten Virgins, Prodigal Son, and Good Samaritan, {{it was one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{frequently}} illustrated parables in medieval art, perhaps because of its vivid account of an afterlife.|$|R

25|$|In the New Testament, Jesus {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of Christians forgiving or showing mercy towards others. Jesus used the <b>parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unmerciful servant (Matthew 18:21-35) to say that we should forgive without limits. <b>Parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prodigal Son is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God's forgiveness for his people.|$|E

25|$|In addition, some Christian {{authors have}} argued that this typological {{interpretation}} finds its origin in the speech of Saint Stephen in Acts , {{as well as the}} Gospel of Luke and the parables of Jesus, noting strong verbal and conceptual collocation between the Greek translation of the portion of Genesis concerning Joseph and the <b>Parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wicked Tenants and the <b>Parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prodigal Son.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} gospel {{passages}} warn against sin and suggest {{a path of}} righteousness to avoid <b>the</b> judgement <b>of</b> God. For instance, the Sermon on the Mount in [...] teaches <b>the</b> avoidance <b>of</b> sin and <b>the</b> <b>Parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom (...) state that at <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> judgement <b>the</b> angels will [...] "sever the wicked from among the righteous and shall cast them into <b>the</b> furnace <b>of</b> fire". Christians can thus enjoy forgiveness that lifts them from <b>the</b> judgement <b>of</b> God by following <b>the</b> teachings <b>of</b> Jesus and through a personal fellowship with him.|$|R
50|$|Father Seraphim was {{distinguished}} as an author. Three <b>of</b> his books, <b>The</b> <b>Parables</b> <b>of</b> Christ, <b>The</b> Miracles <b>of</b> Christ and <b>The</b> Sermon on the Mount, became classics for the Orthodox in Greece.

25|$|While {{it can be}} {{understood}} in Gnostic terms, it lacks the characteristic features of Gnostic doctrine. The Jesus Seminar identified two of its unique parables, the <b>parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empty jar and the <b>parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assassin. It had been lost but was discovered, in a Coptic version dating from c. 350, at Nag Hammadi in 1945–46, and three papyri, dated to c. 200, which contain fragments of a Greek text similar to but not identical with that in the Coptic language, have also been found.|$|E

2500|$|A common motif in many caves is {{the areas}} entirely covered by rows of small seated Buddha figures, after which {{this and other}} [...] "Thousand Buddhas Caves" [...] are named. These small Buddhas were drawn using stencils so that {{identical}} figures may be replicated.

[...] The cantata text was written by the court poet Salomon Franck for the occasion and published in 1715 in [...] Franck stayed close to <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gospel, recalling the injunctions and <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mote and the beam and the blind leading the blind. The last aria summarizes the admonitions as [...] "" [...] (This is the Christians' art). The cantata is closed by <b>the</b> first stanza <b>of</b> Johannes Agricola's hymn [...] "" [...] (1531).

40|$|Analysing {{the artistic}} {{structure}} and semantics of this Pushkin’s story, the author reveals its very core {{that is a}} somehow transformed version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well-known evangelic <b>parable</b> – <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prodigal children going along an arduous road from one axiological extreme to another, from 'self-will' to 'humbleness' which determines a deep psychological basis of its plot development...|$|R
2500|$|This period <b>of</b> {{ministry}} includes <b>the</b> Discourse on the Church {{in which}} Jesus anticipates a future community of followers, and explains <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> his apostles in leading it. It includes <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Lost Sheep and The Unforgiving Servant in Matthew 18 which also refer to <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Heaven. <b>The</b> general theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discourse is <b>the</b> anticipation <b>of</b> a future community <b>of</b> followers, and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> his apostles in leading it. Addressing his apostles in 18:18, Jesus states: [...] "what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven". The discourse emphasizes <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> humility and self-sacrifice {{as the high}} virtues within the anticipated community. It teaches that in <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> God, it is childlike humility that matters, not social prominence and clout.|$|R
25|$|In the <b>Parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wedding Feast, it is “the poor, the crippled, {{the blind}} and the lame” who become God’s honored guests, while others reject the {{invitation}} because of their earthly cares and possessions (Lk 14.7–14).|$|E
25|$|Critics often talk of The Castle and The Trial in concert, {{highlighting}} {{the struggle of}} the protagonist against a bureaucratic system and standing before the law's door unable to enter as in the <b>parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> priest in The Trial.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the Buckley dialect was {{recorded}} by community heritage archivist John Butler in 2016.

40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{workers in}} <b>the</b> {{vineyard}} and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost son, Jesus shows {{the relationship between}} goodness/forgiveness and justice. The protagonists of the two parables: <b>the</b> workers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first hour {{as well as the}} elder son were expecting justice, while the vineyard owner and <b>the</b> father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost son showed goodness which rises above justice. This attitude triggers off “evil eye” of those whose sense of justice is disturbed. Whilst the Old Testament assumed the “eye for eye” rule as the fundamental social strategy, Jesus changes into <b>the</b> strategy <b>of</b> “do to others as you would have them do to you”. History shows that justice which is not counterbalanced by goodness, mercy, and forgiveness may deform into revenge, retaliation, vengeance. Although justice is still the basic norm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society, it is goodness that should dominate in individual relations, even if it causes a negative reaction of those who construe goodness as injustice (trans.

500|$|Noye's Fludde {{has been}} {{described}} by the musicologist Arnold Whittall as a forerunner <b>of</b> Britten's church <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, and by the composer's biographer Paul Kildea as a hybrid work, [...] "as much a cantata as an opera". Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orchestral writing, says the music analyst Eric Roseberry, lies [...] "well within <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> intelligent young players of very restricted technique". Several episodes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opera – such as [...] "the grinding conflict of Britten's passacaglia theme against Dykes's familiar hymn-tune in the storm" [...] – introduces listeners and the youthful performers to what Roseberry terms [...] "a contemporary idiom of dissonance", in contrast to the [...] "outworn style" [...] of most music written for the young. With its innovatory arrangement of vocal and instrumental forces, Noye's Fludde is summarised by Whittall as [...] "a brilliant demonstration of how to combine the relatively elementary instrumental and vocal skills of amateurs with professionals to produce a highly effective piece of music theatre." ...|$|R
