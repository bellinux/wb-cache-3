40|$|The {{importance}} of hydrodynamics {{in the development}} of in vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVCs) for a BCS Class II compound housed in a hydrophilic matrix formulation and for a BCS Class I compound housed in an Osmotic Pump formulation was assessed. In vitro release data were collected in media simulating the fasted state conditions in the stomach, small intestine and the ascending colon using the USP II, the USP III and the USP IV release apparatuses. Using the data collected with the USP II apparatus, the <b>plasma</b> <b>profiles</b> were simulated and compared with human <b>plasma</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained after administration of the same dosage forms to healthy fasted volunteers.

For both formulations, based on the values of the difference factor, all three apparatuses were equally useful in predicting the actual in vivo profile on an average basis. Although some hydrodynamic variability is likely with low Solubility drugs in hydrophilic matrices, the hydrodynamics of USP II, III and IV may all be adequate {{as a starting point for}} generating IVIVCs for monolithic dosage forms in the fasted state...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent skin-friction {{control is}} the subject of much {{research}} and the use of transverse (spanwise) oscillating motions offers the means of obtaining a significant reduction in skin-friction. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) actuators can be used to generate spanwise oscillating waves but the difficulty in placing a sensor in the area of plasma gives rise to problems in recording near-wall velocities. A modified version of the Shyy et al. (2002) DBD model was integrated into a direct numerical simulation (DNS). This numerical model was used in a series of two-dimensional simulations, in initially quiescent flow, and the results were compared to results reported from experimental investigations. A close affinity was found confirming that the DBD model is satisfactory. Both a temporal and a spatial, spanwise oscillating flow were investigated.

40|$|A set of {{numerical}} {{procedures have}} been written in IDL[1] to compute the neutral atomic and molecular hydrogen (or deuterium) distribution functions (fn, fH 2) in a slab-like spatial geometry with specified <b>plasma</b> <b>profiles.</b> This paper reports detailed information about the numerical algorithms and the atomic and molecular physics employed by the code. The top-level numerical procedure (KN 1 D) sets up the model geometry, numerical grid, and boundary conditions and principally calls two sub-programs, one which handles the spatial evolution of the molecular distribution function and the resultant velocity space source of atomic hydrogen (Kinetic_H 2) and one which handles the spatial evolution of the atomic distribution function (Kinetic_H). The model geometry in KN 1 D consists (in increasing values of x) of a wall surface, a local limiter shadow and plasma scrape-off layer (SOL) region, a global SOL region, and a core plasma. The input parameters are: the 1 -D geometric dimensions (limiter, SOL, and core), <b>plasma</b> <b>profiles</b> (density, ion and electron temperature) and the molecular neutral pressure at the wall.

In conjunction, we examined <b>plasma</b> <b>profiles</b> of glucose and lactate to infer metabolic processes associated with green turtle nesting behaviour. Finally, because these hormones are also involved in mediating behaviour and physiology associated with stressful situations, we {{examined the}} effect of a stressor encountered during nesting, physical disturbance, on hormone levels. <b>Plasma</b> <b>profiles</b> of epinephrine, norepinephrine and corticosterone were not significantly altered across different stages of nesting. Plasma glucose and lactate both exhibited significant increases related to nesting activity; glucose increased dramatically during the emergence stage of nesting before stabilizing, and lactate levels continued to increase throughout the nesting process. There was no significant association between plasma hormones and glucose. For female turtles that abandoned nesting activities due to competition for nest space, {{there was no significant difference}} in plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine and corticosterone compared to females that persisted with nesting activities. Overall, while distinct metabolic changes took place in nesting females, there was little association in profiles of hormones typically considered important for regulating heightened metabolism and nesting activity.

40|$|Solutions to a model 2 D {{eigenmode}} equation describing micro-instabilities in tokamak plasmas {{are presented}} that demonstrate a {{sensitivity of the}} mode structure and stability to <b>plasma</b> <b>profiles.</b> In narrow regions of parameter space, with special <b>plasma</b> <b>profiles,</b> a maximally unstable mode is found that balloons on the outboard side of the tokamak. This corresponds to the conventional picture of a ballooning mode. However, for most profiles this mode cannot exist and instead a more stable mode is found that balloons closer to the top or bottom of the plasma. Good quantitative agreement with a 1 D ballooning analysis is found provided the constraints associated with higher order profile effects, often neglected, are taken into account. A sudden transition from this general mode to the more unstable ballooning mode can occur for a critical flow shear, providing a candidate model for why some experiments observe small plasma eruptions (Edge Localised Modes, or ELMs) in place of large Type I ELMs. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

However, {{it is unknown}} whether the levels of circulating miRNAs in a healthy subject might vary with external factors in daily life. In this study, we investigated whether cigarette smoking, a habit that has spread throughout the world and is {{a risk factor for}} various diseases, affects <b>plasma</b> miRNA <b>profiles.</b> We determined the profiles of 11 smokers and 7 non-smokers by TaqMan MicroRNA array analysis. A larger number of miRNAs were detected in smokers than in non-smokers, and the plasma levels of two-thirds of the detected miRNAs (43 miRNAs) were significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. A principal component analysis of the <b>plasma</b> miRNA <b>profiles</b> clearly separated smokers and non-smokers. Twenty-four of the miRNAs were previously reported to be potential biomarkers of disease, suggesting the possibility that smoking status might interfere with the diagnosis of disease. Interestingly, we found that quitting smoking altered the <b>plasma</b> miRNA <b>profiles</b> to resemble those of non-smokers. These results suggested that the differences in the <b>plasma</b> miRNA <b>profiles</b> between smokers and non-smokers could be attributed to cigarette smoking.

40|$|Low-temperature plasma {{technique}} {{is one of}} the critical techniques in IC manufacturing process, such as etching and thin-film deposition, and the uniformity greatly impacts the process quality, so the design for the plasma uniformity control is very important but difficult. It is hard to finely and flexibly regulate the spatial distribution of the plasma in the chamber via controlling the discharge parameters or modifying the structure in zero-dimensional space, and it just can adjust the overall level of the process factors. In the view of this problem, a segmented non-uniform dielectric module design solution is proposed for the regulation of the <b>plasma</b> <b>profile</b> in a CCP chamber. The solution achieves refined and flexible regulation of the <b>plasma</b> <b>profile</b> in the radial direction via configuring the relative permittivity and the width of each segment. In order to solve this design problem, a novel simulation-based auto-design approach is proposed, which can automatically design the positional sequence with multi independent variables to make the output target profile in the parameterized simulation model approximate the one that users preset. This approach employs an idea of quasi-closed-loop control system, and works in an iterative mode. It starts from initial values of the design variable sequences, and predicts better sequences via the feedback of the profile error between the output target profile and the expected one.
