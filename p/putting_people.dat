Then the rough sea disabled the boat and it was stranded on the beach. They were left with no shelter and only the boat's water and food rations to sustain them. Another 42 people, including Captain Lee, were left aboard the beached ship.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reasons given}} for the {{rebranding}} was disappointing RAJAR figures, that the Jazz FM name was <b>putting</b> <b>people</b> off listening to the station and that the station not playing enough jazz for the purists.

Included in the investment would be two dedicated jazz stations of which one still runs to this day and has been rebranded to Jazz FM.|$|E

When allusions to socialist legality started to be made, it was decided to prosecute such people.

Dominated by revolutionary zealots, most of whom were youths, the Revolutionary Committees were led by Mohammad Maghgoub and a Central Coordinating Office based in Tripoli, and met with Gaddafi annually. Membership of the Revolutionary Committees was drawn from within the BPCs. According to Bearman, the revolutionary committee system became [...] "a key—if not the main—mechanism through which [...] exercises political control in Libya". Publishing a weekly magazine The Green March (al-Zahf al-Akhdar), in October 1980 they took control of the press. Responsible for perpetuating revolutionary fervour, they performed ideological surveillance, later adopting a significant security role, making arrests and <b>putting</b> <b>people</b> on trial according to the [...] "law of the revolution" [...] (qanun al-thawra).

500|$|While the {{character}} artwork for Mighty Jill Off {{was created by}} James Harvey, Anthropy first designed Jill in sprite form. Harvey was initially wary of doing work that was BDSM-themed; he {{felt that it was}} easy for something that is both cartoony and sexual to make viewers feel uncomfortable and used the Japanese harem anime genre as an example. He added that in humorous, sexually-oriented cartoons, there is a [...] "fine line" [...] between [...] "cute and funny" [...] and [...] "repulsive". He wanted to design the relationship between the Queen and Jill in a way that people in the BDSM community could identify with it, while also avoiding <b>putting</b> <b>people</b> off who were not into BDSM. He used European comics as a model for his art work, which he admired for the [...] "permissive attitude they have to sex in cartoons". He also cited as inspiration specific Japanese cartoonists who he felt had successfully portrayed sex in animation such as Monkey Punch, the creator of Lupin III.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{thought it was a}} [...] "quintessential" [...] Swartzwelder episode, and executive producer/show runner David Mirkin said it was a [...] "fantastic job by one of the most prolific writers of the show". The most important thing to Mirkin while making the episode was {{to make sure that the}} elephant would be a [...] "bastard" [...] and behave rudely, unlike other animals on the show. For example, instead of <b>putting</b> <b>people</b> on his back, Stampy would put them in his mouth. Mirkin said the elephant [...] "never quite bonds because it's a very cantankerous animal, a concept that was very important to this episode". Stampy has since been used several times in jokes later on in the series. For example, Stampy made an appearance in the season nine episode [...] "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace" [...] in one of Bart's dreams, and in the season fourteen episode [...] "Large Marge", where he is used by Bart in a stunt to help Krusty the Clown win back his popularity. Stampy appeared briefly in The Simpsons Movie, where he tries to break down the giant glass dome lowered over Springfield. The episode also introduces the character Cletus Spuckler. He is shown as one of the [...] "slack-jawed yokels" [...] gawking at Stampy in the Simpson family's backyard. Cletus is not named in the episode, so the staff simply referred to him as the Slack-Jawed Yokel.|$|E

In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "when I was <b>putting</b> <b>people</b> up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What are you planning to wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd even think of asking the question.

[...] The imperial guard commander Sun Hanshao (孫漢韶), who had previous conflicts with Zhang, thus submitted an accusation to Meng that Zhang and his son Zhang Jizhao (張繼昭) were plotting treason.

[...] However, Meng did not wish to kill either of them, and allowed them to retire. [...] Believing that much had been hidden from him while Zhang Ye and Wang Chuhui were in control of the government, Meng set up chests in front of the palace, allowing the people to make secret reports to him by putting them in the chests. [...] Li Hao and Xu Guangpu replaced Zhang as chancellor (although Xu was shortly after removed after being accused of having sexually harassed the daughter of Former Shu's founding emperor Wang Jian), while no one immediately succeeded Wang Chuhui as chief of staff — Meng had wanted to make two close associates, Gao Yanzhao and Wang Zhaoyuan his chiefs of staff, but as they were perceived to lack sufficient seniority, gave them lesser offices and made them acting chiefs of staff, while giving them free rein in the matters of finance.
