5000|$|In the April 5, 2008 {{issue of}} Billboard, the song {{received}} a spotlight review by Chuck Taylor: [...] "I Nine catapulted out of native South Carolina when Cameron Crowe invited the quartet {{to appear on}} the motion pic soundtrack for his “Elizabethtown.” At year-end 2007, it grazed the adult top 40 top 25 with “Seven Days of Lonely,” the debut from upcoming CD “Heavy Weights the King”—but that <b>pep</b> <b>pill</b> was a mere taste of the group’s prowess. Sunny follow-up “If This Room Could Move” is garnering hype because Chad Kroeger produced—all well and good—but bragging rights are earned on its own merits: an ambrosial vocal from Carmen Keigans, divine start-and-stop tempo, and instrumental elements that blend ‘90s jangle-rock with Brit pop. On record, they sound like a blissful union of Jewel and Sixpence None the Richer—if more Avril Lavigne live. With two exquisite singles in a row, I Nine is counting down to name-brand status. Utterly superlative." ...|$|E

50|$|The film satirizes {{the instant}} {{manufacture}} of media stars, {{the decline of}} a gentlemanly business ethos (or the tradition of bushido) and rise of a culture of ruthless corporate skulduggery, and the emphasis on work {{at the expense of}} personal life and health—Mr Goda's health has been so ruined by his diet of <b>pep</b> <b>pills</b> and tranquilizers {{by the end of the}} film that he is regularly coughing up blood.|$|R
2500|$|Relying on {{evidence}} from The President's Council on Physical Fitness, he also agrees that [...] "many of our {{aches and pains}} come from lack of physical activity." [...] As an immediate remedy for symptoms such as constipation, insomnia, tiredness, anxiety, shortness of breath, or high blood pressure, LaLanne states that people will resort to various drugs: [...] "We look for crutches such as sleeping <b>pills,</b> <b>pep</b> <b>pills,</b> alcohol, cigarettes, and so on." ...|$|R

2500|$|The lure of {{big money}} pushed players {{harder and harder}} to perform at their peaks. There is only so much {{conditioning}} that one can do to obtain an edge without inducing injury. The wearying travel schedule and 162-game season meant that amphetamines, usually in the form of <b>pep</b> <b>pills</b> known as [...] "greenies", had been widespread in baseball since at least the 1960s. Baseball's drug scene was no particular secret, having been discussed in Sports Illustrated and in Jim Bouton's groundbreaking book Ball Four, but there was virtually no public backlash. [...] Two decades later, however, some Major League players turned to newer performance-enhancing drugs, including ephedra and improved steroids.|$|R
5|$|The group {{released}} several successful albums, including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath and Between the Buttons, but {{in their}} personal lives their behaviour was brought into question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter <b>pep</b> <b>pills</b> he had purchased in Italy. The traditionally conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although he ended up spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, {{amphetamine}} and methamphetamine {{were used}} extensively {{by both the}} Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. In the 1950s, there was {{a rise in the}} legal prescription of methamphetamine to the American public. Methamphetamine constituted half of the amphetamine salts for the original formulation for the diet drug Obetrol. Methamphetamine was also marketed for sinus inflammation or for non-medicinal purposes as [...] "pep pills" [...] or [...] "bennies". A thriving black market in <b>pep</b> <b>pills</b> among long-haul truck drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, linked to long drive times and intense competitive pressures within the industry, contributed to federal efforts by the late 1960s to curtail non-medical use of the substance.|$|R
5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} {{at the wheel}} of the truck due to taking a combination of <b>pep</b> <b>pills</b> and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes to discover that the truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{uses the}} full opening {{sequence}} because the story came out short. Despite this, a large sequence {{was cut from}} the middle of the episode, with half of the episode having to be re-written after the animatic had been finished. The main plot of the episode came from an original idea that the family would be issued a credit card in the name [...] "Hobart Simpson" [...] and that Bart would use that. An original side-story was that Lisa would become addicted to the [...] "Trucker's Choice" [...] <b>pep</b> <b>pills.</b> Originally, instead of going to the dog park, the family took Laddie to a waterfall and he performed a series of dives, but it was scrapped as it had already been proven that Laddie was a form of [...] "superdog". Likewise, Laddie rescuing Baby Gerald was originally a complicated rescue scene, but was cut into showing the aftermath.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{availability}} {{of a range of}} new psychotropic agents raises the possibility that these will be used for enhancement purposes (smart pills, happy <b>pills,</b> and <b>pep</b> <b>pills).</b> The enhancement debate soon raises questions in philosophy of medicine and psychiatry (eg, what is a disorder?), and this debate in turn raises fundament questions in philosophy of language, science, and ethics. In this paper, a naturalistic conceptual framework is proposed for addressing these issues. This framework begins by contrasting classical and critical concepts of categories, and then puts forward an integrative position that is based on cognitive-affective research. This position can in turn be used to consider the debate between pharmacological Calvinism (which may adopt a moral metaphor of disorder) and psychotropic utopianism (which may emphasize a medical metaphor of disorder). I argue that psychiatric treatment of serious psychiatric disorders is justified, and that psychotropics are an acceptable kind of intervention. The use of psychotropics for sub-threshold phenomena requires a judicious weighing of the relevant facts (which are often sparse) and values. </p...|$|R
