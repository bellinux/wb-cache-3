50|$|In 1928. Kerzhentsev was {{appointed}} deputy head of Agitprop {{and head of}} the culture and science department of the CPSU Central Committee, and for the next ten years was a major figure in the administration and censorship of the arts. A champion of proletarian art, he took a particular dislike to the prominent Russian playwright, Mikhail Bulgakov. In January 1929, he played a pivotal part in getting Bulgakov's fourth <b>play,</b> <b>Flight,</b> banned. He then wrote an article that appeared in Pravda on 7 February 1929, alleging that the Ukrainian people were being insulted by a play performed at the Moscow Arts Theatre, his obvious target being Bulgakov's first and best known play, The Day of the Turbins known to western audiences as The White Guard, set in Kiev, and attacked the People's Commissar for Enlightenment, Anatoli Lunacharsky for allowing it to be staged. The play was suppressed in March 1929, but later revived, because Stalin liked it. Kerzhentsev was President of the All Union Radio Committee. In January 1936, he {{was appointed}} Chairman of the State Committee on the Arts, which meant that he was responsible for music, as well as other art forms, during the campaign initiated by Stalin against Dmitri Shostakovich, who turned to Kerzhentsev for advice, and was told to write less complex music that the masses could understand. He resumed his campaign against Bulgakov, whose latest play, Moliere, the first two performances of which, in February 1935, had sold out. Kerzhentsev wrote to Stalin, alleging that the play was an allegory which drew a parallel between Molière's humiliating treatment by Louis XIV and the treatment of soviet artists - which very likely was Bulgakov's intention. The play was immediately banned.|$|E
