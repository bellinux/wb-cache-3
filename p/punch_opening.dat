50|$|Charles Bennett’s {{drawings}} {{appeared in}} Punch {{from time to}} time and in 1865 he was invited to join the Punch Council, which included Mark Lemon (Editor), Shirley Brooks and John Tenniel. By March 1866 Charles was a regular attendee and another member of the Council, Henry Silver, recorded in his diaries some of Charles Bennett’s contributions to discussion and reported that he was deaf in his right ear and smoked cigars. Silver also mentions that Charles was left handed although he sometimes drew with his right hand. In a discussion of recurring nightmares, Shirley Brooks’ was swimming in a sea of butter, while Charles Bennett described how he had to tie up a parcel but was unable to find a piece of string the right length, despite cutting a hundred bits. His regular contributions began in February 1865 at the beginning of a new parliamentary session with a cartoon of Mr <b>Punch</b> <b>opening</b> parliament. Over the next two years he contributed nearly 200 drawings, identified by his characteristic CHB monogram from March 1865 onwards. He specialised in very elaborate initial letters, such as the letter Z at the beginning of Punch's Essence of Parliament in April 1866. He occasionally contributed political cartoons, and in September 1866 he depicted the Pope as a turnip propped up by a musket, about to be knocked away by Louis Napoleon. Charles Bennett’s bohemian appearance, apparently the result of his financial straits, seems to have been the cause of comment even around the Punch table. In October 1866, therefore, the Council passed the following resolution:Resolved• That this meeting deeply sympathises with C. H. Bennett on the state of his hair • That this meeting appreciates the feeling which detains the said Bennett from the Council until his hair shall have been cut • That this meeting deplores the impecuniosity which prevents the said Bennett from attending a barber • That this meeting, anxious to receive the said Bennett to its bosom once again, organizes a subscription to enable him to attend the said barber • That this meeting, having (limited) confidence in Mr. Mark Lemon, entrusts him with the following subscriptions in aid of the above object, and requests him to communicate with the aforesaid Bennett, to the end that he may have his damn hair cut, and rejoin the assembly of the brethren.This resolution was signed by ten members of the Council, who each contributed one penny by attaching a penny red stamp to the letter. It seems unlikely that the state of his hair was the true reason for Charles’s absence from Council meetings, it being more likely that his deteriorating health was already keeping him away. His final attendance at the table was apparently on 12 December 1866 and Henry Silver recorded his absence the following week, but made no further reference to his subsequent presence.|$|E
50|$|The {{educational}} wing of {{the building}} is built {{in the north of}} the sanctuary. The roof is a series of gable roofs. The windows of the building are <b>punched</b> <b>openings</b> in a continuous pattern. The window units are steel casement in a two over one operable hopper configuration.|$|R
50|$|Enclosures {{for some}} {{purposes}} have partially <b>punched</b> <b>openings</b> (knockouts) {{which can be}} removed to accommodate cables, connectors, or conduits. Where they are small and primarily intended to conceal electrical junctions from sight, or protect them from tampering, they are also known as junction boxes, street cabinets or technically as serving area interface.|$|R
5000|$|... 330 Hudson Street {{consists}} of a limestone colonnaded base that supports a brick façade of <b>punched</b> <b>openings.</b> Portions of the original storefront system have been restored, and others replicated, including decorative column capitals. The addition includes a transitional “punched” brick envelope, out of which grows a light curtain-wall clad volume that recalls the cast iron vocabulary of the adjacent SoHo neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|Kongo fought at UFC 92 on December 27, 2008 {{where he}} beat former Cage Rage British Heavyweight {{champion}} Mustapha al-Turk by TKO. Kongo dropped Al Turk with two right hands. Then fired on a vicious ground and pound attack, Kongo pounced on al-Turk with elbows and <b>punches,</b> <b>opening</b> {{up a big}} cut above the eye. Referee Steve Mazzagatti stopped the fight after 4:37 of the first round. This fight was also somewhat controversial because Kongo hit al-Turk with a groin knee prior to the stoppage. In his next fight he then defeated Antoni Hardonk at UFC 97 by second-round TKO.|$|R
50|$|Architectural Glass and Aluminum, {{referred}} to as AGA, is a specialty glazing contractor located in the United States. Architectural Glass & Aluminum provides engineering, design, fabrication, installation, and assembly services for custom glazing systems, such as Curtain Wall, Storefront, <b>Punched</b> <b>Openings,</b> and Window Wall. The firm works with architects and General Contractors to meet desired aesthetics, and performance criteria (such as LEED), while providing details that interface with other exterior enclosure substrates. Along with glazing of glass, AGA installs systems with infills including aluminum panels, composite materials, and natural stone. The company has also dealt with integrating custom ornamental trims and sunscreens {{on a number of}} projects.|$|R
40|$|Nonresidential {{fenestration}} {{systems have}} different characteristics from residential products and therefore require different treatment. A component modeling methodology {{has been developed}} and is {{presented in this paper}} to specifically address nonresidential fenestration products, from <b>punched</b> <b>openings</b> to site-built and assembled products. The basic premise of this methodology is that the manufacturer of each fenestration component (i. e., framing, glazing, and spacer manufacturer) is responsible for its own product, for which the performance is published in NFRC-certified product directory (CPD), while the overall performance of the fenestration system is determined using functions developed from a number of actual runs with real glazing and spacer systems. The methodology is based on four generic runs, incorporating the high and low end of performance (i. e., best/worst or B/W options). This methodology can be implemented in a software tool, which would pull component information from the CPD into its own database and would calculate thermal and solar-optical performance at the standard size as well as the actual product size. This way, not only responsibility for component performance is clearly defined, but also the input data about fenestration systems for building energy simulation is accurate and will lead to more precise prediction of peak loads and annual energy use. Implementation of this methodology within a nationally recognized rating program will allow for uniform and accurate representation of nonresidential fenestration systems, for both site-built and <b>punched</b> <b>opening</b> type of fenestration products, while still providing data for a prescriptive path in energy codes (e. g., performance at standard NFRC size) ...|$|R

50|$|All {{four of the}} {{exterior}} elevations are similar, although the primary entries are located on {{the north and south}} sides while vehicular openings are located on the east and west. Each elevation is divided vertically into thirds, with a base, a midsection and a top. The base consists of a raised basement and floors one and two and is clad with polished black granite at the water table/raised basement level, and smooth-cut limestone blocks at the first and second stories. The basement, first and second stories have <b>punched</b> recessed <b>openings</b> with bronze sheet sills. The middle portion of the building, floors three through seven, is also faced with smooth-cut limestone articulated by rectilinear pilasters. The windows on the third through sixth stories are grouped vertically and separated by bronze spandrels. The seventh floor windows are in <b>punched</b> <b>openings</b> with bronze sheet sills. The upper portion of the building, floors eight through ten, is characterized by smooth-cut limestone with vertically-grouped windows aligning with those of the middle section. The cubic mass of the building is relieved by minor setbacks at the third and eighth floor levels. An ornamental frieze with relief sculpture extends around the building between the sixth and seventh floors. Each elevation has carved relief panels located in its end bays. The panels depict 1930's-era federal government agencies. Extending between the end bays is a frieze of circular medallions alternating with carved, fluted panels. The medallions depict various symbols of the federal government.|$|R
50|$|The north {{elevation}} contains two-story window openings at its base, allowing {{natural light}} into the public lobby. The majority of this elevation is smooth limestone veneer with <b>punched</b> window <b>openings.</b> The projecting glass and steel curtain wall accents the northeast corner, and the solid limestone shaft with curved elevator penthouse accents the northwest corner. The building's vaulted metal roof crowns the tower.|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and operation}} of membrane switches are discussed. The membrane switch functions as a normally open, momentary contact, low-voltage pressure-sensitive device. Its design is a three-layer sandwich usually constructed of polyester film. Conductive patterns are deposited onto the inner side of top and bottom sheets by silk screening. The center spacer is then placed between the two circuit layers to form a sandwich, generally held together by an adhesive. When pressure {{is applied to the}} top layer, it flexes through the <b>punched</b> <b>openings</b> of the spacer to establish electrical contact between conductive pads of the upper and lower sheets, momentarily closing the circuit. Upon release of force the top sheet springs back to its normal open position. The membrane touch switch is being used in a rapidly expanding range of applications, including instrumentation, appliances, electronic games and keyboards. Its board acceptance results from its low cost, durability, ease of manufacture, cosmetic appeal and design flexibility. The principal electronic components in the membrane switch are the conductor and dielectric...|$|R
40|$|Windows {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} elements in the design of buildings. Whether there are small <b>punched</b> <b>openings</b> in the facade or a completely glazed curtain wall, windows are usually a dominant feature of the building's exterior appearance. From the energy use perspective, windows may also be regarded as thermal holes for a building. Therefore, window design and selection must take both aesthetics and serviceability into consideration. In this paper, using building computer simulation techniques, the effects of glass types on the thermal and energy performance of a sample air-conditioned office building in Australia are studied. It is found that a glass type with lower shading coefficient will have a lower building cooling load and total energy use. Through the comparison of results between current and future weather scenarios, it is identified that the pattern found from the current weather scenario would also exist in the future weather scenario, although the scale of change would become smaller. The possible implication of glazing selection in face of global warming is also examined. It is found that compared with its influence on building thermal performance, its influence on the building energy use is relatively small or insignificant...|$|R
5000|$|Rosenberg's is {{a two-story}} {{structure}} measuring about 140 ft by 120 ft, with an attached 126 ft by 108 ft one-story section. The front {{is dominated by}} an Art Moderne marquee and sign that extends beyond the roof, with the main entrance under the marquee. The steel-framed structure is clad with stucco-covered cast in place concrete. The lower level features continuous plate glass display windows, with a curved corner above set apart by string courses or [...] "speed lines", inset with glass block clerestory windows. Large <b>punched</b> <b>openings</b> with keystone-like vertical stripes define the second floor bays. The marquee section is defined by flanking pylons embracing a tall, glass block window whose surface undulates. A fin or [...] "blade sign" [...] rises {{from the top of}} the window to about 10 ft above the roof, where it originally carried neon lettering advertising the store. A taller fin is set back and rises much higher, to 50 ft above the roof. It is translucent, and was internally lighted with green neon. The one-story section is much plainer, with a continuous canopy across the front. The entrance to this section is marked by two arches in the canopy.|$|R
50|$|The same {{materials}} and similar details continue {{around to the}} south elevation. The employees entrance is located {{near the center of}} the first floor. The eight-story block of the south elevation features a wide, vertical band of windows near its west end and a <b>punched</b> four-story window <b>opening</b> which constitutes nearly two-thirds of the elevation's wall surface. The windows are divided horizontally by metal spandrels and mullions. The top floor of the eight-story block is fully glazed and sheltered under a projecting metal canopy. A four-story metal bracket appears to support the cantilevered canopy. The 16-story tower is set back from the plane of the eight-story block, allowing for the open-air rooftop terrace. The tower's elevation consists of a limestone center shaft flanked by glass and steel curtain walls. The limestone wall surface has <b>punched</b> window <b>openings</b> of horizontal bands and small squares. The curtain walls are divided horizontally by projecting fins at the floor plates and intermediate window mullions. The vaulted metal roof crowns the tower.|$|R
