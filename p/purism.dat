25|$|The {{movement}} had {{run its course}} by about 1925, but Cubist approaches to sculpture didn't end {{as much as they}} became a pervasive influence, fundamental to the related developments of Constructivism, <b>Purism,</b> Futurism, Die Brücke, De Stijl, Dada, Abstract art, Surrealism and Art Deco.|$|E
25|$|His {{enduring}} aversion towards Western neologisms, {{as well as}} {{towards the}} Latin-based linguistic <b>purism</b> favored by many Transylvanian scholars, made Asachi a predecessor of the Bukovinan academic Aron Pumnul. However, in his later years, Asachi came to praise and uphold Heliade Rădulescu's controversial advocacy in favor of modifying Romanian {{on the basis of}} Italian (with its claim that the two languages were in fact closely related dialects of Latin).|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{language of}} Iceland is Icelandic, a highly inflected North Germanic language. Danish and English are also taught in schools. Linguistic <b>purism</b> is strongly supported in Iceland {{in an attempt}} to prevent loanwords from entering the language. Instead, neologisms are coined from Icelandic roots, creating a compound word to describe new concepts. It is often the case that old words which are no longer used are recycled with a new meaning. It should be noted, however, that some loanwords persist in Icelandic, and many more, the majority anglicisms, are used in everyday speech.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{influence}} of English was perceived {{as a threat to}} Afrikaans, there was a trend to coin <b>purisms</b> rather than to borrow from English or international vocabulary; whereas the word for [...] "computer" [...] in Dutch is simply computer, in Afrikaans it is rekenaar, from reken, meaning [...] "to count".|$|R
50|$|While Afrikaans uses <b>purisms</b> or loan {{translations}} where Dutch {{would use}} loans from French, Latin or English, {{owing to the}} exposure of Afrikaans speakers to English, Dutch words like computer, lift and appartement are more readily understood by them than Afrikaans equivalents like rekenaar, hysbak and woonstel are by Dutch speakers.|$|R
50|$|Owing to the {{geographical}} and later political isolation of South Africa from the Netherlands, Afrikaans vocabulary diverged {{from that of}} Dutch, coining <b>purisms</b> or using loan translations rather than adopting terms found in English, as English was perceived as being a greater threat to Afrikaans in South Africa {{than it was to}} Dutch in the Netherlands.|$|R
25|$|Artists Naum Gabo, El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, and Alexander Rodchenko, have {{influenced}} the graphic sense of geometric forms of deconstructivist architects such as Zaha Hadid and Coop Himmelb(l)au. Both Deconstructivism and Constructivism have been concerned with the tectonics of making an abstract assemblage. Both were concerned with the radical simplicity of geometric forms as the primary artistic content, expressed in graphics, sculpture and architecture. The Constructivist tendency toward <b>purism,</b> though, is absent in Deconstructivism: form is often deformed when construction is deconstructed. Also lessened or absent is the advocacy of socialist and collectivist causes.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Csaky (also written Josef Csàky, Csáky József, József Csáky and Joseph Alexandre Czaky) (18 March 1888 – 1 May 1971) was a Hungarian avant-garde artist, sculptor, {{and graphic}} artist, {{best known for}} his early {{participation}} as a sculptor in the Cubist movement. Joseph Csaky {{was one of the first}} sculptors in Paris to apply the principles of pictorial Cubism to his art. A pioneer of modern sculpture, Csaky is among the most important sculptors of the early 20th century. He was an active member of the Section d'Or group between 1911 and 1914, and closely associated with De Stijl and <b>Purism</b> throughout the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|They {{also share}} traits {{with the work}} of Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant who {{together}} had founded <b>Purism,</b> a style intended as a rational, mathematically based corrective to the impulsiveness of cubism. Combining the classical with the modern, Léger's Nude on a Red Background (1927) depicts a monumental, expressionless woman, machinelike in form and color. His still life compositions from this period are dominated by stable, interlocking rectangular formations in vertical and horizontal orientation. The Siphon of 1924, a still life based on an advertisement in the popular press for the aperitif Campari, represents the high-water mark of the Purist aesthetic in Léger's work. Its balanced composition and fluted shapes suggestive of classical columns are brought together with a quasi-cinematic close-up of a hand holding a bottle.|$|E
5000|$|Other <b>purisms</b> {{were less}} successful; beeldradio, {{a word for}} [...] "television", {{proposed}} before its introduction in the 1970s, was abandoned in favour of televisie, already used in Dutch. In South Africa and Namibia, the TV licence is known in Afrikaans as TV-lisensie, whereas in the Netherlands and Flanders, the now defunct equivalent was known in Dutch as kijkgeld ("viewing money") or omroepbijdrage ("broadcasting subsidy").|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which the German-Jewish writers Gershom Scholem, Werner Kraft and Ludwig Strauss dealt with the linguistic dilemmas and opportunities, which they encountered as a result of their German-Jewish cultural location and emigration or exile. Born in the 1890 s they were exposed to ideas like the 'sprachbestimmte Kulturnation', to Modem Hebrew in the framework of the Jewish Renaissance, and to language scepticism in modernist writing. How did they contribute to these debates? Did linguistic dislocation between 1923 and 1935 result in mute resignation, literary paralysis or in a burst of creativity? I argue that Scholem, Kraft and Strauss developed unique linguistic counterstrategies: Hebraist lamentation, Germanist steadfastness and polyglot dialogue, respectively. In his early writings Scholem advanced from the idea of the 'lamentation of language' to the idea of the 'retaliation of language', as expressed in 'Uber Klage und Klagelied' (1917) and 'Bekenntnis uber unsere Sprache' (1926). These performative texts wished to counteract the secularisation and instrumentalisation of Hebrew in the hands of Zionists in Germany and Jerusalem. Kraft envisaged himself as a guardian of the German language in the face of cultural decline and political turmoil and sought inspiration from the restorative projects of Rudolf Borchardt and Karl Kraus. After flight and settlement in Jerusalem in 1935 Kraft's Germanist scholarship became a practice of defiant re territorialisation. In Germany Strauss attempted to negotiate between his Germanist and Hebraist pursuits while avoiding stereotypical mediatory roles. His political and poetological essays display a close affinity to the dialogical ideas of Buber and Holderlin. After emigration in 1935 a series of bi -lingual poems that negate linguistic <b>purisms</b> and cultural boundaries granted his dialogical poetics a more subversive dynamic. These three divergent linguistic counterstrategies were nonetheless grounded in a shared conviction about language as a constitutive force and moral indicator in the world, and in an unceasing engagement with the question of German-Jewish identity in Germany and in Palestine and later Israel.

25|$|In 1908, Latvian {{linguists}} Kārlis Mīlenbahs and Jānis Endzelīns elaborated {{the modern}} Latvian alphabet, which slowly replaced the old orthography used before. Another {{feature of the}} language, in common with its sister language Lithuanian, that was developed at that time is that proper names from other countries and languages are altered phonetically to fit the phonological system of Latvian. Even if the original language also uses the Latin alphabet, this process takes place. Moreover, the names are modified {{in order to ensure}} that they have noun declension endings, declining like all other nouns. For example, a place such as Lecropt (a Scottish parish) is likely to become Lekropta; the Scottish village of Tillicoultry becomes Tilikutrija. This is a good example of linguistic <b>purism</b> in this language.|$|E
25|$|Frequently, {{acquisition}} {{planning is}} {{integrated into a}} larger language planning {{process in which the}} statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities. This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a bilingual language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language’s script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language’s status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote language revitalization, which can change a language’s status or reverse a language shift, or to promote linguistic <b>purism.</b> In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain effective language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Modernization {{is a form}} of {{language}} planning that occurs when a language needs to expand its resources to meet functions. Modernization often occurs when a language undergoes a shift in status, such as when a country gains independence from a colonial power or when there is a change in the language education policy. The most significant force in modernization is the expansion of the lexicon, which allows the language to discuss topics in modern semantic domains. Language planners generally focus on creating new lists and glossaries to describe new technical terms, but it is also necessary to ensure that the new terms are consistently used by the appropriate sectors within society. While some languages, such as Japanese and Hungarian, have experienced rapid lexical expansion {{to meet the demands of}} modernization, other languages, such as Hindi and Arabic, have failed to do so. Rapid lexical expansion is aided by the use of new terms in textbooks and professional publications, as well as frequent use among specialists. Issues of linguistic <b>purism</b> often play a significant role in lexical expansion, but technical vocabulary can be effective within a language, regardless of whether it comes from the language’s own process of word formation or from extensive borrowing from another language. While Hungarian has almost exclusively used language-internal processes to create new lexical items, Japanese has borrowed extensively from English to derive new words as part of its modernization.|$|E

500|$|The {{vocabulary}} of Tamil is mainly Dravidian. [...] A {{strong sense of}} linguistic <b>purism</b> is found in Modern Tamil, which opposes the use of foreign loanwords.

[...] In more modern times, Tamil has imported words from Urdu and Marathi, reflecting groups that have influenced the Tamil area at various points of time, and from neighbouring languages such as Telugu, Kannada, and Sinhala.

500|$|The strongest {{impact of}} <b>purism</b> in Tamil {{has been on}} words taken from Sanskrit. [...] During its history, Tamil, along with other Dravidian {{languages}} like Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam etc., was influenced by Sanskrit in terms of vocabulary, grammar and literary styles, reflecting the increased trend of Sanskritisation in the Tamil country. [...] Tamil vocabulary never became quite as heavily Sanskritised {{as that of the}} other Dravidian languages, and unlike in those languages, it was and remains possible to express complex ideas (including in science, art, religion and law) without the use of Sanskrit loan words. [...] In addition, Sanskritisation was actively resisted by a number of authors of the late medieval period, culminating in the 20th century in a movement called [...] (meaning [...] "pure Tamil movement"), led by Parithimaar Kalaignar and Maraimalai Adigal, which sought to remove the accumulated influence of Sanskrit on Tamil. [...] As a result of this, Tamil in formal documents, literature and public speeches has seen a marked decline in the use Sanskrit loan words in the past few decades, under some estimates having fallen from 40–50% to about 20%. [...] As a result, the Prakrit and Sanskrit loan words used in modern Tamil are, unlike in some other Dravidian languages, restricted mainly to some spiritual terminology and abstract nouns.|$|E

The Sketch includes the maxim that [...] "Music was born free; and to win freedom is its destiny". It therefore takes issue with conventional wisdom on music, caricatured by Busoni as the constricting rules of the [...] "lawgivers".

[...] "The performance of music, its emotional interpretation, derives from those free heights whence descended Art itself... What the composer's inspiration necessarily loses through notation, his interpreter should restore by his own." [...] He envisages a future music that will include the division of the octave into more than the traditional 12 semitones.

2500|$|To {{counter the}} {{influence}} of Russian and English, government organizations (namely the Terminology Commission of the Latvian Academy of Science and the State Language Center) try to popularize the use of Latvian terms and linguistic <b>purism.</b> <b>Purism</b> is often observed in the coining of new terms, which are usually disputed by the public– although purists have invented some euphonic words, many neologisms are widely seen as alien and unnecessary, as preexisting words could be used instead [...] For example, a heated debate arose when the Terminology Commission suggested that eira, with its Latvianized ending, {{would be a better}} term for euro than the widely used eiro.

De Stijl was also linked by Gino Severini to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of <b>Purism,</b> Amédée Ozenfant and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier,) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published Après le cubisme in 1918. Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, Le Corbusier and his cousin Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects.|$|E
