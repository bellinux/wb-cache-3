40|$|Imitative {{learning}} and learning by observation are social mechanisms that allow a robot to acquire knowledge {{from a human}} or another robot. However {{to be able to}} obtain skills in this way the robot faces many complex issues, one of which is that of finding solutions to the correspondence problem. Evolutionary predecessors to observational imitation may have been self-imitation where an agent avoids the complexities of the correspondence problem by {{learning and}} replicating actions it has experienced through the manipulation of its body. We investigate how a robotic control and teaching system using self-imitation can be constructed with reference to psychological models of motor control and ideas from social scaffolding seen in animals. Within these scaffolded environments sets of competencies can be built by constructing hierarchical state/action memory maps of the robot's interaction within that environment. The scaffolding process provides a mechanism to enable learning to be scaled up. The resulting system allows a human trainer to teach a robot new skills and modify skills that the robot may possess. Additionally the system allows the robot to notify the trainer when it is being taught skills it already has in its repertoire and to direct and focus its attention and sensor resources to relevant parts of the skill being executed. We argue that these mechanisms may be a first step towards the transformation from self-imitation to observational imitation. The system is validated on a physical pioneer robot that is taught using self-imitation to track, follow and point to a <b>patterned</b> <b>object...</b>|$|E
40|$|When two visual targets, T 1 and T 2, are {{presented}} in rapid succession, detection or identification of T 2 is almost universally de-graded by the requirement to attend to T 1 (the attentional blink, or AB). One interesting exception occurs when T 1 is a brief gap in a continu-ous letter stream and the task is to discriminate its duration. One hy-pothesized explanation for this exception is that an AB is triggered only by attention to a <b>patterned</b> <b>object.</b> The results reported here eliminate this hypothesis. Duration judgments produced no AB whether the judged duration concerned a short gap in the letter stream (Experiment 1) or a letter presented for slightly longer than others (Experiment 2). When iden-tification of an identical longer letter T 1 was required (Experiment 3), rather than a duration judgment, the AB was reestablished. Direct percep-tual judgments of letter streams with gaps embedded showed that whereas brief gaps result in the percept of a single, briefly hesitating stream, longer gaps result in the percept of two separate streams with a sepa-rating pause. Correspondingly, an AB was produced in Experiment 4, when participants were required to judge the duration of longer T 1 gaps. We propose that, like spatially separated objects, temporal events are parsed into discrete, hierarchically organized events. An AB is trig-gered only when a new attended event is defined, either when a long pause creates a new perceived stream (Experiment 4) or when atten-tion shifts from the stream to the letter level (Experiment 3). The rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) attentional blink (AB) paradigm is a well-established means of investigating the temporal limi...|$|E

40|$|Term {{matching}} {{has become}} one of the most important primitive operations for symbolic computation. This paper describes the extension of the object-oriented symbolic computation system AlgBench with pattern matching and unification facilities. The various <b>pattern</b> <b>objects</b> are organized in subclasses of the class of the composite expressions. This leads to a clear design and to a distributed implementation of the pattern matcher in the subclasses. New <b>pattern</b> <b>object</b> classes can consequently be added easily to the system. Huet's and our simple mark and retract algorithm for standard unification as well as Stickel's algorithm for associative commutative unification have been implemented in an objectoriented style. Unifiers are selected at runtime. We extend Mathematica's type-constrained pattern matching by taking into account inheritance information from a user-defined hierarchy of object types. The argument unification is basically instance variable unification. The improvement of the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Pattern {{matching}} is {{an abstraction}} mechanism that can greatly simplify source code. We present functional-style pattern matching for C++ implemented as a library, called Mach 7 1. All the patterns are user-definable, {{can be stored}} in variables, passed among functions, and allow the use of class hierarchies. As an example, we implement common patterns used in functional languages. Our approach to pattern matching is based on compile-time composition of <b>pattern</b> <b>objects</b> through concepts. This is superior (in terms of performance and expressiveness) to approaches based on run-time composition of polymorphic <b>pattern</b> <b>objects.</b> In particular, our solution allows mapping functional code based on pattern matching directly into C++ and produces code that is only a few percent slower than hand-optimized C++ code. The library uses an efficient type switch construct, further extending it to multiple scrutinees and general patterns. We compare the performance of pattern matching to that of double dispatch and open multi-methods in C++...|$|R

To interpret the rich semantics in albums, we mine frequent <b>object</b> <b>patterns</b> in the training set, and then rank them by their discriminating power.

The pattern {{is intended for}} applications where collaborators on clients across a network work closely together. The Simple Shared <b>Object</b> <b>pattern</b> allows distributed applications to create, modify and delete shared objects on a corresponding server. The clients have copies of shared objects they use in their own address spaces. All modifications made to the primary copies on the server are propagated to clients having copies in their address spaces. The pattern is not designed for high traffic communication between concurrent running applications. Rather, it is designed for applications where some objects have to be shared across a network and where shared objects have to be synchronised and informed whenever a shared object changes. 1 Intent The Simple Shared <b>Object</b> <b>pattern</b> allows <b>object</b> sharing across networks.
