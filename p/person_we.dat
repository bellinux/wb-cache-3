500|$|Following the {{underground}} {{success of the}} band's second studio album Kerplunk (1992), {{a number of major}} record labels became interested in Green Day. Representatives of these labels attempted to entice the band to sign by inviting them for meals to discuss a deal, with one manager even inviting the group to Disneyland. The band declined these advances until meeting producer and Reprise representative Rob Cavallo. They were impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only <b>person</b> <b>we</b> could really talk to and connect with".|$|E

She posited that Collins plays the role with [...] "somber intensity", and [...] "brings a sense of curiosity about humans to the character". The angel's interactions with Dean were [...] "one {{of the highlights of}} the [...] season". She especially praised Collins for his dual role as Castiel and the angel's host Jimmy Novak in the episode [...] "The Rapture", and wrote, [...] "It is a tribute to Collins's acting that the audience knows immediately that the <b>person</b> <b>we</b> are seeing is not Castiel." ...|$|E

500|$|Kerplunks {{underground}} success led to {{a number}} of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only <b>person</b> <b>we</b> could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward." [...] After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.|$|E

One of his anthologies, Readings in American Poetry for the Use of Schools, was created specifically for that purpose. His knowledge in American poetry was emphasized by his claim that he had read every American poem published before 1850an estimated 500volumes. [...] "He has more literary patriotism, if the phrase be allowable... than any <b>person</b> <b>we</b> ever knew", wrote a contributor to Graham's. [...] "Since the Pilgrims landed, no man or woman has written anything on any subject which has escaped his untiring research."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Observer, co-creator Mark Gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding the right actor to play Dr John Watson than they had for the title character. Producer Sue Vertue said, [...] "Benedict was the only <b>person</b> <b>we</b> actually saw for [...] Sherlock... Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure we got the chemistry for John —and I think you get {{it as soon as}} they come into the room, you can see that they work together". Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson, and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that Matt Smith was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too [...] "barmy", as the producers required someone [...] "straighter" [...] for Watson. Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the Eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who.|$|E

His paintings were displayed publicly {{for the first time}} at the Glü Gallery in Los Angeles, from January 7, through February 11, 2006. He launched his first European art exhibition in 2011 at Peres Projects in Berlin. He enjoys reading on the set of his films. Pineapple Express producer Judd Apatow has said of him: [...] "He's a very education-minded <b>person.</b> <b>We</b> used to laugh because in between takes he'd be reading The Iliad on set. We still haven't read The Iliad. It was a very difficult book. With him, it was always James Joyce or something".|$|E
500|$|As the Chili Peppers' {{contract}} with EMI {{came to an}} end, they began {{looking for a new}} record company to release their next album. The group reached a consensus to go with Sony BMG/Epic, with the proviso that they buy out their last album from EMI. Even though the label promised it would take only a few days, the process stretched out into several months. Although a deal had been made with Sony/Epic, Mo Ostin of Warner Bros. Records called Kiedis to congratulate him on the successful deal, and complimented the rival record label. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "The coolest, most real <b>person</b> <b>we</b> had met during all these negotiations had just personally called to encourage me to make a great record for a rival company. That was the kind of guy I'd want to be working for." [...] The group pursued the idea, and eventually dropped the {{contract with}} Sony in favor of a deal with Warner Bros. Ostin called an old friend at EMI, who immediately allowed for the label transfer.|$|E

For a time, it was said that Willis was the [...] "most-talked-about author" [...] in the United States. Poe questioned Willis's fame, however. [...] "Willis is no genius–a graceful trifler–no more", he {{wrote in a letter to}} James Russell Lowell. [...] "In me, at least, he never excites an emotion." [...] Minor Southern writer Joseph Beckham Cobb wrote: [...] "No sane <b>person,</b> <b>we</b> are persuaded, can read his poetry".

Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of [...] "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" [...] respectively. The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. The Biography Channel said, [...] "Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before Dynasty, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R. Ewing's evil ways?" [...] The Boulevard Magazine said, It may be 2009 and seventeen years since the primetime drama Dallas went off the air, but memories of the Ewing family still linger. Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal – all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. At the center of it all was one of our favorite Ewings, the <b>person</b> <b>we</b> couldn't help but root for each week as she drank and slept her way through one ordeal after another.
