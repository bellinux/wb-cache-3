40|$|Needless to {{say that}} there is a high demand for maps on the {{internet}}. Several papers had dealt with issues on internet map use and the exploding numbers of hits on busy cartographic websites [7]. However, most of the presented maps are of low (carto) -graphical quality and none or little degree of interactivity. This fact is due to a lack of standardized technology and limited know−how in programming, graphics design and additional web−techniques. With the rise of SVG there is for the first time a technology at hand that allows to represent all graphical elements <b>producable</b> by graphics and cartographic−software with the additional advantages of high interaction possibilities and animation, all based on open and standardized file formats and programming languages.

40|$|Energy is a {{main input}} for economy. Because of an {{increase}} in other fossil fuels’ prices and it’s accepted as an important resource for energy supply for the countries which don’t have enough oil and natural gas resources, shale gas became a current issue in the world. Technically <b>producable</b> shale gas in the world is about 6. 621 bcm (billion cubic meter). We can say that this amount may be higher if unsought areas are added. Turkey is one of the countries which has shale gas potential. According to a report published by EIA in 2011, Turkey has approximately 424 billion cubic meter shale gas reserves. This shale gas potential can reduce Turkey’s energy dependence if we think of the fact that annual natural gas consumption of Turkey is 46 bcm. Despite all, production of shale gas has not been searched in terms of it’s advantages and disadvantages. The aim {{of this study is to}} present the advantages and disadvantages of shales gas for the world and Turkey. Reducing energy dependence, supporting a more clean energy than coal, balancing the oil prices are some advantages. Nevertheless, it’s a fossil fuel, it’s production is expensive and it gets negative social and environmental reactions...|$|E
40|$|Objectives of {{the project}} were to develop and {{investigate}} OFDM switching systems with a narrow channel spacing of 10 GHz and data rates of 140 Mbit/s. The demonstrator was comprised of optoelectronic frequency stages based on tunable heterodyne receivers and optoelectronic 3 D space stages containing 16 by 16 optical free space interconnection networks. It has been demonstrated that a stable operating OFDM-system using frequency multiplexing with narrow channel spacing (10 GHz) for {{a large number of}} channels (above 50) can be built. Commercially available components meet the requirements of the frequency selective tunable receivers. This holds for the heterodyne receiver as well as for a direct receiver. The 3 D space stage was performed as a compact multi-stage unit including optical interconnection networks for 1. 5 #mu#m wavelength between each electronic switching stages. The HHI designed the whole system, fabricated the arrays of Fresnel zone lenses incorporated in the optical interconnection network and combined all parts in the final set-up. Additional components were developed in cooperation with ANT Nachrichtentechnik GmbH, the Technical University Berlin, the Ferdinand-Braun-Institut and the University Erlangen-Nuernberg. It has been shown that free space interconnects without can be realized solely using the well known techniques and technologies of established industrial fabrication processes. Interconnection distances < 5 cm and data rates up to 10 Gbit/s are achievable when set-up tolerances do not exceed some #mu#m. Holographic optical elements with diffraction efficiencies above 8 % for 1. 5 #mu#m wavelength are <b>producable.</b> The fabrication of Fresnel zone lenses in quartz-glass and silicon has been performed using micro-structuring techniques of VLSI-fabrication whereas the deflection holograms in dichromated have been fabricated by optical holograph.

40|$|Summary In {{this work}} the {{question}} was to be pursued whether the enigmantic, nontranslated oncofetal human H 19 -RNA interacts specifically with proteins. For a longer time the possibility has been discussed that the H 19 gene serves only for the limiting regulation of the reciprocally imprinted growth factor IGF 2 and therefore the RNA might be without function and dispensable. However, later investigations indicate, that this RNA has a conserved secondary structure and that the sequence is under stabilizing pressure. The RNA occurs in proliferating tissue during differen-tiation in temporal and tissue-specific parallelism to IGF 2, whose mRNA level seems to be negatively influenced by the H 19 RNA. The suppression of proliferation shown in cell culture through {{the production of the}} H 19 RNA suggested a role as a tumor suppressor, whereas the occurrance in several tumors did not. From the beginning there was evidence that the RNA is associated with proteins, but none of them has been identified. The function of this structured RNA might be defined just through the interaction with proteins. For the identification of binding proteins the RNA must be <b>producable</b> in larger quantities. Therefore the cDNA was cloned using RACE-PCR in order to produce the RNA via in vitro transcription. Half of the obtained clones carried an enigmatic consenus sequence at the very 5 ´-end. All of the clones carried PCR-related point mutations. The attempt to isolate a complete and mutationless clone from a cDNA phage library failed. A chosen working clone was subcloned in order to minimize the additional sequences at the ends of the RNA and to generate a poly-A-tail at the 3 ´-end. The RNA was modified and immobilized using different methods but the most promising was the covalent binding to agarose for the construction of affinity columns. Finally, in the presence of heparin, specific placental binding proteins could be isolated and identified. These were PTB, hnRNP K, IMP 3 and c-myc-FUSE-BP, of these PTP and another member of the IMP-family (IMP 1) were confirmed by another publication (Runge et al., 2000). H 19 sense and antisense RNA seem to bind essentially the same proteins which still has to be investigated in more detail. For the future the effect of the H 19 binding on the activity of the proteins has to be investigated together with the identification of possible additional ligands in order to fully under-stand the growth-inhibiting and differentiating mode of action of the H 19 RNA.   </FONT...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas is an {{important}} energy source. Recently the world-wide consumption is rapidly increasing due to the growing demand caused by industrial growth and also by shifting to cleaner energy source driven environmental concerns. To satisfy demand also in the future, {{it is necessary to}} look for alternatives sources of supply of energy. An alternative could be the gas production from Natural Gas Hydrates (NGH), which are ice-like crystalline compounds that form from water and gas at low temperature and high pressure. NGH are found in subsurface either near the surface in arctic regions or in deep water marine environments. The estimated volume of NGH with respect to energy contains twice the amount of currently recoverable world-wide fossil fuels. IHC Merwede (IHC) is interested in the potential of deep sea mining of NGH. This defines the research question: “Is deep sea mining of gas hydrates from the sea floor and sediments feasible from a technological and economic perspective?” An extensive review of literature on NGH-deposits shows that they exist globally but occur predominantly {{around the edge of the}} continents in marginal marine basins and some in permafrost regions. The occurrence of hydrates depends on the temperature, pressure and the kind of gas. Depressurization, thermal- and chemical stimulation are three possible dissociation mechanisms for the production of hydrocarbon gases from NGH. For further research the Atwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico was chosen based on the high potential and available information about this site. This research was necessary to verify the technological and economic perspective of mining marine natural gas hydrates. The main conclusions concerning the technological perspective were identified: Deep sea mining of gas hydrate bearing sediments (GHBS) is possible from a technological point of view. However, for a reliable feasibility study on potential mining operations of GHBS more research into geological data needs to be done. Nevertheless, this study shows that existing know-how and equipment for deep-sea mining could be used to excavate GHBS. Thereby, future investigations should focus on the intermediate transport of the excavated sediment to a separation unit. Even though several technologies are available to remove liquids and solids from gases there are no operational plants to process GHBS. Compressed Natural Gas seems to be the best way to transport the gas from the mining site to its market. The main conclusions concerning the economic perspective were identified as: The project’s economic viability of the base case is negative. A sensitivity analysis (a relative change of +/- 30 % on the input variables) shows that the economic viability remains always negative. This is mainly caused by the high operating- and capital expenditures. Especially the CAPEX on the initial phase of the operation is high. The revenues are not high enough to offset these expenses. To make the mining economically attractive, the required gas price has to be almost ten times the current gas price of 4. 2 US$/mmBtu. Nevertheless this thesis provides insight into the various aspects of the recovery of natural gas from GHBS operated from a vessel. Based on the conclusions of this research it is recommended to: Do detailed research into: geotechnical properties of GHBS such as compressive-, tensile- and cohesive strength; the behaviour of NGH during extraction and vertical transportation; the environmental impact of physical mining of marine gas hydrates; the processing of GHBS; the <b>producable</b> reserves from NGH-deposits; and technological innovations to lower OPEX and CAPEX. The developed cash flow model for NGH-operations allows evaluating the financial parameters. Further research and development is recommended to optimise the model for other deep sea mining operations. Resources EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to extend the {{photosensitivity}} spectral range of fullerene/poly(3 -hexylthiophene) blend to NIR region by adding extra electron donor – hydroxygallium phthalocyanine (GaOHPc) with a strong and wide intermolecular charge transfer (CT) band around 830 nm. Multilayer cells of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/ 6 GaOHPc/P 3 HT: C 61 (CO 2 Et) 2 have been prepared by spin coating with vacuum evaporated Al or In top electrodes. Significant photosensitivity of the cells was in 370 - 900 nm spectral range. However charge carrier photogeneration efficiency was 3 times higher for illumination in P 3 HT absorption band as compared with the GaOHPc CT band at 830 nm. But when GaOHPc was mixed in the blend forming P 3 HT:C 61 (CO 2 Et) 2 :GaOHPc active layer its CT band shifted to infrared part at 875 nm. At the same time the charge carrier photogeneration efficiency for illumination in GaOHPc CT band increased significantly, exceeding its value for illumination in P 3 HT absorption band. The bulk heterojunction approach appears {{to be one of the}} most promising concepts of creating efficient, low cost and easy <b>producable</b> solar cells. For this purpose one of the best materials is regioregular poly- 3 -hexylthiophene (P 3 HT), which is widely used as a donor molecule and a whole transporter, with soluble fullerene derivatives as acceptors and electron transporters. Blends of these molecules in PV cells exhibit the efficiency of light power conversion up to 5 %. Still, it is not sufficient to meet realistic requirements for commercialization. The main drawback of this highly efficient blend is its limited spectral range, which covers 350 - 650 nm interval, allowing only ~ 35 % of the full solar spectrum energy to be used. In the present work we tried to extend the spectral range of the blend by adding hydroxygallium phthalocyanine (GaOHPc), which has a strong and wide intermolecular charge transfer (CT) absorption band around 830 nm. The choice of GaOHPc was dictated by the following reasons: 1) high thermal and chemical stability of phthalocyanines as compared with the most of molecular materials, 2) the NIR absorption provides the possibility to extend the photosensitivity spectral range (up to the NIR region) of the blend, 3) the CT character of the IR absorption band, which promises high efficiency of charge carrier photogeneration, 4) the solubility in chloroform, which allows its processing by spin coating. In this work we show that by adding GaOHPc to the P 3 HT-fullerene blend its photosensitivity spectral range can be extended in the NIR direction beyond 900 nm, while the efficiency of charge carrier photogeneration for illumination in the GaOHPc intermolecular CT band at 880 nm even exceeds its value for illumination in the P 3 HT absorption band. At the same time the CT band located for pure polycrystaline film at 830 nm shifts to 870 - 880 in the GaOHPc:P 3 HT: C 61 (CO 2 Et) 2 blend with the weight ratio of components being (1 : 1 : 2). The paper discusses the problems connected with the electrodes and the built-in electric field in the sample as the cause of low external quantum efficiency (EQE) of photocurrent. For host polymer and hole transporter regioregular poly 3 -hexylthiophene (P 3 HT) with an average molecular weight of 87000 (Sigma Aldrich) was chosen. As extra donor for increasing the photosensitivity spectral range of the blend hydroxygallium phthalocyanine (GaOHPc) (Fig. 1.) was synthesized according to Yamasaki et al. Fig. 1 : Chemical structure of used organic molecules For the electron acceptor, the soluble C 60 derivative (C 61 (CO 2 Et) 2) shown in Fig. 1 was synthesised. As the sample substrate, ITO-covered glass with Rsu= 4 - 8 Ohm/Sq (purchased from Delta Technologies) was used. The ITO electrode was covered with a 50 - 100 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer by spin coating at 4000 rpm, applying the acceleration of 3000 rpm۰s- 1, followed by two types of photosensitive organic layers: 1 st type – a pure GaOHPc film formed using 6 -fold deposition by spin coating of GaOHPc from it...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the technical and economic feasibility of using CO 2 for the enhanced production of coal bed methane (ECBM) in the Netherlands. This concept could lead to both CO 2 storage by adsorbing CO 2 in deep coal layers that are not suitable for mining, as well as production of methane. For every two molecules of CO 2 injected, roughly one molecule of methane is produced. The work included {{an investigation of the}} potential CBM reserves in the Dutch underground and the related CO 2 storage potential in deep coal layers. The latter was also supported by laboratory experiments on the adsorption capacity of coal. Furthermore, an economic evaluation of ECBM recovery was made by analysing the costs of capturing CO 2 from major stationary sources and CO 2 transport, modelling the production of ECBM using CO 2 injection with reservoir simulations and system analyses to investigate the costs (and it's sensitivities) of gas production. Furthermore, the costs of on-site hydrogen and power production (including on site CO 2 removal and injection) were evaluated. CO 2 sources in the Netherlands have been inventoried. Annually 3. 4 Mtonne CO 2 can be captured from chemical installations and transported to sequestration locations at 15 /tonne. Another 55 Mtonne from power generating facilities can be delivered at 40 to 80 /tonne. The technical potential of CBM in the Dutch underground is significant: a maximum reserve of about 60 EJ is stored in coal layers up to a depth of 2000 m. This figure should be compared to the current annual energy consumption of the Netherlands (about 3 EJ) or the known reserves of natural gas in the Netherlands (about 70 EJ in 1994). These reserves are concentrated in four main areas in the Netherlands: Zuid Limburg, the Peel area, the Achterhoek area and Zeeland. The CO 2 storage potential could be about 8 Gtonne. This storage potential should be compared to the annual CO 2 emissions of the Netherlands: about 180 Mtonne. This means, theoretically, that the total CO 2 emissions of the Netherlands could be stored in coal layers for over 40 years and that CBM could meet the total national energy demand of the Netherlands for 20 years. However, it is still uncertain to what extent these reserves can be accessed. With conservative assumptions regarding the potential completion and recovery rate of CBM from coal layers by means of drilling and CO 2 injection, as well as by limiting the ECBM recovery to a depth range of 500 [...] 1500 metres, the 'proven' reserves could be limited to 0. 3 EJ and the 'possible' reserves up to about 3. 9 EJ. The accompanying CO 2 that can be sequestrated than lays between 54 Mtonne and 0. 6 Gtonne. Although those figures are far more modest than the 'theoretical' potential, they are still significant. In case the 'possible' reserves can be accessed, ECBM could supply 5 % of the current national energy use on a more than carbon neutral basis for over 25 years. Given the Kyoto targets for 2010, or the national targets for renewable energy, this is a very significant amount. Without any subsidies or carbon taxes, the cost levels for ECBM recovery ranges from 3. 5 to 6. 5 /GJ methane produced. These costs levels come close to the projected natural gas prices in Europe in a timeframe of 10 to 20 years, which are projected to be between 2. 5 and 3. 2 /GJ. Inclusion of a carbon tax (or bonus) of 25 /tonne CO 2 sequestrated, lowers the price of ECBM to a competitive 1. 5 to 4 ?/GJ. The cost level of CO 2 sequestration through ECBM is comparable with projected cost levels for CO 2 storage in aquifer traps(Steinberg and Cheng 1989) in case the CBM would be sold for current natural gas prices. If the produced CBM is used for electricity or hydrogen production on top of the CBM field, the resulting CO 2 can be injected in the coal directly (thereby eliminating CO 2 transport costs). CO 2 removal from a gas engine or a combined cycle is currently more expensive when compared to CO 2 from industrial processes that must be transported to the CBM field. But a (SOFC) fuel cell produces a pure and therefore much cheaper CO 2 stream. Although SOFC fuel cells are not fully commercially available and have high capital costs, they could lead to somewhat lower costs of electricity. Without CO 2 bonus, on site power generation is more expensive than grid prices for the systems considered. But when a CO 2 bonus of 25 /tonne CO 2 is assumed, power generation costs are reduced below 3 cent/kWh, which is lower than the current average 3. 2 cent/kWh. On the longer term, when SOFC fuel cells could become cheaper, on site power generation could become a (very) attractive alternative. On site (smaller scale) hydrogen production gives similar results. Capital costs for smaller scale on site hydrogen production are relatively high, but with a CO 2 bonus of 25 /tonne, hydrogen costs could be lower than current production costs from coal and comparable to production costs from natural gas. Overall, the results of the economic evaluation indicate that CBM by means of enhanced recovery by CO 2 injection in deep coal layers can be performed at competitive cost levels when the right system configurations are chosen. A, relatively modest, carbon tax (or 'bonus') of 25 /tonne could easily tick the balance in favour of ECBM recovery in Dutch conditions on short term already. However, a number of important (geo) technical and geological factors {{play a key role in}} whether these cost levels can be obtained or not. The dominating factors in the costs are the drilling costs. In case the costs per wellhead appear to be higher than assumed here, the economic performance of the system deteriorates. On the other hand innovations in drilling techniques, gaining more experience with the required drilling methods over time and obtaining 'economies of scale' by drilling relatively large numbers of wells in a short time to exploit larger CBM fields may bring drilling costs (and thus CBM production costs) down considerably. Regarding to the geology, the CBM potential and the actual accessibility of the, theoretical, coal reserves and the predicted presence of <b>producable</b> CBM gas in the coal layers is subject to broad ranges. More detailed surveys of the Dutch underground are needed to reduce uncertainties about CBM gas reserves. This can be obtained by seismic research and obtaining more and better samples of the Dutch underground. Such research is absolutely essential before ECBM is developed in the Netherlands on a significant scale. In conclusion, this study showed that ECBM is likely to become an economically feasible option for the Netherlands on relatively short term. It could at least play a significant (and potentially very large) role in reducing greenhouse gas emission levels for a time period of about 50 years. Although the estimates of energy reserves in the form of CBM are uncertain, they are potentially very significant (varying from 6 [...] 60 EJ). The potential CO 2 storage capacity is (very) large as well (1 - 8 Gtonne of CO 2). Given the fact that CO 2 binds well to the coal matrix, that deep coal layers are unlikely to be accessed for mining or other activities in the future and that CO 2 storage with ECBM delivers a clean fossil fuel as a by-product, coal layers may be a preferable CO 2 storage medium when compared to (saline) aquifers, empty gas fields or in deep oceans. Therefore, this option deserves further development and study. A mix of more detailed geological surveys combined with getting good quality samples, laboratory experiments, system studies on implementation scenarios and a pilot project (with a special focus on drilling techniques) is recommended...|$|E
