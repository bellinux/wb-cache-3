25|$|<b>Psychoacoustics</b> is the {{scientific}} study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including noise, speech and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of psychophysics. <b>Psychoacoustics</b> received its name from a field within psychology—i.e., recognition science—which deals with all kinds of human perceptions. It is an interdisciplinary field of many areas, including psychology, acoustics, electronic engineering, physics, biology, physiology, and computer science.|$|E
40|$|The term "remote <b>psychoacoustic</b> {{experiments}} " {{describes the}} situation that- {{in contrast to}} traditional <b>psychoacoustic</b> experiments- the experimenter and the subject are located in different places, like different offices, buildings, cities, countries, continents. In essence, the <b>psychoacoustic</b> experiment is performed via internet. In particular, calibration problems have to be solved that the (remote) subject is presented the sounds at appropriate level, at least approximately. For the example of audio-visual interactions, the setup and calibration procedure are described in detail. Results from remote <b>psychoacoustic</b> experiments concerning perceived loudness differences of trains in different colour, but at same SPL are compared to data for traditional <b>psychoacoustic</b> experiments with the same stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a new {{design of a}} <b>psychoacoustic</b> model for audio coding following the model used in the standard MPEG- 1 audio layer 3 using an appropriate wavelet packet decomposition of the speech/audio signal. The design of a <b>psychoacoustic</b> model is achieved by wavelet packet decomposition whose connections are selected {{in such a way}} that sub bands correspond to the best possible one to the critical bands. For that, we used gammachirp wavelet packet because gammachirp filter underwent a good success in <b>psychoacoustic</b> research. In order to investigate this new design of a <b>psychoacoustic</b> model based on wavelet packet decomposition, we proceed to some experimental results: the distribution curve of masking threshold for tone at 1 kHz and for a real complex signal were calculated by utilizing the two different <b>psychoacoustic</b> models respectively, the old one based on FFT analysis and the newest one based on wavelet packet analysis especially gammachirp wavelet packet. Also, we show some gammachirp scalograms of some audio sounds...|$|R

25|$|During encoding, 576 time-domain {{samples are}} taken and are {{transformed}} to 576 frequency-domain samples. If {{there is a}} transient, 192 samples are taken instead of 576. This is done to limit the temporal spread of quantization noise accompanying the transient. (See <b>psychoacoustics.)</b> Frequency resolution {{is limited by the}} small long block window size, which decreases coding efficiency. Time resolution can be too low for highly transient signals and may cause smearing of percussive sounds.|$|E

25|$|Windows Media Audio (WMA) is {{the most}} common codec of the four WMA codecs. Colloquial usage of the term WMA, {{especially}} in marketing materials and device specifications, usually refers to this codec only. The first version of the codec released in 1999 is regarded as WMA 1. In the same year, the bit stream syntax, or compression algorithm, was altered in minor ways and became WMA 2. Since then, newer versions of the codec have been released, but the decoding process remained the same, ensuring compatibility between codec versions. WMA is a lossy audio codec based on the study of <b>psychoacoustics.</b> Audio signals that are deemed to be imperceptible to the human ear are encoded with reduced resolution during the compression process.|$|E

25|$|<b>Psychoacoustics</b> {{is applied}} within many fields from {{software}} development, where developers map proven and experimental mathematical patterns; in digital signal processing, where many audio compression codecs such as MP3 and Opus use a psychoacoustic model to increase compression ratios; {{in the design}} of (high end) audio systems for accurate reproduction of music in theatres and homes; as well as defense systems where scientists have experimented with limited success in creating new acoustic weapons, which emit frequencies that may impair, harm, or kill. It is also applied today within music, where musicians and artists continue to create new auditory experiences by masking unwanted frequencies of instruments, causing other frequencies to be enhanced. Yet another application is {{in the design of}} small or lower-quality loudspeakers, which can use the phenomenon of missing fundamentals to give the effect of bass notes at lower frequencies than the loudspeakers are physically able to produce (see references).|$|E
25|$|Music {{therapy is}} a non verbal {{approach}} to the person using instruments and music in general, the use of interventions to accomplish individual goals within a therapeutic relationship by a professional who has completed an approved music therapy program. Music therapy {{is one of the}} expressive therapies, consisting of a process in which a music therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients improve their physical and mental health. Music therapists primarily help clients improve their health in several domains, such as cognitive functioning, motor skills, emotional development, social skills, and quality of life by using both active and passive music experiences such as free improvisation, song, dance, listening, and discussion of music to achieve treatment goals. There is a wide qualitative and quantitative research literature base which incorporates clinical therapy, psychotherapy, biomusicology, musical acoustics, music theory, <b>psychoacoustics,</b> embodied music cognition, aesthetics of music, sensory integration, and comparative musicology. Referrals to music therapy services may be made by other health care professionals. Clients can also choose to pursue music therapy services without a referral (i.e., self-referral).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{scalable}} perceptual audio compression. Two scalable perceptual solutions {{as well as}} a scalable to lossless solution are proposed and investigated. One of the scalable perceptual solutions is built around sinusoidal modelling of the audio signal whilst the other is built on a transform coding paradigm. The scalable coders are shown to scale both in a waveform matching manner {{as well as a}} <b>psychoacoustic</b> manner. In order to measure the <b>psychoacoustic</b> scalability of the systems investigated in this thesis, the similarity between the original signal 2 ̆ 7 s <b>psychoacoustic</b> parameters and that of the synthesized signal are compared. The <b>psychoacoustic</b> parameters used are loudness, sharpness, tonahty and roughness. This analysis technique is a novel method used in this thesis and it allows an insight into the perceptual distortion that has been introduced by any coder analyzed in this manner...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{quality is}} a complex perceptual measure {{depending}} on several factors, which can often be associated with more basic <b>psychoacoustic</b> measures such as roughness, sharpness, tonality or loudness. One frequently used method for modeling {{the overall quality of}} sounds is therefore to fit a linear combination of <b>psychoacoustic</b> measures to subjectively measured data of quality. The <b>psychoacoustic</b> measures are usually calculated using standards or descriptions from literature references. However, these standards or references may not always be accurate for the specific class of sounds for which sound quality shall be determined. In this study we therefore applied this method to subjectively measured <b>psychoacoustic</b> measures and compared the results to data from instrumental measures and to data from literature. By means of regression analyses model approaches were derived from parts of the data and used to predict another part of the data for validation. The results indicate that subjectively measured basic <b>psychoacoustic</b> measures are not always in line with standardized calculation procedures, and that subjectively measured annoyance can be predicted quite well by subjectively measured sharpness, loudness, roughness and tonality. These data serve as benchmarks for further model approaches and underline the general applicability of this method...|$|R

40|$|A <b>psychoacoustic</b> model which approximates {{the masked}} {{threshold}} evoked by complex sounds is presented.

First results obtained with the <b>psychoacoustic</b> model for controlling the quantizers of the ISO MPEG Layer 3 coder are discussed. 1 Introduction Significant improvements of high quality audio bit rate reduction have been achieved by considering {{the properties of the}} human auditory perception. This is generally realized by the introduction of a <b>psychoacoustic</b> model which generates the masked threshold evoked by a sound signal and which controls the quantizers of a coding system. The masked threshold for quantization errors is defined as the maximum level of quantization noise which is just non audible {{in the presence of a}} masking sound.
