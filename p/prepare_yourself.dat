During his tenure he dealt with student unrest and a drop in cadet enrollment that eventually compelled Norwich to merge with Vermont College in Montpelier, Vermont. The Vermont College student body was predominantly women, sparking apprehension that Norwich might lose its military character.

2500|$|Many Nisei {{worked to}} prove {{themselves}} as loyal American citizens. Of the 20,000 Japanese Americans {{who served in the}} Army during World War II, [...] "many Japanese-American soldiers had gone to war to fight racism at home" [...] and they were [...] "proving with their blood, their limbs, and their bodies that they were truly American". It was not only men either, some one hundred Nisei women volunteered for the WAC (Woman's Army Corps), where, after undergoing rigorous basic training, they had assignments as typists, clerks, and drivers. Satoshi Ito, an internment camp survivor, reinforces the idea of the immigrants’ children striving to demonstrate their patriotism to the United States. He notes that his mother would tell him, [...] "‘you’re here in the United States, you need to do well in school, you need to <b>prepare</b> <b>yourself</b> to get a good job when you get out into the larger society’". He said she would tell him, [...] "‘don’t be a dumb farmer like me, like us’" [...] to encourage Ito to successfully assimilate into American society. As a result, he worked exceptionally hard to excel in school and later became a professor at the College of William & Mary. His story, along with the countless Japanese Americans willing to risk their lives in war, demonstrate the lengths many in their community went to prove their American patriotism.|$|E

This is followed by a two-minute passage dominated by Nick Mason's drum solo, with rototoms and backgrounded by a tick-tock sound created by Roger Waters picking two muted strings on his bass. With David Gilmour singing lead on the verses and with Richard Wright singing lead on the bridges and with female singers and Gilmour providing backup vocals, the song's lyrics deal with Roger Waters' realization that life was not about <b>preparing</b> <b>yourself</b> for what happens next, but about grabbing control of your own destiny.|$|R
40|$|Load {{forecasting}} is {{the procedure}} to predict future loading conditions on a power system. Using simulation software such as ETAP {{you are able}} to predict abnormal voltage conditions, overloading of certain equipment, as well as determine protective equipment from short circuit studies. This study consisted of a 115 kV loop network with multiple loading busses and one infinite bus. There was no separate generation other than the infinite bus. As load increased from forecasting to the future voltage dropped. To restore voltage levels capacitors were added at strategic points in the system to boost the voltage back up. <b>Preparing</b> <b>yourself</b> for the future in power systems is crucial to be able to efficiently and safely run the system...|$|R
