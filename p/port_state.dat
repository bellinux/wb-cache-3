25|$|In 1978, {{a number}} of European {{countries}} agreed in The Hague on a memorandum that agreed to audit whether the labour conditions on board vessels were {{according to the rules}} of the ILO. After the Amoco Cadiz sank that year, it was decided to also audit on safety and pollution. To this end, in 1982 the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (Paris MoU) was agreed upon, establishing <b>Port</b> <b>State</b> Control, nowadays consisting of 24 European countries and Canada. In practice, this was a reaction on the failure of the flag states - especially flags of convenience that have delegated their task to classification societies - to comply with their inspection duties.|$|E

Using frequent periodic communications among the fisheries enforcement agencies of its members, ENFO coordinates information on patrol schedules and joint ship patrols, personnel exchanges, flag State enforcement and <b>port</b> <b>State</b> inspection actions, and on unauthorized fishing activities conducted by vessels without nationality operating in the Convention Area.|$|E

Resulting from strong political and public outcry over the Amoco Cadiz sinking, fourteen European nations signed the 1982 Paris Memorandum of Understanding on <b>Port</b> <b>State</b> Control or Paris MOU. Under <b>port</b> <b>state</b> control, ships in international trade became subject to inspection by the states they visit. In addition to shipboard living and working conditions, these inspections cover items concerning the safety of life at sea and the prevention of pollution by ships. In cases when a <b>port</b> <b>state</b> inspection uncovers problems with a ship, the <b>port</b> <b>state</b> may take actions including detaining the ship. In 2015, member states of the Paris MOU conducted 17,858 inspections with deficiencies, which resulted in 595 detained vessels and 11 banned. Member states of the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding conducted 17,269 ship inspections in 2015, recording 83,606 deficiencies which resulted in 1,153 detentions.|$|E

China has emerged as the world×³s largest shipbuilder, the largest seafarers supplying country, one of the world×³s largest ship-owners, and one of the largest <b>port</b> <b>states.</b> Therefore, the Convention has perhaps more significant impact on China than any other country. Until now, China has not yet ratified the Convention.
