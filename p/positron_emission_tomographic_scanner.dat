40|$|AbstractObjective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prognostic significance of perfusion-metabolism imaging in patients undergoing <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography for myocardial viability assessment. Background. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography using nitrogen- 13 ammonia and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose to assess myocardial blood flow and metabolism has been shown to predict improvement in wall motion after coronary artery revascularization. The prognostic implications of metabolic imaging in patients with advanced coronary artery disease have not been investigated. Methods. Eighty-two patients with advanced coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function underwent <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> imaging between August 1988 and March 1990 to assess myocardial viability before coronary artery revascularization. Results. Forty patients underwent successful revascularization. Patients who exhibited evidence of metabolically compromised myocardium by <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography (decreased blood flow with preserved metabolism) who did not undergo subsequent revascularization were more likely to experience a myocardial infarction, death, cardiac arrest or late revascularization due to development of new symptoms than were the other patient groups (p < 0. 01). Concordantly decreased flow and metabolism in segments of previous infarction did not affect outcome in patients with or without subsequent revascularization. Those with a compromised myocardium who did undergo revascularization were more likely to experience an improvement in functional class than were patients with preoperative <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> findings of concordant decrease in flow and metabolism.

Its value in acute myocardial infarction has not been studied extensively. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-two patients receiving thrombolytic therapy were studied. Myocardial tissue flow and metabolism were measured at 5 days and 3 months. Recovery of left ventricular function was investigated with echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography. In eight patients, normal flow was found in the infarct area at 5 days with no significant changes in flow, metabolism or function over the next 3 months. In 54 patients, impaired regional myocardial blood flow in the infarct zone was observed at 5 days. In 39 patients, there was a matching <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> pattern, while in 15 the pattern was mismatched. None of the patients with a TIMI flow grade < 3 revealed recovery of left ventricular function.

Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients with biopsy-proven malignant mesothelioma underwent <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> scanning. The results of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> imaging were compared with results obtained by computed tomography, mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, and pathologic examination of surgical specimens.

MethodsPatients with cT 1 /cT 2 tumors of 2 cm or less in size were retrospectively reviewed. All had a computed tomographic scan, as well as a <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> scan on a dedicated scanner, with a standard uptake value reported. A standard uptake value of 2. 5 g/mL or greater was considered positive. The results of computed tomography and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography were correlated with pathologic results after either resection (n = 60) or mediastinoscopy (n = 4). ResultsSixty-four patients (38 women; mean age, 66 years) had a mean tumor size of 1. 4 cm (range, 0. 7 - 2. 0 cm). Forty-three patients had adenocarcinoma, 13 had adenocarcinoma–bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, 5 had squamous cell carcinoma, and 3 had other tumor types. Twenty-nine (45 %) tumors had negative <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> results.

Methods: We studied 93 consecutive patients with severe coronary artery disease and low ejection fraction (median, 25 %) who underwent <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography to delineate the extent of perfusion-metabolism mismatch (reflecting hibernating myocardium) for potential myocardial revascularization. Median follow-up was 4 years (range, 0 to 6. 2 years). Results: Fifty patients received medical therapy, and 43 patients underwent bypass grafting. In Cox survival models, heart failure class, prior myocardial infarction, and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> mismatch were the best predictors of survival. Patients with <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> mismatch receiving bypass grafting had improved 4 -year survival compared with those on medical therapy (75 % versus 30 %; P =. 007) and a significant improvement in angina and heart failure symptoms. In patients without <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> mismatch, bypass grafting tended to improve survival and symptoms only in those patients with severe angina (100 % versus 60 %; P =. 085), whereas no survival advantage was apparent in patients with minimal or no anginal symptoms (63 % versus 52 %; P =. 462).

MethodsSeventy-eight patients with non–small cell lung cancer who were potential candidates for surgical resection and admitted to the thoracic surgery unit of our hospital from March 2006 to June 2008 joined this prospective study. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomographic–computed <b>tomographic</b> scanning was performed as part of the prospective studies used to diagnose or stage the tumors.

Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of mediastinal lymph node involvement in patients undergoing thoracic computed tomographic scanning were 45. 4 %, 80. 5 %, 27. 7 %, and 90 %, respectively.

This report introduces a kinetic model that relates 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> scanning results to {{specific aspects of}} cardiac sympathoneural function. Inputs were the 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine concentration in arterial blood and the estimated contribution of circulating metabolites of 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine. All of the three compartments in the model were intraneuronal. Two compartments corresponded to vesicles in sympathetic nerves, consistent with the "multiple vesicular pool" hypothesis from preclinical studies. The model successfully fit the empirical time-activity curve for myocardial 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity and predicted correctly the effects of several neuropharmacological and physiological manipulations on the time-activity curve.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether angiographically visualized collateral vessels in patients with chronic coronary artery disease imply the presence of viable myocardium in asynergic regions subtended by completely occluded coronary arteries. Background. Patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are being considered for revascularization frequently exhibit angiographically visualized collateral vessels to completely occluded coronary arteries supplying seventy asynergic myocardial regions. However, {{little is known about}} the relation between angiographic collateral flow and myocardial viability in these patients. Methods. We studied 42 patients with 78 completely occluded coronary arteries supplying asynergic territories. Angiographic collateral vessels were interpreted as absent (grade 1) in 14 patients, minimal (grade 2) in 27 and well developed (grade 3) in 37. Myocardial viability was determined with <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography using nitrogen- 13 (N- 13) ammonia and fluorine- 18 (F- 18) deoxyglucose lor assessment of regional perfusion and glucose uptake, respectively. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> patterns were interpreted as mismatch (perfusion defect with enhanced F- 18 deoxyghicose uptake); transmural match (severe concordant reduction or absence of both perfusion and F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake) or nontransmural match (mild to moderate concordant reduction of both perfusion and F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake). Results. There was no significant correlation (p = 0. 14) between the severity of perfusion deficit assessed by <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography and the collateral grade. The extent of mismatch was unrelated to either the presence or the magnitude of collateral vessels. Conversely, with increasing collateral vessels from grade 1 to 3, the total extent of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> match remained similar, whereas the ratio of transmural to nontransmural match decreased. Myocardial viability was usually present in severely hypokinetic regions (82 %). It was lower in akinetic-dyskinetic regions (49 %). Of the 64 regions with angiographic collateral vessels, 37 (58 %) (95 % confidence interval [CI] 46 % to 70 %) showed <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> mismatch. In contrast, 7 (50 %) of 14 (95 % CI 24 % to 76 %) regions without collateral vessels on angiography exhibited <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> mismatch. The presence of angtographically visualized collateral vessels was a sensitive (84 %) but not specific (21 %) marker of viability. Conclusions. In patients with chronic coronary artery disease, angtographically visualized collateral vessels to asynergc myocardial regions subtended by occluded coronary arteries do not always imply the presence of viable myocardium, suggesting that revascularization may not always provide a functional benefit...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEvaluation of {{regional}} myocardial blood flow by conventional scintigraphic techniques {{is limited to}} the qualitative assessment {{of regional}} tracer distribution.

To test this hypothesis, <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> imaging in combination with N- 13 ammonia was performed at rest and after pharmacologically induced vasodilation in seven healthy volunteers. Myocardial and blood time-activity curves derived from regions of interest over the heart and ventricular chamber were fitted using a three compartment model for N- 13 ammonia, yielding rate constants for tracer uptake and retention. Myocardial blood flow (K 1) averaged 88 ± 17 ml/min per 100 g at rest and increased to 417 ± 112 ml/min per 100 g after dipyridamole infusion (0. 56 mg/kg) and handgrip exercise. The coronary reserve averaged 4. 8 ± 1. 3 and was not significantly different in the septal, anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle. Blood flow values showed only a minor dependence on the correction for blood metabolites of N- 13 ammonia. These data demonstrate that quantification of regional myocardial blood flow is feasible by dynamic <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> imaging. The observed coronary flow reserve after dipyridamole is in close agreement with the results obtained by invasive techniques, indicating accurate flow estimates over a wide range.

BACKGROUNDPatients with HCM often have clinical findings consistent with increased cardiac sympathetic outflow. Little {{is known about the}} status of sympathetic innervation specifically in hypertrophic regions. METHODSWe conducted <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> (PET) scanning using the perfusion imaging agent 13 N-ammonia (13 NH 3) and the sympathoneuronal imaging agent 6 -[18 F]-fluorodopamine (18 F-FDA) in 8 patients with HCM and 15 normal volunteers. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> data corrected for attenuation and the partial volume effect were analyzed using the region-of-interest technique. RESULTSMyocardial 13 NH 3 -derived radioactivity was similar in hypertrophied and nonhypertrophied regions of patients with HCM and in normal volunteers. At all time points, the 18 F: 13 N ratio was lower in hypertrophied than in nonhypertrophied regions of HCM patients and in the septum of normal volunteers (p = 0. 001). Trends in 18 F-FDA-derived radioactivity over time were normal in both hypertrophied and nonhypertrophied myocardium. CONCLUSIONSThe results are consistent with decreased neuronal uptake of catecholamines in hypertrophied but not in nonhypertrophied myocardium of patients with HCM. Other aspects of cardiac sympathoneural function seem normal. Decreased neuronal uptake could reflect local relative hypoinnervation, decreased numbers of neuronal uptake sites, or metabolic limitations on cell membrane transport. By enhancing norepinephrine delivery to adrenoceptors for a given amount of sympathetic nerve traffic, decreased neuronal uptake can explain major clinical features of HCM...|$|R

Follow-up <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> scanning was performed in a subgroup ≤ 18 months after the stroke event. Standardized uptake value ratios for regions of interest were analyzed after coregistration. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were imaged with (11) C-PiB <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography. There was an increase in (11) C-PiB accumulation in the stroke area compared with a reference region in the contralesional hemisphere, which was not statistically significant (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0. 07 [95 % confidence interval, - 0. 06 to 0. 123]; P= 0. 452). There was no significant increase in the accumulation of (11) C-PiB in the peri-infarct region or in the ipsilesional hemisphere (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0. 04 [95 % confidence interval, - 0. 02 to 0. 10]; P= 0. 095). We repeated (11) C-PiB <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography in 21 patients and found a significant reduction in accumulation of (11) C-PiB between regions of interest (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, - 0. 08 [95 % confidence interval, - 0. 23 to - 0. 03]; P= 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant increase in (11) C-PiB accumulation in or around the infarct. There was no increase in ipsilesional hemispheric (11) C-PiB accumulation over time. We found no evidence that infarction leads to sustained or increased β-amyloid deposition ≤ 18 months after stroke...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveBronchioloalveolar {{carcinoma}} is a clinically heterogeneous subtype of non–small cell lung carcinoma {{that frequently}} has low 2 -[18 F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) uptake on <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> scanning. We investigated whether tumor FDG avidity {{was associated with}} worse survival among patients with completely resected node-negative pure and mixed bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. MethodsWe performed a cohort study of 36 patients who had completely resected pure and mixed bronchioloalveolar carcinoma between 1998 and 2004, who had no hilar or mediastinal lymph node metastases, and who had undergone a preoperative <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> scan. Tumor FDG avidity {{was defined as a}} standardized uptake value of 2. 5 or greater. Survival analysis was performed with a proportional hazards model. ResultsOf 36 patients studied, 26 patients (72 %) were alive and 10 patients (28 %) were dead after a median follow-up of 31 months (interquartile range 17 - 41 months). Seventeen patients (47 %) had FDG-avid tumors, and 19 patients (53 %) had non-avid tumors. Three-year survival was 49 % in the FDG-avid group and 95 % in the non-avid group (P =. 005). FDG avidity had a hazard ratio of death of 8. 6 (95 % confidence interval 1. 4 - 244. 7, P =. 02) after adjusting for tumor size, the presence of multifocal bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and the presence of histologically mixed bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. ConclusionsPreoperative tumor FDG standardized uptake value of 2. 5 or greater on <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography is a powerful predictor of long-term mortality in patients with lymph node–negative pure and mixed bronchioloalveolar carcinoma who undergo complete surgical resection. Patients {{with a high level of}} FDG uptake (standardized uptake value ≥ 2. 5) may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or more frequent clinical follow-up...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{evaluated}} the safety, efficacy {{and validity of}} 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> scanning of cardiac sympathetic innervation and function in humans. Methods. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> (PET) scans, arterial blood and urine were obtained after a 3 -min intravenous infusion of 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine (1 to 4 mCi, 188 to 809 mCi/mmol) in healthy volunteers, with or without pretreatment with oral desipramine to inhibit neuronal uptake of catecholamines. Results. 6 -[18 F]Fluorodopamine PET scanning visualized the left ventricular myocardium. Blood pressure increased slightly and transiently. The estimated absorbed radiation dose to the main target organ, {{the wall of the}} urinary bladder, was 0. 8 to 1. 0 rad/mCi of injected 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine. By 24 h after the injection, the main 6 F-compound in urine was 6 F-vanillylmandelic acid, a metabolite of 6 F-norepinephrine. Desipramine attenuated accumulation of myocardial 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity and plasma 6 Fdihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Conclusions. 6 -[18 F]Fluorodopamine produces negligible hemodynamic effects and acceptable radiation exposure at doses that visualize the left ventricular myocardium. Sympathetic nerves take up 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine, which is translocated from the axoplasm into storage vesicles, where is it beta-hydroxylated to the fluorinated analogue of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Therefore, the basis for visualization of myocardium after 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine injection in humans is radiolabeling by 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine and 6 -[18 F]fluoronorepinephrine of vesicles in sympathetic terminals. 6 -[18 F]Fluorodopamine PET scanning provides a novel means for assessing sympathetic innervation and function noninvasively in the human heart...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of fluconazole in tissue of human volunteers {{was determined by}} <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> scanning over a 2 -h period following the infusion of a tracer dose of 18 F-fluconazole (5 to 7 mCi) plus 400 mg of unlabeled drug (the standard daily dose of fluconazole). Previous studies have validated this approach for animals. From serial <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> imaging and blood sampling, pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in tissue were determined. There was significant {{distribution of}} the radiolabeled drug in all organs studied, with nearly constant levels achieved by 1 h. Plateau concentrations of fluconazole in key organs (micrograms per gram) included the following: whole brain, 4. 92 +/- 0. 17; heart, 6. 98 +/- 0. 20; lung, 7. 81 +/- 0. 46; liver, 12. 94 +/- 0. 24; spleen, 22. 96 +/- 2. 5; kidney, 11. 23 +/- 0. 61; prostate, 8. 24 +/- 0. 58; and blood, 3. 76 +/- 0. 30. Since levels of fluconazole of > 6 micrograms/g are needed to treat infection with most strains of Candida and levels of > 10 micrograms/g are needed for Cryptococcus neoformans, Coccidioides immitis, and Histoplasma capsulatum, the following predictions can be made. The current standard dose of 400 mg/day should be more than adequate {{in the treatment of}} urinary tract and hepatosplenic candidiasis but problematic in the treatment of candidal osteomyelitis, even with the higher levels that develop after multiple doses. Similarly, higher doses should be considered, particularly in immunocompromised patients, with infection with C. neoformans, H. capsulatum, and C. immitis that involves the central nervous and musculoskeletal systems...|$|R
40|$|WE DESCRIBE A {{technique}} that allows target definition for stereotactic brain biopsy using coordinates calculated on stereotactic <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> (PET) images. In this study, PET images were obtained using -labeled fluorodeoxyglucose, a marker for glucose metabolism. The difference between PET-calculated and actual stereotactic coordinates of simulated targets is within PET spatial resolution. Combined computed tomography- and PET-guided stereotactic biopsies were performed in 11 patients with brain tumors. In this report, we describe two representative patients who underwent stereotactic brain biopsy using the present technique. Because of the complementary role of PET and computed tomography, their integration in multimodality planning might optimize the target selection for stereotactic brain biopsies.

40|$|Carbon dioxide {{inhalation}} {{can be used}} to map {{changes in}} cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2) during neuronal activation with functional MRI (fMRI). A hypercapnic stress also can be achieved with a simple breath-holding test. Using this test as means of manipulating cerebral blood flow (CBF) independent of CMRO 2, we assessed changes in CMRO 2 during visual stimulation. With this task, CBF increased by 61 � 7 %, whereas CMRO 2 changed by 2. 43 � 4. 97 %. These results are in good agreement with previous <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> (PET) data, indicating that changes in oxidative metabolism during focal neuronal activity can potentially be determined with the breath-holding test.

40|$|The authors {{report the}} results of a <b>Positron</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>Tomographic</b> (PET) study of local {{cerebral}} blood flow and oxygen consumption in one patient with a right capsulo-thalamic ischemic lesion. That lesion is well demonstrated using X-ray CT Scan. PET study demonstrates a decreased perfusion and metabolism at three levels: first in right thalamus region, second in whole right hemisphere, more marked at orbitofrontal area and third {{at the level of the}} left cerebellar hemisphere. The authors point out the usefulness of PET studies which allow a better understanding of clinical signs by demonstrating functional consequences of damage in deeply located structures such as thalamus and internal capsule on cerebral and cerebellar cortices.
