25|$|Increasingly, {{writing is}} a {{critical}} part of learning in English Language Arts and all content areas, and the ability to write effectively is a requirement for success at all levels of education, from elementary school through high school and in university and adult education classes. Studies of dialogue journal writing have shown that students (and the teachers, classroom helpers, or <b>prospective</b> <b>teachers</b> they are writing with) increase their sense of engagement with each other, learn to express themselves for an audience, and experience an atmosphere of openness and expression. Students also develop writing fluency over time.|$|E
40|$|<b>Prospective</b> <b>Teacher</b> Educators (M. Ed scholars) using {{e-learning}} is {{more crucial}} than acquiring {{a large number}} of computers. <b>Prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> educators have to be trained to facilitate the learning process, make the process real, achievable, challenging, yet exciting and not intimidating. Everything need not be written on the blackboard to be considered as taught. <b>Prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> educators think that the computer is used only to make the content look attractive. They need to know that in 21 st century, information is not difficult access, instead organizing, sharing, and collaborating become essential skills. The present generation is a multimedia generation. They are numbed by too much of information and easy access to that information. The information that is given in the classroom is redundant and presented in boring manner. They show so much of the present and the past far and wide that one seems to learn unknowingly. So a study is intended to study about the level of awareness of e-learning among <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> educators. The investigator selected normative methodology and survey technique for the present study based on the problem selected. For that a sample of 306 number of <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> educators was selected for the present study. Descriptive and inferential techniques were used for the present study. It was found that the level of awareness of e-learning of <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> educators was average. Independent variables like gender, nature of subject has significant influence on the awareness of <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> educators. Other independent variables like medium of instruction, educational qualification, marital status, location and type of family has least significant influence over the awareness of e-learning among <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> educators. So it is necessary to revamp the existing policies to improve e-learning among the <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> educators during their pre-service training programme...|$|R

In addition, this study also examined the perceived perceptions of <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> education students levels of preparedness to use instructional technologies in their future classrooms. Participants in the study were students in a teacher preparation program. The survey was administered to students from six community colleges in the southeastern part of the United States. The <b>Prospective</b> <b>Teacher</b> Education Students Survey was developed and administered to a sample of 109 <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> education students.

25|$|Dialogue journal {{writing has}} become an {{important}} component of professional development for teachers in both pre-service teacher training programs at universities and in in-service workshops and coaching. It might take place between the professor and a class of <b>prospective</b> <b>teachers</b> in a teacher preparation program; between prospective or new teachers and experienced teachers they are working with, as a mentoring and coaching opportunity; or between prospective and practicing teachers. Those who use and study these approaches have found that these professional conversations promote reflection on oneself as a teacher and between teachers as they reflect on their practice. Some research focuses on the types of responses and interactions that are effective for promoting teacher learning. With use of the Internet, these interactions can take place among educators around the world.|$|E
25|$|From the 1850s {{laws were}} enacted in British Honduras {{so that by}} the end of the century the church-state system of {{education}} was well established, with payment by results, for the benefit of every denomination of Christians. But the problem of finding qualified teachers persisted. From the late 1940s <b>prospective</b> <b>teachers</b> among Catholic young men were hosted in a teachers’ hostel on New Road in Belize City, to return to their villages as teachers. This lasted until the building was destroyed by hurricane Hattie in 1961. By then several future government ministers and Fr. Calistus Cayetano had received their education through this program. In 1957 Fr. John Stochl introduced a high school equivalency program for adults in the downtown Extension Division of SJC. The first government secondary school, Technical High School, did not open until 1952. In 1954 the Diocese established St. John’s Teacher Training College at Holy Redeemer. In 1965, it was amalgamated with the government’s St. George’s Teachers’ College to become Belize Teachers’ College. At that time total enrollment at five church-run schools in Belize City was 815 students; of these, 589 were in primary school and 226 were in secondary school. In 1961 two more Catholic secondary schools were opened: St. Francis Xavier in Corozal and St. Peter Claver in Punta Gorda.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} one <b>prospective</b> elementary <b>teacher's</b> developing science {{subject matter}} knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge as she constructs {{a unit of}} instruction to teach fourth graders about light. This analysis builds on a knowledge integration perspective on learning, in which learners are assumed to learn through adding ideas to their repertoires, making links and distinctions where necessary, and identifying weaknesses in their own knowledge. Findings include that this <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher</b> has relatively strong and well-integrated subject matter knowledge, but that even where this is the case, she makes faulty links to lessons to teach that subject matter. Furthermore, she develops instructional representations that highlight where she needs to distinguish between different scientific conceptsfor both herself as a science learner, and as a teacher teaching children. However, she does readily link science concepts to real-world applications of those concepts, indicating that she has nascent pedagogical content knowledge on which to build. The paper then uses this analysis of the <b>prospective</b> <b>teacher's</b> knowledge and knowledge integration to analyze what science teacher educators can learn about designing their learning environments by attending to learners, assessment, and knowledge.

Education of prospective secondary school teachers was done jointly with the Faculty of Philosophy (in the fields of music, drawing and physical arts). 1953 brought complete reform of teacher training methods. The Faculty became the base for the newly established School of Education (separate from the university), so between 1954 and 1964 the Faculty in its former sense did not exist. Teacher training for kindergartens and the first four years of primary education was conducted by the universities, while <b>prospective</b> <b>teachers</b> of years 5−8 of primary schools were educated in specialist higher schools (there was none of this type in Olomouc).
