A protocol of repetitive exercise in the magnet was set and a wooden probe designed to support the limb and to allow exercise. Spectra were recorded continuously during the protocol. In each spectrum, inorganic phosphate, <b>phosphocreatin,</b> adenosin triphosphate, and pH were measured. All the subjects were studied before, after bedrest, and 6 weeks later. After 1 month, the lido group show no changes in the spectra of their leg muscles while the group doing no exercise or ergometer do. For the arms, a loss of muscle function is only seen in the group doing no exercise...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of phosphamidase activity was described 23 years ago, and a discrete enzyme catalyzing deamidation was demonstrated {{at that time}} (Wald-schmidt-Leitz and K#{ 246 }hler, ‘ 33; Ichihara, ‘ 33). The cellular distribution of this enzyme, however, could be established only after a reliable histochemical tech-nique became available (Gomori, ‘ 48; Meyer and Weininann, ‘ 55). The {{purpose of the present}} investigation was to study the distribution of phosphamidase in different organs and tissues of the rat. Since the reaction which this enzyme catalyzes in vivo is unknown, the sites of its occurrence have been classified from a functional point of view. It was hoped that clues to the function of phosphamidase might become apparent from a study of its associations with known physiological functions.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} changes in myocardial con-tractility during regional ischemia are unknown. Since changes in high-energy phosphates during ischemia are sensitive to reductions in myocardial blood flow, {{it was hypothesized that}} myocardial function under steady-state conditions of graded regional ischemia is closely related to changes in myocardial high-energy phosphates. Therefore, phosphorus- 31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed in an in vivo porcine model of graded coronary stenosis. Simultaneous mea-surements 4 of regional subendocardial blood flow, high-energy phosphates, pH, and myocardial segment shortening were made during various degrees of regional ischemia in which subendocardial blood flow was reduced by 16 - 94 %. During mild reductions in myocardial blood flow (subendocardial blood flow = 83 % of nonischemic myocardium), only the ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate (PCr/P 1), Pi, and [H'I were significantly changed from control. PCr, ATP, and PCr/ATP were not significantly reduced from control with mild reductions in blood flow. Changes in myocardial segment shortening were most closely associated with changes in PCr/ Pi (r = 0. 94). Pi and [H'I were negatively correlated with seg-ment shortening (r =- 0. 64 and- 0. 58, respectively) and in-creased over twofold when blood flow was reduced by 62 %. Thus, these data demonstrate that PCr/P; is sensitive to re-ductions in myocardial blood flow and closely correlates with changes in myocardial function. These data are also consistent with a role for Pi or H ' as inhibitors of myocardial contractility during ischemia. (J. Clin.

40|$|Creatine {{monohydrate}} {{has become}} the supplement of choice for many athletes striving to improve sports performance. Recent data indicate that athletes may not be using creatine as a sports performance booster per se but instead use creatine chronically as a training aid to augment intense resistance training workouts. Although several studies have evaluated the combined effects of creatine supplementation and resistance training on muscle strength and weightlifting performance, these data have not been analyzed collectively. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effects of creatine supplementation on muscle strength and weightlifting performance when ingested concomitant with resistance training. The effects of gender, interindividual variability, training status, and possible mechanisms of action are discussed. Of the 22 studies reviewed, the average increase in muscle strength (1, 3, or 10 repetition maximum [RM]) following creatine supplementation plus resistance training was 8 % greater than the average increase in muscle strength following placebo ingestion during resistance training (20 vs. 12 %). Similarly, the average increase in weightlifting performance (maximal repetitions at a given percent of maximal strength) following creatine supplementation plus resistance training was 14 % greater than the average increase in weightlifting performance following placebo ingestion during resistance training (26 vs. 12 %). The increase in bench press 1 RM ranged from 3 to 45 %, and the improvement in weightlifting performance in the bench press ranged from 16 to 43 %. Thus there is substantial evidence to indicate that creatine supplementation during resistance training is more effective at increasing muscle strength and weightlifting performance than resistance training alone, although the response is highly variable.

40|$|Creatine {{has become}} a popular {{nutritional}} supplement among athletes. Recent research has also suggested {{that there may be}} a number of potential therapeutic uses of creatine. This paper reviews the available research that has examined the potential ergogenic value of creatine supplementation on exercise performance and training adaptations. Review of the literature indi-cates that over 500 research studies have evaluated the effects of creatine supplementation on muscle physiology and/or exer-cise capacity in healthy, trained, and various diseased populations. Short-term creatine supplementation (e. g. 20 g/day for 5 – 7 days) has typically been reported to increase total creatine content by 10 – 30 % and phosphocreatine stores by 10 – 40 %. Of the approximately 300 studies that have evaluated the potential ergogenic value of creatine supplementation, about 70 % of these studies report statistically significant results while remaining studies generally report non-significant gains in performance. No study reports a statistically significant ergolytic effect. For example, short-term creatine supplementation has been reported to improve maximal power/strength (5 – 15 %), work performed during sets of maximal effort muscle contractions (5 – 15 %), single-effort sprint performance (1 – 5 %), and work performed during repetitive sprint performance (5 – 15 %). Moreover, crea-tine supplementation during training has been reported to promote significantly greater gains in strength, fat free mass, and performance primarily of high intensity exercise tasks. Although not all studies report significant results, the preponderance of scientific evidence indicates that creatine supplementation appears to be a generally effective nutritional ergogenic aid for a variety of exercise tasks in a number of athletic and clinical populations.

40|$|AbstractIschemic {{preconditioning}} (IPC) {{induced by}} administration of brief episodes of ischemia-reperfusion represents a protective {{mechanism of the}} heart against prolonged episodes of ischemia. Although the mechanism of ischemic preconditioning has been extensively studied, however, until now it is insufficient elucidated. Using a Langendorff rat heart model with 45 minutes ischemia followed by 120 minute reperfusion we aimed to evaluate the role of <b>Phosphocreatin</b> Kinase-C (PCK) in ischemic rat myocardium and demonstration of its involvment {{in the path of}} pharmachological preconditioning (PP) by using PKC activators 1, 2 -dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG) and inhibitors chelerythrine (CHE) and evaluation of the role of KATP channels in pharmachological preconditioning (PP) mechanism by administration of a KATP channel opener (Cromakalim) (CRK) or by blocking the opening of KATP channels with glibenclamide(GLB). The activators of PCK(DOG) and of K ATP channel (CRK) limited the infarct size when perfused before lethal ischemia, mimicking the ischemic preconditioning in rat heart When activator of PCK DOG + GLB, a KATP channel inhibitor were coperfused before the lethal ischemia, there was an increase in myocardial infarct size, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} area at risk, versus control, the cardioprotective effect of DOG being abolished by GLB. The same results were obtained when CHE the inhibitor of PCK was coperfused with CRK the activator of K ATP channel. The effect of CHE and GLB perfused at the beginning of IPC resulted in loss of protection accompanied by a significant increase in infarct size area. The finding that treatment with a DOG PKC activator and CRK activator of K ATP channel gives a similar degree of protection against infarction as that seen after ischemic preconditioning and that this protection can be blocked by CHE a PCK pharmachological inhibitor provides support for the hypothesis that PKC plays a pivotal role in ischemic preconditioning. Our data may have a significance in pharmachological preconditioning (PP) with decrease in infarct size as an end point...|$|E

Sports Physiol., Vol. 7, No. 3 pp. 73 - 79, 2001. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of reduced oxygen availability on the anaerobic capacity and power when absolutely the same work was performed in hypoxia as in normoxia. Fourteen healthy male students, the members of a football team, volunteered for this study. Two graded high intensity exercises of continuous exercise (CE) and intermittent exercise (IE) were involved in this study. The CE was a modified maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) test, and the IE was maximal anaerobic cycle test (MACT). The exercises were performed under normoxic(N) and hypoxic(H) conditions. The MAOD was defined as the difference between the estimated oxygen demands and total VO 2 during exercise. The maximal power (Pmax) exerted at a finak stage in the IE was used as a measure of anaerobic power. The VO 2 during exercise and rest period in the IE were also measured. In addition, the subjects were tested with a 30 sec Wingate anaerobic test (WT) in normoxia. The subjects were exhaused in the CE within the range of 80 - 160 sec (mean 132. 5 sec) in N and 80 - 140 sec (mean 110. 8 sec) in H. the VO 2 during CE in H was lower than that in N, and caused the reduction of the exhaustion time. Although the exhaustion time was shorter, the MAOD, the Pmax was not lowered in hypoxia, therefore, the anaeribic capacity and power were not affected by the reduced oxygen availability. Aithough the VO 2 during exercise was not lowered in the IE, the VO 2 during rest periods was significantly lower in H, suggesting that the resynthesis of depleted <b>phosphocreatin</b> during rest periods was less in hypoxia...|$|E
