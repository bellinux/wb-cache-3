40|$|AbstractTetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) is {{required}} for NO synthesis and inhibition of superoxide release from endothelial NO synthase. Clinical trials using BH 4 to treat endothelial dysfunction have produced mixed results. Poor outcomes {{may be explained by}} the rapid systemic and cellular oxidation of BH 4. One of the oxidation products of BH 4, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -dihydrobiopterin (<b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2),</b> is recycled back to BH 4 by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). This enzyme is ubiquitously distributed and shows a wide range of activity depending on species-specific factors and cell type. Information about the kinetics and efficiency of BH 4 recycling in human endothelial cells receiving BH 4 treatment is lacking. To characterize this reaction, we applied a novel multielectrode coulometric HPLC method that enabled the direct quantification of <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2</b> and BH 4, which is not possible with fluorescence-based methodologies. We found that basal untreated BH 4 and <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2</b> concentrations in human endothelial cells (ECs) are lower than in bovine and murine endothelioma cells. Treatment of human ECs with BH 4 transiently increased intracellular BH 4 while accumulating the more stable <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2.</b> This was different from bovine or murine ECs, which resulted in preferential BH 4 increase. Using BH 4 diastereomers, 6 S-BH 4 and 6 R-BH 4, the narrow contribution of enzymatic DHFR recycling to total intracellular BH 4 was demonstrated. Reduction of <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2</b> to BH 4 occurs at very slow rates in cells and needs supraphysiological levels of <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2,</b> indicating this reaction is kinetically limited. Activity assays verified that human DHFR has very low affinity for <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2</b> (DHF <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2)</b> and folic acid inhibits <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2</b> recycling.

BACKGROUNDDepletion of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) and elevation of the <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -dihydrobiopterin (BH <b>2)</b> (activating and inactivating cofactors of nitric oxide synthase [NOS], respectively) contribute to impairment of NO-dependent vasodilation through reduction of NOS activity as well as increased superoxide anion generation in insulin-resistant rats. METHODSThirty-six consecutive nondiabetic, normotensive and nonobese subjects with angiographically normal coronary vessels were studied. Traditional coronary risk factors, plasma pteridine levels, activities of erythrocyte dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR), the recycling enzyme that converts BH 2 to BH 4 and lipid peroxide (LPO) levels were measured and coronary endothelial function was assessed with graded infusions of acetylcholine (ACh). RESULTSWhen we divided patients into tertiles based on insulin sensitivity, we observed stepwise decreases in the maximal ACh-induced vasodilation and plasma BH 4 / <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2</b> ratio, and increases in coronary LPO production as insulin sensitivity decreased. The ACh-induced vasodilation {{was positively correlated with}} insulin sensitivity, BH 4 / <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2</b> ratio and DHPR activity. Furthermore, BH 4 / <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2</b> was inversely correlated with DHPR activity and insulin sensitivity. In multiple stepwise regression analysis, BH 4 /BH 2 was independently related to ACh-induced vasodilation and accounted for 39 % of the variance. However, no significant correlation existed between other traditional risk factors and BH 4 / <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -BH <b>2.</b> CONCLUSIONSThese results indicate that both abnormal pteridine metabolism and vascular oxidative stress are linked to coronary endothelial dysfunction in the insulin-resistant subjects...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{acetylcholinesterase}} (AChE, EC 3. 1. 1. 7) {{has received}} increased {{attention in the}} field of environmental sciences. Evaluation of the effects of environmental contaminants on AChE enzymatic activity not only can reflect, to some extent, the interference with the nervous system, but also can be used for monitoring pollution. Our previous study showed that <b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (<b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -TCDD) suppressed neuronal AChE enzymatic activity via transcriptional downregulations mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor. In the present study, the effects of several other dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) on neuronal AChE activity were determined, including 1, <b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, <b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -tetrachlorodibenzofuran, <b>2,</b> 3, 4, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -pentachlorodibenzofuran, and <b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -tetrabromodibenzo-p-dioxin. The results showed that the enzymatic activity of AChE was significantly decreased by approximately 15 - 30 % after exposure to a certain concentrations of the DLCs, whereas incubating neuronal cell lysates directly with these DLCs did not inhibit AChE enzyme. Subsequent molecular mechanism study showed that these chemicals could decrease ACHE promoter activity, as well as AChE (T) mRNA expression, thereby suggesting the involvements of transcriptional regulation in these effects. These findings on DLCs are similar with those on <b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -TCDD, pointing to the possibility that exposure to dioxin and DLCs, which frequently coexist in the contaminated environments, may concurrently interfere with the cholinergic functions via AChE...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate if cooking fumes from frying of bacon induce oxidative stress by measurement of urinary <b>8</b> -oxo- <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -dihydro- <b>2</b> deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidatively damaged DNA. Three non-smoking women fried bacon for 3 h. Urine samples were taken as early morning void at the same time on four days; the morning before frying, the morning after first frying, the morning after three days of frying and one week after first urine sample. <b>8</b> -Oxo- <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -dihydro- <b>2</b> deoxyguanosine, 1 -hydroxypyrene and 2 -hydroxyphenanthrene, metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). <b>8</b> -Oxo- <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -dihydro- <b>2</b> deoxyguanosine correlated weakly with concentrations of 1 -hydroxypyrene (r = 0. 31, p = 0. 042), but it did not correlate with 2 -hydroxyphenanthrene (r = − 0. 074; p = 0. 64). Average urinary <b>8</b> -oxo- <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -dihydro- <b>2</b> deoxyguanosine concentrations increased from the day before frying (16. 3 ± 4. 2 nmol/L) to the third day of frying (26. 2 ± 10. 2 nmol/L), although not statistically significantly. Our pilot study shows that frying of bacon may result in increased oxidative stress which further emphasises the possible carcinogenic potential of cooking fumes...|$|R

In this study ten additional adipose samples were analysed for polybrominated dibenzo- p dioxins and furans, PBDD/Fs. In all samples, <b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -TeBDF was present in levels ranging from 0. 23 to 0. 54 pg g - 1 lipid and pentabrominated furans were present in {{nine out of ten}} samples.

By lowering the detection limits by using larger injection volumes by employing the PTV injection technique, <b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -TeBDD, 1, <b>2,</b> 3, 4, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -/ 1, <b>2,</b> 3, 6, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -HxBDD, 1, <b>2,</b> 3, 4, 6, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> - HpBDD, 1, <b>2,</b> 3, 4, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -HxBDF and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -HpBDF were detected {{for the first time in}} human adipose tissue samples from Sweden. <b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -TeBDD was detected in five out of ten samples in the range of 0. 03 - 0. 05 pg g - 1 lipid. <b>2,</b> 3, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -TeBDD has been detected in samples with human origin earlier but not in samples from Sweden and levels of 1, <b>2,</b> 3, 4, <b>7,</b> <b>8</b> -HxBDF has previously been detected in human milk samples from several countries, including Sweden.

To summarize, results from nineteen samples (the present and previous study) demonstrate the presence of brominated furans in the general Swedish population. Additionally, the individuals having the highest PBDD/F concentrations had also the highest levels of PCDD/Fs (pg TEQ g - 1). This might support the general assumption that brominated and chlorinated dioxins have the same sources and exposure routes...|$|R
