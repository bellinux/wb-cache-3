5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E
5|$|Emerald ash borer {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown P.semilanceata to {{suppress}} {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, P.semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSorghum stalk juice {{preparation}} method {{is not yet}} fully explored and mainly still adopting those of cane juice. The suitability of pre-treatment to remove impurities and total <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> to {{the growth rate of}} yeast in sorghum stalk juice, in aerobic and anaerobic fermentation needs to be evaluated. Process adopted for this research was liming method at 80 oC followed by addition of phosphoric acid. Liming method reduces juice turbidity to 82. 43 % ± 0. 50 % and gives specific growth rate (μ) of inoculated yeast of 0. 38 h– 1 (aerobic) and 0. 17 h– 1 (anaerobic). Other method evaluated was by addition of Poly-aluminium chloride (PAC), which gives higher juice clarity but negative impact to cell growth. The effect of total <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> to the microbial growth was also studied. <b>Phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> was reduced through activated carbon absorption column. Reduction of 75 % total <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> in sorghum stalk juice promotes yeast cell growth rate up to 10. 5 % in aerobic condition compared to growth in clarified juice without <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> reduction...|$|R
40|$|Two {{plant species}} were selected, which are Hevea Brasiliensis (Rubberwood) and Shorea spp. (Meranti) for {{determination}} of total <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> and the free-radical scavenging activities. In this study, the total <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> {{was determined by}} using Folin-ciocalteau reagent. Free-radical scavenging activitity was determine by using DPPH (1, 1 - dipheny 1 - 2 -picryl hydrazyl) radical. Free radical scavenging activities was determined by using DPPH radical which is expressed as EC 50 (µg/m 1). Total phenolic content varied between the species. Hevea Brasiliensis (Rubberwood) have higher total phenolic content compared to Shorea spp. (Meranti), which is 316. 444 mg GAE/mg and 117. 555 mg GAE/mg respectively. Result showed that the Hevea Brasiliensis (Rubberwood) has lower EC 50 value compare to Shorea spp. (Meranti). So, Hevea Brasiliensis (Rubberwood) has high free radical scavenging activity. The relationship between free-radical scavenging activities and total <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> was interpreted by using graph. There are correlationship between free-radical scavenging activities and total <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound.</b> Higher total <b>phenolic</b> <b>compound</b> show high free radical scavenging activities...|$|R
5|$|The fruit {{bodies have}} a high antioxidative capacity, due {{probably}} {{to a combination of}} various organic acids (such as oxalic, citric, malic, succinic and fumaric acids), tocopherols, <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> and alkaloids; the highest antioxidant activity is in the mushroom caps. Furthermore, fruit bodies were determined to have 528mg of the antioxidant compound ergothioneine per kilogram of fresh mushroom; this value was the highest among many food items tested in one study. Porcini were thought to have anti-cancer properties according to Hungarian research conducted in the 1950s, but later investigations in the United States did not support this.|$|E
5|$|The {{psilocybin}} {{contents of}} dried herbarium specimens of Psilocybe semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds,</b> this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E
5|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E

25|$|In winemaking, the {{duration}} of maceration or skin contact will influence how much <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> are leached from skins into the wine. Pigmented tannins, anthocyanins, colloids, tannin-polysaccharides and tannin-proteins not only influence a wine's resulting color but also act as preservatives. During fermentation adjustment to a wine's acid levels {{can be made with}} wines with lower pH having more aging potential. Exposure to oak either during fermentation or after (during barrel aging) will introduce more <b>phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> to the wines. Prior to bottling, excessive fining or filtering of the wine could strip the wine of some phenolic solids and may lessen a wine's ability to age.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenolic</b> <b>compounds</b> may {{interact}} with volatiles {{and contribute to}} the specific release of aromas in a wine.
