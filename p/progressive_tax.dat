5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist revisionism of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> system, rendering public ownership {{of the means of}} production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam.|$|E

While this result clarifies some ambiguities in the literature, {{it does not}} rule out <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> in general. If we maximize total or weighted utility of the poor, as often intended by the society, <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> can be justified, especially when the ‘rich’ are very rich. Under these objectives we obtain new necessary conditions for <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes,</b> which only depend on aggregate features of income distributions. The validity of these conditions is examined using plausible income distributions...|$|R

40|$|Does {{an income}} tax harm {{economic}} efficiency more the more progressive it is? Public economics provides {{a strong case for}} a definite "yes. " But at least three forces may pull in the other direction. First, low-wage workers may on average have more elastic labour supply schedules than high-wage workers, in which case <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> contribute to a more efficient allocation of the total tax burden. Second, in non-competitive labour markets, <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> may encourage wage moderation, and hence reduce the equilibrium level of unemployment. And third, if wage setters have egalitarian objectives, <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> may reduce the need for redistribution in pre-tax wages, and hence increase the demand for low-skilled workers. This paper surveys the theoretical, as well as the empirical literature about labour supply, taxes and wage setting. We conclude that in a second best world, the trade-off between equality and efficiency is not always inevitable. Copyright 2002 by Blackwell Publishers Ltd...|$|R
25|$|Multiple {{conflicting}} {{theories have}} been proposed regarding {{the economic impact of}} income taxes. Income taxes are widely viewed as a <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> (the incidence of tax increases as income increases).|$|E

40|$|This paper studies how income-based, <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> and {{transfers}} {{may reduce}} aggregate volatility by protecting the economy against expectation-driven business cycles. Eliminating “local” sunspots that are arbitrarily {{close to an}} indeterminate steady state requires, for sensible parameter values, strong levels of progressivity {{so as to make}} labor supply close to inelastic. However, <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers are shown to be ineffective to rule out stable deterministic cycles (and the associated “global” sunspots) that are located close to a determinate steady state. Our results are formalized within two benchmark models and show how the efficiency of progressive fiscal schemes as local automatic stabilizers depends on the fiscal base. In the first setting with heterogeneous agents and segmented asset markets in which wage income mostly finances consumption, we show that <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers should be made dependent on labor income, so as to rule out local indeterminacy. On the contrary, progressive fiscal rules should be applied to capital income in an overlapping generations economy where consumption comes from savings income. Incidentally, the latter results suggest that capital income taxes may be desirable, when progressive, to make local expectation-driven fluctuations less likely. In both frameworks, key to the results is the property that progressive fiscal rules provide insurance in the presence of imperfect capital markets. <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers, business cycles, sunspots, endogenous cycles. ...|$|R

25|$|CBO {{reported}} that less <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> and transfer policies {{contributed to an}} increase in after-tax income inequality between 1979 and 2007. This indicates that more progressive income tax policies (e.g., higher income taxes on the wealthy and a higher earned-income tax credit) would reduce after-tax income inequality.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause is}} {{the rate at}} which income is taxed coupled with the {{progressivity}} of the tax system. A <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|E

40|$|Several {{papers have}} {{documented}} that US consumers {{can not fully}} insure themselves against all their idiosyncratic risks, but little is understood about which mechanisms provide insurance. We investigate whether, as some suggest, <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> provide additional insurance. The methodology distinguishes insurance from redistribution, and can by applied to testing any potential insurance mechanism. Using repeated cross-sections from the US consumer expenditure survey (CEX), we relate changes in consumption inequality to several measures of tax progressivity. Identification exploits the variation in taxes both across states and over time. Our results suggest, under weak assumptions, that <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes</b> do not induce insurance, while stronger assumptions quantify this effect. ...|$|R
40|$|More <b>progressive</b> <b>taxes,</b> holding tax {{liability}} constant, generate disincentives for health investment by decreasing benefits for additional working time and, thus, decreasing returns to health. On the other hand, progressive taxation may induce individuals {{to invest more}} in health {{for the purpose of}} extending their working life, because lifetime maximization could imply less work per period but more working years. I identify the effect of progressivity through differences in labor income tax rates among states.
