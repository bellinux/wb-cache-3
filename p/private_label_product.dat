5000|$|Product Level: The classic product level brand {{measurement}} {{example is}} to compare {{the price of a}} no-name or <b>private</b> <b>label</b> <b>product</b> to an [...] "equivalent" [...] branded product. The difference in price, assuming all things equal, is due to the brand. More recently a revenue premium approach has been advocated. Marketing mix modeling can isolate [...] "base" [...] and [...] "incremental" [...] sales, and it is sometimes argued that base sales approximate to a measure of brand equity. More sophisticated marketing mix models have a floating base that can capture changes in underlying brand equity for a product over time.|$|E
50|$|The use of private-label {{products}} {{by small}} companies has grown. Small companies {{usually do not}} have any input in the recipes or packaging of the products they buy. They buy from a specialty food company that uses their recipes and simply label for the individual retail store. Small companies do this for advertising benefits. For example, if John's Farm Market sells jams or salsas, each time the consumer uses the product they are reminded of their visit to John's Farm Market, where they will have to return to repurchase it. The brand also benefits when products are gifted, as this allows the gift recipient to become another potential customer. In recent years, Amazon has been a popular channel for small companies to launch a <b>private</b> <b>label</b> <b>product,</b> where almost 500,000 products are released on a daily basis, many of which are private label products. By leveraging Amazon FBA infrastructure, small companies can launch private label brands without having to invest into any storing facilities.|$|E

The gradually increasing of the tendency to <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> by the retailers makes this subject a focus of interest especially in recent years in our country. Thus, retailers’ branded products which retailers own and sell only in their own stores are called â€œprivate label productsâ€ and these products are examined in the study.

Consumer response was so favourable that it began converting older, more marginal stores to No Frills outlets.|$|E

The influence of private label coupons, national brand coupons, and store features is examined. To identify these effects, a logistic model Probit is estimated where the binary variable equals 1 if the household buys the <b>private</b> <b>label</b> <b>product,</b> and equals 0 if the <b>private</b> <b>label</b> <b>product</b> is not bought. The model gives the probability that Y= 1 is chosen conditional {{on a set of}} explanatory variables. In this study we focus on the American processed cheese transactions and we use the ACNielsen Homescan Panel of U. S. households for the year 2005. No significant relationship was found between private label purchase and the level of private label couponing activity. Although increasing private label couponing has no impact on increasing private label purchase, a strong negative relationship was found between national brand manufacturer couponing activity and private label purchase decision. Therefore, national brand couponing appears to be an effective strategy for manufacturers to deter the private label growth in the processed cheese market. retail promotion, coupon, private label, cheese consumption, probit, endogenous explanatory variable, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|E

How do specific in-store placements of a <b>private</b> <b>label</b> <b>product</b> affect consumers' purchase intention? Purpose The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate a potential impact of private labels' in-store placement on consumers' quality perception and purchase intention with a view to the Swedish pharmacy market – namely, Apoteket AB, which is regarded as the research's case example. Method Systematic observations were carried out in two Apoteket AB stores first, which facilitated the structure of the customer survey. In total, 89 completed questionnaires were received to answer the research questions and test the corresponding hypotheses. Conclusion Conducted observations demonstrate a certain particularity of Apoteket AB's store brands' placement. Results of the survey show that consumers perceive the quality of Apoteket AB's <b>private</b> <b>label</b> <b>product</b> higher if the product is placed in an off-shelf display or at eye-level, and lower if it is placed at bottom-level. Furthermore, it is indicated that an off-shelf display receives higher rankings on quality perception than an eye-level placement. In terms of purchase intention, an off-shelf display indicates a positive and a bottom-level placement a negative impact. Finally, it is evident that respondents are more likely to buy a product with a higher perceived quality. Outcomes could provide Apoteket AB with important information how to boost profits with their store brand portfolio. In order to improve the trust of its private label range and continuously enhance consumers' respective quality perception and purchase intention, Apoteket AB should increasingly place their store brands in prime locations such as off-shelf displays and at eye-level. ...|$|E

We estimate {{the effect of}} common labelling characteristics on demand using data from 92 brands in 12 product categories from major supermarket stores across Australia over the period 2002 to 2005. We find that certain characteristics - such as whether the product is made from recycled materials, certified as being Australian-made, is a <b>private</b> <b>label</b> <b>product,</b> is health-conscious or supports a charity - {{have a positive effect}} on demand.

Primary data was collected through observations in the grocery stores and also through questionnaires that were handed out to the customers in the stores.
