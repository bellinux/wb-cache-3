We examined the relationship of serum perfluoroalkyl chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid and <b>perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonate,</b> and elevated uric acid levels in a representative sample of US adults. Methods: We examined 3883 participants from the 1999 &ndash; 2000 and 2003 &ndash; 2006 National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys,a representative, multiethnic population-based survey of noninstitutionalized US adults. Serum perfluorooctanoic acid and <b>perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonate</b> were analyzed as quartiles. The main outcome was hyperuricemia. Results: We found that serum levels of perfluoroalkyl chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid and <b>perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonate,</b> were positively associated with hyperuricemia. This association appeared to be independent of confounders such as age, gender, race-ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and serum cholesterol.
