Juveniles are similar but dark areas have pale mottling and light areas, especially the flanks, have dark mottling. The chest is pale with some darker marks. The subterminal band of the tail is less obvious. Birds in their first spring may have pale heads because of feather wear.|$|E

2500|$|The Benjamin Franklin Z Grill, {{or simply}} [...] "Z-Grill", is a 1-cent postage stamp {{issued by the}} United States Postal Service in February 1868 {{depicting}} Benjamin Franklin. [...] While stamps of this design were the common 1-cent stamps of the 1860s, the Z-Grill is distinguished by having the so-called [...] "Z" [...] variety of a grill pressed into the stamp, creating tiny indentations in the paper. Although the 1-cent Z-Grill is generally cited as the rarest and most valuable of all US postage stamps, the 15-cent Lincoln Z-Grill is just as rare and the 10-cent Washington Z-Grill scarcely less so. [...] All three of these stamps were produced at the same time, along with more common Z-grill versions of the contemporary 2-cent, 3-cent, 5-cent and 12-cent stamps (The earliest known postmarks on Z-grill stamps date from January 1868). The [...] "Z" [...] <b>pattern,</b> <b>unique</b> among grill templates used by the Post Office because it incises horizontal ridges into the stamp rather than vertical ridges, was replaced within a very short time, for stamps with the D- and E-Grills were already being postmarked in mid-February.|$|E

The compilation {{is based on the}} glossary compiled by Goodall (1989), but a substantial numbers of new terms have been added. Thus, we list 316 simple anatomical terms, 81 complex anatomical terms, 37 simple functional terms, and 81 complex functional terms, in addition to 116 synonyms. The behavioral patterns are divided into eight categories on the basis of degree of universality: (1) commonly seen in both Homo and two species of Pan, (1 ?) commonly seen in Homo and only one species of Pan, (2) patterns common to the genus Pan but not to Homo, (3) patterns common to the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes but not the bonobo Pan paniscus, (4) patterns common to eastern (P. t. schweinfurthii) and central (P. t. troglodytes) but not western (P. t. vents) chimpanzees, (5) <b>patterns</b> <b>unique</b> to the eastern chimpanzees, P. t. schweinfurthii, (6) <b>patterns</b> <b>unique</b> to the population of Mahale, (7) <b>patterns</b> <b>unique</b> to many individuals (at least most members of an age/sex class) of M group chimpanzees, (8) patterns limited to a single (idiosyncrasy) or a few individuals of M group. It is most likely that the behavior patterns of the last common ancestor of Homo and Pan are found in Categories 1 and I? and less likely in Categories 2 and 3.

With its long, pencil-shaped profile, its single jet black stripe reminiscent of the graphite core of a pencil, and its eraser-colored caudal fin, this is the species for which the popular name, 'pencilfish', was first coined in the 1920s, later to be applied to all the species of the genus Nannostomus.|$|E

50|$|Electrons {{exist in}} energy levels (i.e. atomic orbitals) within an atom. Atomic orbitals are quantized, meaning they exist as defined values {{instead of being}} {{continuous}} (see: atomic orbitals). Electrons may move between orbitals, but in doing so they must absorb or emit energy equal to the energy difference between their atom's specific quantized orbital energy levels. In optical spectroscopy, energy absorbed to move an electron to a higher energy level (higher orbital) and/or the energy emitted as the electron moves to a lower energy level is absorbed or emitted {{in the form of}} photons (light particles). Because each element has a unique number of electrons, an atom will absorb/release energy in a <b>pattern</b> <b>unique</b> to its elemental identity (e.g. Ca, Na, etc.) and thus will absorb/emit photons in a correspondingly unique pattern. The type of atoms present in a sample, or the amount of atoms present in a sample can be deduced from measuring these changes in light wavelength and light intensity.|$|E

The outsole boasts a more noticeable change, with a different traction <b>pattern</b> <b>unique</b> to this shoe, while the midsole remains almost entirely the same.
