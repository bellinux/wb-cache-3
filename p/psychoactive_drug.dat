5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drug</b> that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square.|$|E
5|$|The novel Dark Angel: Skin Game {{picks up}} where season two ends. Reports of a {{transgenic}} serial killer in Seattle are exacerbating the stand-off at Terminal City. Max uncovers that the killer's psychosis {{was caused by}} him unwillingly being given a <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drug</b> by White. A truce develops between transgenics and the authorities after Max publicly reveals the information, and White goes into hiding. The final novel, Dark Angel: After the Dark, picks up where the previous novel ends. Cale is kidnapped by the cult, {{who are trying to}} provoke Max into attacking them. Max eventually leads an assault on the cult's headquarters, which frees Cale and results in White's death and the compound being set on fire. As the headquarters burn Max finds Lydecker in a prison cell, and he promises to help her find her mother if she saves him, to which she agrees. The book ends with Cale and Max finally consummating their relationship.|$|E

40|$|People injecting {{image and}} {{performance}} enhancing drugs (IPEDs) have traditionally not been {{perceived as being}} {{at high risk of}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, recent studies indicate the HCV antibody (anti-HCV) prevalence in this group is 10 -times that in the general population. HCV testing uptake and undiagnosed infections are examined using data from a voluntary unlinked-anonymous survey. Method People injecting IPEDs across England and Wales completed a short bio-behavioural survey (2012 – 15). Anti-HCV status and self-reports of HCV testing were used in the analysis. Results The participants median age was 31 years, 98 % were men, 14 % had also injected <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> and the anti-HCV prevalence was 4. 8 % (N = 564). Among those who had never injected <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> the anti-HCV prevalence was 1. 4 %; among those who had recently injected <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> (preceding 12 months) prevalence was 39 % and among those who had done this previously 14 % (p < 0. 001). Overall, 37 % had been tested for HCV: among those who had recently injected <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> 78 % had been tested, as had 56 % of those who had injected <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> previously; 33 % of those never injecting <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> were tested (p < 0. 001). Overall, 44 % of those with anti-HCV were aware of this; however, only 14 % of those who had never injected <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> were aware. Conclusions One-in-twenty people who inject IPEDs have anti-HCV. HCV infections among those who had never injected <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> were mostly undiagnosed, though this group had a lower prevalence. Targeted HCV testing interventions are also needed for those injecting IPEDs...|$|R

The use of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> is increasing due to the release of new drugs and to the better understanding of emotional disorders in children and adolescents. Conclusions: The use of antiepileptic and <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> in childhood requires extensive knowledge concerning pharmacokinetics and deleterious side effects.

25|$|A <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drug,</b> psychopharmaceutical, or psychotropic is a {{chemical}} substance that changes brain function {{and results in}} alterations in perception, mood, consciousness or behavior. These substances may be used medically; recreationally; to purposefully improve performance or alter one's consciousness; as entheogens; for ritual, spiritual, or shamanic purposes; or for research. Some categories of psychoactive drugs, which have therapeutic value, are prescribed by physicians and other healthcare practitioners. Examples include anesthetics, analgesics, anticonvulsant and antiparkinsonian drugs as well as medications used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders, such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and stimulant medications.

25|$|Cannabis sativa L. subsp. sativa var. sativa is {{the variety}} grown for {{industrial}} use, while C. sativa subsp. indica generally has poor fiber quality and female buds from this variety are primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes.

Oilseed and fiber varieties of Cannabis approved for industrial hemp production produce only minute amounts of this <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drug,</b> not enough for any physical or psychological effects.

40|$|Introduction: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the proportion of usage of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs,</b> and to identify factors associated with its use among Patients visiting outPatient clinics of a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} involving 461 adult (age 18 years and above) Patients, who were surveyed by using interviewer-administered questionnaires. All interviews were conducted by a medical students. Out {{of the total number of}} participants, 242 (52. 5 percent) were males and 219 (47. 5 percent) were females. Results: In all, 118 (25. 6 percent) of the respondents were using some sort of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs,</b> however, only 20 (4. 3 percent) study subjects were diagnosed with any psychiatric illness. Factors found to be significantly associated with usage of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> included belonging to the female gender (p-value equals 0. 019), older (more than 50 years) age (p-value is less than 0. 001), being married (p-value equals 0. 004), having formal schooling of up to 12 years (p-value equals 0. 001) and physical inactivity (p-value equals 0. 004). In addition, those whose family members were using <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drug(s)</b> or who suffered from non-communicable diseases were more likely to use <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> in comparison to others (p-value is less than 0. 001). Conclusion: The use of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs</b> is quite common in our Patients regardless of having any psychiatric disease. Efforts are required to control and prevent the abuse of these drugs. Education and awareness programmes for doctors and Patients may help to prevent the inappropriate use of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drugs.</b> Regulatory intervention to control use of these drugs is also recommended...|$|R

25|$|Opioids include opiates, {{an older}} term {{that refers to}} such drugs derived from opium, {{including}} morphine itself. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone; and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. The terms opiate and narcotic are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. Opiate is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. Narcotic, derived from words meaning 'numbness' or 'sleep', as an American legal term, refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials; it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled <b>psychoactive</b> <b>drug.</b> In some jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as narcotics.
