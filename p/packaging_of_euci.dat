40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Vif protein plays {{a critical role in}} the production of infectious virions. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of small amounts of Vif in virus particles. However, Vif packaging was assumed to be nonspecific, and its functional significance has been questioned. We now report that <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif is dependent on the <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> viral genomic RNA in both permissive and restrictive HIV- 1 target cells. Mutations in the nucleocapsid zinc finger domains that abrogate <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> viral genomic RNA abolished <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif. Additionally, an RNA packaging-defective virus exhibited significantly reduced <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif. Finally, deletion of a putative RNA-interacting domain in Vif abolished <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif into virions. Virion-associated Vif was resistant to detergent extraction and copurified with components of the viral nucleoprotein complex and functional reverse transcription complexes. Thus, Vif is specifically packaged into virions as a component of the viral nucleoprotein complex. Our data suggest that the specific association of Vif with the viral nucleoprotein complex might be functionally significant and could be a critical requirement for infectivity of viruses produced from restrictive host cells...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the effect <b>of</b> varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training on selected physiological variables of college women basketball players. Thirty subjects were selected from the Alagappa University College of Physical Education in Karaikudi and their age ranged from 19 to 23 years. The subjects were equally divided into three groups namely control and two experimental groups with ten subjects in each group. Control group (Group I) did not undergo any training programme rather than their daily routine work. The experimental group (Group II) underwent varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training I (General training) and experimental group (Group III) were treated with varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training II (Basketball skill related). Training was given for a period of 8 weeks, trained forty five minutes duration for six weeks except Sunday. Anaerobic power and Cardio respiratory endurance were measured through field tests. The Anaerobic power and Cardio respiratory endurance was measured before and after the completion <b>of</b> varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training. The results of pre-test and post-test were statistically analysed by using Analysis of Co-variance. The result revealed that Anaerobic power and Cardio respiratory endurance had significant improvement due to the practices <b>of</b> varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training when compared to the control group. The result when compared between the two experimental groups, it was found that the varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training (General training) group had significant effect on Anaerobic power and Cardio respiratory endurance than the varied <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> training (Basketball skill related) ...|$|R

40|$|A <b>package</b> <b>of</b> water {{management}} practices including pitcher irrigation method and water conserving techniques of manure application and mulching is experimented for sustainable growth and improved production of cucumber crop in Makanya village in North Eastern Tanzania. The increase in total yield due to <b>package</b> <b>of</b> {{water management}} practices is 203 per cent and water use efficiency obtained is 12. 06 kgm- 3. The seasonal water requirement of cucumber crop under <b>package</b> <b>of</b> water management practices ranges from 146. 30 to 198. 10 mm, {{which is on}} an average 4. 19 times less as compared to control treatment of can irrigation. The irrigation interval in <b>package</b> <b>of</b> water management practices is 4. 9 {{times higher than the}} can irrigation method. The water and labour uses are reduced by 75. 9 and 73 per cent, respectively in <b>package</b> <b>of</b> water management practices. The results showed that the self-regulative nature of pitchers and moisture retention by water conserving techniques is helpful in mitigating water stress in crop root zone. The moisture retention period in soil is increased assisting reduction of labour hours required in irrigation. In local context, the water management practices included in the package are easy to understand, adopt, operate and maintain.
