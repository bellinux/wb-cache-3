40|$|It {{is shown}} that a surface wave will be {{generated}} by a horizontal. slot situated above a corrugated or dielectric-coated guiding surface. A physical interpretation of the analysis is suggested which explains the mechanism of launching {{in terms of a}} resonance phenomenon allied to that which arises when a <b>piston</b> <b>attenuator</b> is terminated by a reactance equal and opposite to its own (reactive) characteristic impedance. The problem of efficient launching is discussed, and it is shown that under suitable conditions a high launching efficiency is possible. Some of the theoretical predictions have been verified experimentally. LIST OF PRINCIPAL SYMBOLS A = Amplitude factor. d = Thickness of dielectric or depth of slot on guiding surface. if,, if,, = Rectangular components of electric field strength...|$|E
