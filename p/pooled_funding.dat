40|$|This a {{compelling}} story of collaboration. It is an inspiring example of funders having {{the courage to}} not accept the usual fragmented approach. They believed the lives of vulnerable children deserved better. After enormous effort they reached a stage of performing effectively as a funder collaborative. But this is also a cautionary tale. Collaborating with other funders is much harder than going it alone. This example illustrates the phenomenal costs, compromises and commitment involved in making a joint venture collaborative work. It cautions against <b>pooled</b> <b>funding</b> with diverse donors, implementing an innovative and complex programme in such a demanding context. This begs the big question - was it all worth it? After all, "it was a pretty expensive experiment" as one member said. In terms of the work on the ground in Tangababwe, the honest answer is probably not. Steering committee members admit that the collaborative has not got near to achieving most of its initial aims (but this may be more a consequence of the unique challenges the project faced in-country, rather than funder collaboration itself). What is clear is that despite the costs and difficulties involved, the members have subsequently scaled up their collaborative ventures with other funders.

40|$|Background. Outreach {{services}} are used systematically to deliver immunization {{and health services}} to individuals with insufficient access to health facilities in lower-income countries. Currently, the topic of integrated service delivery during immunization outreach lacks the attention paid to integration at fixed sites or during campaigns. This article explores integrated outreach and risks associated with service integration. Methods. Published and gray literature in public health databases and on organization websites were reviewed, yielding 33 articles and gray literature documents for a literature review of experience integrating other services with routine immunization at outreach sessions. Results. The current policy climate favors service integration as a strategy for increasing the equity and efficiency of important health interventions. However, integration may also present some risk to well-established and resourced interventions, such as immunization, which must be recognized as programs compete for limited resources. Experience reveals integration opportunities in planning and intersectoral coordination, training and supervision, community participation, <b>pooled</b> <b>funding,</b> and monitoring. Conclusions. The reviewed literature indicates that successful integration of health interventions with immunization at routine outreach sessions requires well-planned and implemented steps. It also highlights {{the need for additional}} studies or feedback on planning and implementing integrated outreach services in lower-income countries...|$|E
40|$|As {{demand for}} {{hospital}} and emergency services grows {{there will be}} pressure to improve the integration of primary, acute and continuing care services. Research on ambulatory sensitive care conditions suggests that {{a significant proportion of}} hospital use is potentially preventable by primary health and community care services.

Reforms have generally emphasised planning, funding and regulatory mechanisms including brokered management of services for an enrolled population, capitation payments and <b>pooled</b> <b>funding</b> across primary, acute and continuing care, the development of coordinated service pathways and the consolidation of responsibility for costs and outcomes. Australia’s division of funding, regulatory and planning responsibilities across jurisdictions introduces a unique set of challenges to address these issues. Nevertheless, {{there are a number of}} options better aligning Commonwealth and State initiatives through the Australian Health Agreements and funding for range of primary health and community care funding programs.

40|$|Maternal {{mortality}} in Zimbabwe has unprecedentedly risen {{over the last}} two and half decades although a decline has been noted recently. Many reasons have been advanced for the rising trend, including deliveries without skilled care, in places without appropriate or adequate facilities to handle complications. The recent decline has been attributed to health systems strengthening through a multi-donor <b>pooled</b> <b>funding</b> mechanism. On the other hand, the proportion of community deliveries has also been growing steadily over the years and in this study we investigate why. We used twelve (12) focus group discussions with child-bearing women and eight (8) key informant interviews (KIIs). Four (4) were traditional birth attendants and four (4) were spiritual birth attendants. A thematic approach was used to analyse the data in Ethnography software. The study shows that women prefer community deliveries due to perceived low economic, social and opportunity costs involved; pliant and flexible services offered; and diminishing quality and appeal of institutional maternity services. We conclude that rural women are very economic, logical and rational in making choices on place of delivery. Delivering in the community offers financial, social and opportunity advantages to disenfranchised women, particularly in remote rural areas. We recommend for increased awareness of the dangers of community deliveries; establishment of basic obstetric care facilities in the community and more efficient emergency referral systems. In the long-term, there should be a sustainable improvement of the public health delivery system to make it accessible, affordable and usable by the public...|$|E

40|$|Background/Objectives: The Belgian {{health-care system}} is characterised {{by a large}} {{autonomy}} of health providers and extensive freedom of choice for patients. It lacks of mechanisms supporting care continuity, such as local health authorities, organised referrals, and <b>pooled</b> <b>funding.</b> Belgium also has {{a high number of}} psychiatric beds in hospitals. However, since 2011, a reform of the mental-health care delivery system is ongoing. Psychiatric hospitals were proposed to set up networks with community-based services to strengthen care in the community, supply integrated care pathways, and support patient’s recovery. Networks were free to include any type of partner and developed their own governance mechanisms. Hence, within a nation-wide evaluation process that goes with the reform, we assessed how these networks were structured and whether they were likely to reach the reform’s aims. Methods: Each service member of a network received an online questionnaire that included items on clinical contacts between services (referrals, information exchange), contacts on network organisation activities, and preferred partners. Network structure was measured using Social Network Analysis metrics: density of ties, centralisation, and homophily. Results: Off 990 services identified within 19 networks, 519 (53 %) participated to the survey. A cluster analysis showed that networks varied greatly in terms of size and service types, density of ties, centrality of key services, and core homophily. Discussion/Conclusion: There is a wide variety of local network partnerships, hampering homogenous effects of the reform across the country. Indeed, the literature shows that network density facilitates care individualisation whereas centralisation facilitates coordination. The influence of hospitals remains high and may hinder community care development. The position of social services in network organisation has to be strengthened to support patient’s recovery. Hence, it remains unclear whether one network structure is adapted to reach the multiple reform aims simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|Background: Global {{health policy}} is created largely through a {{collaborative}} process between development agencies and aid-recipient governments, yet {{it remains unclear}} whether governments retain ownership over the creation of policy in their own countries. An assessment of the power structure in this relationship and its influence over agenda-setting is thus the first step towards understanding where progress is still needed in policymaking for development. Methods: This study employed qualitative policy analysis methodology to examine how health-related policy agendas are adopted in low-income countries, using Tanzania as a case study. Semi-structured, in-depth, key informant interviews with 11 policy-makers were conducted on perspectives of the agenda-setting process and its actors. Kingdon’s stream theory {{was chosen as the}} lens through which to interpret the data analysis. Results: This study demonstrates that while stakeholders each have ways of influencing the process, the power to do so can be assessed based on three major factors: financial incentives, technical expertise, and influential position. Since donors often have two or all of these elements simultaneously a natural power imbalance ensues, whereby donor interests tend to prevail over recipient government limitations in prioritization of agendas. One way to mediate these imbalances seems to be the initiation of meaningful policy dialogue. Conclusion: In Tanzania, the agenda-setting process operates within a complex network of factors that interact until a “policy window” opens and a decision is made. Power in this process often lies not with the Tanzanian government but with the donors, and the contrast between latent presence and deliberate use of this power seems {{to be based on the}} donor ideology behind giving aid (defined here by funding modality). Donors who used <b>pooled</b> <b>funding</b> (PF) modalities were less likely to exploit their inherent power, whereas those who preferred to maintain maximum control over the aid they provided (ie, non-pooled funders) more readily wielded their intrinsic power to push their own priorities...|$|E

40|$|Access to {{affordable}} and functional housing in remote Indigenous settlements {{is dependent on}} successful management and maintenance of essential services infrastructure. Access to these services {{is a measure of}} the settlement viability. Together they constitute the principal technical services that need to be sustained in by State and Territory government agencies, Indigenous community organizations and other enterprises. The supply of essential services infrastructure, repairs and maintenance to large Indigenous desert settlements is provided through different arrangements across the various States and Territories delineated on whether the Commonwealth funding is pooled in the jurisdiction. In WA <b>pooled</b> <b>funding</b> into the Remote Area Essential Services Program (RAESP) provides capital, operation and maintenance to 78 large Indigenous settlements and allows supply of capital and emergency repairs to be extended to some smaller settlements (outstations, homelands, emerging communities less than 50 people) by one of 3 Regional Service Providers, which are an Indigenous community organisation or a community-private partnership. In other parts of Australia, Indigenous community councils or local government authorities in larger settlements (Indigenous and non-Indigenous) provide maintenance services to the smaller settlements. However, in these settlements, technical services (minor repairs and maintenance for power, water, sewerage, solid waste) are most often provided by regional Indigenous resource agencies, particularly in WA, NT and SA. The Commonwealth Community Development & Employment Program (CDEP) provides basic wages for Indigenous community members to participate in these activities. While these agencies are the preferred medium of service delivery, with their ‘community development’ focus, their asset management capacities vary considerably. The principal source of funding for these various arrangements was the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services’ (FaCS) Community Housing and Infrastructure Program (CHIP). The overall aim of this Desert Knowledge Cooperative Research Centre (DKCRC) scoping study was to identify knowledge gaps and opportunities for improving the maintenance of essential services in small desert settlements by looking at 12 case studies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assist SDC with its {{decision}} on whether to integrate the Tanzania National TB Leprosy Programme into national delivery structures. The paper looks at experiences in three countries (Ghana, Bangladesh and Zambia), which have integrated some vertical programmes into their national systems which are also supported by a SWAp. The main finding is that integration can, and has caused problems of retaining programme performance. This can be attributed to the reorganisation of technical responsibilities, rationalisation of procurement arrangement, shortages of funding, changes in priorities and changes in government and donor relationships. At the same time however a review of other aspects of the SWAps in those countries suggests that the longer term prognosis for programme performance may be positive because there are indications of improvements in planning, financial management and accountability, greater expenditure at district level and resource allocation, swifter programme mobilisation, better linkages outside MoH and wider accountability for programme performance. In response to these findings, a number of recommendations on how to deal potential problems in Tanzania are given (section 5), and then priorities summarised (section 6). Recommendations are noted here according to when in the process they should be addressed. Issues to consider before making the decision to integrate; Reappraise the likelihood of macro-economic decline and economic shocks (e. g. natural disasters) and their possible impact on Government of Tanzania (GoT) capacity to sustain funding to any integrated programme where overall finance levels depended on GoT funds as well as donors. Also consider the possible impact of a change of government or minister, and the effect on the programme if the SWAp lost political support, Assess whether there is enough cohesion with other DPs to overcome possible future programme problems without the control offered by direct funding, Assess absorption capacity of national delivery systems to utilise available funds adequately without the impetus of a vertical programme, Assuming that the programme would then be funded through the existing district basket, assess whether SDC could maintain commitments to this pool, and how well the pool as a whole has been functioning to date in terms of timely disbursements etc. Accept a change over to integration is probably a one way event Once the decision to integrate has been made; Ensure that transition is gradual and that capacity exists before any technical and managerial responsibilities are passed on, Plan for continued capacity building after integration, including continued technical assistance, Work with MoH to consider options for retaining dedicated supervisory and technical capacity at the centre and regions after integration even if these still resemble a vertical programme approach. Pay particular attention to where supervisory and leadership responsibilities lie in the system. Ensure that there is adequate technical input to national planning processes at all levels and that the process is not overly administratively led, Ensure reporting remains robust, Ensure that during the transition phase and capacity building TB and leprosy control continue to be presented as national priorities. Also appraise national planning and budgeting mechanisms to establish how well they communicate and support national priorities, Consider earmarking <b>pooled</b> <b>funding</b> as an interim measure, Carry out a careful assessment of MoH procurement capacity in order to establish its immediate ability to procure effectively and efficiently. Anticipate having to carry out some immediate capacity building work in order to ensure that any new procurement functions operate smoothly, Try to negotiate with GoT and other DPs a procurement system which reduces transaction costs and labour intensity rather than increases them Longer term strategies to consider are; Consider helping MoH to develop specific strategies for advocacy for TB and leprosy as priority programmes with both national government (MRALG) and local government in order to try to ensure that disease control activities remain a priority, Encourage improvements in participation by local populations and better needs assessment at local level with flexibility in funding to respond to these, Carefully monitor overall expenditure of the programme in order to ensure that substitution does not take place...|$|E
40|$|John Spierings {{discusses}} the main {{findings of the}} How Young People are Faring 2005 report LIVING in a buoyant economy, with strong jobs growth and unprecedented wealth connected to home ownership, are Australians comfortable with their lot? The evidence is mixed. Widespread optimism about economic prospects is generally tempered by anxiety about levels of household debt and concerns about terrorism. Rising levels of clinical depression, popular longing for a personal sea-change, and a profound incidence of family breakdown also tend to counter-balance the sense of economic good times. As you might expect, young people share the national optimism. Recent longitudinal research shows that in general young people {{have high levels of}} life satisfaction consistent with previous generations of young Australians. But their satisfaction in life is intimately related to what they are doing as students or workers, to whether they have a full-time job or not, or a course or a career plan that provides direction. To whether they are part of Australia’s economic ‘insiders’ or ‘outsiders’. It may surprise but there are currently more than 560, 000 young Australians not in full-time work or study, people who are predominantly on the ‘outside’ of the Australian economic success story. Most of them - about 330, 000 - are women. It’s a curious thing that there has been such a passionate focus in recent times on boys participation in schooling - and rightly so - but relative indifference to the labour market opportunities for teenage girls and young adult women. While full-time jobs for young men are gradually recovering and trade apprenticeships have grown, little attention has been focused on the predominance of casual, part-time and often low-skilled jobs for young women who have left education. It is true that young women have lower levels of absolute unemployment than young men and they participate in education more readily and for longer, but they are also considerably more prone to precarious employment and to underemployment. Perhaps it’s part of our social condition. The outward signs of distress (at school) - aggression, bullying, misbehaviour - attract parents, communities and policy-makers. Meanwhile the piecemeal nature of serial part-time work tends to be endured as an individual experience, stoicism rather rebellion being a favoured means of coping. It was into this pool of hormones, attitudes and structures that the prime minister stepped a year ago when he set an unequivocal benchmark for his government’s fourth term: ‘We aim at nothing less than assisting all young Australians from age 13 to 19 to make a successful transition from school to an enduring career. ’ But in 2005 15 per cent of teenagers are either unemployed, working part-time or have withdrawn from the labour force. Thirty percent of school leavers were in this situation six months after leaving school. When our strong economy is producing skills vacancies that should be filled by young people, but are not, it’s clear there is considerable work ahead if the PM’s benchmark is to be achieved. His frequent suggestion that students use Year 10 as a watershed point to decide about proceeding further with schooling is well-founded. The latest data shows that 45 per cent of Year 10 leavers were either unemployed, working part-time (but not in education) or had withdrawn from the labour force six months after leaving school. It is simply not acceptable to encourage students to consider withdrawing from school without providing strong support and guidance and decent alternative learning and work opportunities. There is a growing sense that the nation could be dividing into the overworked or the underemployed, the insiders and the outsiders mentioned earlier. Many in the middle class are aware of overwork and the pain it brings, even if it is often worn as a badge of honour in the tea room. Simultaneously, however, Australia {{has one of the highest}} rates of part-time employment for young people in the OECD, and the growth of part-time employment is outstripping full-time employment. More than half of Australia’s young part-time workers (excluding full-time students) say they want to work more hours. One of the high points of the last federal election was the animation that followed John Howard’s commitment to improved transitions from school, the new technical colleges, and support for apprentices and apprenticeships. Similarly Labor’s Learn or Earn strategy attracted a lot of public comment. For the first time in memory young people and their fates were part of the national political discourse. However, much of that focus has since been lost in the maelstrom of headline issues like terrorism and industrial relations. Policies and programs that ensure young people leave school better prepared for life and for employment will have an economic benefit and contribute to sustaining even further our long economic boom. Beyond improving the employability of Australia’s young economic outsiders - those growing up in stressed socio-economic circumstances, rural Australia, Indigenous communities and young women not in education - personal support and career guidance, robust learning choices, labour market programs and structural incentives are needed if the PM’s pledge is to become a reality. In recent times there have been numerous Commonwealth and state initiatives to improve participation in education and to provide better support for trade apprenticeships. Many of these are to be applauded, but it will take some time for the impact of these measures to be reflected in data on youth transitions. The challenge is to match the high expectations attached to these initiatives with adequate resources, <b>pooled</b> <b>funding,</b> coordination and planning, especially between our levels of government. One clear oversight in the array of post-compulsory education and training reforms is a focus on the labour market and the quality of employment that young people experience in the first twelve months after leaving school. It is in this phase that a gender gap is emerging. Along with other holes in youth labour and training markets, this is an area that must be addressed by government and employers. The report also provides a timely reminder that Australia cannot be complacent about its improving level of educational attainment. OECD ranking of estimated completion rates of upper secondary education shows that Australia lies in the middle, significantly adrift of the Scandinavians, Korea and Japan. Our national long-term prosperity will derive more from the skills and capacity of our people rather than our talent to exploit our natural physical resources. Investing in education and skills, and redoubling our efforts to improve participation, achievement and completion rates is critical. General economic success is clearly a necessary but not a sufficient condition for Australians to be relaxed about our lot. • John Spierings is a researcher with the Dusseldorp Skills Forum.
