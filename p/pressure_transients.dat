In order to use pipe failure prediction models, accurate information about loads acting on these pipes is important.

Pipe repairs {{are one of the}} biggest challenges of ageing {{water infrastructure}} in the UK and world wide. <b>Pressure</b> <b>transients</b> resulting from sudden interruptions of the movement of the water can be caused by routine value operations. In a single pipeline one extreme event can burst a pipe. However the occurrences and impact of <b>pressure</b> <b>transients</b> in operational water distribution systems were not currently fully understood. This research developed new insights and understanding of pressure transient occurrences and their contribution to observed pipe repair rates. A large scale field monitoring program, including deploying and managing high-speed (100 Hz) instrumentation for 11 months, was designed and implemented to cover 67 district metered areas (DMA) subdivided into 79 pressure zones. In total 144 locations were monitored. The data was analysed using a novel method, termed transient fingerprint. This allowed the identification of discrete <b>pressure</b> <b>transients</b> and their three fundamental components (magnitude, duration and numbers of occurrences) leading to a quantitative interpretation of <b>pressure</b> <b>transients.</b> Evolutionary polynomial regression modelling was used to assess the impact of directly measured pressure transient data in context with static pressure, age, diameter and soil variables on 64 cast iron pipes. The analysis suggested that high magnitude, short duration repeatedly occurring <b>pressure</b> <b>transients</b> can have an adverse effect on the pipes. The extrapolation of pressure transient analysis into 7978 cast iron pipes showed inconclusive results suggesting that more accurate pressure transient data is required for each pipe in the network. Additional analysis carried out on 25 asbestos cement pipes, with actual measurements of <b>pressure</b> <b>transients</b> for each pipe, confirmed an adverse effect of pressure transient on water network observed in cast iron pipes. This research has provided an understanding of the occurrence of <b>pressure</b> <b>transients</b> that has implications on pipe management strategies. Mitigation techniques to locate pressure transient sources based on the project outcomes could be utilised to better manage distribution systems and ultimately reduce future pipe replacements and associated costs. ...|$|E

In whiplash experiments conducted for animals, <b>pressure</b> <b>transients</b> have been recorded in the spinal canal. It was hypothesized that the transients caused dorsal root ganglion dysfunction. Neck motion introduces volume changes inside the vertebral canal. The changes require an adaptation which is likely achieved by redistribution of blood volume in the internal vertebral venous plexus (IVVP). <b>Pressure</b> <b>transients</b> then arise from the rapid redistribution.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a new three-dimensional fully coupled poroelastic numerical model to simulate <b>pressure</b> <b>transient</b> response of naturally fractured reservoirs. One {{of the main}} applications of the new approach {{is to improve the}} reservoir characterization by decreasing the uncertainties associated with subsurface fracture map and to understand the interaction between fracture and matrix. The model is based on a hybrid methodology to simulate fluid flow by combining a single continuum and discrete fracture network approaches. To decrease the uncertainty associated with subsurface fracture map, a different realizations of the discrete fracture systems are generated based on image logs, seismic, geological features and the tectonic history of the studied reservoir. An iterative loops have been used between the reservoir static model and dynamic well-test data to optimize the generation of subsurface fracture maps. At each loop, a new discrete fracture system is used and the simulated <b>pressure</b> <b>transient</b> data are compared with the available field data. The process is repeated till the matching between the simulated and the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>transient</b> data is achieved using the most appropriate fracture realization. The numerical model is validated against an analytical <b>pressure</b> <b>transient</b> solution for dual-porosity system, and then applied to a real case taken from fractured basement reservoir in offshore Southern Vietnam.
