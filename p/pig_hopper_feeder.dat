The work aims at the {{optimization}} of {{the output}} feed rate of a Stationary Hook <b>Hopper</b> <b>Feeder</b> {{so that the}} best possible set of parameters affecting it can be selected to get the desired output. For this purpose the effect of various parameters on the feeder output is studied. To facilitate the study and detailed analysis, a statistical model is constructed {{which is used to}} predict and optimize the performance of the system. Efficient feed rate optimization determines the input variable settings to adjust the feed rate of the feeder according to the consumption of the parts in the next phase of production. The Stationary Hook <b>Hopper</b> <b>Feeder,</b> whose performance is to be studied, consists of a rotating circular plate and a guiding hook fixed at the centre and running up to the periphery of the plate. As the plate rotates, the parts follow the trajectory of the hook, orient themselves and then eventually are delivered through the delivery chute, tangentially to the plate. The factors influencing the feeder’s performance include the speed of rotation of the disc, the population of the parts in the hopper and the size of parts to be fed. A series of experiments is performed on the three process parameters to investigate their effect on the feed rate. To study the interaction among the factors a full 23 factorial experiment approach has been adopted using the two basic principles of experimental design- replication and randomization. The process model was formulated based on Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Minitab ® statistical package. The outcome is represented graphically and in the form of empirical model which defines the performance characteristics of the Stationary Hook <b>Hopper</b> <b>Feeder...</b>|$|R

In experiment 1, a survey was carried out on 22 pig units of known growth performance in south-west Ireland to compare management factors between those showing poor and good growth rates. Low growth rate appears to be due to the cumulative effect of a combination of factors. Experiment 2 was conducted to determine the effects of providing an additional feeder on performance of weaned piglets. No benefits were recorded. Feed consumed from the additional feeder was a replacement for feed that otherwise would have been consumed from the control <b>hopper</b> <b>feeder.</b> Experiment 3 was designed to determine if pig performance and efficiency of growth were affected by weight at birth and at weaning. Lightweight pigs showed inferior growth performance up to the finisher period. Although they compensated some of the inferior growth towards the time of slaughter, they never reached the weights of the heavy birth-weight animals. Males were either significantly heavier or tended to be heavier than females throughout. There was no significant difference between the sexes in the number of days to slaughter. Light and heavy pigs did not differ in the levels of IGF- 1 in their blood plasma; however lightweight pigs had significantly lower IgG preweaning. Experiment 4 aimed to determine whether piglet birth weight influenced growth performance, plasma IGF- 1 concentrations and muscle fibre characteristics at day 42 of life. At slaughter (Day 42) light birth weight pigs were significantly (P < 0. 001) lighter. Plasma IGF- 1 concentration was lower by 28 % (P= 0. 06) in light pigs.

50|$|Seed feeders {{are mainly}} {{squirrel}} proof, tube-like or hopper. Due {{to the need}} of keeping squirrels away from the bird food, manufacturers have created different defense mechanisms that may deter squirrels from getting close to the seed. Some seed feeders come with weight sensitive technology which shuts off the access to the seed ports whenever a heavy weight is detected (as most squirrels are heavier than birds). Birds can still feed as they weigh less and the ports remain open under their weight. Other seed feeders {{are designed to be}} mounted on poles as it is believed that squirrels reach seed feeders more easily from trees than from poles. The simplest type of squirrel proof feeder is a tube-like feeder surrounded by a metal cage. These feeders also offer protection from larger and more aggressive birds.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Since {{the era of}} industrialization, the {{handling}} of materials in bulk form has become a necessary process {{for a range of}} industries throughout the world. Bulk handling and storage facilities should be designed and operated to obtain both maximum reliability and efficiency as well as encourage economy. A better understanding of the stress field and arching behavior and an accurate assessment of the bin wall pressure are essential steps to achieving reliable design of the storage bins or the feeder system. To date, the determination of the critical mass-flow hopper opening dimensions to prevent blockages due to the formation of stable, cohesive arches has been based on the radial stress field generated in the lower region of the hopper. The surcharge loads on the hopper have not been taken into account. Non-linear effects caused by the hopper surcharge loads in mass-flow analysis need to be addressed. In this study, a large number of experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the surcharge pressure and the filling level on the hopper wall pressure during arching. The failure mechanism of the arches is discussed by means of studying the arch profile in the mass-flow hopper. In this study, to ensure efficient feeding, the <b>hopper</b> and <b>feeder</b> geometry are designed as an integral unit. The stress field at the hopper/feeder interface is of particular interest due to the role that it plays in estimating the feeder loads. In reality, the two-dimensional stress field assumed in the mass-flow hopper is influenced by the shear force due to the feeder operation. The combination of the active stress field and the passive stress field in the mass-flow hopper is suggested. This study also attempts to provide an accurate estimation of the feeder loads by investigating the feeder loads given by a combination of two methods. Apart from the comparisons between the experimental and theoretical results, numerical simulations using the discrete element method were carried out additionally to assist in the investigation of the hopper wall pressures and feeder loads. The influences of the various parameters on the hopper wall pressure, such as filling heights and outlet dimensions, are presented in this thesis.

A creep diet (1, 585 kcal ME/lb, 1. 56 % TID Lys) with 1. 0 % chromium oxide was offered ad libitum at d 18 until weaning (d 21). A single lactation diet (1, 586 kcal ME/lb, 0. 97 % TID Lys) was used, where sows were allowed free access to feed throughout lactation. Piglets were weighed individually at d 0 (birth), 18, and 21 (weaning) to calculate total and daily gains. Litter creep feed intake as feed disappearance was also calculated. Fecal samples from all piglets were taken twice using sterile swabs between 3 and 12 h before weaning for all treatments. Piglets were categorized as ‘eaters’ when the fecal sample was colored green at least once on any of the two samplings. Results showed no differences in pig (P< 0. 18) and litter (P< 0. 51) weights at weaning among litters using the different types of creep feeder. Total and daily gains of pigs (P< 0. 20) and litters (P< 0. 31) were also similar across treatments.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of a granular material with boundary materials {{is one of}} the most important factors to consider when designing mass flow <b>hoppers,</b> chutes, <b>feeders</b> and other equipment where flow is expected to occur. Numerous properties of a bulk material and wall surface influence the measurement of wall friction angles (e. g. particle size and distribution, particle shape, particle and boundary asperities and moisture content) which can be difficult to thoroughly investigate on a standard Jenike direct shear tester. Often the Jenike direct shear tester is limited to small particle sizes, wall sample materials, shear rates and displacements.

Factors which are examined on the LSWFT include particle size, moisture content, wall sample material conditions (i. e. effects of joints and edges between tiled materials) and shear cell size to improve the understanding of granular material interaction withboundaries to enhance infrastructure performance.

In the present work, a feed delivery {{system for a}} solar gasification reactor was designed, fabricated and tested. The feedstock delivery system delivers the required amount of feedstock into the reactor which is a cavity of molten salt held at 1200 K. The feed delivery rate was from 8 ±(0. 4) gm/min to 15 (± 0. 75) gm/min. The cellulose feed particles were of diameter 0. 5 mm. The feed delivery system is comprised of <b>hopper,</b> screw <b>feeder,</b> stepper motor and feed injector. The hopper was designed to store a feed supply needed for continuous one hour operation of the reactor at the feed delivery rate of 15 (± 0. 75) gm/min. The screw feeder, which is rotated using a stepper motor, draws the feed particles from the hopper outlet and carries them in forward direction to the feed injector.

40|$|Swedish {{agricultural}} soils {{are reported to}} receive an annual application of plant nutrients as fertilizer amounting to a value almost as large the total new-investment made during one year. Poor precision in nutrient supply results in yield decreases and environmental loading. The purpose of this work is to summarize the knowledge available today on factors that influence fertilizer distribution achieved by pneumatic fertilizer spreaders. The work is mainly concentrated on technical design parameters that influences the spreading uniformity parallel to and {{at right angles to}} the direction of travel. The average coefficient of variation for the evenness of spreading of today’s fertilizer spreaders is 25 % in the field. In practise, there is no significant difference between centrifugal spreaders and pneumatic spreaders. During the work of which this report accounts for, 87 Swedish and international references have been studied in order to find factors influencing the result of fertilizer spreading. Factors influencing the spreading result can be divided into: the fertilizer, the machine, the field the weather and the operator. The flow properties of the fertilizer and its tendency to deposit on working mechanism are affected by its physical properties. The particle size distribution influences length of throw, flow properties and tendency of separation. The durability of the fertilizer will affect the particle size distribution. Particle shape and surface texture affect the flow properties. Density influences throw properties. Hygroscopicity influences water uptake and thereby flow properties and tendency to deposit within the machine. Thixotropic fertilizers lead to hard deposits being placed on working mechanisms and transport ducts against which the fertilizer glides. The machine can be divided into fertilizer <b>hopper,</b> <b>feeder</b> mechanism, fan, piping, spreader boom and spreader mechanism. When filling a hopper separation generally occurs. Severe separation influences the resulting distribution. When emptying the hopper the slope of the floor will influence the amount of fertilizer remaining in the hopper. 60 — 65 ° slope of the bottom of the hopper will ensure complete emptying. Metering mechanisms can be divided into active and passive mechanisms. The function of passive mechanisms depend on the flow properties of the fertilizer. The studded roller is a semi-active metering mechanism. Cyclic variations in out-flow may occur in metering devices that measure out the fertilizer in portions, e. g. cell wheels, star wheels and augers. Shaking and slope of hopper influences the mass flow from passive metering mechanisms. The fan is used to transport the fertilizer within the machine. The flow of air can be used to reduce drift caused by wind if both the flow of fertilizer and the flow of air are directed downwards at the spreading mechanism. At high fertilizer application rates the fan-pipe system in modern fertilizer spreaders tend to overload, with pulsating flows as a result. These pulsating flows are reflected in a severe deterioration of the spreading uniformity. The piping functions as a way of transport of the fertilizer. Piping with a high coefficient of friction leads to a rapidly attained even radial distribution of granules in the pipe. Curves induces pressure losses and deteriorated radial distribution in the pipe. Bends immediately before the spreading mechanism should be avoided. Movements of the spreader boom influences the final result of fertilizer spreading. Boom movements occur {{largely as a result of}} the torque of the fertilizer vehicle along its respective longitudinal and vertical axles. The response of a boom suspension to the rolling motion of the vehicle to which it is attached should be such that the boom is insulated from the high frequency random rolling movements but is able to follow the low frequency undulations of the ground. An example of such a boom suspension is found in the literature. In the literature, spreader mechanisms are found in many different shapes. Significant for the majority of them is that their evenness of distribution is sensitive to the radial distribution of granules in the pipe immediately before entering the spreader mechanism. The evenness of distribution is also sensitive to the working height above the ground. The field will through its geometry (shape, slope and bumpiness) affect the working result in form of unevennesses in the spreading pattern, gaps and overlapping. Soil type variations and varying cultivation capacity demand variable application rates. The weather factors that mainly influence the spreading accuracy are wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. The wind speed influences the length and direction of throw. Air temperature and moisture are together with the temperature of the fertilizer decisive for the water uptake of the fertilizer. Large water uptake will change the flow properties of the fertilizer in a negative direction. The operator is the overall regulator in the "granule spreading system". The operator adjusts and maintain the machine. It is the operator who choses driving technique and the way the work is done. A technically very good fertilizer spreader cannot compensate fully for a bad operator. The operator should have assistance in steering the tractor and information of and possibility to adjust the application rate. What requirements can be placed on the future fertilizer spreader? The requirements placed on the fertilizer spreader of the future involve large control ability, i. e. high spreading accuracy and possibility to continuously vary the application rate. Furthermore, some kind of control over the mass flow of fertilizer will be needed. This review of the literature is concluded with a presentation of a new type of fertilizer spreader. The concept gives precedence to low manufacturing cost, active metering mechanism, variable mass flow and even distribution of fertilizer to the spreader mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} program {{is concerned with}} {{the development of a new}} form of feeder, known as the Stamet Posimetric O High Pressure Solids Feeder, to feed dry granular solids continuously and controllably into gas pressure. The device is a rotary mechanical feeder, which utilizes the interlocking and internal friction of the granular solids to drive the solids through into the outlet pressure in a continuous and controllable way, using a continuous solids material seal on the feeder outlet to control gas leakage. Earlier work sponsored under previous SBIR grants has successfully demonstrated the potential benefits of the Stamet machine over pressurized lock <b>hopper</b> or paste <b>feeder</b> methods. The objective of this project was to demonstrate proof of principal to feed and meter specified granular coal into 450 psig gas pressure for use with next generation pressurized fluidized bed combustors. This report encompasses the development of material transport properties testers, methods to predict feeder performance by calculation, and the modification and testing of Stamet feeders to feed the material supplied into pressure. Testers were made to measure material compressibility, bulk density, both internal and wall friction coefficients, and permeability under typical conditions experienced inside a Stamet high pressure feeder. This data is then used in support of ongoing efforts to develop calculations to predict the performance of Stamet pressure feeders with different materials and conditions. Three Stamet pressure feeders were modified to handle the fine granular or pulverized coal, and were tested under various conditions using different outlet arrangements. The initial testing identified difficulties in handling the fine materials, but through a series of calculations and tests, the issues were overcome and the material was successfully fed into pressure. In all cases the performance calculated based on the measured material properties and feeder geometry agreed well with the test results, confirming the ability to predict performance and select geometry required to handle different conditions. However, the maximum pressure achieved was limited by an ineffective auger design, which was unable to effectively control the length of the outlet seal at higher pressures without imposing additional mechanical loads on the surface of the coal seal. This prevented steady state conditions being maintained long enough to reach the target pressure. Though the specified coal was successfully pumped into pressures over 200 psi, and the test results clearly indicate the changes required to provide a fixed outlet geometry that would achieve the 450 psi target, time and funding was not available to pursue this goal further under this project...|$|R
40|$|The {{two main}} sources of biomass for energy {{generation}} are purpose-grown energy crops and waste materials. Energy crops, such as Miscanthus and short rotation woody crops (coppice), are cultivated mainly for energy purposes and {{are associated with the}} food vs. fuels debate, which is concerned with whether land should be used for fuel rather than food production. The use of residues from agriculture, such as barley, canola, oat and wheat straw, for energy generation circumvents the food vs. fuel dilemma and adds value to existing crops. In fact, these residues represent an abundant, inexpensive and readily available source of renewable lignocellulosic biomass. In order to reduce industry’s operational cost as well as to meet the requirement of raw material for biofuel production, biomass must be processed and handled in an efficient manner. Due to its high moisture content, irregular shape and size, and low bulk density, biomass is very difficult to handle, transport, store, and utilize in its original form. Densification of biomass into durable compacts is an effective solution to these problems and it can reduce material waste. Upon densification, many agricultural biomass materials, especially those from straw and stover, result in a poorly formed pellets or compacts that are more often dusty, difficult to handle and costly to manufacture. This is caused by lack of complete understanding on the natural binding characteristics of the components that make up biomass. An integrated approach to postharvest processing (chopping, grinding and steam explosion), and feasibility study on lab-scale and pilot scale densification of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw was successfully established to develop baseline data and correlations, that assisted in performing overall specific energy analysis. A new procedure was developed to rapidly characterize the lignocellulosic composition of agricultural biomass using the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In addition, baseline knowledge was created to determine the physical and frictional properties of non-treated and steam exploded agricultural biomass grinds. Particle size reduction of agricultural biomass was performed to increase the total surface area, pore size of the material and the number of contact points for inter-particle bonding in the compaction process. Predictive regression equations having higher R 2 values were developed that could be used by biorefineries to perform economic feasibility of establishing a processing plant. Specific energy required by a hammer mill to grind non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw showed a negative power correlation with hammer mill screen sizes. Rapid and cost effective quantification of lignocellulosic components (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) of agricultural biomass (barley, canola, oat and wheat) is essential to determine the effect of various pre-treatments (such as steam explosion) on biomass used as feedstock for the biofuel industry. A novel procedure to quantitatively predict lignocellulosic components of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw was developed using Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Regression equations having R 2 values of 0. 89, 0. 99 and 0. 98 were developed to predict the cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin compounds of biomass, respectively. The average absolute difference in predicted and measured cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in agricultural biomass was 7. 5 %, 2. 5 %, and 3. 8 %, respectively. Application of steam explosion pre-treatment on agricultural straw significantly altered the physical and frictional properties, which has direct significance on designing new and modifying existing bins, <b>hoppers</b> and <b>feeders</b> for handling and storage of straw for biofuel industry. As a result, regression equations were developed to enhance process efficiency by eliminating the need for experimental procedure while designing and manufacturing of new handling equipment. Compaction of low bulk density agricultural biomass is a critical and desirable operation for sustainable and economic availability of feedstock for the biofuel industry. A comprehensive study of the compression characteristics (density of pellet and total specific energy required for compression) of ground non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw obtained from three hammer mill screen sizes of 6. 4, 3. 2 and 1. 6 mm at 10 % moisture content (wb) was conducted. Four preset pressures of 31. 6, 63. 2, 94. 7 and 138. 9 MPa, were applied using an Instron testing machine to compress samples in a cylindrical die. It was determined that the applied pressure (60. 4 %) was the most significant factor affecting pellet density followed by the application of steam explosion pre-treatment (39. 4 %). Similarly, the type of biomass (47. 1 %) is the most significant factor affecting durability followed by the application of pre-treatment (38. 2 %) and grind size (14. 6 %). Also, the applied pressure (58. 3 %) was the most significant factor affecting specific energy required to manufacture pellets followed by the biomass (15. 3 %), pre-treatment (13. 3 %) and grind size (13. 2 %), which had lower but similar effect affect on specific energy. In addition, correlations for pellet density and specific energy with applied pressure and hammer mill screen sizes having highest R 2 values were developed. Higher grind sizes and lower applied pressures resulted in higher relaxations (lower pellet densities) during storage of pellets. Three compression models, namely: Jones model, Cooper-Eaton model, and Kawakita-Ludde model were considered to determine the pressure-volume and pressure-density relationship of non-treated and steam exploded straws. Kawakita-Ludde model provided the best fit to the experimental data having R 2 values of 0. 99 for non-treated straw and 1. 00 for steam exploded biomass samples. The steam exploded straw had higher porosity than non-treated straw. In addition, the steam exploded straw was easier to compress since it had lower yield strength or failure stress values compared to non-treated straw. Pilot scale pelleting experiments were performed on non-treated, steam exploded and customized (adding steam exploded straw grinds in increments of 25 % to non-treated straw) barley, canola, oat and wheat straw grinds obtained from 6. 4, 3. 2, 1. 6 and 0. 8 mm hammer mill screen sizes at 10 % moisture content (wb). The pilot scale pellet mill produced pellets from ground non-treated straw at hammer mill screen sizes of 0. 8 and 1. 6 mm and customized samples having 25 % steam exploded straw at 0. 8 mm. It was observed that the pellet bulk density and particle density are positively correlated. The density and durability of agricultural straw pellets significantly increased with a decrease in hammer mill screen size from 1. 6 mm to 0. 8 mm. Interestingly, customization of agricultural straw by adding 25 % of steam exploded straw by weight resulted in higher durability (> 80 %) pellets but did not improve durability compared to non-treated straw pellets. In addition, durability of pellets was negatively correlated to pellet mill throughput and was positively correlated to specific energy consumption. Total specific energy required to form pellets increased with a decrease in hammer mill screen size from 1. 6 to 0. 8 mm and also the total specific energy significantly increased with customization of straw at 0. 8 mm screen size. It has been determined that the net specific energy available for production of biofuel is a significant portion of original agricultural biomass energy (89 - 94 %) for all agricultural biomass...|$|R
