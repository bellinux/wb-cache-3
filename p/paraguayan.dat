5|$|In December 1864, the {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, {{took advantage of}} Brazil's military intervention in Uruguay to establish his country as a regional power. The <b>Paraguayan</b> army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the <b>Paraguayan</b> War. Four months later, <b>Paraguayan</b> troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation for an attack on Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Caxias had {{organized}} {{an assault on}} the new <b>Paraguayan</b> defenses which López had thrown up along the Pikysyry, south of Asunción (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy jungle of the Chaco region. Caxias had a road cut through the supposedly impenetrable Chaco, located {{on the other side of}} the <b>Paraguayan</b> River where the Allied army was camped. The Brazilian ships carried the Allied troops across the river, where they moved over the road which had been finished in December. The Allied forces outflanked the <b>Paraguayan</b> lines and attacked from the rear. The combined allied forces annihilated the <b>Paraguayan</b> army and on 1 January 1869 Asunción was occupied.|$|E
5|$|The {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, {{took advantage}} of the Uruguayan situation during late 1864 to establish his nation as a regional power. On 11 November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the <b>Paraguayan</b> War. Then in December, the <b>Paraguayan</b> army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul). Four months later, <b>Paraguayan</b> troops invaded Argentine territory as a prelude to an attack upon the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E

5|$|In December 1864, the {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, ordered {{the invasion of}} the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the <b>Paraguayan</b> War. Four months later, <b>Paraguayan</b> troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation for an attack on Rio Grande do Sul. The situation in Rio Grande do Sul was chaotic, and the local military commanders were incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the <b>Paraguayan</b> army. The Baron of Porto Alegre offered to return to active duty, and on 21 July 1865, the government gave him command of the Brazilian land forces in Rio Grande do Sul. He set out for Uruguaiana, a small town in the province's west, where the <b>Paraguayan</b> army was besieged by a combined force of Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan units.|$|E

5|$|On 2 March 1868, {{parties of}} <b>Paraguayans</b> in canoes camouflaged by foliage and brush boarded Brazilian ironclads {{anchored}} in Tayí. The imperiled vessels dispatched a boat to warn Inhaúma, who was aboard the flagship Brasil downriver at Elisiário Port. By {{the time he}} arrived, the Brazilians had locked themselves inside their ships and the <b>Paraguayans</b> had taken control of the decks. Inhaúma ordered the Brasil and two other vessels to open fire, decimating the <b>Paraguayans</b> and saving the ironclads. A day later he was raised from baron to viscount by Pedro II. On 25 July, the allies occupied Humaitá after the <b>Paraguayans</b> had abandoned it and retreated further upriver.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, {{one-fourth of}} all <b>Paraguayans</b> were {{registered}} as living in countries outside Paraguay, {{with a majority}} in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. In 1979, close to 11,000 <b>Paraguayans</b> immigrated to the United States, but the numbers declined rapidly. In 1982, 4000 <b>Paraguayans</b> immigrated to the United States. The reasons of migration were varied, but many immigrants were young people that wanted educational opportunities to get professional knowledge, skills and to have better jobs.|$|R

5|$|The Brazilian ironclad Tamandaré was {{an armored}} gunboat {{built for the}} Brazilian Navy during the <b>Paraguayan</b> War in the mid-1860s. She bombarded the <b>Paraguayan</b> fortifications {{blocking}} access up the Paraná and Paraguay Rivers as well as bombarding <b>Paraguayan</b> positions {{in support of the}} Brazilian Army. The ship participated in the Passagem de Humaitá in February 1868 and was badly damaged. After Tamandaré was repaired she provided fire support for the army {{for the rest of the}} war, aside from bombarding Paraguyan capital of Asunción once. The ship was assigned to the Mato Grosso Flotilla after the war. Tamandaré was decommissioned in 1879 and scrapped afterwards.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire threatened, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay as its political parties turned against each other. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and looting of their property in Uruguay. Brazil's government decided to intervene, fearful of giving any impression of weakness in the face of conflict with the British. A Brazilian army invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War, which ended in February 1865. Meanwhile, the dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power. The <b>Paraguayan</b> army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (the area known after 1977 as the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the <b>Paraguayan</b> War. Four months later, <b>Paraguayan</b> troops invaded Argentine territory as a prelude to an attack on Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|In a {{combined}} offensive against Blanco strongholds, the Brazilian–Colorado troops advanced through Uruguayan territory, taking one town after another. Eventually the Blancos were left isolated in Montevideo, the national capital. Faced with certain defeat, the Blanco government capitulated on 20 February 1865. The short-lived war {{would have been}} regarded as an outstanding success for Brazilian and Argentine interests, had <b>Paraguayan</b> intervention {{in support of the}} Blancos (with attacks upon Brazilian and Argentine provinces) not led to the long and costly <b>Paraguayan</b> War.|$|E
50|$|After this {{defeat the}} Bolivian army {{prepared}} for a last stand at Villa Montes. The loss of that base would allow the <b>Paraguayans</b> to reach the proper Andes. Col. Bernardino Bilbao Rioja and Col. Oscar Moscoso were left {{in charge of the}} defenses, after other high-ranking officers declined. On 11 January 1935 the <b>Paraguayans</b> encircled and forced the retreat of two Bolivian regiments. The <b>Paraguayans</b> also managed in January to cut off the road between Villa Montes and Santa Cruz.|$|R
50|$|As {{compared}} with other nations of the Western Hemisphere, immigration to Paraguay has been very low in recent decades and very few <b>Paraguayans</b> identify with the non-Christian faiths founded in the Eastern Hemisphere.

5|$|Roa Bastos' {{life and}} writing {{were marked by}} {{experience}} with dictatorial military regimes. In 1947 he was forced into exile in Argentina, and in 1976 he fled Buenos Aires for France in similar political circumstances. Most of Roa Bastos' work was written in exile, but this did not deter him from fiercely tackling <b>Paraguayan</b> social and historical issues in his work. Writing in a Spanish that was at times heavily augmented by Guaraní words (the major <b>Paraguayan</b> indigenous language), Roa Bastos incorporated <b>Paraguayan</b> myths and symbols into a Baroque style known as magical realism. He is considered a late-comer to the Latin American Boom literary movement. Roa Bastos' canon includes the novels Hijo de hombre (1960; Son of Man) and El fiscal (1993; The Prosecutor), as well as numerous other novels, short stories, poems, and screenplays.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian ironclad Barroso was an {{armoured}} gunboat {{built for}} the Brazilian Navy during the <b>Paraguayan</b> War in the mid-1860s. Barroso bombarded <b>Paraguayan</b> fortifications in 1866 and 1867 {{a number of times}} before she participated in the Passagem de Humaitá in February 1868. Afterwards the ship provided fire support for the army {{for the rest of the}} war. She was assigned to the Mato Grosso Flotilla after the war. Barroso was decommissioned in 1882, but was not scrapped until 1937.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor rode within rifle-shot of Uruguaiana, but the Paraguayans did {{not attack}} him. To avoid further bloodshed, he offered terms of {{surrender}} to the <b>Paraguayan</b> commander, who accepted. PedroII's coordination of the military operations and his personal example played a decisive role in successfully repulsing the <b>Paraguayan</b> invasion of Brazilian territory. Before returning to Rio de Janeiro, he received the British diplomatic envoy Edward Thornton, who apologized on behalf of Queen Victoria and the British Government for the crisis between the empires. The Emperor regarded this diplomatic victory over the most powerful nation {{of the world as}} sufficient and renewed friendly relations.|$|E

5|$|Atlético Mineiro's first {{participated in}} the Copa Libertadores in 1972, having {{qualified}} as champion of the inaugural Campeonato Brasileiro in 1971. In the first stage, Atlético was drawn in Group 3, along with <b>Paraguayan</b> clubs Olimpia and Cerro Porteño, and fellow Brazilian club São Paulo, runner-up of the Brasileiro. Atlético failed {{to advance to the}} second stage, after drawing four games and losing one to Cerro Porteño. A match against Olimpia in Paraguay was abandoned in the 84th minute at 22, because Atlético had five players sent off; the points were awarded to the <b>Paraguayan</b> club. According to Atlético left-back Oldair, Olimpia played a violent game, and at one point Atlético's players decided to reciprocate. They were subsequently attacked and beaten by local police.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 1864, {{before the}} siege of Paysandú, the <b>Paraguayan</b> {{dictator}} Solano López seized the Brazilian steamer Marquês de Olinda, beginning the <b>Paraguayan</b> War. While the Army of the South crossed Uruguay heading toward Paysandú, Brazil's government sent José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to replace Saraiva. He arrived in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires on 2 December {{and a few days}} later sought a formal alliance with Mitre against the Blancos. The Argentine president refused, insisting that neither he nor his government had any role in Flores' rebellion, and that Argentina would remain neutral. On 26 December, the Paraguayans invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso, laying waste to towns and the countryside.|$|E
5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{conflicts}} occurred between the Empire and its neighbors. Brazil experienced no serious conflicts {{with its neighbors}} {{to the north and}} west, due to the buffer of the nearly impenetrable and sparsely populated Amazonian rainforest. In the south, however, the colonial disputes inherited from Portugal and Spain over the control of the navigable rivers and plains which formed the frontiers continued after independence. The lack of mutually agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the <b>Paraguayan</b> War.|$|E
5|$|After {{the sudden}} and {{unexpected}} death of Carneiro Leão in September 1856, his cabinet only {{managed to survive}} him by a few months. The Emperor, although critical {{of the way the}} Conciliation had been implemented, had learned to appreciate its merits and was eager that it continue. PedroII's support gave the Conciliation another chance, and allowed Paranhos to return to government once more as Foreign Minister on 12 December 1858. The most pressing issue facing Paranhos was the <b>Paraguayan</b> government's persistent refusal to allow Brazilian ships access to Mato Grosso province. At that time, the best and fastest way to reach that distant Brazilian province was to travel via the Atlantic and from there up the rivers which flow between the nations south of Brazil. One of the reasons for Brazil's war against Argentina in 1851 was to assure the free passage of its ships. The crisis between Brazil and Paraguay had dragged on since Paranhos's tenure as Foreign Minister in Carneiro Leão's cabinet. On 12 February 1858, Paranhos signed a treaty with Paraguay which allowed Brazilian ships unrestricted navigation of <b>Paraguayan</b> rivers. This prevented the outbreak of war—or at least deferred the conflict until 1864.|$|E
