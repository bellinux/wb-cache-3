40|$|AbstractThe {{equivalent}} rectangular concrete stress {{block is}} widely adopted in flexural strength design of normal-strength reinforced concrete members. From the past research work reported by other researchers, the equivalent stress <b>block</b> <b>parameters</b> {{was assumed to}} be dependent only on concrete strength. Nonetheless, the theoretical flexural strengths predicted by the currently used codes were often significantly lower than the actual strengths. In this study, the authors studied the characteristics of equivalent concrete stress block by investigating other factors than concrete strength only. In total 14 inverted T-shaped specimens in 6 groups were fabricated and tested. Each group had identical cross section properties and contained one concentrically loaded specimen and one/several eccentrically loaded specimen(s). The equivalent concrete stress <b>block</b> <b>parameters</b> of the eccentrically loaded specimen were obtained by adopting the modified stress-strain curve of its counterpart concentrically loaded specimen using a numerical analysis method. Based on the experimental results, the authors found that the equivalent stress <b>block</b> <b>parameters</b> are dependent on strain gradient besides concrete strength. A new set of equivalent rectangular concrete stress <b>block</b> <b>parameters</b> incorporating strain gradient effects were proposed for design purpose, and their validities were verified by comparing with the measured flexural strengths of beams and columns tested by previous researchers...|$|R

In other words, how to choose the input signal so that the model error described previously is minimized, is studied. The investigations show that the optimal input probability density function has a surprisingly simple format.

40|$|Abstract — Block {{transmission}} {{systems are}} used for high data rate transmissions over wireless channels. The block structure {{can be obtained by}} inserting guard periods, which are used to avoid inter block interference between the transmitted data blocks. However, these guard periods produce a transmission overhead and therefore reduce the throughput of the transmission system. By using so-called overlapping techniques, a block processing structure can be realized without inserting guard periods. In this paper we will use these techniques for two major processing tasks, the data estimation and the error correction Viterbi decoding. By avoiding the overhead in terms of guard periods and initialization/termination sequences for convolutional coding, the throughput of the system can be increased significantly, while the bit error performance is only slightly decreased. Furthermore the overlapping approaches enable a block-wise parallel implementation of the receiver’s processing tasks. Depending on the used system <b>parameters</b> (<b>block</b> length, interleaving length, decoding block length), different levels of parallelization can be achieved. I...|$|R

The cases of distinct and multiple eigenvalues are addressed.
