40|$|Complete {{information}} on the planned Galileo Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not yet available because the system {{is still in the}} pre-development phase and much detail of the services to be offered is subject to commercial confidentiality. However, {{information on}} the planned spectrum occupancy and the signal details are available and other information may be inferred from the operation of GPS, a similar system which is planned will operate co-operatively with Galileo. The paper describes what is now known about the proposed Galileo system design and its applications, with particular reference to the E 6 (1260 - 1300 MHz) band. It also covers some of the political issues driving the <b>programme</b> <b>and</b> the <b>frequency</b> allocation situation. It describes the operation of typical receivers and their ability to deal with interference, and gives practical illustrations of these effects. The likely effect of the Galileo transmissions on amateur 23 cm receivers is analysed and found to be negligible. However, there is the potential for most amateur 23 cm transmissions to interfere with Galileo unless the Galileo receivers are designed and built to withstand it. Finally the likely course of events is discussed and arguments that we might use to continue ou...|$|R

Potential affections on oocyte and embryo quality are mention according to specific types of administration protocols. Human infertility is slowly becoming common and one of the techniques used to treat it in assisted reproduction is also ovarian stimulation.

The crucial role nutrition plays for developmental, conductive and behavioral outcomes in life’s early stages is often not well understood and appreciate acted upon by schools and parents. Kirie division is among the divisions greatly affected by irregular rain and inadequate food supplies due to drought. In this regards, it is necessary {{to evaluate the}} malnutrition effects on learning ability of children. Malnutrition is a medical condition where one is weak or ill because he/she doesn’t eat enough, or the right kind of food. Descriptive research design was adopted. The study covered 10 schools where class one pupils were obtained from each school. Five teachers and 5 parents were selected from each school. The data was collected by use of two questionnaires, one for the teacher and the other for the parent. an interview schedule was used for the pupils. Data was analyzed by use of excel <b>programme</b> <b>and</b> presented in <b>frequency</b> tables, bar graphs and pie charts. From the study, it was found that poor malnutrition had an effect on learning due to increased infections, diminished cognitive ability and low school attendance rate. By improving on the feeding programme, the learners can continue to attend school. Basic needs should also be provided for...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{falls in}} older adults is a {{significant}} global public health challenge. Exercise interventions which incorporate the physiological components of balance and strength can reduce falls risk. However, the optimum qualities, such as type, duration <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of engagement in these exercise programmes, are yet to be established. Objective: the overall research project aimed to develop and test a tool {{for the assessment of}} physiological criteria in community exercise <b>programmes</b> <b>and</b> to determine which community exercise programmes may be modified to help reduce falls risk factors. This initial phase of the research and the aim of this paper are to describe the development of the Community Exercise Program Assessment Matrix (the Matrix). Methods: a review of the falls literature identified an existing classification system, which guided the development of the Matrix. An expert panel assisted in reviewing, testing and ongoing refinement of the Matrix. Results: the Matrix contains a range of physiological and cognitive components as well as other items which capture non-physiological components. After testing some modifications were made to the Matrix to aid usage. Conclusion: this paper has outlined the development of the Matrix, which is intended to be used for the recording of physiological components (related to falls prevention) of an exercise programme in terms of type, duration <b>and</b> <b>frequency.</b> The next step is to use the Matrix in conjunction with pre- and post-physiological testing of participants to assess a range of exercise <b>programmes</b> <b>and</b> changes in participant physiological functioning...|$|R

30|$|Although {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that pesticide use poses threats {{to the environment and}} farmers themselves, and that farmers can improve yields as well as increase profits following adoption of integrated pest management (IPM), integrated plant nutrition systems (IPNS) and other technologies (Pretty 1995), pesticide use is still high among farmers in Ghana, particularly, cocoa farmers. The question that arises is “what are the factors that influence the decision of a farmer to use pesticide”? Another major concern aside the use of pesticide is the frequency of pesticide application. The Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) recommends that for effective and sustainable control of pests and diseases, cocoa farmers need to apply pesticides on their cocoa farms four times per season (Adu-Acheampong et al. 2007). This notwithstanding, farmers do not apply pesticide on their cocoa farms at the recommended frequency. The question that arises is “what are the factors that influence frequency of application”? Knowing the factors that influence pesticide use <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of application would enable stakeholders such as Ghana COCOBOD and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), to identify the specific issues (socio-economic characteristics) that influences cocoa farmer’s pesticide use <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of application in order to put up policies (such as Cocoa Disease and Pest Control (CODAPEC) <b>programme</b> <b>and</b> IPM Farmer Field Schools) that would reduce or increase pesticide use <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of application if necessary. In view of this, it is imperative to assess the factors that influence cocoa farmers’ decision to use pesticide <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of pesticide application.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Cancer is {{increasingly}} being {{viewed as a}} chronic illness requiring long-term management, {{and there is a}} growing need for evidence-based rehabilitation interventions for cancer survivors. Previous reviews have evaluated the benefits of exercise interventions for patients undergoing cancer treatment and long-term survivors, but none have investigated the role of exercise during cancer rehabilitation, the period immediately following cancer treatment completion. This systematic review summarises the literature on the health effects of exercise during cancer rehabilitation and evaluates the methodological rigour of studies in this area to date. [...] - Methods: Relevant studies were identified through a systematic search of PubMed and Embase to April 2009. Data on study design, recruitment strategy, participants, exercise intervention, adherence rates, and outcomes were extracted. Methodological rigour was assessed using a structured rating system. [...] Results: Ten studies were included. Breast cancer patients were the predominate patient group represented. Most interventions were aerobic or resistance-training exercise <b>programmes,</b> <b>and</b> exercise type, <b>frequency,</b> duration <b>and</b> intensity varied across studies. Improvements in physical functioning, strength, physical activity levels, quality of life, fatigue, immune function, haemoglobin concentrations, potential markers of recurrence, and body composition were reported. However, all studies were limited by incomplete reporting and methodological limitations. [...] Conclusions: Although the methodological limitations of studies in this new field must be acknowledged, initial evidence indicates that exercise is feasible and may provide physiological and psychological benefits for cancer survivors during the rehabilitation period. Future studies with rigorous study designs are now required to advance the field. ...|$|R
