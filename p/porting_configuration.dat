Fully transient CFD analyses by means of state-of-the-art tools and methodologies are carried out for the wholeintake and compression strokes, in order to evaluate port effects on both engine permability and in-cylinder flowfield evolution. Organized mean motions (i. e., swirl, tumble and squish) are investigated, trying to establishgeneral rules in the port design optimization process, addressing relationships between the relative portorientation and the in-cylinder flow structure. Different <b>port</b> <b>configurations</b> are compared, each deriving from therotation of the BASE <b>port</b> <b>configuration</b> on two different planes, the former being perpendicular to the cylinderaxis, while the latter being parallel to the cylinder axis.

40|$|Freeing ports {{on fishing}} vessels are a {{significant}} safety feature. They are designed to reduce the build up of green water on deck {{that may lead to}} loss of stability. At a more mundane level they reduce wetness on decks that are the working platforms for the fishers. Wet decks that are moving working platforms are clearly a hazard. The present study deals more with the build up of water on deck rather than just general deck wetness. It attempts to quantify the amount of water on deck for different freeing <b>port</b> <b>configurations,</b> using parameters such as number of freeing ports, freeing port areas, deck area etc. The study uses numerical simulations to evaluate these parameters. One particular vessel has been used throughout the study, namely a typical fibreglass 65 foot fishing vessel of recent design. The main conclusions of the study are that generally there is not a great deal of difference between the amounts of water on deck for the different freeing <b>port</b> <b>configurations.</b> Although larger freeing ports allow more water on deck if the ingress and egress of water flowing through the freeing ports is unhindered in both directions, for freeing ports fitted with some device (such as 2 ̆ 018 flaps 2 ̆ 019) that hinders the in-flow but not the out-flow then having larger freeing ports is shown to be beneficial. The benefits here are more to do with stability than general deck wetness. It is in fact clear from some of the results that larger freeing ports lead to wetter decks. The motions of the vessel in the study with water on deck have been evaluated and it is shown that different freeing <b>port</b> <b>configurations</b> can lead to different motions of the vessel, particularly {{in the early stages of}} flooding.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{bulk gas}} motion in an engine cylinder with different flow scales generates a varied range of shear stresses and deformations in the fluid, {{which leads to}} the gas turbulence. These flow irregularities combined with periodic engine operation induce gas fluctuations over time and cylinder volume. This affects the thermal inhomogeneity of the in-cylinder gas mixture composition. A novel approach to the formation of in-cylinder flow that promote Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition HCCI engine by generating various patterns of the incylinder flow has been proposed. Two types of inlet manifold diffusers were experimentally applied to a 4 -valve pentroof optical engine and the spatial flow inhomogeneities were carefully analysed. Additional special effects in the in-cylinder flow fields were induced by using the Negative Valve Overlap (NVO) technique. Case studies for internal nonreactive ‘COLD’ flow structures were investigated using a motored single cylinder optical engine and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique to validate a 3 -D CFD engine model. The optical diagnostics and CFD modelling of the in-cylinder HCCI ‘COLD’ flow show that two different porting strategies with fixed Negative Valve Overlap (NVO) significantly affect the in-cylinder flow structures. A comparison of in-cylinder flow effects generated by different intake deflectors indicate that a low-swirl <b>port</b> <b>configuration</b> can potentially improve the fuel and thermal homogeneity by producing higher values of Root Mean Square (RMS) of velocity fluctuation and turbulence intensity. The high-swirl <b>port</b> <b>configuration</b> generates high stratification of gas flow field at Top Dead Centre (TDC). The final part of the study investigates the stratification of gas temperatures. The 3 studies show that both of the intake shrouds generate differences in the rate of change of the large scale rotating flow affecting the gas transport and mixing process within the engine cylinder.

The {{motivation}} comes from {{the high number of}} intake and exhaust ports which characterizes this engine. The scavenging and trapping efficiency were studied by modifying several parameters related to the ports, such as the inclination, shape, pressure and number. To this end, a numerical model based on the commercial software ANSYS Fluent was employed. Numerical results were validated using experimental measurements performed on a Fairbanks-Morse 38 D 8 - 1 / 8 engine installed on a submarine.

5000|$|Compared with OHV pushrod {{systems with}} {{the same number of}} valves, the {{reciprocating}} components of the OHC system are fewer and have a lower overall mass. Though the system that drives the camshafts may be more complex, most [...] accept that added complexity as a trade-off for better engine performance and greater design flexibility. The fundamental reason for the OHC valvetrain is that it offers an increase in the engine's ability to exchange induction and exhaust gases. (This exchange is sometimes known as 'engine breathing'. [...] ) Another performance advantage is gained {{as a result of the}} better optimised <b>port</b> <b>configurations</b> made possible with overhead camshaft designs. With no intrusive pushrods, the overhead camshaft cylinder head design can use straighter ports of more advantageous cross-section and length.
