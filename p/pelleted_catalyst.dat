40|$|Catalyst {{deactivation}} due to coke and metals deposition as {{a result}} of cracking presents a challenge in heavy oil recovery and upgrading. This is particularly pronounced for in situ upgrading techniques, in which <b>pelleted</b> <b>catalyst</b> is packed {{around the perimeter of the}} horizontal producer well of the Toe-to-Heel Air Injection (THAI) process. The fixed bed of catalyst is virtually impossible to regenerate in place, promoting investigation of alternative contacting via the dispersion of nanoparticles. The catalysts studied were finely crushed micro-particulates with average size of 2. 6 µm and also a catalyst prepared upon a bacterial support. The latter has advantages in terms of ease of preparation of catalysts from recycled metal sources. Heavy oil of API gravity 13. 8 o and viscosity 1091 mPa. s was used as feed and upgrading was performed in a batch reactor at 425 oC, with a catalyst-to-oil ratio of 0. 02 (g/g), and at an initial pressure of 20 bar. The activity of the Pd/biomass catalyst was evaluated against a number of other catalysts: Pd/Al 2 O 3, Pd/C, Al 2 O 3 and Co-Mo/Al 2 O 3. By using the Pd/biomass catalyst, the produced oil gravity increased by 7. 8 o API, and its viscosity was reduced to 7 mPa. s. This effect corresponded to an increase in the amount of low-boiling distillate (IBP- 200 oC) from 34. 6 vol. % (original feedstock) to 53 - 62 vol. %, potentially reducing the amount of diluent needed for pipeline transport of bitumen. The coke yields were (wt%) : 13. 65 (Al 2 O 3), 9. 55 (Pd/Al 2 O 3), 6. 85 (Pd/C) and 3. 87 (Pd/biomass).

An alternative contacting pattern between the oil and nanoparticulate catalysts was investigated in this study, to mitigate the above mentioned challenges. The Taguchi method was applied to optimize the effect of reaction factors and select the optimum values that maximize level of heavy oil upgrading while suppressing coke yield.

An orthogonal array, analysis of mean of response, analysis of mean {{signal to noise ratio}} (S/N) and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) were employed to analyze the effect of these reaction factors. Detailed optimization of the reaction conditions with iron oxide dispersed nanoparticles (≤ 50 nm) for in situ catalytic upgrading of heavy oil was carried out at the following ranges; temperature 355 – 425 oC, reaction time 20 – 80 min, agitation 200 – 900 rpm, initial hydrogen pressure 10 – 50 bar, and iron metal loading 0. 03 – 0. 4 wt%.

40|$|Heterogeneous <b>catalyst</b> based <b>pellets</b> typify a {{material}} where functionality is dependant on hierarchical pore structures spanning many {{orders of magnitude}} from nanometers up to tens of microns. The total activity, selectivity and lifetime of <b>catalyst</b> based <b>pellets</b> depends {{on the ability of}} molecules to flow through a large pellet bed (m), into the pellets (mm) and their pore structure (μm-nm) to/from the active sites. Three dimensional imaging techniques such as tomography allow for the direct characterisation and quantification of pore structures. However, the field of view in tomography decreases as resolution increases. This work circumvents this issue with multiscale tomography (MT) combining x-ray microtomography (XMT), dual beam focused ion beam tomography (DB-FIB) and electron tomography (ET) to probe porous <b>pellet</b> based <b>catalysts.</b> The results show MT as a viable method that offers new insights into the quantification and behaviour of <b>pellet</b> based <b>catalysts</b> across large length scales, all in three dimensions (3 D), that no single tomographic technique can adequately capture. MT was successfully used in the characterising of pore sizes, distributions, structures and spatial relationships and this was compared to existing multiscale characterisation techniques to illustrate the new insights that can be obtained. The pore structures were meshed and modeled using MT data to provide results for understanding the transport properties scaled up from the nanometre length scale to the packed bed, through <b>pellet</b> based <b>catalysts</b> produced under different manufacturing conditions. The results show the very strong dependence on the calcining temperature which is important for designing better catalysts in future. The tomography data was also used to determine thermal/mechanical stresses at both a pellet and pellet bed level. Although many stresses are compressive; the packing of the pellets creates local tensile stresses and a potential cause for pellet failure through internal flaws at relatively low loads.

At a temperature range of 650 - 800 degrees C, O- 2 /C molar ratio of 0. 38 - 0. 45 (air as oxygen source) and H 2 O/C ratio of 2. 0, alkanes (e. g., octane) were fully converted into reformate with minor amount of CH 4 remaining whereas aromatics (e. g., toluene) converted into CH 4 -free reformate at a relatively higher temperature. Compared with <b>pellet</b> <b>catalysts,</b> monolithic catalysts with equivalent amount of net catalytic components demonstrated higher activity and selectivity due to the intensified reforming process. This catalyst also showed quite good resilience to sulfur poisoning, although the presence of sulfur in source fuels could make the hydrogen productivity suffer. Moreover, one 1 kW gasoline fuel processor built on a scaled-up catalyst was successfully operated at a (H- 2 + CO) throughput of 0. 9 - 1. 0 m(3) /h for 60 h. The catalyst sintering and carbon formation which were exacerbated by sulfur-poisoning mainly accounted for the slowly deactivation of the catalyst. The sintering was also aggravated by the low thermal conductivity of the cordierite substrates and by the inharmonic reaction rates of catalytic partial oxidation and steam reforming.

At the steady state, it is shown that a one-dimensional model gives an adequate description of the system for most purposes, provided that the overall effective heat transfer coefficient between the fluid and coolant is suitably evaluated. The models, which are of the continuum type, take account of the heterogeneous nature of the system by modifying the rates of reaction and heat generation at each point in the bed to allow for the effects of transport processes on the performance of individual <b>catalyst</b> <b>pellets.</b> The models of the <b>catalyst</b> <b>pellet</b> have been formulated initially in a fully distributed form, taking account of transport resistances around and within the particles, and are then simplified by lumping the thermal resistance at the boundary between solid and fluid.

The proposed dynamic model of the reactor is one dimensional and has been used to examine the basic transient characteristics of the system. It is demonstrated that some unexpected difficulties may arise in attempting to control the reactor. In particular, very high peak temperatures may occur when the inlet temperature is reduced. These are specifically associated with the heterogeneous nature of the model.

A novel photocatalytic reactor, which employs a commercial pellet titanium dioxide (TiO 2) catalyst, was tested for water treatment capability by investigating the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants from waste water discharges such as; hydrocarbons in produced water from the oil industry and synthetic dyes from the textile industry’s waste processing fluids, using titanium dioxide (TiO 2) as photocatalyst in an aqueous suspension under UV irradiation. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of parameters such as catalyst loading, pollutant adsorption rate on the <b>pellet</b> TiO 2 <b>catalyst</b> and reactor circulation flow rate. In this work, the batch adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution (10 M) onto the Hombikat-KCO <b>pellet</b> TiO 2 <b>catalyst</b> was studied, adsorption isotherms and kinetics were determined from the experimental data. A modest catalyst loading of 30 g per 1 L TiO 2 was choosen for further experiments since its shows gradual and consistent degradation results and approximately 98 % degradation of methylene blue was achieved within 60 minutes irradiation in the optimization experiment. Photodegradation of methylene blue dye was monitored by UV- spectroscopy. Complete degradation of methylene blue was achieved within 60 minutes illumination with the various loads of catalyst (30 - 200 g). Experimental results indicate that this novel reactor configuration has a high effective mass transfer rate and UV light penetration characteristics. The use of TiO 2 Hombikat KOC <b>pellets</b> <b>catalyst</b> means the system is free from the need of filtration of catalyst following photocatalysis and provides a higher surface area for catalyst illumination and a high contact of catalyst surface area with contaminated water...|$|R

The study {{of a variety of}} partially wetted cylindrical <b>catalyst</b> <b>pellets</b> for first- and second-order kinetics indicates that the manner in which particles are externally wetted does not significantly influence the value of the effectiveness factor. External and internal partial wetting of industrial-size porous extrudates is determined in a bench-scale hydrotreater at real hydroprocessing conditions by simulating the system response to a step change of feed using the sulfur compounds of a petroleum fraction as tracer molecules. To solve the corresponding mass balances in the interparticle and intraparticle domain, two different numerical methods are compared...|$|R
40|$|A {{new way of}} {{preparing}} catalytically active wire meshes through a thermal-spray technique is described. A metal substrate (e. g. Kanthal AF) was plasma-sprayed with a composite ceramic/polymer-powder. The polymer content of the sprayed layer was burnt off whereupon a well-defined macro-porosity was created. By treating the so obtained material with an alumina-sol the specific surface area could be increased {{by a factor of}} 50 or more. The ceramic layer was finally activated with precious metals through an impregnation step. A numerical model was developed to compare the performance of wire-mesh-, monolith- and <b>pellets</b> <b>catalysts.</b> The model describes the resistance to internal and external mass- and heat transfer and the effects of axial dispersion. The wire-mesh model was verified through experiments. Different evaluation parameters were derived to compare the catalyst performance relative to the catalyst volume, the geometric weight, the catalyst weight, the pressure drop and the temperature response. Wire-mesh catalysts offer the following advantages: high mass and heat transfer numbers, moderate pressure drop, insignificant effects of pore diffusion and axial dispersion, thermal and mechanical strength, geometric flexibility, excellent thermal response, simplicity in the catalyst recovery. The cost of a wire-mesh catalyst is expected to be competitive to other alternatives. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R
