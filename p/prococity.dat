40|$|Serum {{concentrations}} of luteinizing hormone (LH) and {{follicle stimulating hormone}} (FSH) were determined in 329 normal children and 185 individuals with endocrinological abnormalities or variations of development. A significant increase of gonadotrophins is noted {{at the onset of}} puberty among the boys and at menarche for girls. The values are compared with serum {{concentrations of}} LH and FSH in children with abnormalities of sexual development, pituitary malfunction as well as other clinical abnormalities. Comparable levels for age and stage of development were found for premature thelarche, premature adrenarche, cryptorchidism, male pseudohermaphroditism and pubertal gynaecomastia. Hypogonadal individuals (Klinefelter's and Turner's syndrome, pure ovarian dysgenesis and testicular dysgenesis) have markedly elevated values while those with pituitary hypofunction had low values. Patients with sexual <b>prococity</b> tended to have elevated concentrations...|$|E
