40|$|This paper aims to {{introduce}} a new strategic direction for the multinational <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> {{in terms of the}} access to essential, life-saving medicines. The multinational <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> have been severely criticized by their various stakeholders because of their business models, particularly because of the stringent patent protection on the pharmaceutical products. The multinational <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> should find a new strategic direction to balance their R&D-intensive, expensive business with the access to essential, lifesaving medicines since favorable public relations are critical for the multinational <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> to maintain their profitable business. This paper adopts an Analogical Reasoning Model (ARM) to propose a new strategic direction for the multinational <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> in an effort to balance their expensive business with the enhanced social responsibility. In essence, the ARM helps the multinational <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> formulate viable strategies that can realize a win-win situation not only for their stakeholders but also for the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> themselves. The ARM is constructed, analyzing the food and beverage industry as a source environment, and suggests a comprehensive, industry-wide, multi-stakeholder public-private partnership, led not by the public sector but by the multinational <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although {{access to}} {{medicines}} {{is a vital}} feature {{of the right to}} the highest attainable standard of health ("right to health"), almost two billion people lack access to essential medicines, leading to immense avoidable suffering. While the human rights responsibility to provide access to medicines lies mainly with States, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> also have human rights responsibilities in relation to access to medicines. This article provides an introduction to these responsibilities. It briefly outlines the new UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and places the human rights responsibilities of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> in this context. The authors draw from the work of the first UN Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, in particular the Human Rights Guidelines for <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Companies</b> in Relation to Access to Medicines that he presented to the UN General Assembly in 2008, and his UN report on GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). While the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights are general human rights standards applicable to all business entities, the Human Rights Guidelines for <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Companies</b> consider the specific human rights responsibilities of one sector (<b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies)</b> in relation to one area of activity (access to medicines). The article signals the human rights responsibilities of all <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies,</b> with particular attention to patent-holding <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies.</b> Adopting a right-to-health "lens," the article discusses GSK and accountability. The authors argue that human rights should shape pharmaceutical companies' policies, and provide standards in relation to which <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> could, and should, be held accountable. They conclude that it is now crucial to devise independent, accessible, transparent, and effective mechanisms to monitor <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> and hold them publicly accountable for their human rights responsibilities...|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since {{the drug was}} first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on the central nervous system. In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> Parke Davis, began investigating the relationship between kinins {{and the effects of}} aspirin. In tests on guinea pigs, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the bronchoconstriction effects of bradykinin. He found that cutting the guinea pigs' vagus nerve did not affect the action of bradykinin or the inhibitory effect of aspirin—evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on the central nervous system. In 1963, Collier began working with University of London pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise {{mechanism of}} aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and in vitro tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like in vivo tests.|$|E

Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks.

Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering if he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe.
