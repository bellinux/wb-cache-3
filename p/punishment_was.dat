5|$|Crime and <b>Punishment</b> <b>was</b> a 2002 {{television}} serial {{produced by}} the BBC, starring John Simm as Raskolnikov and Ian McDiarmid as Porfiry Petrovich.|$|E
5|$|Time and <b>Punishment</b> <b>was</b> later {{referenced}} in DC Comics' Booster Gold {{comic book}} series, where Booster Gold explains the butterfly effect by referencing this episode.|$|E
5|$|More {{than fifty}} former pupils {{contacted}} police, either as victims of, or witnesses to, sexual abuse. The alleged sexual abuse, including molestation of children while corporal <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> administered, stemmed from 1962 onwards and continued over four decades.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{the outcome}} of the trial a <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> chosen. The {{ultimate}} <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> death. An execution squad will carry out the order. They could possibly suffocate the offender in their bed or slit their throat. The death <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> known as a [...] "number one".|$|R
50|$|The above Nash {{equilibrium}} is {{not always}} subgame perfect. If <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> costly for the punishers, the threat of <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> not credible.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{philosophers}} {{of punishment}} have contrasted retributivism with utilitarianism. For utilitarians, <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> forward-looking, justified by a purported {{ability to achieve}} future social benefits, such as crime reduction. For retributionists, <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> backward-looking, justified by the crime that has already <b>been</b> committed. Therefore <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> carried out to atone for the damage already done.|$|R
5|$|The legal code {{distinguished}} {{different levels}} of severity in meted punishments when different members {{of the social and}} political hierarchy committed the same crime. For example, the severity of <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> different when a servant or nephew killed a master or an uncle than when a master or uncle killed a servant or nephew.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the authoritarian {{government}} in Portugal in 1974, the Spanish government was the sole surviving dictatorship in Western Europe, where several countries in 1975 were ruled by socialist parties which had long loathed Franco for coming to power by overthrowing a socialist democracy. Hostility to the use of capital <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> widespread in Western Europe at this time and most Western European countries had ceased using it.|$|E
5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce {{to bury the}} dead between the lines led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|Criminal {{responsibility}} is considered personal, therefore collective <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> not recognized. A defendant is considered {{innocent until proven}} guilty, and <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> aimed at the rehabilitation of the convicted. The death penalty and cruel and unusual <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> prohibited. Extradition of citizens is not permitted outside of those cases provided by international conventions, and is prohibited for political offences.|$|R
40|$|Lab {{experiments}} on <b>punishment</b> <b>are</b> of limited relevance for understanding cooperative {{behavior in the}} real world. In real interactions, <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> not cheap, but the costs of <b>punishment</b> <b>are</b> of a different nature than in experiments. They do not correspond to direct payments or payoff deductions, but they arise from the repercussions punishment has on social networks and future interactions...|$|R
50|$|One {{variable}} affecting <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> contingency, {{which is}} defined as the dependency of events. A behavior may be dependent on a stimulus or dependent on a response. The purpose of <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> to reduce a behavior, {{and the degree to which}} <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> effective in reducing a targeted behavior is dependent on the relationship between the behavior and a punishment. For example, if a rat receives an aversive stimulus, such as a shock each time it presses a lever, then it is clear that contingency occurs between lever pressing and shock. In this case, the punisher (shock) is contingent upon the appearance of the behavior (lever pressing). <b>Punishment</b> <b>is</b> most effective when contingency is present between a behavior and a punisher. A second variable affecting <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> contiguity, which is the closeness of events in time and/or space. Contiguity is important to reducing behavior because the longer the time interval between an unwanted behavior and a punishing effect, the less effective the <b>punishment</b> will <b>be.</b> One major problem with a time delay between a behavior and a <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> that other behaviors may present during that time delay. The subject may then associate the punishment given with the unintended behaviors, and thus suppressing those behaviors instead of the targeted behavior. Therefore, immediate <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> more effective in reducing a targeted behavior than a delayed <b>punishment</b> would <b>be.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the executions, there was speculation that up to 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished the death penalty in all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The {{judiciary}} of Texas {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex in the United States, with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions. Texas has two courts of last resort: the Texas Supreme Court, for civil cases, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary; the governor fills vacancies by appointment. Texas is notable for its use of capital punishment, having led the country in executions since capital <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> reinstated in the Gregg v. Georgia case (see Capital punishment in Texas).|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{penalties}} enacted against the French officers whose neglectful behaviour {{had contributed to}} the mutiny at Yen Bay. Resident Superior Robin released Resident Massimi from his duties immediately after the mutiny. No <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> handed down to Commandant Le Tacon, the main person responsible for the security at Yen Bay which had failed to stop the mutiny. Neither Robin nor General Aubert, who were ultimately accountable for the failures of their subordinates, were punished. The former remained in Indochina as Governor General until retiring in 1936. Aubert returned to France when his three-year term ended {{in the autumn of}} 1930.|$|E
50|$|Value: that <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> only {{justified}} {{when it is}} most {{conducive to}} the welfare of society 1987:3, that is, the value society gains from the <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> more than the disadvantages incurred by the offender.|$|R
50|$|However, some {{theories}} {{would argue}} that the amount of <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> not important at all. For example, if the purpose of <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> incapacitation, the fact that a jail sentence is undesirable to the offender is irrelevant.|$|R
50|$|Two {{sorts of}} {{necessary}} <b>punishment</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Disciplinary <b>punishments</b> help to reinforce an individual's good conscience, by providing external {{support in the}} battle against falling into vice. The second and most essential sort of <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> the punitive. Weil considers that in a sense the committal of a crime puts the individual outside of the chain of obligations that form the good society, and that <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> essential to re-integrate the individual into lawful society.|$|R
5|$|Whereas {{the common}} law {{protected}} habitation and sources of wealth and food in a largely agricultural society, the Industrial Revolution, especially the Luddism resulting from workers' perceived threats to their livelihood, required new legislation to match the circumstances. The reaction of Parliament to Luddism was to criminalise machine-breaking – the destruction of textile-making machinery – as early as 1721. Initially the <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> transportation to the Colonies {{but as a result}} of continued opposition to mechanisation the Frame-Breaking Act of 1812 made the death penalty available.|$|E
5|$|After three down {{years by}} UConn standards, the team {{emerged as a}} heavy {{contender}} for the championship in the 2008 season. In addition to all players returning from the 2007 team, #1 ranked high school player Maya Moore joined the team after a bitter recruitment battle between UConn and Tennessee. Shortly after Moore's commitment to UConn, Tennessee announced they were cancelling the annual series with UConn, thus ending {{one of the biggest}} rivalries in the sport. Even if both coaches remained vague and unspecific about the reasons of the cancellation, Tennessee filed a complaint to the NCAA about UConn's recruitment of Moore. UConn was found to have committed a secondary violation (involving a tour of the ESPN campus) and no <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> handed out.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{returned}} to Normandy, and in December 1195 attempted to secure {{compensation for the}} losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip. He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction, and felt so ill-treated by the kings that he abandoned his see. The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 Treaty of Louviers that the two kings arranged for themselves, with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety, or guarantor that {{the conditions of the}} treaty would be fulfilled. Part of the treaty laid out that if the archbishop laid an interdict or excommunicated anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen, then the archiepiscopal manor of Andeli should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop's <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> valid.|$|E
50|$|Each hold is {{responsible}} for the discipline of its wrongdoers. Most times the Lord Holder will make the wrongdoer pay restitution and service to the wronged party. The next severest <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> incarceration. Death penalty can also be used in response to heinous crimes. But the greatest <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> to be named holdless. This is where a person is stripped of all rank and status and thrown out of the hold. The reason this is the most severe <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> because the holdless have nowhere to go during Threadfall.|$|R
50|$|With {{respect to}} the {{cooperation}} norms violations (prisoner's dilemma), {{it has been shown}} that second-party <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> consistently higher than third-party punishments for defectors. The <b>punishments</b> <b>were</b> such that the defectors could still profit in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. <b>Punishment</b> for cooperators <b>were</b> negligible under both conditions.|$|R
50|$|With {{respect to}} the {{distribution}} norms violations (dictator games), {{it has been shown}} that second-party <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> consistently higher than third-party punishments for dictators that choose to share less than half of their endowment. The <b>punishments</b> <b>were</b> such that the dictators could still profit from giving less than half in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. The levels of <b>punishment</b> <b>were</b> consistently low for both second and third-party punishments if the levels of endowment were higher than half.|$|R
5|$|Gaveston's {{return to}} grace was only temporary. On 26 February 1307, Edward I {{announced}} that the prince's favourite {{had to leave the}} realm shortly after 30 April that year. This time it seems the <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> not intended for Gaveston, though, but for the Prince of Wales. According to Walter of Guisborough, the prince appeared before the King to request that his own county of Ponthieu be given to Gaveston. Edward I, enraged, tore out handfuls of his son's hair and threw him out of the royal chambers. Though Guisborough cannot necessarily be trusted on the details of the events, the story reflects the general exasperation the King felt with the prince's favouritism towards Gaveston, and the lavish gifts bestowed on the favourite. This extravagance was clearly seen on Gaveston's departure, when Prince Edward equipped him with horses, luxurious clothes, and £260 of money.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system {{was a mixture of}} the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars regard it as being a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the traditional family unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E
5|$|Hill and his {{brothers}} {{had taken over the}} management of their father's school in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E

5|$|In Gortyn, in Crete, {{according}} to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (doulos or oikeus) {{found themselves in a}} state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Powell v. Alabama in 1932, the United States Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to {{defendants}} in capital trials, that is trials where capital <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own counsel. In Johnson v. Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded this principle to cover all federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to State courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, the court has affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation {{after they have been}} arrested (Miranda v. Arizona), and for line-ups (United States v. Wade).|$|E
5|$|Kemper was {{released}} {{at the age}} of 21 after convincing Atascadero psychiatrists that he had been rehabilitated. Kemper was regarded as nonthreatening by his victims. He solely targeted young female hitchhikers during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to quiet areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered, and violated. He then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities. He was found sane to stand trial and in 1973 guilty and requested the death penalty for his crimes. However, capital <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> temporarily suspended in California. He instead received eight life sentences. Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the California Medical Facility.|$|E

The most severe <b>punishment</b> of all <b>is</b> exile, usually to the island archipelago known as the Eastern Ring Islands. The reason this is the most severe <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> because the holdless have nowhere to go during Threadfall and have no other human contact. This <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> usually followed by a Shunning, which, in effect, causes the Shunned to be ignored completely by all humans. It is established in Dragon's Fire that the Shunned are marked on their foreheads with an indelible dye for identification.|$|R
