40|$|The {{exploitation}} of hidden information from large datasets {{by means of}} data mining techniques suffers from long response times. We address this problem by using the processing power of workstation clusters and have studied the performance of OLAP queries {{as a first step}} towards a <b>portable</b> data <b>mining</b> platform. The results of our study suggest that with the availability of parallel workstation clusters that are equipped with high performance communication networks, fine-grained and communication-intensive parallelizations of queries are promising [...] even though they are considered too costly in traditional database systems. The paper describes our Java framework for parallel OLAP-type query execution, necessary optimizations to the standard Java implementation, and analyzes the performance of non-standard parallel execution schemes on a workstation cluster. 1 Introduction The need for and the benefits of data mining have been commonly accepted by the business and scient [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Data mining offers {{tools for}} the {{discovery}} of relationship, patterns and knowledge from a massive database in order to guide decisions about future activities. Applications from various domains have adopted this technique to perform data analysis efficiently. Several issues {{need to be addressed}} when such techniques apply on data these are bulk at size and geographically distributed at various sites. In this paper we describe system architecture for a scalable and a <b>portable</b> distributed data <b>mining</b> application. The system contains modules for secure distributed communication, database connectivity, organized data management and efficient data analysis for generating a global mining model. Performance evaluation of the system is also carried out and presented. ...|$|R

Production started in 1980 {{with the use of}} components from both the BMP-1 and BMP-2. Fifty IRMs were produced from 1986. However, the suspension had a new hull, one extra road wheel and one additional hydraulic shock-absorber. It has four pressurized compartments, with the engine located at the rear. There are three hatches {{on the top of the}} hull and one emergency hatch in the bottom. The IRM is equipped with two retractable propellers in ring covers for swimming and steering and two cases with 16 9M39 solid engines (each has a thrust of 312 kg and weighs 6.3 kg), for getting out of mud. Special reconnaissance equipment consists of two R-147 radios; one PIR-451 periscope; TNPO-160, TNP-370 and TNV-25M periscopic observation devices; an AGI-1s horizon indicator; a DSP-30 portable periscopic rangefinder, a PAB-2M portable aiming circle, one TNA-3 gyroscopic navigational device, an EIR echo depth finder with automatic recorder and three sonar transducers, a RShM-2 river-type wide-span mine detector, RVM-2M and IMP-2 <b>portable</b> <b>mine</b> detectors, a PR-1 portable penetrometer used to analyze soil for crossability and an ice drill with ice stake. The vehicle has two arms for detecting metallic mines which are mounted on the front of the hull. They can be retracted when not in use. The mine detector arms can be hydraulically articulated to their operating position in under three minutes. The mine detector brings the vehicle to a full stop upon encountering an obstacle or detecting a metallic object. The PIR-451 periscope is mounted on the right hand side of the front of the vehicle, at the commander's station. It can be extended to 1.5 m and can move vertically up to 750 mm. The IRM also has an air revitalization system, automatic fire extinguishers, a water pump with a capacity of 1,000 l/min, an automatic NBC protection system and an engine thermal smoke generator. It weighs 17.2 tonnes and has a crew of six. It is 8.22 m long, 3.15 m wide and 2.40 m high. Ground clearance is 420 mm. It has a maximum road speed of 52 km/h and it can swim at up to 12 km/h. It is armed with a PKT machine gun fitted in a small turret for which it carries 1,000 rounds. In the west, the IRM was believed to be based on the 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer until 1986 when its true origins became known.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{humanitarian}} demining {{it is essential to}} have a reliable and accurate sensor or an integration of heterogeneous/homogeneous sensors with efficient and reliable data fusion and processing techniques. In addition, it is necessary to overcome the constrain on the resources to speed up the demining process in terms of time, cost, and safety enhancement of personnel and operation. A <b>portable</b> handheld <b>mine</b> detection approach to sensor movement is slow and hazardous for individual deminers. Armored vehicles may not thoroughly protect the occupants and may be of only limited usefulness in off-road operations. Robotized solutions with effective sensing capabilities properly sized with suitable modularized mechanized structure and well adapted to local conditions of minefields can greatly improve the safety of personnel as well as work efficiency and flexibility. Such intelligent and flexible machines can speed the clearance and perform verifying processes when used in combination with handheld mine detection tools. Furthermore, the use of many robots working and coordinating their movement will improve the productivity of the overall mine detection process through the use of team cooperation and coordination. This paper evaluates the available mine clearance technologies and disscusses their development efforts and limitations to automate tasks related to demining process. In addition, it introduces technical features and design capabilities of a mobile platform needed to accelerate the demining process and achieve safety with cost effective measures...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the JAM system, a distributed, scalable and <b>portable</b> agent-based data <b>mining</b> system that employs a general approach to scaling data mining applications that we call meta-learning. JAM provides a set of learning programs, implemented either as JAVA applets or applications, that compute models over data stored locally at a site. JAM also provides a set of meta-learning agents for combining multiple models that were learned (perhaps) at different sites. It employs a special distribution mechanism which allows the migration of the derived models or classifier agents to other remote sites. We describe the overall architecture of the JAM system and the specific implementation currently under development at Columbia University. One of JAM's target applications is fraud and intrusion detection in financial information systems. A brief description of this learning task and JAM's applicability are also described.

40|$|Rock gas outbursts are a {{coal mine}} dynamic {{phenomena}} similar to rock bursts, however, they involve the active participation of {{large quantities of}} asphyxious and explosive gases under pressure. These events {{have occurred in the}} Sydney coal field, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, where they have resulted in injury and economic hardship. Because these phenomena are life threatening and not well understood and because geophysical methods have been identified as a means of studying these phenomena, an intrinsically safe microseismic monitoring system and method suitable for underground coal mines has been developed to gather information about these events. This thesis documents research encompassing the design and development of the intrinsically safe coal <b>mine</b> <b>portable</b> microseismic system (CPMS), and its application to outburst research in coal mine development headings advanced in virgin ground, where the phenomena have occurred. The CPMS has provided an increased understanding of the rock gas outburst phenomena in the Sydney coal field by recording various mining activity related seismicity and by partially recording the first rock gas outburst in an advance development headings driven by machine. Monitoring is continuing in a development heading driven by the drill and blast method in an attempt to capture rock gas outburst precursory information and more rock gas outbursts events which are required to more clearly define the mechanisms involved...|$|R
