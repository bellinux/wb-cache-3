40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} equal-channel angular {{pressing}} (ECAP) on the <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance</b> of Al and Al-Mg alloy was investigated {{by means of}} polarization curves in solutions containing 300 ppm of Cl- and by surface analysis. The potentials for pitting corrosion of Al and Al-Mg alloy were evidently shifted to the noble direction by using the ECAP process, indicating that this process improves resistance to pitting corrosion. This increase in resistance seems to be attributable {{to the increase in}} formation rate of Al oxide films due to the increase in grain boundary with ECAP. The <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance</b> of Al and Al-Mg alloy anodized galvanostatically in H 2 SO 4 solution after ECAP was also investigated using electrochemical techniques. The <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance</b> of Al and Al-Mg alloy was remarkably improved by anodizing.

Carbon steel presents a wide passive anodic region (0. 0 - 0. 9 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE)), while those of chromium steel and HSS, either as-received or heat-treated, are narrower because of transpassive anodic dissolution of Cr above ~ 0. 4 V. This is clearly seen through changes in the impedance spectra. An equivalent circuit is proposed to fit the experimental data, leading to determination of oxide film capacitance and film resistance. The semiconductor properties of the passive films were investigated by Mott-Schottky plots. All steel samples behave like n-type semiconductors, showing that the passive film properties are dominated by iron.

Corrosion resistance investigations were carried out with the use of potentiodynamic method. The test were realized in solution simulating human blood environment (artificial plasma) at the temperature of 37 ± 1 ºC and pH = 7. 2.

This study examines the degradation behaviour and the mechanical integrity of calcium-containing magnesium alloys using electrochemical techniques and slow strain rate test (SSRT) method, respectively, in modified-simulated body fluid (m-SBF). Potentiodynamic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results showed that calcium addition enhances the general and <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistances</b> of magnesium alloys significantly. The corrosion current was significantly lower in AZ 91 Ca alloy than that in AZ 91 alloy. Furthermore, AZ 91 Ca alloy exhibited a five-fold increase in the surface film resistance than AZ 91 alloy.

In a companion article (Part I), the influence of post-weld annealing tem- perature on microstructure evolution and chemical com- position of austenite and ferrite was analyzed; this study can thus be considered directly connected with the previous one. The <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance</b> of the heat-treated welded joints was evaluated by using both electrochemical measurements and ASTM G 48 standard gravimetric tests; examinations of initiation sites of pitting attack were carried out in order to correlate the experimental data obtained in this study with the predicted pitting corrosion behavior obtained by using the results described in Part I.

As a result of the corrosion behavior of a comparatively low cost 444 ferritic stainless steel is compared in this study, with that of 316 austenitic stainless steel in acidic chloride environments where 316 are typically and mostly applied. The <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistances</b> of the two alloys were studied by means of immersion tests and electrochemical techniques including cyclic potentiodynamic polarization, open circuit corrosion potential measurements and chronoamperometry. All the corrosion measurements were carried out at room temperature and at varying concentrations of the electrolytes. The alloys were also characterized prior and after corrosion tests using an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, a Raman spectrometer and a X-ray diffractometer. The alloys displayed similar corrosion behaviour with slight differences in their <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance</b> in all the solutions. The passivity of both alloys remained stable with no passivity breakdown and pitting in the lower concentrations of all the investigated solutions.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{influence and}} corrosion inhibition of N, N'-dimethylaminoethanol on the <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance</b> of {{austenitic stainless steel}} (type 304) in dilute sulphuric acid solution with sodium chloride addition was investigated using potentiodynamic polarization technique. Corrosion potential, pitting potential, passivation potential, nucleation resistance, passivation range and repassivation capacity measurements and potentiodynamic analysis were {{used to evaluate the}} steel’s pitting resistance characteristics. The potentiodynamic experiments revealed that pitting potential increased with increase in concentration of the inhibiting compound coupled with an increase in the passivation range hence increased resistance to pittinggcorrosion...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the electrochemical corrosion tests of Inconel 600 and Inconel 625 laser-welded superalloys. The studies were conducted in order to assess the resistance to general and <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> in 3. 5 % NaCl solution. It was found that Inconel 600 possesses good <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance,</b> however Inconel 625 is characterized by a greater resistance to general and also to <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> of the weld as well as the base metal...|$|R
5000|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steel {{can be tested}} by nondestructive testing using the dye penetrant inspection method but not the magnetic particle inspection method. Eddy-current testing may also be used. It is the primary {{stainless steel}} used in aviation construction. Chemical and steel industry-applicable grades are SAE steel grades 308, 308L, 316, 316L, 316LN (nitrogen bearing), 312, 309L, and 310L. [...] "L" [...] denotes a carbon percentage less than 0.03%, mostly used for <b>corrosion</b> heat <b>resistance</b> and reducing sensitivity to chromium carbide formation. Another grade, 312, is used for dissimilar steel welding, also known as universal alloy steel as unknown composition steels can be welded. For high temperature applications at greater than 600°C, grades 309 and 310 are preferred. Grade 316 is alloyed with molybdenum (~2-3%) for high-temperature strength, <b>pitting</b> and crevice <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|R
40|$|Inconel 718 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} superalloys, and it is mainly used in the aerospace field on account of its high mechanical strength, good resistance to fatigue and creep, good <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance</b> and ability to operate continuously at elevated temperatures. In this work the <b>resistance</b> to <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> of a superalloy, Inconel 718, is analyzed before and after double aging heat treatment. The used heat treatment increases the creep resistance of the alloy, which usually is used up to 0. 6 Tm. Samples were subjected to <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> tests in chloride-containing aqueous solution, according to ASTM-F 746 - 04 and the procedure described by Yashiro et al. The results of these trials show that after heat treatment the superalloy presents higher <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance,</b> i. e., the <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> currents of the as received surfaces are about 6 (six) times bigger (0. 15 mA) than those of double aged surfaces (0. 025 mA) ...|$|R
