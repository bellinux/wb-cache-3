25|$|After Marshall's {{appointment}} in January 1947, administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov {{and others to}} press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets in their occupied zone. Molotov refrained from supplying accounts of Soviet assets. The Soviets took a <b>punitive</b> <b>approach,</b> pressing for a delay rather than an acceleration in economic rehabilitation, demanding unconditional fulfillment of all prior reparation claims, and pressing for progress toward nationwide socioeconomic transformation.|$|E
25|$|Researchers in the United States have {{undertaken}} field evaluations of in-vehicle devices that monitor driver behaviours and fuel consumption. Studies that tested {{the use of}} in-vehicle monitoring in emergency medical services (EMS) reported substantial improvements in driver behaviour through in-vehicle monitoring systems that gave drivers real-time feedback. The researchers reported that the technology demonstrated sustained cost savings in regards to vehicle maintenance and required minimal retraining of drivers. Another study of EMS drivers reported similar results and recommended gradual implementation of in-vehicle monitoring, with attention to defusing potential concerns regarding a <b>punitive</b> <b>approach</b> to corrective action.|$|E

25|$|<b>Punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> to {{drug policy}} are {{severely}} undermining {{human rights in}} every region of the world. They lead to the erosion of civil liberties and fair trial standards, the stigmatization of individuals and groups – particularly women, young people, and ethnic minorities – and the imposition of abusive and inhumane punishments.|$|R
50|$|Restorative {{justice is}} an {{approach}} to justice that personalizes the crime by having the victims and the offenders mediate a restitution agreement {{to the satisfaction of}} each, as well as involving the community. This contrasts to more <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> where the main aim is retributive justice or to satisfy abstract legal principles.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there are}} also notable {{differences}} between the Sedition Act and the MRHA. The first relates to the consequences of violation. Under section 4 of the Sedition Act, an offender is criminally liable. In contrast, under the MRHA, {{the imposition of a}} restraining order does not per se carry criminal liability. It is only when this restraining order has been breached that criminal liability will attach to the offender. This difference reflects the varying approach towards disruption of public order – the <b>punitive</b> <b>approach</b> of the Sedition Act contrasts with the pre-emptive approach of the MRHA. Such an arrangement allows the Government to mount a calibrated response against perpetrators. If the Sedition Act was the only relevant statute in operation, it might result in disproportionately harsh action being taken against minor public order disturbances.|$|E
25|$|The Sedition Act plays {{its part}} by criminalizing the doing of any act or the uttering of any words having a seditious tendency, and {{dealings}} with seditious publications. The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act ("MRHA") is {{another piece of}} this legislative jigsaw. It was introduced to ensure that adherents of different religious groups exercise tolerance and moderation, and to keep religion out of politics. Minister for Home Affairs S. Jayakumar stated that the MRHA takes a pre-emptive approach and can be invoked in a restrained manner to enable prompt and effective action. In contrast with the <b>punitive</b> <b>approach</b> of the Sedition Act where a breach of the statute carries criminal liability, under the MRHA restraining orders may be imposed upon people causing feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different religious groups, among other things. Criminal sanctions only apply if such orders are contravened.|$|E
500|$|Opposition to the Poor Law grew at the {{beginning}} of the 19th century. The 1601 system was felt to be too costly and was considered in academic circles as encouraging the underlying problems. Jeremy Bentham argued for a disciplinary, <b>punitive</b> <b>approach</b> to social problems, whilst the writings of Thomas Malthus focused attention on overpopulation, and the growth of illegitimacy. David Ricardo argued that there was an [...] "iron law of wages". The effect of poor relief, in the view of the reformers, was to undermine the position of the [...] "independent labourer".|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a brief overview}} of the last decade in relation to juvenile justice and Indigenous youth. It argues that while there have been some progressive changes these have been generally outweighed by a lack of thoroughgoing commitments to the fundamental reform envisaged by the Bringing Them Home Report.

30|$|Current {{regulatory}} solutions {{have been}} prosecution based. Laws {{such as the}} graduated response or the three strikes law [18] have tried to hold individuals accountable for their systems security [19]. Simultaneously, regulators have targeted the prosecution of cybercriminals and other <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> such as takedowns. These punitive regulations are limited in their scope [16], can lead to collateral damage [20], and may be {{more expensive than the}} damages due to criminal activity [21].|$|R

5000|$|Professor Blasi is a {{prominent}} {{advocate of the}} [...] "housing first" [...] approach to addressing chronic homelessness.

40|$|While {{there have}} been some {{progressive}} changes in Australia juvenile justice in recent years including developments in youth justice conferencing, more consistent and widely available diversionary options, and a longer term decline in juvenile incarceration rates, these changes have not tended to affect the contact of Indigenous young people with the justice system. The paper analyses why more <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> to law and order (such as a greater reliance on custodial remand) and a greater bifurcation between less serious offenders and repeat offenders is having a particularly negative impact on Indigenous youth. It concludes with a consideration of some of the more promising developments concerning Indigenous young people in youth justice...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effects of the {{environment}} in The Institution for Boys Tamworth during the 1960 s and 1970 s. The particular focus is {{the effects of}} the institutional experiences and disintegrative shaming on the identities and self-control of its adolescent residents, as well as its impact on their adult lives, especially in terms of their propensity for criminal behaviour. By capturing the stories of these former residents, this thesis contributes both empirically and theoretically to the understanding of linkages between adolescent institutionalisation, disintegrative shaming, destabilised self-control and degraded self-identity. Ultimately the results demonstrate the potential criminogenic effects of adopting <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> to juvenile delinquency...|$|R

40|$|Disruptive {{behavior}} {{is a major}} concern for most educational systems. Schools often respond to disruptive students with exclusionary and <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> that have limited effect or value. Moreover, recent neoliberal trends with increased focus on student learning outcome change the attitudes towards disruptive student behavior and also narrow down and homogenize the range of what is considered as “acceptable student behavior”. In this article we discuss the interrelationship between an outcome-based, neoliberal school approach and notions of disruptive behavior. We claim that the outcome-based and neoliberal approach to education basically promotes an un-educational way of thinking about education that also has a huge influence on perceptions of and tolerance towards all kinds of disruptions in schools - whether they come from students, parents, teachers or researchers...|$|R
40|$|Cocaine {{addiction}} {{is a major}} public health problem that is particularly difficult to treat. Without medically proven pharmacological treatments, interventions to change the maladaptive behavior of addicted individuals mainly rely on psychosocial approaches. Here we report on impairments in cocaine-addicted patients to act purposefully toward a given goal and {{on the influence of}} extended training on their behavior. When patients were rewarded for their behavior, prolonged training improved their response rate toward the goal but simultaneously rendered them insensitive to the consequences of their actions. By contrast, overtraining of avoidance behavior had no effect on patient performance. Our findings illustrate the ineffectiveness of <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> and highlight the potential for interventions that focus on improving goal-directed behavior and implementing more desirable habits to replace habitual drug-taking...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally the {{treatment}} of opioid dependence in Singapore has not been viewed {{as a public health}} problem, but rather as a social problem that necessitated custodial and other <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches.</b> The turning point came in 1996, when, after a pilot programme in the Prisons Department, naltrexone was introduced as an option in management of heroin dependence. 1 However, because of long-standing attitudes and perceptions held by both the public and the medical profession, ambivalence persisted towards the addict as a patient. Recent advances in neuroscience have increased our understanding of substance-use disorders, and the new insights have important implications for clinical practice.

40|$|There is {{now some}} {{evidence}} of a potential drift towards 'punitive' approaches to regulation in which greater {{emphasis is placed on}} criminal sanctions. This new enthusiasm for punishment can be seen in government policy, legislation and some regulators' public stances. There is evidence, however, that companies (even top ones) deal with punitive regulatory risks in a confused manner and that even when they do act rationally, this may not lead to compliance. One response to <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> and their limitations is to move towards greater reliance on stimulating the self-regulatory capacities of corporations. Such stimulation, however, has to be carried out with an awareness of the dangers of self-regulation – notably that it may lead to controls that lack legitimacy, prove unfair and are exclusive and inefficient...|$|R

As an apparent outlier to both the human rights and <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches,</b> or perhaps as a hybrid of sorts, the relative impact of the two models can be elucidated. The article also provides an example of how small penal systems can be resistant to broader trends and the value of directing the criminological gaze upon countries where it seldom falls...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare {{public health}} and legal {{policies}} to reduce the harm associated with cannabis use in Canada and Australia, given similarities between both countries. Method: A review of the epidemiological and health policy literature. Results: Although both countries have adopted harm minimization, a continued heavy reliance on legislative and <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> in both Canada and Australia has failed to arrest the increase in cannabis use, especially among young people. A Senate inquiry in Canada has recommended the liberalization of laws on the possession and use of cannabis, while tightening legislation against operating vehicles or machinery while intoxicated. Conclusions: Existing policies are not evidence-based and lead to adverse outcomes such as criminalization of otherwise law-abiding citizens and diversion of resources from more effective policing or health service initiatives.

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} sexual violence against students {{and the concept of}} ‘lad culture’, which has been used to frame this phenomenon in the UK and has connections to similar debates around masculinities in other countries. This issue is much-researched and debated but under-theorised, and {{due to a lack of}} intersectionality, radical feminist frameworks around violence against women are useful but incomplete. The chapter sketches a more nuanced approach to the understanding of campus sexual violence and the masculine cultures which frame it, which also engages with the intersecting structures of patriarchy and neoliberalism. It argues that framing these issues structurally and institutionally is necessary, in order to avoid individualistic and <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> to tackling them which may seem feminist but are embedded in neoliberal rationalities...|$|R

40|$|Local {{television}} {{news is the}} public’s primary source of public affairs information. News stories about crime dominate local news programming because they maintain high audience demand. The prevalence {{of this type of}} reporting has led to a crime narrative or “script” that includes two core elements: crime is violent and perpetrators of crime are non-white males. We show that this script has become an ingrained heuristic for understanding crime and race. Using a multi-method design, we assess the impact of the crime script on the viewing public. Our central findings are that exposure to the racial element of the crime script increases support for <b>punitive</b> <b>approaches</b> to crime and heightens negative attitudes about African-Americans among white, but not black, viewers. In closing, we consider the implications of our results for intergroup relations, electoral politics, and the practice of journalism...|$|R
