The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify risk factors related to a low ABI in the elderly using two different methods of ABI calculation (traditional and modified definition using lower instead of higher ankle pressure). A cross-sectional study was carried out with 65 hypertensive patients aged 65 years or older. PAD was present in 18 % of individuals by current ABI definition and in 32 % by modified method. Diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, higher levels of systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, elevated risk by Framingham Risk Score (FRS), and a higher number of total and antihypertensive drugs in use were associated with low ABI by both definitions. Smoking and LDL-cholesterol were associated with low ABI only by the modified definition. Low ABI by the modified definition detected 9 new cases of PAD but cardiovascular risk had not been considered high in 3 patients when calculated by FRS. In conclusion, given that a simple modification of ABI calculation would be able to identify more patients at high risk, it should be considered for cardiovascular risk prediction in all elderly hypertensive outpatients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Peripheral {{artery disease}} (PAD) is a {{condition}} characterized by restricted {{blood flow to the}} extremities, and is especially common in the elderly. <b>PAD</b> <b>increases</b> the risk for mortality and morbidity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), especially those on hemodialysis (HD). Methods The records of 484 patients with end-stage renal disease who were on HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD) were reviewed. PAD was diagnosed based on the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI). Demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Results PAD had an overall prevalence of 18. 2 % and was significantly more common in HD patients (21. 8 %) than in PD patients (4. 8 %). Advanced age, diabetes mellitus, smoking, low parathyroid hormone level, elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum glucose, and low serum creatinine levels increased the risk for PAD. PAD was independently associated with advanced age, diabetes mellitus, duration of dialysis, low serum creatinine, and hyperlipidemia. PD patients had a significantly lower prevalence of PAD than HD patients, maybe due to their younger age and lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus in this present study. Conclusions The prevalence of PAD was greater in the HD group than the PD group. Most of the risk factors for PAD were specific to HD, and no analyzed factor was significantly associated with PAD in PD patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: In a sham-controlled {{double-blind}} trial, we aim {{to establish}} the efficacy and safety of the local application of laser therapy in patients with diabetes, onychomycosis and risk factors for diabetes-related foot complications. Onychomycosis leads to thickened and distorted nails, which in turn lead to increased local pressure. The combination of onychomycosis and neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease (<b>PAD)</b> <b>increases</b> {{the risk of developing}} diabetes-related foot complications. Usual care for high-risk patients with diabetes and onychomycosis is completely symptomatic with frequent shaving and clipping of the nails. No effective curative local therapies exist, and systemic agents are often withheld due to concerns for side effects and interactions. Methods/Design: The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of four sessions of Nd:YAG 1064 nM laser application on the one-year clinical and microbiological cure rate in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled design with blinded outcome assessment. Mandatory inclusion criteria are diagnosis of diabetes, risk factors for developing foot ulcers defined as a modified Simm's classification score 1 or 2 and either neuropathy or PAD. A total of 64 patients are randomized to intervention or sham treatment performed by a podiatrist. Discussion: This study will be the first double-blind study that investigates the effects of local laser therapy on onychomycosis, specifically performed in patients with diabetes with additional risk factors for foot complications...|$|E

A multi-center cross-sectional observational study was conducted in four care providing agencies for people with ID in the Netherlands. We included 407 participants with mild to profound ID aged 40 - 59 years, receiving medical care from specialized ID physicians. The ankle-brachial index was used to diagnose PAD. The overall prevalence of PAD was 8. 4 % (95 % CI = 6. 0 - 11. 4 %), with no significant differences between age groups 40 - 49 years (8. 2 %) and 50 - 59 years (8. 5 %). None of the participants had been diagnosed with PAD prior to this study and only one participant with PAD had PAD-related symptoms (1 / 34).

40|$|Under-sleeper pads (USPs), {{typically}} {{made from}} polyurethane, {{are used by}} railways {{in certain parts of}} the world to reduce ballast settlement and consequently lengthen the ballast tamping cycle. The rationale behind this relatively new addition to the conventional ballasted track structure is that the <b>pad</b> <b>increases</b> the contact area between the angular ballast particles and the underside of the concrete sleeper, with the effect that ballast breakdown and total track settlement are reduced. This paper describes two experiments on the effects of USPs on four aspects of sleeper–ballast interaction, namely contact area, contact pressure, ballast settlement and ballast breakdown. Static and dynamic tests up to 1 million loading cycles were performed under controlled laboratory conditions on concrete sleepers with and without USPs. Sophisticated pressure sensors revealed an increase in contact area from 12 % to 35 % for static loading tests, and from 8 % to 20 % for dynamic tests, with a resulting 70 % reduction in contact pressure. In addition, a 44 % reduction in ballast settlement and a 23 % reduction in ballast breakdown were achieved by the introduction of USPs. In conclusion it is argued that the introduction of USPs specifically on heavy-haul lines would offer significant advantages with respect to ballast settlement and breakdown. These advantages are most likely to lengthen general ballast tamping and screening cycles, resulting in significant life cycle cost savings.

Thus, the combination of log-m embedding with padded convolutional layers allows networks using popular deep CNN architectures, such as AlexNet, to be trained with higher classification accuracy {{in less time than}} 1 -of-m embedding. Additionally, these results should apply to more recent networks architectures, such as the inception model [27], as the use of padding enables arbitrarily deep networks to be constructed from any input layer size.|$|R
