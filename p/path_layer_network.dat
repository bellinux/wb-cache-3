3000|$|The {{simulation}} {{was implemented}} under the network simulator NS 2 2.29, which can simulate a <b>layered</b> <b>network</b> protocol stack and wireless channel [17]. The simulation scenario is {{conducted in a}} 7 -nodes chain topology of multi-hop ad hoc networks, as shown in Fig. 3. The distance between neighboring nodes is 200 m, which allows a node to connect only to its neighboring nodes. The same distance between neighboring nodes ensures that the nodes act equally in the simulation. The number of employed bees and onlooker bees were set to 10. The MNI was set to 2000. The IEEE 802.11 DCF is used as the medium-access control protocol. All nodes communicate with identical, half duplex, and wireless radios that have a bandwidth of 1 Mbps, an effective transmission radius of 250  m and the interfering range of 500  m. Each node has a queue called interface queue (IFQ) for packets waiting to be transmitted by the network interface, which holds up to 10 packets and is managed in a drop tail fashion. The two-ray ground reflection model is used for propagation. AODV routing protocol is adopted to find routing <b>path</b> in <b>network</b> <b>layer.</b> In this paper, constant bit rate (CBR) traffic is used to simulate the UDP performance. Every CBR packet size is 1200 bytes, and the packet sending rate is varied in each run to change the offered traffic load (0.01, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 Mbps) in the network.

40|$|In <b>layered</b> <b>networks,</b> {{a single}} failure {{at the lower}} (physical) layer may cause {{multiple}} failures at the upper (logical) layer. As a result, traditional schemes that protect against single failures may not be effective in <b>layered</b> <b>networks.</b> This thesis studies the problem of maximizing network survivability in the layered setting, {{with a focus on}} optimizing the embedding of the logical network onto the physical network. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we start with an investigation of the fundamental properties of <b>layered</b> <b>networks,</b> and show that basic network connectivity structures, such as cuts, paths and spanning trees, exhibit fundamentally different characteristics from their single-layer counterparts. This leads to our development of a new crosslayer survivability metric that properly quantifies the resilience of the <b>layered</b> <b>network</b> against physical failures. Using this new metric, we design algorithms to embed the logical network onto the physical network based on multi-commodity flows, to maximize the cross-layer survivability. In the second part of the thesis, we extend our model to a random failure setting and study the cross-layer reliability of the networks, defined to be the probability that the upper <b>layer</b> <b>network</b> stays connected under the random failure events. We generalize the classical polynomial expression for network reliability to the layered setting. Using Monte-Carlo techniques, we develop efficient algorithms to compute an approximate polynomial expression for reliability, as a function of the link failure probability. The construction of the polynomial eliminates the need to resample when the cross-layer reliability under different link failure probabilities is assessed. Furthermore, the polynomial expression provides important insight into the connection between the link failure probability, the cross-layer reliability and the structure of a <b>layered</b> <b>network.</b> We show that in general the optimal embedding depends on the link failure probability, and characterize the properties of embeddings that maximize the reliability under different failure probability regimes. Based on these results, we propose new iterative approaches to improve the reliability of the <b>layered</b> <b>networks.</b> We demonstrate via extensive simulations that these new approaches result in embeddings with significantly higher reliability than existing algorithms. by Kayi Lee.
