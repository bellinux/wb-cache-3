5000|$|The Egg was {{crafted by}} Albert Holmström (1876-1925) [...] under the {{supervision}} of Peter Carl Fabergé and is made of yellow gold, platinum, brilliant diamonds, rose-cut diamonds, ruby, emerald, topaz, sapphire, garnet, half-pearls, moonstone, white enamel and opaque pink enamel. It consists of a series of yellow gold belts which are pavé-set with diamonds and a variety of gems in a floral pattern, providing a look of petit <b>point</b> <b>tapestry</b> work.|$|E
2500|$|The famous late Gothic {{series of}} seven {{tapestry}} hangings The Hunt of the Unicorn are a high <b>point</b> in European <b>tapestry</b> manufacture, combining both {{secular and religious}} themes. The tapestries now hang in the Cloisters division of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In the series, richly dressed noblemen, accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against mille-fleur backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay {{with the help of}} a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, [...] "The Unicorn in Captivity", the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a pomegranate tree surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the Low Countries, probably Brussels or Liège, for an unknown patron. A set of six engravings on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist Jean Duvet in the 1540s.|$|R
