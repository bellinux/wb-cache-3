40|$|A {{combined}} {{thermal power}} and cooling cycle using {{the combination of}} a Rankine Cycle and the Goswami Cycle has been analyzed in this study to assess its performance. It can provide power output as well as refrigeration with power generation as a primary goal. The Goswami Cycle uses very high concentration ammonia vapor in the turbine which can be expanded to a very low temperature in the turbine without condensation. This cycle uses an absorption condensation process instead of the conventional condensation process. In this study combined thermal power and cooling cycle (Goswami & Rankine Cycle combined) is first optimized for maximum thermal efficiency and then it is compared with conventional system. The combined cycle is also analyzed for different fraction of steam extracted from a pass out turbine of the topping cycle (Rankine Cycle) as heating source to the bottoming cycle (Goswami Cycle). The proposed heating sources are the waste heat at the exit of back pressure turbine and extracted steam from <b>pass-out</b> <b>turbine.</b> The main parameters that can be varied to influence the cycle are the heat source temperature, boiler pressure, basic solution ammonia mass fraction, ratio of working and heating fluid flow rates, and absorber pressure and temperature. However, the study focuses on the impact of change in the ratio of working and heating fluid flow rates. The combined power and cooling cycle is optimized for the maximum thermal efficiency...|$|E
40|$|A linear {{programming}} model is described {{which is designed}} to assist in the assessment of optimum operational strategies for industrial plants with cogeneration facilities. A concise format is provided for linking together basic elements such as boilers, valves, turbines and processes with steam and electricity demands with steam, fuel and electricity balance equations. The model should prove particularly useful for assessment when electricity tariffs have time-of-use energy or demand charges or when tariffs have conditions which require consideration of strategies over an extended period. The model has been applied to a paper mill which utilises <b>pass-out</b> <b>turbines</b> for cogeneration of electricity and process steam. Results indicate that savings in fuel costs of the order of 400, 000 dollars per year could be obtained by implementing optimal strategies for operating the present turbines. Savings of the order of one million dollars per year could be obtained by converting the turbines to give high pressure pass-out steam and then operating optimally. ...|$|R
40|$|Present EU trends {{strive to}} {{maximize}} the resources recovery from municipal solid waste thus minimizing the waste amount to be disposed off. Refuse-derived fuel (RDF) production is considered in some countries to be a priority solution even if current market scenarios and consumers scepticism at present limit its widespread utilization. In this work, a comparison {{has been carried out}} of two possible RDF utilization alternatives, with particular reference to territorial districts with low population density. After a brief introduction, in which current RDF combustion technologies are illustrated, two possible plant configurations are considered, one concerning only electric power production; the other one combined heat and power production (CHP), using heat for district heating purposes, resorting to two different architectures: single <b>pass-out</b> condensing <b>turbine</b> and back-pressure turbine. Possible application of these technologies to a case study is then proposed, referring to a central Italy mountain territory characterized by a low population density. Then, an economic evaluation has been carried out. Finally, a parametric study was performed in order to define acceptable values for the sale price of thermal energy and the effect on profitability of the incremental investment needed {{for the construction of a}} district heating network...|$|R
