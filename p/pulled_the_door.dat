25|$|The act {{of pushing}} or <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{triggers}} <b>the</b> {{open and close}} cycle. These are also known as power-assisted doors.|$|R
6000|$|The boy gathers up {{his change}} and has <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open by a leather strap nailed {{to it for}} the purpose, when Venus cries out: ...|$|E
60|$|His {{hunt was}} successful, {{and soon they}} had the tin in the crack under the bar. The latter gave way with ease, and then they <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open. Beyond was the {{passageway}} leading to the cabin.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Oliver Wadsworth {{was in front}} of one of the {{shattered}} safes. An inner door, somewhat bent, was swung shut. With trembling fingers the manufacturer <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open and felt into the compartment beyond.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{signed to}} her to leave the room. She went out, <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to, but not closing it behind her.|$|R
5000|$|Surface mount, <b>pull</b> (track) - <b>the</b> {{operator}} {{is mounted}} {{on the wall above}} <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> on <b>the</b> swing side and <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with an arm whose end slides in a track mounted on <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's gratitude,' said Mr. Ferrars, as 'Boy' {{slid off}} his mamma's knee, stood on tiptoe to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open, and ran after Gilbert to grandmamma's room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why once," [...] said Beechnut, [...] "I knew {{a boy who}} put {{his nose}} into {{the crack of the}} door, and then took hold of the latch and <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to, and pinched his nose to death. That was a little more foolish, though not much." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was another}} {{carriage}} that stopped the way now, {{and once more}} the barker made the night ring with what Westover felt his heartless and shameless cries for Miss Lynde's carriage. After a maddening delay, it lagged {{up to the curb}} and Jeff <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open.|$|E
6000|$|He struck Sterne's arm {{away with}} a smart blow, and {{catching}} hold of the handle <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to. The terrific slam darkened the cabin instantaneously to his eye as if after the flash of an explosion. At once he dropped into the chair. [...] "Oh, no! You don't!" [...] he whispered faintly.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll like to {{hear your}} opinion of it," [...] Dan began; but his sister <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> open, and ran out {{to see if he}} really meant that too.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> rear <b>doors</b> were a {{different}} matter. The grenadier had to lean {{out of the}} vehicle to use his thumb to depress <b>the</b> <b>door</b> hold open latch while <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed. These two doors were much lighter than <b>the</b> side <b>doors.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{set down}} the tray with a rattle and tried to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open. But <b>the</b> top bolt had become displaced, and it was several seconds {{before it could be}} shot back.|$|R
60|$|She shrugged her {{shoulders}} and followed him. Something in the man's earnest tone and almost pleading look convinced her, at least, of his good intentions. Besides, the interest which her question had undoubtedly aroused amongst the bystanders was, {{to say the least}} of it, embarrassing. He <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to after them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!" [...] said he. [...] "Lights in a {{house is}} a thing I dinna agree with. I'm unco feared of fires. Good-night to ye, Davie my man." [...] And before I had time to add a further protest, he <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to, and I heard him lock me in from the outside.|$|E
6000|$|It {{broke off}} with {{significant}} suddenness, and the agent {{turned to the}} man who had first spoken. [...] "You are going to be sorry for this, Mr. Grant," [...] he said and then tried to slip away, but one of the others <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to and stood with his back to it while Grant, smiling, said, [...] "I'm quite willing to take my chances. Have the stock-cars passed Perry's siding?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Office Door : A typical {{use case}} occurs upon departing the office: the user pushes {{a button on}} the inside handle, locking <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> then <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> shut behind. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> must now be opened with a key. The F82(F04) {{function}} works for this case.|$|R
60|$|He bowed, therefore, for {{the third}} time, and with another of his foolish grins he shuffled out of <b>the</b> chamber, <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> after him, so that Marius should not see how near at hand he stayed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How stupid of me; it is {{the head}} of a screw.' Whatever mysterious {{contrivance}} had originally existed for opening the puny cupboard of the cabinet, it had at some time been broken, and this rough substitute provided. Stimulated curiosity would not allow her to recede now. She fetched a screwdriver, withdrew the screw, <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open with a penknife, and found inside a cavity about ten inches square. The cavity contained-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Upon hearing {{these words}} the dwarf skipped quickly out, and the Dryad entered {{the tree and}} <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> shut after her. [...] "Now, then," [...] she said to herself, [...] "he can break off the key if he likes. It does not matter to me. Another will grow out next spring. And {{although}} the good piper made me no promise, I know that when the warm days arrive next year he will come and let me out again." ...|$|E
60|$|Some people can't take a 'int, and, as the cabman wouldn't be'ave 'imself, Sam {{walked into}} a shed that was handy and <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to, and he stayed there until he 'eard 'im {{go back to the}} stable for 'is rug. It was only a yard or two from the shed to the cab, and, 'ardly {{thinking}} wot he was doing, Sam nipped out and got into it and sat huddled up on the floor.|$|E

5000|$|Exit {{doors opened}} inward, into the auditorium. The crowd pressed against <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> keeping them closed. When people {{were able to}} <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> open enough to get out, some people were then wedged in <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opening as people {{continued}} to push on <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Today, exit doors open outward, so that people trying to escape will tend to hold <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> open.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mark of a}} good passive entry {{system is}} that the user never hits the [...] "wall". This happens when <b>the</b> user <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> handle to its full extent before <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is unlocked. <b>The</b> handle has to be {{released}} and pulled again to gain access. Good systems have an override feature that allows <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> to be opened more quickly.|$|R
60|$|Remorse--that most awful of {{the ministers}} of vengeance--had begun to torment Abel Bones. When he saved Tottie from the fire, Aspel had himself unwittingly {{unlocked}} {{the door in the}} burglar's soul which let the vengeful minister in. Thereafter Miss Stivergill's illustration of mercy, for the sake of another, had set the unlocked door ajar, and the discovery that his ill-treated little nephew had nearly lost his life in the same cause, had <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> well back on its rusty hinges.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is hardly}} the place--we'll go to the study, if you don't mind." [...] And they both passed him through the curtain opening. In the little room to which he {{followed}} them, Irene stood by the open window, and the 'fellow' close to her by a big chair. Soames <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to behind him with a slam; the sound carried him back all those {{years to the day}} when he had shut out Jolyon--shut him out for meddling with his affairs.|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{changed the}} subject {{somewhat}} abruptly, {{and it was an}} hour later when he shook hands with his comrade and went out into the bitter night with two blankets strapped upon his shoulders. Their parting was not demonstrative, though they realized that the grim spectre with the scythe would stalk close behind each of them until they met again, and Brooke, turning on the threshold, saw Allonby following him with comprehending eyes. Then he suddenly <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to, shutting out the lamplight and the alluring red glow of the stove, and swung forward, knee-deep in dusty snow, into the gloom of the pines. The silence of the great white land was overwhelming, and the frost struck through him.|$|E
60|$|But {{this time}} an {{unforeseen}} interruption prevented the manoeuvre being the success {{it had been}} before. I had turned the handle {{and was about to}} <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open, while Ukridge, looking like some modern and dilapidated version of the Discobolus, stood beside me with his jug poised, when a voice spoke from the window.|$|R
50|$|Claire {{refuses to}} let him in, and he drops the earring on her front porch and {{apparently}} leaves. Claire spends several agonizing moments crouched in the doorway retrieving the earring, but upon successfully recapturing it and <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed, finds her back door has swung open. Duke has entered the house from the rear and proceeds to brutally murder Claire.|$|R
60|$|Sikes made no reply; but, <b>pulling</b> open <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{of which}} Fagin {{had turned the}} lock, dashed into the silent streets.|$|R
