40|$|In industry, and {{particularly}} in the building construction and automotive industries, lap-joint technology for <b>precoated</b> <b>steel</b> sheet assembly has undergone rapid development. However, the durability problems associated with joints of this type are well known, i. e., premature deterioration of protective coatings (metallic, organic) and accelerated metallic corrosion of the base steel by moisture retention in the joint, crevice corrosion, etc. The authors have been involved in researching lap-joint corrosion testing to know the behaviour of materials in these joints. The <b>precoated</b> <b>steel</b> sheet materials studied were divided into two groups according to their use in two well-defined industrial sectors: building (55 % Al-Zn and hot-dip galvanised, painted and unpainted) and car manufacturing (electrogalvanised and galvanneal).

40|$|The {{adoption}} of designs involving {{the use of}} lap joints is becoming increasingly common in the building industry. However, <b>precoated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets assembled by lap joints are prone to suffer durability problems associated {{with this type of}} joint, such as the premature deterioration of protective coatings (metallic, organic) and accelerated metallic corrosion of the base steel by moisture retention in the lap. The literature reveals a lack of knowledge about the corrosion mechanisms and primary factors involved in this issue. The main objective of this work is to study lap-joint corrosion in relation with two zinc-based coatings used in the building industry: 55 %Al-Zn and hot-dip galvanised (HDG), unpainted and painted, and before and after atmospheric exposure or accelerated ageing (salt fog and Prohesion tests). The proposed corrosion mechanisms are based on results obtained by visual observation and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) associated with X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Complementary X-ray diffraction (XRD) has also been used. With the unpainted <b>precoated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets, localised attack of the metallic coating is observed in the lapped area. In the case of the metallic+organic coatings, attack is initiated in the lapped area and advances towards the non-lapped area. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Microabrasion with PREMA Compound (Premier Dental Product Co., King of Prussia, Penn.) {{has been}} {{advocated}} {{for the removal}} of superficial enamel stains. This procedure eliminates stains by removing a microscopic layer of enamel. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the use of PREMA microabrasion prior to orthodontic bonding affects the tensile bond strength of an adhesive <b>precoated</b> stainless <b>steel</b> orthodontic bracket. Sixty noncarious extracted human premolar teeth were randomly divided into three groups of 20 and stored in 3 -percent buffered formalin solution. Group I was a control group that was etched and bonded in the usual manner. Group II received PREMA Compound microabrasion immediately prior to bonding. Group III received PREMA microabrasion followed by a six-week storage period prior to bonding. After bonding, specimens were thermocycled and stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 14 days. The specimens were then loaded to failure in the tensile mode of an Instron testing machine (Instron Corp., Canton, Mass.). A stress-breaking apparatus was utilized to minimize all forces other than tensile. The data was statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance at the 0. 05 level. No statistically significant differences were found among the three groups. From these results it was concluded that microabrasion with PREMA did not affect bond strength. Enamel microabrasion can be provided prior to orthodontic treatment without any detriment to bracket bond strength...|$|R
