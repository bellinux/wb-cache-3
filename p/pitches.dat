5|$|On {{water-based}} <b>pitches,</b> shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce {{friction and}} increase {{the speed at which}} the game can be played. However, these <b>pitches</b> require watering before, during and after the game and maintenance costs are significant. Sand-dressed <b>pitches</b> cost more than sand-filled <b>pitches</b> but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface. However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption, surface rebound, friction, and strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation. Recently, longer-pile third-generation or 3G <b>pitches</b> have become popular, especially for football, but these do not usually meet the FIH's test criteria; they are often too inconsistent and slow.|$|E

40|$|Native {{speakers}} {{recognize a}} second language accent mainly by prosodic features. <b>Pitch,</b> <b>pitch</b> range, and <b>pitch</b> variability are language-specific {{and have to be}} acquired in L 2 acquisition (usually without explicit teaching). Until now, results remain inconclusive as to whether L 2 speakers are able to acquire a <b>pitch</b> range that is wider than their native <b>pitch</b> range. The present paper investigates the acquisition of mean <b>pitch,</b> <b>pitch</b> range, and <b>pitch</b> variability in Mandarin Chinese by native speakers of Danish. This is particularly interesting since Chinese uses a relatively wide <b>pitch</b> range whereas Danish has an extremely small <b>pitch</b> range. We show that Danish students can largely acquire the mean <b>pitch</b> and <b>pitch</b> range of Mandarin Chinese. However, the <b>pitch</b> variability of Danish-accented Chinese turned out to be considerably lower than native Chinese, which we tentatively attribute to a poor acquisition of tone...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pitch</b> filters play an {{important}} role in high quality medium and low rate speech coders. We propose a pseudo-three-tap <b>pitch</b> filter with one or two degrees of freedom of the pre-diction coefficients, which gives a higher <b>pitch</b> prediction gain and also a more desirable frequency response than a one-tap <b>pitch</b> prediction filter. First, we describe an anal-ysis model for the pseudothree-tap <b>pitch</b> filter. Then, we apply the pseudo-three-tap concept together with a frac-tional <b>pitch</b> lag. The <b>pitch</b> prediction gain and frequency response of the pseudothree-tap <b>pitch</b> filters are compared to a one-tap and three-tap <b>pitch</b> predictors with an integer or a non-integer <b>pitch</b> lag. The pseudo-three-tap <b>pitch</b> fil-ter with one degree of freedom outperforms a conventional one-tap <b>pitch</b> filter. Even better is a pseudo-three-tap filter which switches between two parameter values. 1...|$|R

50|$|<b>Pitch</b> accents can {{be divided}} into nuclear and prenuclear <b>pitch</b> accents. The nuclear <b>pitch</b> accent is defined as the head of a {{prosodic}} phrase.

5|$|Historically, {{the game}} was {{developed}} on natural grass turf. However, in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial <b>pitches</b> mandatory at all major competitions. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{was the first of}} these; however at this time few players had seen or played on synthetic <b>pitches.</b> Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. However, due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes's most {{successful}} seasons {{in terms of}} wickets were the three seasons from 1900 to 1902. In these years, Rhodes took 725 wickets {{at an average of}} 14.07, taking five or more wickets in an innings 68 times and taking ten or more wickets in a match 21 times, assisting Yorkshire to three consecutive County Championships. In 1900, Rhodes took 261 wickets as bad weather made <b>pitches</b> helpful to his bowling. In 1901, the weather was much better, leading to <b>pitches</b> that were good for batting, but Rhodes took 251 wickets, an achievement described by Wisden as astonishing. Against MCC that year, Rhodes scored his maiden first-class century, batting at number nine. In the 1902 season, Rhodes took 213 wickets, fewer than 1901 despite a greater number of favourable <b>pitches</b> in a wet summer. This attracted unfavourable comment from some critics who had expected more.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pitch</b> {{quantification}} is {{the attempt}} to describe {{the quality of a}} <b>pitch</b> using a single numeric value based on quantifiable aspects of an individual baseball <b>pitch.</b> There are two main kinds of <b>pitch</b> quantification. The first is outcome oriented. This means that the result of a given <b>pitch</b> (i.e., walk, out, home run, etc.) is a component used to calculate the overall numeric value that describes the quality of the <b>pitch.</b> The other kind of <b>pitch</b> quantification does not consider the outcome of a <b>pitch</b> when calculating quality. Rather, it is batter independent. Its quality can be assessed without regard to what the batter does with the <b>pitch.</b>|$|R
25|$|Normal {{conversation}} is usually at middle or high pitch; low <b>pitch</b> {{occurs at the}} end of utterances other than yes–no questions, while high <b>pitch</b> occurs {{at the end of}} yes–no questions. Very high <b>pitch</b> is for strong emotion or emphasis. <b>Pitch</b> can indicate attitude: for example, Great uttered in isolation can indicate weak emotion (with <b>pitch</b> starting medium and dropping to low), enthusiasm (with <b>pitch</b> starting very high and ending low), or sarcasm (with <b>pitch</b> starting and remaining low).|$|R
50|$|A <b>pitch</b> shifter is a {{sound effects}} unit that raises or lowers the <b>pitch</b> of an audio signal by a preset interval. For example, a <b>pitch</b> shifter set to {{increase}} the <b>pitch</b> by a fourth will raise each note three diatonic intervals above the notes actually played. Simple <b>pitch</b> shifters raise or lower the <b>pitch</b> by one or two octaves, while more sophisticated devices offer a range of interval alterations. <b>Pitch</b> shifters are included in most audio processors today.|$|R
