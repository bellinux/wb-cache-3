2500|$|Bortkiewicz's {{analysis}} nevertheless {{raised the}} very important {{question of what}} the point of Marx's value theory is. Is there is any real difference between Marx's [...] "values" [...] and theoretical prices? If {{there is no real}} difference, neo-Ricardians argued, then Marx's value theory is redundant; one could then just as well make all the same sorts of arguments in <b>price</b> <b>terms.</b> The advantage seemed to be, that there exists no [...] "transformation problem" [...] of converting values into prices through a quantitative adjustment anymore, and that value theory could be replaced with equilibrium theory to explain prices, since [...] "value" [...] then simply stood for [...] "equilibrium prices" [...] (such as the Smithian or Ricardian [...] "natural prices"). One could then create a system of equilibrium prices for the critical variables involved in production, to explain price relationships. However, then Marx's theory of the formation of a general rate of profit, and his theory of the TRPF, would no longer be valid.|$|E

5000|$|This system was, paradoxically, {{strongly}} influenced by Marx's critique of wealth creation in capitalist society, and his distinction between capitalistically productive and unproductive labour. The [...] "material product" [...] represented, in <b>price</b> <b>terms,</b> the net new value created annually by the production of tangible material goods.

Unless the minimum requirements are met, an offer of sale is not classified by the courts as a legal offer but is instead seen as an advertisement.|$|E
50|$|The {{impact of}} the Exoduster {{migration}} on subsequent white treatment of African Americans was mixed. On the one hand, the exodus did little to alleviate the national propensity for violence towards blacks. From the 1880s through the 1930s, the lynching of African Americans increased, and some 3,000 lynchings took place during that period nationwide. On the other hand, the Exoduster migration {{seems to have had}} some impact on labor relations between southern black farm workers and their white employers. Temporary benefits accorded to counties with the highest black labor scarcity included better <b>price</b> <b>terms</b> in leasing contracts and shrinking long-term contract commitments.|$|E
50|$|Using this {{equation}} Okishio proved Marx’s fundamental {{proposition that the}} exploitation of surplus labor is the necessary condition {{for the existence of}} positive profit, later called as Fundamental Marxian Theorem by Michio Morishima. This proof has some characteristics. First, it does not preclude the acceptance of value theory in advance. Starting from the existence of profit expressed in <b>price</b> <b>terms,</b> we can deduct the existence of surplus value as a logical consequence. This is the opposite way to Marx, who started from value and reached price and profit. Okishio’s proof has effects to persuade the validity of Marxian propositions to much more non-Marxian economists at present.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ecological}} critique {{focuses on}} mindless [...] "production for production's sake", attacking both the neoclassical notion and the Marxist concept of [...] "productiveness". It is argued neoclassical economics {{can understand the}} value of anything (and therefore {{the costs and benefits of}} an activity) only if it has a price, real or imputed. However, physical and human resources may have a value which cannot be expressed in <b>price</b> <b>terms,</b> and to turn them into an object of trade via some legal specification of property rights may be harmful to human life on earth. Activities may have non-priced costs and benefits which never feature on the balance sheet, at most in propaganda and advertising.|$|E

In spite of lengthy development, they were never able to manufacture a cost-competitive indexing tube, and eventually abandoned the concept. The major problem was the cost of the indexing electronics, which was addressed through the introduction of the transistor and integrated circuits. The system was re-introduced as the Uniray in the 1970s, now highly competitive in <b>price</b> <b>terms,</b> but competing against greatly improved shadow mask designs and the new Trinitron. Several Japanese companies used the Uniray for a variety of specialist purposes, the best-known being the Sony Indextron series. The system also saw some military use, due to its low sensitivity to magnetic interference.|$|E

50|$|Delage did {{not have}} the dealer/service network across France {{necessary}} for a volume automaker, and {{it is unlikely that the}} production processes for the D4 were as cost-effective as those for its competitors in the now hotly contested 8CV class. In <b>price</b> <b>terms</b> the Delage found itself undercut by Peugeot, Citroen and Renault. It's larger cylinder diameter and the overhead valves for which that gave space gives credibility to the higher listed power output figure which implied a performance advantage, but even allowing for the somewhat approximate nature of manufacturers' performance data at this time, the D4 appears to have been only marginally faster than the 8CV models from the volume manufacturers: the Delage D4 was marginally heavier than the volume manufacturer's rival products, presumably reflecting more conservative production processes.|$|E
5000|$|Bubble memory {{started out}} as a {{promising}} technology in the 1980s, offering memory density of a similar order to hard drives but performance more comparable to core memory while lacking any moving parts. This led many to consider it a contender for a [...] "universal memory" [...] {{that could be used for}} all storage needs. The introduction of dramatically faster semiconductor memory chips pushed bubble into the slow end of the scale, and equally dramatic improvements in hard drive capacity made it uncompetitive in <b>price</b> <b>terms.</b> Bubble memory was used for some time in the 1970s and 80s where its non-moving nature was desirable for maintenance or shock-proofing reasons. The introduction of Flash RAM and similar technologies rendered even this niche uncompetitive, and bubble disappeared entirely by the late 1980s.|$|E
