25|$|There is {{potential}} of nanocellulose {{applications in the}} area of paper and paperboard manufacture. Nanocelluloses are expected to enhance the fiber-fiber bond strength and, hence, have a strong reinforcement effect on paper materials. Nanocellulose may be useful as a barrier in grease-proof type of papers and as a wet-end additive to enhance retention, dry and wet strength in commodity type of <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>board</b> products. It has been shown that applying CNF as a coating material on the surface of paper and paperboard improves the barrier properties, especially air resistance. It also enhances the structure properties of paperboards (smoother surface).|$|E

The recent evolution of wood production from maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) is described and analyzed in a context that takes in account their potential to supply raw material for wood based industries. The effect of forest fire regimes and cuts on wood availability is modeled, using National Forest Inventories data and wildfire statistics. The models were used in predictions of future wood availability under various fire scenarios. Models for the supply and domestic consumption of sawn wood, wood panels, wood pulp, <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> <b>board,</b> based on econometric equations, were developed...|$|R

40|$|Composting is {{nowadays}} {{a general}} treatment method for municipal solid waste. Compostable household waste contains, together with vegetable material, varying amounts of <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> <b>boards.</b> In the European Union composting {{is regarded as}} one recycling method for packages and this will probably favour compostable packages, like <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> <b>boards,</b> in the future. Paper {{is made up of}} lignocellulose and it may contain up to 20 % of lignin. Ecient degradation of papers in composting plants means that biodegra-dation of lignin is also needed. However, very little is known about lignin degradation by mixed microbial compost populations, although lignin degradation by white-rot fungi has been extensively studied in recent years. Organic material is converted to carbon dioxide, humus, and heat by compost microorganisms. It is assumed that humus is formed mainly from lignin. Thus, lignin is not totally mineralized during composting. The elevated temperatures found during the thermophilic phase are essential for rapid degradation of lignocellulose. Complex organic compounds like lignin are mainly degraded by thermophilic microfungi and acti-nomycetes. The optimum temperature for thermophilic fungi is 40 – 50 °C which is also the optimum temperature for lignin de...|$|R
