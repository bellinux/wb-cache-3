2500|$|In {{her first}} {{performance}} in Edinburgh in 1973, Abramović explored elements of ritual and gesture. Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the Russian game, in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she {{would pick up}} a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body – {{the pain and the}} sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramović began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. [...] "Once you enter into the performance state you can <b>push</b> <b>your</b> body to do things you absolutely could never normally do." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Part II (On the Run)" [...] is {{a smooth}} slow-tempo electro-R love ballad which is {{equipped}} with a steamy, retro and retro-futuristic groove that creates an acute level of moody texture. It is instrumentally complete with keyboards and drums. Jon Pareles, a writer of The New York Times noted that it was the closest song to pop music on Magna Carta Holy Grail. Pareles further noted that Timbaland's production sets aside his usual brittle tones to hint at the keyboard confections of 1980's Lionel Richie and Don Henley. Lyrically, the song speaks about a rebellious couple that is desperately in love. The song opens with an airy prelude during which Beyoncé sings the lines, [...] "Who wants that perfect love story anyway anyway / Cliché cliché cliché. Who wants that hero love that saves the day anyway, cliché cliché cliché" [...] in dreamy lead vocals along with breathy harmonies. Jay-Z and Beyoncé further trade verses about fugitives finding romance, with Beyoncé singing, [...] "I hear sirens while we make love" [...] and slowly exhaling in the song, singing in her lower register, swearing that she can still hold her lover's heart and gun. She further denounces the couple's own love story as [...] "a toast to clichés in a dark past" [...] over dizzy, diving synths and drums which sound like [...] "they came out of Eric B's basement," [...] as stated by Grant Jones of the website Rap Reviews. With the lines: [...] "If it's you and me against the world/ Then so be it," [...] Jay-Z notes the criticism towards the couple when they first went public with [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and the lines referencing Tupac Shakur in the song. He further acknowledges that if anyone attacks his girlfriend he would kill them: [...] "Cross the line, speak about mine/ I'mma wave this TEC, I'm a geek about mine/ Touch a ni--a where his rib at/ I click clat/ <b>Push</b> <b>your</b> muh'fuckin' wig back." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And now," [...] he went on, [...] "you have <b>pushed</b> <b>your</b> way further, {{much further}} into the world {{where men and women}} think, than I could or should care to follow you. Is it likely to {{separate}} us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you're a naughty girl. Last {{holidays}} you {{licked the}} paint off my lozenge-box, and the holidays before that {{you let the}} boat drag my fish-line down when I'd set you to watch it, and you <b>pushed</b> <b>your</b> head through my kite, all for nothing." ...|$|R

5000|$|Jonathan Shalit told The Stage: [...] "I {{was excited}} by Stuart Piper, {{who is a}} dynamic young man, he’s a new agent really championing his talent, which I haven’t seen {{from a lot of}} {{theatrical}} agents. A lot of theatrical agents are too old-fashioned and gentle and we work in a massively competitive world, {{and you have to be}} aggressive at <b>pushing</b> <b>your</b> talent forward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you call}} forms and ceremonies {{represent}} the divinest instincts of our nature. <b>Push</b> <b>your</b> aversion to forms and ceremonies to a legitimate conclusion, {{and you would}} prefer kneeling in a barn {{rather than in a}} cathedral. Your tenets would strike at the very existence of all art, which is essentially spiritual." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{response}} to J.F. Gonzalez’s Survivor has been mostly positive since its initial release in 2004. When Survivor was contracted and redistributed by Leisure Books in 2006, The New York Times reviewed {{the novel and}} praised it saying, “Survivor <b>pushes</b> <b>your</b> eyes off the page and then pulls them back, forcing the kind of visceral relationship between writer and reader that the best horror writing can produce.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is based}} on {{experiences}} bandleader Ivan Doroschuk had during his teenage years and is an anti-domestic violence song; the chorus implores men to [...] "stop <b>pushing</b> <b>your</b> women down" [...] and [...] "quit knocking your children around". In later interviews, however, Doroschuk acknowledged that he had received some criticism for the lyrics, because [...] "your women" [...] implied possession rather than partnership.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a further}} {{interview}} with Press Association, Scanlan said: [...] "I {{have never had}} the opportunity to play somebody as complex and as damaged as Brendan. He is without doubt a sociopathic, self-loathing, homophobic gay man and that in itself is a fascinating attraction for any actor to play. I think any actor would love a challenge, when youre doing a role if it <b>pushes</b> <b>your</b> boundaries and takes you out of yourself and allows you to experience different things. I think thats great. So coming up to do the part was exciting for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're {{the kind}} of lad for us,' cried the serjeant, holding Joe's hand in his, in the excess of his admiration. 'You're the boy to <b>push</b> <b>your</b> fortune. I don't say it because I bear you any envy, or would {{take away from the}} credit of the rise you'll make, but if I had been bred and taught like you, I'd have been a colonel by this time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor {{would you}} want them. You {{would have to move}} about quickly, and guns would be terribly inconvenient, if you had to <b>push</b> <b>your</b> way through a hedge or a close thicket. And besides, if you had guns they would not be of much use to you, for none of you are {{accustomed}} to their use, and it needs a great deal of training to learn to shoot straight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I {{could not}} imagine you as a stock-broker or a lawyer. I feel it hard to realize you {{in any of the}} {{ordinary}} walks of life. Still, you know, the greatest question of all remains unanswered. Are you content just to live and flourish and die? Are there no compelling obligations with which one is born? Do you never feel cramped--in your mind, I mean?--feel that you want to <b>push</b> <b>your</b> way through the clouds into some other life?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The main {{argument}} against MMOB argues {{the fact that}} the travellers cannot turn off the programs, turn down the volume or change channel. This implies that they cannot skip the commercials. Public transport franchises enjoy [...] "monopoly" [...] over many routes. Many passengers have no real alternative means of transport. The term [...] "captive audience" [...] is repeated. Human brain cannot ignore sound or vision. RoadShow's website described bus television as [...] "a highly effective multi-media advertising platform that <b>pushes</b> <b>your</b> products and services to reach a mass audience in a captive environment".|$|R

6000|$|... "What an {{exquisite}} perfume!" [...] {{the young man}} murmured, enthusiastically. [...] "Doesn't it remind you, Mr. Lynn, of a beautiful garden somewhere right away in the country--one of those old-fashioned gardens, you know, with narrow paths {{where you have to}} <b>push</b> <b>your</b> way through the flowers, and where there are always great beds of pink and white stocks near the box edges? And do you notice--an accident, of course--but what a delicate blend of color the lilac and those yellow jonquils make!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Peter thoughtfully, [...] "I dinna ken if that's {{a reason}} for robbing him, and it's {{sometimes}} safer no to <b>push</b> <b>your</b> enemy over hard when he's willing to give in. You must choose. If you hoad on and force him to sell at a big loss, the fight can only end in yan o' two ways. He'll mak' you pay top price for cattle food, lime, and patent manures; or you'll drive him oot o' dale. You must reckon if you're strong enough." ...|$|E
