40|$|Land use {{planning}} tools {{have been}} extensively {{applied in the}} U. S. to achieve sustainability and resiliency for local communities. These include development regulations, building standards, property acquisition, incentive tools, information dissemination, critical and public facilities policies, financial tools, and private-sector initiatives. An important issue related to land use planning tools is to assess <b>planners?</b> beliefs {{about the ways in}} which these tools differ from each other and, thus, how <b>planners</b> choose among these tools in the plan making process. To address this issue, the present study addressed three basic research objectives: 1) determine if <b>planners</b> agree in their perceptions of the attributes of land use planning tools, including efficacy, cost, and implementation barriers; 2) determine if personal characteristics affect <b>planners?</b> perceptions of land use planning tools; and 3) determine if work environment characteristics affect <b>planners?</b> perceptions of land use planning tools. A web-based survey collected data from urban <b>planners</b> in coastal and inland counties (or boroughs) in the five Pacific states. Interrater agreement was assessed to determine if <b>planners</b> had similar perceptions of the attributes of eight types of land use planning tools. In addition, an intercorrelation matrix was examined to identify any important relationships among three perceptual attributes of planning tools (effectiveness, cost, and implementation barriers) and contextual variables such as <b>planners?</b> personal characteristics and those of their jurisdictions. The results indicate that 1) <b>planners</b> substantively, but not completely, agreed in their perceptions of the land use planning tools; 2) <b>planners?</b> perceptions of planning tools are minimally related to their personal characteristics and those of their jurisdictions; and 3) <b>planners?</b> perceptions of planning tools are significantly correlated with the capacity of their planning agencies. The high level of agreement among practicing <b>planners</b> suggests that <b>planners</b> have similar ?mental models? about these planning tools. Moreover, these <b>planners</b> viewed effectiveness as negatively correlated with cost and implementation barriers so they must make tradeoffs among those attributes because there is no ?dominant? tool that will be appropriate for all situations. These experienced <b>planners?</b> views should be conveyed to planning students and novice <b>planners</b> so the latter can better understand the tradeoffs among these tools? effectiveness, cost, and implementation barriers and choose the most appropriate tool when formulating a growth management strategy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{provide a}} set of {{sufficient}} conditions to es-tablish the completeness of an ensemble of motion planners— that is, {{a set of}} loosely-coupled motion <b>planners</b> that produce a unified result. The <b>planners</b> are assumed to divide the total planning problem across some parameter space(s), such as task space, state space, action space, or time. Robotic applications have employed ensembles of <b>planners</b> for decades, although the concept has not been formally unified or analyzed until now. We focus on applications in multi-robot navigation and collision avoidance. We show that individual resolution-or probabilistically-complete <b>planners</b> that meet certain com-munication criteria constitute a (respectively, resolution- or probabilistically-) complete ensemble of <b>planners.</b> This ensem-ble of <b>planners,</b> in turn, guarantees that the robots are free of deadlock, livelock, and starvation.
