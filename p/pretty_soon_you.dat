I'll square the cop on the beat to leave us be; he's a friend of mine. <b>Pretty</b> <b>soon</b> <b>you</b> land me one on the plexus, and I take th' count.

It was a slow, good-natured grin. [...] "Hello, everybody," [...] said he. [...] "I thought I would just amble over here and see your school.

5000|$|Atari under Tramiel had a poor {{reputation}} in the marketplace. In 1986 a columnist for Atari magazine ANALOG Computing warned that company executives seemed to emulate Tramiel's [...] "'penny-pinching' and hard-nosed bargaining, sometimes {{at the risk of}} everything else", resulting in poor customer service and documentation, and product release dates that were [...] "perhaps not the entire truth ... <b>Pretty</b> <b>soon,</b> <b>you</b> don't believe anything they say". He concluded, [...] "I think Atari Corp. had better start considering how they're perceived by the non-Atari-using public". The company, however, was much more open to the press than its predecessor Atari Inc., which had refused to let Antic preview forthcoming announcements and even opposed the magazine printing the word [...] "Atari" [...] on its issues.|$|E

Lenore was gazing out of the window, away across the wheat-fields and the range. Anderson watched her a moment, and then resumed: [...] "If I can get away I'm goin' to drive up to see Dorn again <b>pretty</b> <b>soon.</b> Do <b>you</b> want to go?" ...|$|R

5000|$|They are {{featured}} {{as one of}} Cafe Oto's artists, accompanied by a review from Gavin Burrows of Lucid Frenzy which reads [...] "The centre of the stage was taken up by projections which, always simple and often semi-abstract, never stole the limelight from the music. It was more like watching a trio, just one at work on different senses to the others. <b>Pretty</b> <b>soon</b> <b>you</b> weren't taking in {{the sights and sounds}} as separate elements at all, but hand been induced into a kind of synaesthesia. And if that seems like we're reverting to Sixties terminology like 'trip' we might as well go with it.... it felt like a trip (man), like being taken through some other reality then dumped back in ours at the end." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Hindu wrote, [...] "Mahesh, Saranya, Matrum Palar is a neat family film. It is {{also true}} that things are unbelievably hunky-dory in this joint family and hence, too cinematic". Rediff gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "The title is in itself an {{interesting}} one and you settle down with some anticipation. But <b>pretty</b> <b>soon</b> <b>you</b> wish debutante director P V Ravi had concentrated as much on his screenplay as he did in naming the film", calling it a [...] "love-story that lacks spice". Sify wrote, [...] "if there's only one reason which makes Mahesh Saranya Matrum Palar watchable is Shakti...He is in very good form even though the film isn't, with its old-fashioned plot points and characters. But it's not entirely unwatchable due to {{the manner in which it}} is narrated and the final twist in the story". Indiaglitz.com wrote, [...] "Ravi has etched out a good entertainer. But, a slow narration with repeatedly familiar characters and plot spoils the show".|$|E
40|$|In this Essay, the {{proposition}} the author draws from {{the narrative of}} the endangered species litigation is derivatively Aristotelian – that we must consciously, actively, and explicitly integrate an informed consideration of human politics into what we teach and do in environmental law. The proposition is not that we should steep ourselves in party politics, although there are interesting observations aplenty that could be made on the direct consequences that the two major parties (and occassionally their wistful smaller incarnations) have on the evolution of environmental law. The proposition offered here operates at two different levels: practical politics and political overview. This proposition, especially its latter portion, risks the criticism that it is just a mite grandiose. But it reflects {{the fact that most of}} us in this field believe environmental law is different from other fields of law. And, in terms of human governance, most of us in this field have repeatedly discovered that, if you scratch away at the surface of almost any issue or controversy in environmental law, <b>pretty</b> <b>soon</b> <b>you</b> will be looking at some of the very most fundamental questions of democratic government...|$|E

Can you fancy any one being afraid of me, except my husband, of course?--for as you know, when a woman is talking of men, her husband is always excepted. Come, we must be going; but, Mr. Caresfoot, bend a little nearer; if you will accept it from such a stranger, I {{want to give you a}} bit of advice--make your choice <b>pretty</b> <b>soon,</b> or <b>you</b> will lose them both." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You are an old hand at this business, sir, but I feel it's {{my duty to}} {{warn you}} that things don't look well," [...] he said. [...] "Your friends of the {{opposition}} are evidently able to stand considerable hammering. The sum you mentioned would be no use now to pull us straight; and unless there's a break <b>pretty</b> <b>soon</b> they'll squeeze <b>you</b> like a screw vice on settling day.

6000|$|The Captain laughed. [...] "Pirates!" [...] said he. [...] "What stuff! There are no pirates {{in these}} days!" [...] {{and then he}} laughed again. [...] "Well, I can't talk any more now," [...] said he, [...] "but I'll keep your {{business}} in my mind, and settle it <b>pretty</b> <b>soon.</b> Then <b>you</b> {{can go back and}} tell your people what I'll do. You had better go on deck and make yourself comfortable. If you'll take my advice, you won't do any talking. The people on this vessel don't know what she carries, and I don't want them to know! So if I see you talking to anybody, I'll consider that you want to make trouble--and I can tell you, if some of these people on board knew what was in them boxes in the hold, there would be the worst kind of trouble. You can bet your head on that! So you can go on and show yourself. Your friends won't be worried about you--I've explained it all to them in my note!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Elsa," [...] he {{now said}} gaily, [...] "I chalked up the days--made marks, I mean, {{in a book}} which I bought in Fiume the day before we sailed. Seven hundred and thirty days--for I never meant to stay away more than two years; and every evening in my bunk on board ship and {{afterwards}} in the farm where I lodged, I scratched {{out one of the}} marks and seemed to feel myself getting a little bit nearer and then nearer to you. By the Saints, my dove," [...] he added, with a merry laugh, [...] "but you should have seen me the time I got cheated out of one of those scratches. I had forgotten that accursed twenty-ninth of February last year. I don't think that I have ever sworn so wickedly in my life before.

'Now as to this article,' said Cincinnati, {{slashing}} {{into the}} ostensible butter and holding forward {{a slab of}} it on his knife-blade, 'it's from our house; look at it--smell of it--taste it. Put any test on it you want to. Take your own time--no hurry--make it thorough. There now--what do you say? butter, ain't it. Not by a thundering sight--it's oleomargarine! Yes, sir, that's what it is--oleomargarine. You can't tell it from butter; by George, an EXPERT can't. It's from our house. We supply most of the boats in the West; there's hardly a pound of butter on one of them. We are crawling right along--JUMPING right along is the word. We {{are going to have}} that entire trade. Yes, and the hotel trade, too. You are going to see the day, <b>pretty</b> <b>soon,</b> when <b>you</b> can't find an ounce of butter to bless yourself with, in any hotel in the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, outside of the biggest cities. Why, we are turning out oleomargarine NOW by the thousands of tons. And we can sell it so dirt-cheap that the whole country has GOT to take it--can't get around it you see. Butter don't stand any show--there ain't any chance for competition. Butter's had its DAY--and from this out, butter goes to the wall. There's more money in oleomargarine than--why, you can't imagine the business we do. I've stopped in every town from Cincinnati to Natchez; and I've sent home big orders from every one of them.' ...|$|R
