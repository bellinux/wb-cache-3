25|$|The {{theory was}} {{introduced}} in the 1950s by Raul Prebisch, Director of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America after observing that economic growth in wealthy countries did not translate into economic growth in poor countries. Dependency theorists believe {{this is due to the}} import-export relationship between rich and poor countries. Walter Rodney, in his book How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, used this framework when observing the relationship between European trading companies and African peasants living in postcolonial states. Through the labour of peasants, African countries are able to gather large quantities of raw materials. Rather than being able to export these materials directly to Europe, states must work with a number of trading companies, who collaborated to keep <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> low. The trading companies then sold the materials to European manufactures at inflated prices. Finally the manufactured goods were returned to Africa, but with prices so high, that labourers were unable to afford them. This led to a situation where the individuals who labored extensively to gather raw materials were unable to benefit from the finished goods.|$|E

25|$|In Finland, the {{standard}} rate of VAT is 24% as of 1 January 2013 (raised from previous 23%), {{along with all}} other VAT rates, excluding the zero rate. In addition, two reduced rates are in use: 14% (up from previous 13% starting 1 January 2013), which is applied on food and animal feed, and 10%, (increased from 9% 1 January 2013) which is applied on passenger transportation services, cinema performances, physical exercise services, books, pharmaceuticals, entrance fees to commercial cultural and entertainment events and facilities. Supplies of some goods and services are exempt under the conditions defined in the Finnish VAT Act: hospital and medical care; social welfare services; educational, financial and insurance services; lotteries and money games; transactions concerning bank notes and coins used as legal tender; real property including building land; certain transactions carried out by blind persons and interpretation services for deaf persons. The seller of these tax-exempt services or goods {{is not subject to}} VAT and does not pay tax on sales. Such sellers therefore may not deduct VAT included in the <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> of his inputs. Åland, an autonomous area, is considered to be outside the EU VAT area, even if its VAT rate is the same as for Finland.

25|$|Between 1709 and 1754, over £46,000 {{was spent}} to extend Lowther {{holdings}} {{of land and}} coal royalties in West Cumberland. The intention was to destroy his local competitors and establish a local monopoly; he failed to offer others high enough <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> to secure the properties needed for a monopoly, but by the 1740s Lowther was the dominant exporter at every harbour in the coalfield. Loans were made to local landowners {{in the hope that}} interest payments would not be met and Lowther would be able to foreclose on the property. Mine-owners at Moresby and Distington were bought out. Repeated attempts were made (through John Spedding and other third parties) to lease the pits at Workington owned by the Curwen family, but came to nothing. However, a lease (in conjunction with a junior partner) was secured (1731) of Seaton colliery, which Spedding regarded as the greatest obstacle to Lowther domination of the coalfield, and in 1734, the lessees of Clifton colliery agreed to limit their export sales to 7000 tons a year, to be sold to the lessees of Seaton colliery; an agreement which - Spedding assured Lowther - must put the coal trade through Workington harbour entirely in his hands. The junior partner in the Seaton lease later fell out with Lowther and Spedding, and alleged that Seaton was deliberately being run inefficiently to stifle competition with the Whitehaven pits.|$|E

2500|$|Reverse auction {{is a type}} of {{auction in}} which the roles of the buyer and the seller are reversed, with the primary {{objective}} to drive <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> downward. While ordinary auctions provide suppliers the opportunity to find the best price among interested buyers, reverse auctions give buyers a chance to find the lowest-price supplier. During a reverse auction, suppliers may submit multiple offers, usually as a response to competing suppliers’ offers, bidding down the price of a good or service to the lowest price they are willing to receive. By revealing the competing bids in real time to every participating supplier, reverse auctions promote “information transparency”.

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{negotiation}} of accounting rules in the <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustment clause of corporate acquisition agreements. <b>Purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments make the deal value contingent on the target's closing working capital or net worth. Some <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments use "rigid" accounting and specify which measurement rules {{will be used to}} prepare the closing-date balance sheet. Many more use "flexible" accounting and require only GAAP compliance. I provide evidence that hidden action and adverse selection problems determine whether the buyer and seller use rigid or flexible accounting. I also provide evidence that this choice is associated with other features of the contract related to <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustment flexibility and to the prospect of hold-up. Estimates of the effect of rigid accounting on finalized <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments are consistent with implications of the adverse selection and hold-up problems. by Derek Christopher Johnson.
