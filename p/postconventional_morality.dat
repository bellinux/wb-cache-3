5000|$|Lawrence Kohlberg is a {{psychologist}} who has {{made significant contributions to}} the field of moral reasoning by creating a theory of moral development. His theory is a [...] "widely accepted theory that provides the basis for empirical evidence on the influence of human decision making on ethical behavior."In Lawrence Kohlberg's view, moral development consists of the growth of less egocentric and more impartial modes of reasoning on more complicated matters. He believed that the objective of moral education is the reinforcement of children to grow from one stage to an upper stage. Dilemma was a critical tool that he emphasized that children should be presented with; yet also, the knowledge for children to cooperate.According to his theory, people pass through three main stages of moral development as they grow from early childhood to adulthood. These are preconventional morality, conventional morality, and <b>postconventional</b> <b>morality.</b> Each of these is subdivided into two levels.|$|E
50|$|The final {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is <b>postconventional</b> <b>morality.</b> The individual determines what the moral ideal {{for the society}} is. The individual will begin to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is legal. He will recognize some laws violate basic moral principles. He will go beyond perspectives of social groups or authorities and will start to accept the perspectives of all points of views around the world. In {{the first stage of}} postconventional, called “morality of contract, individual rights and democratic accepted law”, all people willingly work towards benefitting everyone. They understand all social groups within a society have different values, but believe all intellectual individuals would agree on two points. First point being freedom of liberty and life. Second, they would agree to having democratic vote for changing unfair laws and improving their society. The final stage of the final level of Kohlberg’s moral reasoning is “morality of individual principles of conscience”, At this highest stage of moral reasoning, Kohlberg defines his stage 6 subjects as having a clear and broad concept of universal principles. The stage 6 thinker does not create the basis for morality. Instead, he explores, through self-evaluation, complex principles of respect for all individuals and for their rights that all religions or moral authorities would view as moral. Kohlberg stopped using stage 6 in his scoring manual, saying it was a “theoretical stage”. He began to score postconventional responses only up to stage 5.|$|E
