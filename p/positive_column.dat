40|$|International audienceOptical {{emission}} spectroscopy (OES) measurements {{coupled with a}} collisional-radiative model were used to characterize a plane-to-plane dielectric barrier discharge at atmospheric pressure operated in nominally pure helium. The model predicts the population densities for the n[*][*]=[*][*] 3 levels of He excited by electron impact processes from either ground or metastable states and takes into account excitation transfer processes between He n[*][*]=[*][*] 3 levels {{as well as all}} relevant radiative decays and quenching reactions. Time-resolved OES measurements indicate that line ratios from He n[*][*]=[*][*] 3 triplet states (for example, 587. 5 nm-to- 706. 5 [*]nm) and singlet states (for example, 667. 8 nm-to- 728. 1 [*]nm) first sharply rise as the discharge ignites and then slowly decrease as it extinguishes. Assuming that n[*][*]=[*][*] 3 levels are first populated only by electron impact on ground state He atoms and then only by electron impact on metastable He atoms as the discharge current and thus the metastable number density rise, triplet and singlet line ratios predicted by the model become in each opposite case solely dependent on the electron temperature T e (assuming Maxwellian electron energy distribution function). The values of T e deduced from the analysis of both ratios were relatively high early in the discharge cycle (around 1. 0 – 1. 4 [*]eV) and then much lower near discharge extinction (around 0. 15 [*]eV).

Striation spacing, frequency and velocity were measured as a function of discharge current from low currents to the current for extinction of moving striations, for pressures from 1 to 16 mm Hg. Striation frequency was also measured as a function of pressure for various radii discharge tubes. The anode spot light oscillations were eliminated by use of an auxiliary anode discharge, which brought the <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> in contact with the anode and eliminated the oscillat­ing anode fall in potential. This change in the anode region produced no significant change in the striation parameters, but greatly reduced and altered the frequency of the poten­tial oscillations across the discharge tube. The potential oscillations now followed the wave form and frequency of the striation oscillations instead of the frequency of the anode spot oscillations. By use of a discharge tube, constructed with sections of different radius, moving striations in the <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> were isolated from both cathode and anode by sections of homogenous <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> in which no voltage oscillations were detectable by floating probes.
