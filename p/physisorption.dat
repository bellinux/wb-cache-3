25|$|The Langmuir {{isotherm}} {{is usually}} better for chemisorption and the BET isotherm works better for <b>physisorption</b> for non-microporous surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption can be broadly {{classified}} as {{being one of}} two types: <b>physisorption</b> or chemisorption. <b>Physisorption</b> is characterized by weak van der Waals interactions, and bond enthalpies typically less than 20kJ/mol. Chemisorption, alternatively, is defined by stronger covalent and ionic bonds, with bond enthalpies between 250 and 500kJ/mol. In both cases, the adsorbate atoms or molecules (i.e. the particles which adhere to the surface) are attracted to the adsorbent (solid) surface because of the surface energy that results from unoccupied bonding locations at the surface. The degree of orbital overlap then determines if the interactions will be physisorptive or chemisorptive.|$|E
25|$|CO2 {{can bind to}} the MOF surface through either <b>physisorption</b> or chemisorption, where <b>physisorption</b> occurs through van der Waals {{interactions}} and chemisorption occurs through covalent bonds being formed between the CO2 and MOF surface. Once the MOF is saturated with CO2, the MOF would then be regenerated (CO2 {{is removed from the}} MOF to be transported elsewhere for sequestration or enhanced oil recovery) through either a temperature swing or a pressure swing. In a temperature swing, the MOF would be heated up until CO2 desorbs; temperature swing regeneration is usually used in post-combustion configurations where the heat is supplied from heat exchangers with the power plant. To achieve working capacities comparable to the amine solvent process, the MOF must be heated up to around 200 C. In a pressure swing, the pressure would be decreased until CO2 desorbs; this would usually be used in a pre-combustion carbon capture configuration.|$|E
25|$|In a {{microporous}} material where <b>physisorption</b> {{and weak}} van der Waals forces dominate adsorption, the storage density is greatly {{dependent on the}} size of the pores. Calculations of idealized homogeneous materials, such as graphitic carbons and carbon nanotubes, predict that a microporous material with 7Å-wide pores will exhibit maximum hydrogen uptake at room temperature. At this width, exactly two layers of hydrogen molecules adsorb on opposing surfaces with no space left in between.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to surface}} tension, {{adsorption}} {{is a consequence}} of surface energy. In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms {{on the surface of the}} adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the adsorption process is generally classified as <b>physisorption</b> (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or chemisorption (characteristic of covalent bonding). It may also occur due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
25|$|Metal-organic {{frameworks}} represent another {{class of}} synthetic porous materials that store hydrogen and energy {{at the molecular}} level. MOFs are highly crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid structures that contain metal clusters or ions (secondary building units) as nodes and organic ligands as linkers. When guest molecules (solvent) occupying the pores are removed during solvent exchange and heating under vacuum, porous structure of MOFs can be achieved without destabilizing the frame and hydrogen molecules will be adsorbed {{onto the surface of}} the pores by <b>physisorption.</b> Compared to traditional zeolites and porous carbon materials, MOFs have very high number of pores and surface area which allow higher hydrogen uptake in a given volume. Thus, research interests on hydrogen storage in MOFs have been growing since 2003 when the first MOF-based hydrogen storage was introduced. Since there are infinite geometric and chemical variations of MOFs based on different combinations of SBUs and linkers, many researches explore what combination will provide the maximum hydrogen uptake by varying materials of metal ions and linkers.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{specific}} energy of uncompressed hydrogen gas is very low, denser storage methods {{are of interest}} for energy storage. [...] MOFs attract attention as materials for adsorptive hydrogen storage because of their high specific surface areas and chemically tunable structures. Hydrogen is taken up by MOFs by adsorption. Compared to an empty gas cylinder, a MOF-filled gas cylinder can store more gas because of adsorption that takes place {{on the surface of}} MOFs. (Note that molecular hydrogen adsorbs to the surface; atomic hydrogen does not.) Furthermore, MOFs are free of dead-volume, so there is almost no loss of storage capacity as a result of space-blocking by non-accessible volume. Also, MOFs have a fully reversible uptake-and-release behavior: since the storage mechanism is based primarily on <b>physisorption.</b> No large activation barriers are required when liberating the adsorbed hydrogen. The storage capacity of a MOF is limited by the liquid-phase density of hydrogen because the benefits provided by MOFs can be realized only if the hydrogen is in its gaseous state.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF through <b>physisorption</b> or {{chemisorption}} {{based on}} the porosity and selectivity of the MOF leaving behind a Greenhouse gas poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly. The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) so the MOF can be reused. Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the [...] {{is removed from the}} sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused. Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing , have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water. Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step. Thus, to optimize a MOF for carbon capture, low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired. Additionally, high working capacity and high selectivity are desirable in order to capture as much [...] as possible from the flue gas. However, there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure. As the amount of [...] captured increases, the energy, and therefore cost, required to regenerate increases. A large drawback of using MOFs for CCS is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability. Current research is looking to optimize MOF properties for CCS, but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable MOF. Metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of MOFs.|$|E

A mathematical model for <b>physisorption</b> was developed by London to predict the energies of basic <b>physisorption</b> of non-polar molecules.

50|$|The {{deposition}} of parylene N {{is a function}} of a two-step process. First, <b>physisorption</b> needs to take place, which {{is a function of}} deposition pressure and temperature. The <b>physisorption</b> has inverse Arrhenius kinetics, in other words it is stronger at lower temperatures than higher temperatures. All the parylenes have a critical temperature called the threshold temperature above which practically no deposition is observed. The closer the deposition temperature is to the threshold temperature the weaker the <b>physisorption.</b> Once <b>physisorption</b> occurs, the p-xylylene intermediate needs to react with itself (2nd step) for polymerization to occur. For parylene N, its threshold temperature is 40 °C.|$|E
5000|$|... {{which are}} the Gibbs {{energies}} of <b>physisorption</b> and chemisorption, respectively. Many polymer applications, such as those which use polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, or Teflon) {{require the use of}} a surface with specific <b>physisorption</b> properties toward one type of material, while being firmly adhered in place to a different type of material. Because the <b>physisorption</b> energy is so low for these types of materials, chemisorption is used to form covalent bonds between the polymer coating and the surface of the object (such as a pan) which holds it in place. Because the relative magnitudes of chemisorption processes are generally much greater than magnitudes of <b>physisorption</b> processes, this forms a strong bond between the polymer and the surface it is chemically adhered to, while allowing the polymer to retain its <b>physisorption</b> characteristics toward other materials.|$|E
50|$|Figure 1 is a graph of <b>physisorption</b> and {{chemisorption}} energy {{curves of}} tungsten and oxygen. <b>Physisorption</b> is given as a Lennard-Jones potential and chemisorption is given as a Morse potential. There exists {{a point of}} crossover between the <b>physisorption</b> and chemisorption, meaning a point of transfer. It can occur above or below the zero-energy line (with {{a difference in the}} Morse potential, a), representing an activation energy requirement or lack of. Most simple gases on clean metal surfaces lack the activation energy requirement.|$|E
5000|$|This Pauli {{exclusion}} and repulsion are particularly strong for atoms with closed valence shells {{that dominate the}} surface interaction. As a result, the minimum energy of <b>physisorption</b> must be found by the balance between the long-range van der Waals attraction and short-range Pauli repulsion. For instance, by separating the total interaction of <b>physisorption</b> into two contributions- a short-range term depicted by Hartree - Fock theory and a long-range van der Waals attraction, the equilibrium position of <b>physisorption</b> for rare gases adsorbed on jellium substrate can be determined. [...] Fig. 2 shows the <b>physisorption</b> potential energy of He adsorbed on Ag, Cu, and Au substrates which are described by the jellium model with different densities of smear-out background positive charges. It can be found that the weak van der Waals interaction leads to shallow attractive energy wells (<10 meV). One of the experimental methods for exploring <b>physisorption</b> potential energy is the scattering process, for instance, inert gas atoms scattered from metal surfaces. Certain specific features of the interaction potential between scattered atoms and surface can be extracted by analyzing the experimentally determined angular distribution and cross sections of the scattered particles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fundamental}} interacting {{force of}} <b>physisorption</b> {{is caused by}} van der Waals force. Even though the interaction energy is very weak (~10 - 100 meV), <b>physisorption</b> {{plays an important role}} in nature. For instance, the van der Waals attraction between surfaces and foot-hairs of geckos provides the remarkable ability to climb up vertical walls. [...] Van der Waals forces originate from the interactions between induced, permanent or transient electric dipoles.|$|E
50|$|The Langmuir {{isotherm}} {{is usually}} better for chemisorption and the BET isotherm works better for <b>physisorption</b> for non-microporous surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Physisorption</b> is {{a general}} {{phenomenon}} and occurs in any solid/fluid or solid/gas system. Chemisorption is characterized by chemical specificity.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with chemisorption, {{in which the}} electronic structure of bonding atoms or molecules is changed and covalent or ionic bonds form, <b>physisorption,</b> generally speaking, can only be observed in the environment of low temperature (thermal energy at room temperature ~26 meV) {{and the absence of}} the relatively strong chemisorptions. In practice, the categorisation of a particular adsorption as <b>physisorption</b> or chemisorption depends principally on the binding energy of the adsorbate to the substrate.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{types of}} {{adsorption}} are recognized in heterogeneous catalysis, although many processes fall into an ambiguous range {{between the two}} extremes. In the first type, <b>physisorption,</b> induces only small changes to the electronic structure of the adsorbate. Typical energies for <b>physisorption</b> are from 2 to 10 kcal/mol. The second type is chemisorption, in which the adsorbate is strongly perturbed, often with bond-breaking. Energies for typical chemisorptions range from 15 to 100 kcal/mol.|$|E
5000|$|The {{elementary}} step in <b>physisorption</b> from a {{gas phase}} {{does not involve}} an activation energy. Chemisorption often involves an activation energy.|$|E
5000|$|Typical {{binding energy}} of <b>physisorption</b> is about 10 - 100 meV. Chemisorption usually forms bonding with energy of 1 - 10 eV.|$|E
5000|$|Composition {{plays an}} {{important}} role in that it determines the form that the adsorption process takes, whether by relatively weak <b>physisorption</b> through van der Waals interactions or stronger chemisorption through the formation of chemical bonds between the substrate and adsorbate atoms. Surfaces that undergo chemisorption generally result in more extensive reconstructions than those that undergo <b>physisorption,</b> as the breaking and formation of bonds between the surface atoms alter the interaction of the substrate atoms as well as the adsorbate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Physisorption,</b> {{also called}} {{physical}} adsorption, {{is a process}} in which the electronic structure of the atom or molecule is barely perturbed upon adsorption.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>physisorption,</b> {{perturbation}} of {{the electronic}} states of adsorbent and adsorbate is minimal. For chemisorption, changes in the electronic states may be detectable by suitable physical means.|$|E
5000|$|For <b>physisorption,</b> under {{appropriate}} conditions, {{gas phase}} molecules can form multilayer adsorption. In chemisorption, molecules are adsorbed {{on the surface}} by valence bonds and only form monolayer adsorption.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} to the cometary and asteroidal delivery of H2O would be the accretion via <b>physisorption</b> during {{the formation of the}} terrestrial planets in the solar nebula. This would be consistent with the thermodynamic estimate of around two Earth masses of water vapor within 3AU of the solar accretionary disk, which would exceed by a factor of 40 the mass of water needed to accrete the equivalent of 50 Earth hydrospheres (the most extreme estimate of Earth's bulk H2O content) per terrestrial planet. Even though much of the nebular H2O(g) may be lost due to the high temperature environment of the accretionary disk, it is possible for <b>physisorption</b> of H2O on accreting grains to retain nearly three Earth hydrospheres of H2O at 500 K temperatures. This adsorption model would effectively avoid the 187Os/188Os isotopic ratio disparity issue of distally-sourced H2O. However, the current best estimate of the nebular D/H ratio spectroscopically estimated with Jovian and Saturnian atmospheric CH4 is only 2.1×10−5, a factor of 8 lower than Earth's VSMOW ratio. It is unclear how such a difference could exist, if <b>physisorption</b> were indeed the dominant form of H2O accretion for Earth in particular and the terrestrial planets in general.|$|E
5000|$|In 1958, P. Kisliuk [...] {{presented}} an equation that can explain experimental results. In his theory, molecules {{are trapped in}} precursor states (<b>physisorption)</b> before chemisorption. Then the molecules meet adsorption sites that molecules can adsorb to chemically, so the molecules behave as follows.|$|E
50|$|One {{can find}} {{from the first}} non-vanishing term that the <b>physisorption</b> {{potential}} depends on the distance Z between adsorbed atom and surface as Z&minus;3, {{in contrast with the}} r&minus;6 dependence of the molecular van der Waals potential, where r is the distance between two dipoles.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} with chemisorption is <b>physisorption,</b> which leaves the chemical {{species of the}} adsorbate and surface intact. It is conventionally accepted that the energetic threshold separating the binding energy of [...] "physisorption" [...] from that of [...] "chemisorption" [...] is about 0.5 eV per adsorbed species.|$|E
50|$|Compared to <b>physisorption</b> where adsorbates {{are simply}} {{sitting on the}} surface, the adsorbates can change the surface, along with its {{structure}}. The structure can go through relaxation, where the first few layers change interplanar distances without changing the surface structure, or reconstruction where the surface structure is changed.|$|E
50|$|Minerals {{targeted}} for separation may be chemically surface-modified with collectors {{so that they}} are more hydrophobic. Collectors are a type of surfactant that increase the natural hydrophobicity of the surface, increasing the separability of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. Collectors either chemically bond via chemisorption to the mineral or adsorb onto the surface via <b>physisorption.</b>|$|E
50|$|CO2 {{can bind to}} the MOF surface through either <b>physisorption</b> or chemisorption, where <b>physisorption</b> occurs through van der Waals {{interactions}} and chemisorption occurs through covalent bonds being formed between the CO2 and MOF surface.

To achieve working capacities comparable to the amine solvent process, the MOF must be heated up to around 200 C. In a pressure swing, the pressure would be decreased until CO2 desorbs; this would usually be used in a pre-combustion carbon capture configuration.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{element of}} the common ion pump is a Penning trap. A {{swirling}} cloud of electrons produced by an electric discharge is temporarily stored in the anode region of a Penning trap. These electrons ionize incoming gas atoms and molecules. The resultant swirling ions are accelerated to strike a chemically active cathode (usually titanium). On impact the accelerated ions will either become buried within the cathode or sputter cathode material onto {{the walls of the}} pump. The freshly sputtered chemically active cathode material acts as a getter that then evacuates the gas by both chemisorption and <b>physisorption</b> resulting in a net pumping action. Inert and lighter gases, such as He and H2 tend not to sputter and are absorbed by <b>physisorption.</b> Some fraction of the energetic gas ions (including gas that is not chemically active with the cathode material) can strike the cathode and acquire an electron from the surface, neutralizing it as it rebounds. These rebounding energetic neutrals are buried in exposed pump surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Adsorption is the {{adhesion}} of ions or molecules {{onto the}} surface of another phase. Adsorption may occur via <b>physisorption</b> and chemisorption. Ions and molecules can adsorb to many types of surfaces including polymer surfaces. A polymer is a large molecule composed of repeating subunits bound together by covalent bonds. The adsorption of ions and molecules to polymer surfaces plays a role in many applications including: biomedical, structural, and coatings.|$|E
