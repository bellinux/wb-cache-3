40|$|High {{school dropout}} {{represents}} an important problem that affects {{thousands of students}} each year, and has obvious psychological, economical, and social ramifications. One factor in a student's decision to dropout of school may be motivation. Teachers play important role in helping students develop motivational resources through the provision of autonomy-supportive classrooms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationship of behavioral regulation and competence to students’ intention to <b>persist</b> <b>in,</b> versus drop out of, high school. The authors argue more self-determined forms motivations could positively predict the intention of students to <b>persist</b> <b>in,</b> versus drop out of, high school. The subjects were 318 Iranian 9 th grade students. All subjects completed academic self–regulation questionnaire, perceived competence scale and intention to <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> high school questionnaire. The results of regression analysis showed that more self-determined forms of behavioral regulation predict the intention of students to <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> high school. The results indicated students’ intentions to <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> high school increase with more self-determined forms of behavioral regulation and more perceived competence in classroom. The results also yielded an interesting finding that identified regulation did not predict students’ dropout intention. With respect to intention to <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> high school, these results highlight the importance of taking into account the fostering of perceived competence and more self-determined forms of behavioral regulation. © 2013 IOJES.

5|$|From {{the turn}} of the century, gang warfare <b>persisted</b> <b>in</b> the Whitechapel and Aldgate areas of London between groups of Bessarabians and {{refugees}} from Odessa, and various revolutionary factions were active in the area. One event, the Tottenham Outrage of January 1909, by two revolutionary Russians in London—Paul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus—was an attempt to rob a payroll van, which left two dead and twenty injured. The event used a tactic often employed by revolutionary groups in Russia: the expropriation or theft of private property to fund radical activities.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Kammuri are uncertain; they were {{possibly}} {{related to the}} monsoon trough that moved across the Philippines toward Guam. In late July, a large area of convection <b>persisted</b> <b>in</b> the Philippine Sea, organizing enough for the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Lagalag on August1. Around that time, the system had several weak circulations, one of which <b>persisted</b> <b>in</b> the South China Sea; this center was located east of an area of thunderstorms due to moderate wind shear. Early on August2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression to the north of Luzon. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit by initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 17W, and the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) followed suit early on August3. Initially, it moved generally to the west-northwest, owing to a mid-level ridge over eastern China. The convection became more concentrated, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Kammuri late on August3, to the south of Hong Kong.|$|E

50|$|Pluralistic ignorance {{has been}} linked {{to a wide range of}} {{deleterious}} consequences. For example, victims of pluralistic ignorance see themselves as deviant members of their peer group: less knowledgeable than their classmates, more uptight than their peers, less committed than their fellow board members, less competent than their fellow nurses (see the Dunning - Kruger effect operating in the opposite direction). This can leave them feeling bad about themselves and alienated from the group or institution of which they are a part. In addition, pluralistic ignorance can lead groups to <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> policies and practices that have lost widespread support: This can lead college students to <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> heavy drinking, corporations to <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> failing strategies, and governments to <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> unpopular foreign policies. At the same time, it can prevent groups from taking actions that would be beneficial in the long run: actions to intervene in an emergency, for example, or to initiate a personal relationship.|$|R
