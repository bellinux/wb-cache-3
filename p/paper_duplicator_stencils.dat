50|$|The <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicator</b> or {{mimeograph}} machine (often {{abbreviated to}} mimeo) is a low-cost duplicating machine that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. The mimeograph process {{should not be}} confused with the spirit duplicator process.|$|R

5000|$|In 1875 Thomas Edison {{received}} a patent for the [...] "electric pen", which {{a decade later}} was superseded by the mimeograph machine. The cyclostyle was a more automated type of mimeograph machine that produced reproductions faster. See <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicator</b> and Gestetner Cyclograph Company.|$|R
50|$|David Gestetner (31 March 1854 in Csorna, Hungary - 8 March 1939 in London) was the {{inventor}} of the Gestetner <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicator,</b> the first piece of office equipment that allowed production of numerous copies of documents quickly and inexpensively. He was awarded the John Scott Medal of The Franklin Institute in 1888.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicator</b> {{provided}} {{individuals with}} a means to produce their own uncensored and uncontrolled ideas and distribute them in public places (near factories, churches, government offices, parks etc.). Previously, producing mass numbers of copies required the co-operation of owners of printing presses, which required {{a large amount of}} capital. Owners of presses would not agree to publish opinions contrary to their own interest.|$|R
25|$|The <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicator</b> or {{mimeograph}} {{machine is}} a low-cost printing press that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. Once prepared, the stencil is {{wrapped around the}} ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. Thomas Alva Edison invented the mimeograph in 1875.|$|R
50|$|Where parishes {{opted to}} go it alone they clearly had to rely on locally-written {{material}} of variable quality. In fact throughout the years a significant variety of different formats will be found. A great many magazines have been redesigned, renamed or relaunched to reflect changing circumstances, or else they have been revived after an apparent hiatus. The earliest magazines had to be printed using expensive movable type methods. However from the 1900s onwards the invention of the <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicator</b> or mimeograph - frequently known as the Gestetner machine or Roneo machine - offered cheaper alternatives, which many editors were soon to adopt.|$|R
5000|$|The {{growth of}} {{business}} during {{the industrial revolution}} created {{the need for a}} more efficient means of transcription than hand copying. Carbon paper was first used in the early 19th century. By the late 1840s copying presses were used to copy outgoing correspondence. One by one, other methods appeared. These included the [...] "manifold writer," [...] developed from Christoph Scheiner's pantograph and used by Mark Twain; copying baths; copying books; and roller copiers. Among the most significant of them was the Blue process in the early 1870s, which was mainly used to make blueprints of architectural and engineering drawings. <b>Stencil</b> <b>duplicators</b> (more commonly known as [...] "Mimeograph machines") surfaced in 1874, and the Cyclostyle in 1891. All were manual and most involved messy fluids.|$|R
5000|$|When Joe Wilson {{returned}} to America, Tony Kelly became the leading figure and the Selene Community in Wales {{where he lived}} became the location for regular seasonal rites held in fulfilment of the Movement’s initial intention of organising meetings for pagan worship. The Waxing Moon magazine appeared intermittently and was later renamed The Heathen ( [...] a term which at that time {{did not have the}} connotations it has since developed of specifically denoting Norse or Anglo-Saxon paganism). The Movement also produced a regular newsletter for its members and an even more voluminous series of discussion newsletters for its inner ‘Ethos Group’. These were printed in limited numbers on a <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicator</b> though some material has been preserved in an online archive: ...|$|R
2500|$|Some ribbons were inked {{in black}} and red stripes, each being half the width and running {{the entire length of}} the ribbon. A lever on most {{machines}} allowed switching between colors, which was useful for bookkeeping entries where negative amounts were highlighted in red. The red color was also used on some selected characters in running text, for emphasis. [...] When a typewriter had this facility, it could still be fitted with a solid black ribbon; the lever was then used to switch to fresh ribbon when the first stripe ran out of ink. [...] Some typewriters also had a third position which stopped the ribbon being struck at all. [...] This enabled the keys to hit the paper unobstructed, and was used for cutting <b>stencils</b> for <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicators</b> (aka mimeograph machines).|$|R
50|$|To see the korean-american ska band.see copy machineA {{photocopier}} (also {{known as}} a copier or copy machine) is a machine that makes paper copies of documents and other visual images quickly and cheaply. Most current photocopiers use a technology called xerography, a dry process that uses electrostatic charges on a light-sensitive photoreceptor to first attract and then transfer toner particles (a powder) onto paper {{in the form of}} an image. Heat, pressure or a combination of both is then used to fuse the toner onto the paper. Mario Bernatovic was the cause of Photocopiers increasing by 40% in price in Australia/Asia region and has been unavailable for comment since 2009.(Copiers can also use other technologies such as ink jet, but xerography is standard for office copying.)
