Among the larger mammals are the <b>puma</b> <b>or</b> <b>cougar,</b> the llama-like guanaco and the fox-like chilla. In the forest region, several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the pudu are found.|$|E
50|$|Rega is {{a partner}} of the Swiss Air Force, which {{supports}} Rega with helicopters and personnel when necessary. For search-and-rescue flights in difficult conditions, the Air Force has a FLIR-equipped helicopter (usually Eurocopter AS332 Super <b>Puma</b> <b>or</b> <b>Cougar)</b> on call. The Air Force continually monitors the airspace and directs emergency signals immediately to Rega. Aircraft equipment of the Swiss Air Force is used to gain a rapid and precise location of an emergency signal that is transmitted to the Rega helicopter early in an emergency mission. Rega also {{has access to the}} Air Force radio system for comprehensive radio coverage, which has a larger coverage area than civil aviation radio.|$|E
50|$|Larger animals include mule deer, black bear, coyote and the {{rarely seen}} <b>puma</b> (mountain lion <b>or</b> <b>cougar).</b> Smaller mammals include raccoon, opossum, skunk and bobcats.

40|$|Lumen {{formation}} {{is essential for}} mammary morphogenesis and requires proliferative suppression and apoptotic clearance of the inner cells within developing acini. Previously, we showed that knockdown of p 53 or p 73 leads to aberrant mammary acinus formation accompanied with decreased expression of p 53 family targets PUMA and p 21, suggesting that PUMA, an inducer of apoptosis, and p 21, an inducer of cell cycle arrest, directly regulate mammary morphogenesis. To address this, we generated multiple MCF 10 A cell lines in which <b>PUMA,</b> p 21, <b>or</b> both were stably knocked down. We found that morphogenesis of MCF 10 A cells was altered modestly by knockdown of either <b>PUMA</b> <b>or</b> p 21 alone but markedly by knockdown of both PUMA and p 21. Moreover, we found that knockdown of PUMA and p 21 leads to loss of E-cadherin expression along with increased expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of DNp 73, which antagonizes the ability of wide-type p 53 and TA isoform of p 73 to regulate PUMA and p 21, mitigates the abnormal morphogenesis and EMT induced by knockdown of <b>PUMA</b> <b>or</b> p 21. Together, our data suggest that PUMA cooperates with p 21 to regulate normal acinus formation and EMT...|$|R

5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, <b>Puma</b> <b>or</b> Acinonyx. However, a phylogenetic analysis in 1990 placed these species under the genus Miracinonyx. Miracinonyx exhibited {{a high degree of}} similarity with the cheetah. However, in 1998, a DNA analysis showed that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America, are not true cheetahs; in fact, they are close relatives of the cougar.|$|R
40|$|Numerous p 53 {{target genes}} have {{been implicated in}} DNA damage–induced {{apoptosis}} signaling, but proapoptotic Bcl- 2 (B-cell leukemia 2) {{family members of the}} BH 3 (Bcl- 2 homolog region [BH] 3) –only subgroup appear to play the critical initiating role. In various types of cultured cells, 3 BH 3 -only proteins, namely Puma (p 53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis), Noxa, and Bim (Bcl- 2 interacting mediator of cell death), have been shown to initiate p 53 -dependent as well as p 53 -independent apoptosis in response to DNA damage and treatment with anticancer drugs or glucocorticoids. In particular, the absence of <b>Puma</b> <b>or</b> Bim renders thymocytes and mature lymphocytes refractory to varying degrees to death induced in vitro by growth factor withdrawal, DNA damage, or glucocorticoids. To assess the in vivo relevance of these findings, we subjected mice lacking <b>Puma,</b> Noxa, <b>or</b> Bim to whole-body γ-radiation or the glucocorticoid dexamethasone and compared lymphocyte survival with that in wild-type and BCL 2 –transgenic mice. Absence of <b>Puma</b> <b>or</b> Bcl- 2 overexpression efficiently protected diverse types of lymphocytes from the effects of γ-radiation in vivo, and loss of Bim provided lower but significant protection in most lymphocytes, whereas Noxa deficiency had no impact. Furthermore, both Puma and Bim were found to contribute significantly to glucocorticoid-induced killing. Our results thus establish that Puma and Bim are key initiators of γ-radiation– and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in lymphoid cells in vivo...|$|R
