25|$|The {{algorithm}} {{attempts to}} set up a congruence of squares modulo n (the integer to be factorized), which often leads to a factorization of n. The algorithm works in two phases: the data collection phase, where it collects information that may lead to a congruence of squares; and the data <b>processing</b> <b>phase,</b> where it puts all the data it has collected into a matrix and solves it to obtain a congruence of squares. The data collection phase can be easily parallelized to many processors, but the data <b>processing</b> <b>phase</b> requires large amounts of memory, and is difficult to parallelize efficiently over many nodes or if the processing nodes do not each have enough memory to store the whole matrix. The block Wiedemann algorithm can be used {{in the case of a}} few systems each capable of holding the matrix.|$|E

An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction) is inferred from these estimates. Techniques from control theory convert the task into commands that drive the actuators.|$|E

An alternative process, known as all-in-one processing, also exists for some products whereby all three phases are performed in the vacuum or pressure rated vessel.

30|$|As {{described}} above, {{the event}} dispatcher {{is responsible for}} the event detection and the event handler is responsible for event processing. Therefore, the event detection and event <b>processing</b> <b>phases</b> could overlap. Also, because event handlers are able to work independently, the event <b>processing</b> <b>phases</b> of different events can overlap, which makes it possible to process the events in parallel. These are the key features that make our event-driven architecture as customizable and scalable. The proposed sensor node architecture locates all computation resources locally as needed by the event handler to process a particular event. Therefore, event handlers do not need to signal an interrupt to request the resources for task processing. As a result, there is no interrupt overhead in our architecture.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a hybrid time-frequency {{approach}} {{for the detection of}} audio signal patterns for the purpose of surveillance applications. The proposed detection algorithm evolves through two main <b>processing</b> <b>phases,</b> denoted as coarse and fine, respectively. The key idea is that of distinguishing classes of audio signals on the basis of spectral “signatures. ” However, we use different <b>processing</b> <b>phases,</b> in the time (“coarse”) and frequency (“fine”) domains, {{in order to reduce the}} computational complexity. In fact, fine processing (in the frequency domain) is carried out only when an "atypical" audio signal is detected, on the basis of low-complexity energy detection, with coarse processing. The performance of the proposed detection algorithm is investigated also using experimental audio signals acquired with the microphone module of a multi-sensorial wireless sensor network (WSN) node prototype. The obtained results show that the proposed approach allows to effectively detect a signal of interest, thus making it suitable to surveillance applications and in general for distributed sensing applications...|$|R
