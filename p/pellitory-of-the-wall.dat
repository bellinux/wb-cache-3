It is {{in a different}} family (Asteraceae) from the plants known as <b>pellitory-of-the-wall</b> (Parietaria officinalis) and spreading pellitory (Parietaria judaica).|$|E

It is {{shown that the}} type of P. officinalis L. is specimen No. 1220. 2, and that of P. judaica L. specimen No. 1220. 3, in the Linnaean Herbarium (LINN). P. officinalis h a species found in the Orient and central and northern Europe, but absent from the British Isles. The British species should be called P. judaica L., of which P. rami-flora Moench and P. diffusa Mertens & Koch are synonyms. The diagnostic features of P. officinalis and P. judaica are given. Although name-changes in the British flora have been not infrequent in recent years, comparatively few have been based purely on taxonomic conclusions; rather have the majority resulted from the exploration of the very necessary, but to most botanists rather arid, fields of bibliography and nomenclature. It would appear, however, that the name by which British botanists know the common <b>Pellitory-of-the-wall</b> must be changed on purely taxonomic grounds. In the current authoritative check-list of British plants (Dandy 1958), the Pellitory is listed as Padetaria diffusa Mertens & Koch, with P. officinalis auctt. and P. ramiflora auctt. in synonymy. These synonyms reflect two taxonomic conclusions; firstly, that the names P. offieinalis L. (1753) and P. ramiflora Moench (1794) have been misapplied to our British species, and secondly, that taxa described under these names represent one or more species distinct from P. diffusa Mertens & Koch. The existence of at least two closely related species of Parietaria-one erect in habit with larger leaves, the other more decumbent with smaller foliage (to which the degree of accrescence and form of the perianth of. the hermaphrodite flowers and various other characters have been added) -has been indicated by three principal authors, viz.
