Glass made this way is never fully transparent, but does not necessarily have much texture. It can be pushed and tugged while molten to create certain effects.

40|$|Nitrogen in groundwater, more {{specifically}} nitrate, {{is common in}} certain areas and {{is often associated with}} agricultural production or urban areas underlain by coarse soils. While the presence of nitrates in groundwater is not debated, the specific sources or cause of the elevated nitrate in these areas is often questioned.

These areas include portions of the Ogallala and Seymour Aquifers which both exhibit elevated nitrates in certain areas. In an effort to address questions about sources and causes of elevated groundwater nitrate and to provide sound data on potential management strategies that can remediate groundwater nitrate levels, this project was developed. The primary objective was to identify sources of groundwater nitrate in the Texas High <b>Plains</b> and <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plains</b> and the secondary objective was to evaluate and demonstrate strategies and practices for reducing nitrate levels in these same areas.

In Texas and across their range, Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) habitat frequently overlaps cultivated cropland protected by neonicotinoids. To address the effects of neonicotinoid use on bobwhites in Texas, we conducted a historical analysis from 1978 ? 2012 in Texas? ecological regions using quail count data collected from North American Breeding Bird Survey and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and neonicotinoid use data from the U.

Neonicotinoid use was significantly (p< 0. 05) negatively associated with bobwhite abundance in the High <b>Plains,</b> <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plains,</b> Gulf Coast Prairies & Marshes, Edwards Plateau, and South Texas Plains ecological regions in the time periods following neonicotinoid introduction (1994 ? 2003) or after their {{widespread use}} (2004 ? 2012).

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of neonicotinoid insecticides {{in recent years has}} led to increasing environmental concern, including impacts to avian populations. In Texas and across their range, Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite) habitat frequently overlaps with agricultural areas of known neonicotinoid use. To address the impacts of neonicotinoids on bobwhites in Texas, we developed the following research objectives: (1) Conduct statistical analysis of bobwhite abundance and neonicotinoid use in Texas over the last 35 years, and (2) Analyze bobwhite samples collected from three field sites across the state for neonicotinoid residues and signs of tissue damage. Generalized linear, generalized additive, mixed-effects, zero-inflated, and hurdle models were used to analyze long-term data on bobwhite abundance, neonicotinoid use, and environmental variables from 1978 - 2012. Statewide analysis indicates that total neonicotinoid use is negatively correlated with quail abundance in the periods after neonicotinoid introduction (1994 - 2003) and after their {{widespread use}} (2004 - 2012). Analysis by ecoregion provided further support for the significant negative relationship between bobwhites and neonicotinoids in areas of high-use (e. g. High <b>Plains,</b> <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plains,</b> and Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes). Approximately 10 bobwhites were collected from three field sites in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, for a total of 61 birds. Neonicotinoid compounds were detected in trace amounts in the livers of seven quail, including samples from all three field sites and both collecting periods. Signs of testicular degeneration (n = 2) and lipid-type hepatocellular vacuolation (n= 8) were consistent with known results of neonicotinoid intoxication. Overall, we identified evidence of bobwhite exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, and our statistical analysis indicates that neonicotinoid use may be contributing to quail decline in some ecoregions in Texas...|$|R
