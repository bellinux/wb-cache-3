Controlling the Fe layer thickness allowed {{modification of the}} hysteresis loops from rigid magnet with <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> to exchange-spring like magnet with parallel magnetization due to the nanoscale soft/hard interface coupling. For rigid magnetic films, the magnetization was reversed at a single switching field and interpreted by the two-spin model. In an exchange-spring like film, the in-plane magnetization reversal process was in two-steps and resulted from domain wall nucleation and propagation from the Fe layer into the FePt layer...|$|E

A dominant <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> component in the as-deposited state of thinner films was observed due to high magnetoelastic anisotropy energy which arises from stresses induced at the substrate-film interface.

Thermal annealing at elevated temperature revealed a significant influence on the magnetization state of the FineMET thin films and controlled annealing steps leads to ultra-soft magnetic properties, making these thin films alloys ideal {{for a wide range}} of applications...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMagnetization {{excitation}} and reversal {{induced by}} spin-transfer torques {{is described in}} terms of power received or dissipated in a macrospin system. This approach provides a clear and intuitive understanding of the effect of both applied magnetic fields and injected spin-polarized currents on magnetization reversal. It is illustrated by solving the case of magnetization reversal in a nanopillar spin valve with <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetizations</b> although the approach can be applied more generally. The appearance of critical currents below which spin-transfer torque is no longer efficient is explained by a break in the uniaxial symmetry of such structures...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic torques {{generated}} through spin-orbit coupling promise energy-efficient spintronic devices. It {{is important}} for applications to control these torques so that they switch films with <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetizations</b> without an external magnetic field. One suggested approach uses magnetic trilayers in which the torque on the top magnetic layer can be manipulated by changing the magnetization of the bottom layer. Spin currents generated in the bottom magnetic layer or its interfaces transit the spacer layer and exert a torque on the top magnetization. Here we demonstrate field-free switching in such structures and attribute it to a novel spin current generated at the interface between the bottom layer and the spacer layer. The measured torque has a distinct dependence on the bottom layer magnetization {{which is consistent with}} this interface-generated spin current but not the anticipated bulk effects. This other interface-generated spin-orbit torque will enable energy-efficient control of spintronic devices. Comment: 35 pages (main text + supplementary information...|$|R

This wall contains two kinds of magnetic vortex structures: “circular vortex” and “antivortex. ” At the cores of both vortices, the existence of a spot with <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> has been theoretically predicted. We have detected the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> spots at each vortex core and identified the direction of it by applying magnetic force microscopy imaging to cross-tie walls in patterned rectangular thin permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20) films.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the reversal process of <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> in thin layers of the ferromagnetic semiconductor Ga 1 -xMnxAs. For this investigation we have purposely chosen Ga 1 -xMnxAs with a low Mn concentration (x ~ 0. 02), since in such specimens contributions of cubic and uniaxial anisotropy parameters are comparable, allowing us to identify the role of both types of anisotropy in the magnetic reversal process. As a first step we have systematically mapped out the angular dependence of ferromagnetic resonance in thin Ga 1 -xMnxAs layers, which is a highly effective tool for obtaining the magnetic anisotropy parameters of the material. The process of <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> reversal was then studied by magneto-transport (i. e., Hall effect and planar Hall effect measurements). These measurements enable us to observe coherent spin rotation and non-coherent spin switching between the (100) and (010) planes. A model is proposed to explain the observed multi-step spin switching. The agreement of the model with experiment indicates {{that it can be}} reliably used for determining magnetic anisotropy parameters from magneto-transport data. An interesting characteristic of <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> reversal in Ga 1 -xMnxAs with low x is the appearance of a double hysteresis loops in the magnetization data. This double-loop behavior can be understood by generalizing the proposed model to include the processes of domain nucleation and expansion...|$|E
40|$|In ultrathin films, {{the energy}} {{competition}} between the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and the in-plane magnetostatic coupling can originate stripe domains. In such systems, the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> component has a periodic modulation, pointing alternately upwards and downwards as the stripes are crossed. A measurement technique that is widely used to study these kind of domains is the magnetic force microscopy (MFM). As known, the MFM signal cannot be related immediately to the sample magnetization and {{the interpretation of the}} results is not always straightforward. Therefore, the achievement of a reliable contrast model for this technique in simple specific cases that could be directly compared with experimental results is highly desirable. In this paper, a first-principle model of the MFM contrast in the case of 1 D magnetic nanostructures is proposed. An immediate application of the model pertains to the study of ultrathin films with <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization...</b>|$|E

The (001) oriented L 1 (0) FePt film was obtained when annealed by rapid thermal process at 800 degrees C and a Fe layer was deposited {{at room temperature}} with thicknesses of 2 rim to 20 rim. Controlling the Fe layer thickness allowed modification of the hysteresis loops from out-of-plane rigid magnet to in-plane exchange-spring like magnet due to the nanometer scale interface coupling. When the Fe layer thickness increased to 2 nm, the out-of-plane coercivity is reduced to 5. 9 kOe but the remanence ratio (0. 98) is still high. The Fe (2 nm) /FePt film shows <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> with linear in-plane hysteresis loop. The remanence ratio is reduced to 0. 85 when the Fe layer thickness increased to 5 rim.

40|$|Spin Hall effect (SHE) induced {{reversal}} of <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetization</b> has attracted significant interest, {{due to its}} potential to lead to low power memory and logic devices. However, the switching requires an assisted in-plane magnetic field, which hampers its practical applications. Here, we introduce a novel approach for external-field-free spin Hall switching of a perpendicular nanomagnet by utilizing a local dipolar field arising from an adjacent in-plane magnetic layer. Robust switching of perpendicular CoFeB nanopillars in a dipole-coupled composite stack is experimentally demonstrated {{in the absence of}} any external magnetic field, in consistent with the results of micromagnetic simulation. Large in-plane compensation field of about 135 Oe and out-of-plane loop shift of about 45 Oe / 10 7 A cm- 2 are obtained in the nanopillar devices with composite structure. By performing micromagnetic simulations, we confirm the composite external-field-free switching strategy can also work for a 10 x 10 nm 2 circular pillar.
