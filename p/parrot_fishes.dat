5000|$|Coral sand is a {{collection}} of sand of particles originating in tropical and sub-tropical marine environments from bioerosion of limestone skeletal material of marine organisms. One example of this process is that of <b>parrot</b> <b>fishes</b> which bite off pieces of coral, digest the living tissue, and excrete the inorganic component as silt and sand. However, the term [...] "coral" [...] in coral sand is used loosely in this sense to mean limestone of recent biological origin; corals are not the dominant contributors of sand particles to most such deposits. Rather, remnant skeletal fragments of foraminifera, calcareous algae, molluscs, and crustaceans can predominate. Because it is composed of limestone, coral sand is acid-soluble.|$|E

The majority are taken in traps and nets, some by spearing, fewer on lines. The flesh of even the largest is delicate and tasty, mostly eaten fresh as it is not easily preserved.

In British territories, however, they are eagerly sought by the Whites. It has been stated that in some parts <b>Parrot</b> <b>fishes</b> are toxic, {{but as far as}} could be ascertained no species are ever unwholesome in East Africa or north of Madagascar to Seychelles. It is only in certain specific cases that laymen and even the native fishermen are able to distinguish individual species of <b>Parrot</b> <b>fishes.</b> Most species are more or less lumped together as “Parrots” with prefixes such as “Green” or “Red. ” To the native fishermen they are known as follows: Red Sea to Suez, “Harid”; Somaliland, “Jello” or “Ponno”; Kenya to North Mozambique, “Pono”; Seychelles and vicinity, “KAKATOI”; Mauritius, “KAKATOI” or “GATEAU,” some species characterised more closely by descriptive adjectives.

40|$|Extract] In his {{preface to}} a special issue (and {{dedicated}} workshop) on the biology of butterflyfishes, Motta (1989) suggested that butterflyfishes have received disproportionate scientific attention compared to other common and conspicuous families of coral reef fishes. In support of this assertion, the number of scientific publications that consider butterflyfishes (151 Web of Knowledge; 382 publications since 1927) is far greater than for many other families of nominal reef fishes (e. g., angelfishes, surgeonfishes, and rabbitfishes); the only families that have been more intensively studied are the Pomacentridae (damselfishes), Serranidae (groupers) and Labridae (<b>parrot</b> <b>fishes</b> and wrasses), which probably reflects their high diversity, commercial and functional importance, respectively. In this respect, research on butterflyfishes has contributed greatly to genera l understanding of the biology and ecology of coral reef fishes (e. g., Almany et al., 2007; Lawton et al., 2011). The fields of research in which butterflyfishes have played essential roles also extends well beyond the notion that butterflyfishes are "indicators" of overall reef health, which is the usual justification for studying this relatively unique group of reef fishes (e. g., Ohman et al., 1998; Bozec et al., 2005; Shokri et al., 2005) ...|$|E

Accordingly the knowledge on the mature condition and spawning season of the fish is immediately required. The present paper is dealt with the annual changes of ovarian eggs together with the gonad index of the fish. The results are summarized as follows. 1) The maturity of gonad begins to appear in the males partly of one year old fish, while in the females partly of two years old fish. 2) The spermatozoa release is usually observed during half a month or a month prior to the ovary maturation. 3) The gonad maturity of the Japanese <b>parrot</b> <b>fish</b> is largely depended on the changes of water, temperature. Most of the fish can be attained to maturity when water temperature rised up to 20 ℃. 4) When an ovary is consisted of only the immature eggs, the frequency distribution of egg diameter is indicated by a single mode, while in the ovary with ripe eggs the frequency distribution changes to bimodal. In the latter case, the ovarian eggs are obviously separated into two groups of the transparent ripe eggs and the opaque inmature ones. 5) The annual changes of gonad index well agree with the mature condition of gonad. Judged from the observations above mentioned, the spawning season of the Japanese <b>parrot</b> <b>fish</b> is considered to last from Mav to July with some annual variations.
