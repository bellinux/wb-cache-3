40|$|An {{increasing}} number of application systems can be characterized by their requirement to process sequences of events in real-time. These sequences are principally of constant rate, but may vary within given limits. Hence, several <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> that seem to differ only slightly have been proposed to describe such sequences. This includes the <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> used in the Tenet Protocol Suite, in the traffic description of an ATM connection, and in the model of linear bounded arrival processes (LBAP) for transferring continuous media. The existence of several <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> raises the question {{whether or not the}} <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> differ in principle or in notation only. To answer this question, the paper proposes a generalized model for jitter constrained periodic streams.

The VEPS model contends that <b>parameters</b> are <b>set</b> early. The Variational model supposes that children employ statistical learning mechanisms to decide among competing parameter values, so this model anticipates delays in <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> when critical input is sparse, and gradual <b>setting</b> of <b>parameters.</b> On the Structured Acquisition model, delays occur because parameters form a hierarchy, with higher-level <b>parameters</b> <b>set</b> before lower-level <b>parameters.</b> Assuming that children freely choose the initial value, children sometimes will mis-set parameters.

30|$|<b>Parameter</b> <b>setting</b> {{currently}} {{ranks among}} the most actively researched topics in the evolutionary algorithm (EA) community. This {{can be explained by}} the major impact EA parameters have on search performance. However, <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> has been shown to be both problem dependent and evolution dependent. Moreover, because parameters interact in complex ways, developing an efficient and beneficial <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> approach is not an easy feat, and no broadly recognized solution has emerged to date. In this paper, we borrow the notion of parameter adaptation with the objective of addressing the <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> dependencies mentioned above, using a strategy based on a Bayesian network. The adaptive framework is elaborated for a steady-state genetic algorithm (SSGA) to control nine parameters. To judge parameter state productivities, we consider the population’s fitness improvement, as well as exploration/exploitation balance management. The performance of this proposal, a Bayesian network for genetic algorithm parameter adaptation (BNGA), is assessed based on the CEC’ 05 benchmark. BNGA is compared to a static <b>parameter</b> <b>setting,</b> a naïve approach, three common adaptive systems (PM, AP, and FAUC–RMAB), and two state-of-the-art EAs (CMA-ES and G-CMA-ES). Our results statistically demonstrate that the performance of BNGA is equivalent to that of FAUC–RMAB, CMA-ES, and G-CMA-ES, and overall is superior to that of all the other SSGA <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> approaches. However, these results also reveal that all the approaches considered have great difficulty finding global optima in a multimodal problem set. This suggests a lack of complementarity and/or synergy among parameter states.|$|R
40|$|When {{modeling}} a neuron, modelers often {{focus on}} the values of parameters that produce a desired output. However, if these parameters are not unique, {{there could be a}} number of <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> that produce the same output. Thus, even though the values of the various maximum conductances, half activation voltages and so on differ, as a set they can produce the same spike height, firing rates, and so forth. To examine whether or not <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> are unique, a 3 -compartment motoneuron model was created that has 15 target outputs and 59 parameters. Using parameter searches, over one hundred <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> were created for this model that produced the same output (within tolerances). Parameter values vary between <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> and indicate that the parameter values are not unique. In addition, some parameters are more tightly constrained than others. Principal component analysis is used to examine the dimensionality of the input and output spaces. However, neurons are more than static output generators. For example, a variety of neuromodulatory influences are known to shift parameter values to alter neuronal output. Thus the question arises as to whether this non-uniqueness extends from model outputs to the models sensitivities to its parameters. In this work, the non-unique <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> are further analyzed using sensitivity analyses and output correlations to show that these values vary significantly between these <b>parameter</b> <b>sets.</b> Therefore, each of these models will react to parameter variation differently. This work concludes that <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> are non-unique but have varying sensitivity analyses and output correlations. The ramifications of this are discussed for both modelers and neuroscientists. M. S. Committee Member: Dr. Astrid Prinz; Committee Member: Dr. Robert H. Lee; Committee Member: Dr. Robert J.
