50|$|Knowing {{the amino}} acid {{sequence}} of peptides from a <b>protein</b> <b>digest</b> is essential to study the biological function of the protein. In the old days, this was accomplished by the Edman degradation procedure. Today, analysis by a tandem mass spectrometer is a more common method to solve the sequencing of peptides. Generally, there are two approaches: database search and de novo sequencing. Database search is a simple version as the mass spectra data of the unknown peptide is submitted and run to find a match with a known peptide sequence, the peptide with the highest matching score will be selected. This approach fails to recognize novel peptides since it can only match to existing sequences in the database. De novo sequencing is an assignment of fragment ions from a mass spectrum. Different algorithmsare used for interpretation and most instruments come with de novo sequencing programs.|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} in tryptophanase activity in various conditions was examined in Pasteurella multocida. These experiments suggest strongly that an {{increase in}} tryptophanase activity dependent on the supply of an inducer and amino acids is based upon induced synthesis of the enzyme protein. Effects of beef extract, <b>protein</b> <b>digest</b> or vitamin mixture on tryptophanase induction by cells grown in broth were only slight. On the other hand the situation in tryptophanase induction by cells subjected to starvation was different from that by cells grown in broth in several points; starved cells were not capable of forming the enzyme {{in the presence of}} an inducer and amino acids, but could produce the enzyme completely depending on the addition of beef extract. Also, glucose possessed an ability to provoke of enzyme induction in such starved cells, although to a small extent.

The surface modifier gave rapid and repeatable separations of peptides, <b>proteins</b> and <b>protein</b> <b>digests</b> at acidic pH for more than 4 h of continuous use.

Monolithic-capillary columns prepared by copolymerizing styrene with divinylbenzene {{are used to}} achieve high-resolution separation of peptides from <b>protein</b> <b>digests.</b> This separation is performed with minimal sample preparation directly from the 2 -D liquid fractionation of the cell lysate. The monolithic column separation is directly interfaced to ESI-TOF  14 MS to obtain a peptide map. The <b>protein</b> <b>digests</b> were also analyzed by MALDI-TOF  14 MS and an accurate M r of the intact protein was obtained using an HPLC-ESI-TOF  14 MS. The result is that these techniques provide complementary information where nearly complete sequence coverage of the protein is obtained and {{can be compared to}} the experimental M r value. The high sequence coverage provides information on isoforms and other post-translational modifications that would not be available from methods that result in low sequence coverage. The results from the use of monolithic columns are compared to that obtained by CE-MS. The monolithic column separations provide a rugged and highly reproducible method for separating <b>protein</b> <b>digests</b> prior to MS analysis and is suited to confidently identify biomarkers associated with cancer progression...|$|R

The marriage and the interface in-between high-resolutionchromatographic separation and mass spectrometry have been a critical part ofthe development of large-scale protein analysis. Today, the mass spectrometerhas become the real workhorse for protein sequencing and proteindeterminations.|$|E

40|$|Reversible protein {{phosphorylation}} {{ranks among}} the most important post-translational modifications that occurs in the cell. It is therefore highly relevant to elucidate the phosphorylation states of a given biological system,[*]albeit challenging. Most notably the often low stoichiometry of phosphorylation is inherently incompatible with standard LC-MS analysis of a complex <b>protein</b> <b>digest</b> mixture, primarily due to the relative low dynamic range of current mass analyzers. Therefore a need for specific enrichment of phosphorylated peptides or proteins exists. Significant progress surrounding the biochemical analysis of reversible protein phosphorylation in the past years has {{led to the development of}} several new techniques to isolate or enrich phosphopeptides, particularly in large-scale analyses.

40|$|Amino {{acids and}} <b>protein</b> <b>digests</b> {{are being used}} to provide more {{adequate}} nutrition to many patients. We report here tolerance tests to the intravenous injection into dogs of certain amino acid and digest preparations. Parenteral feeding of protein-building materials has been shown valuable for those who cannot take sufficient protein orally (5, 3, 1). For greatest benefit such solutions should be well tolerated and convenient to administer as well as well utilized. We find that certain mixtures of crystalline amino acids are well tolerated, whereas the <b>protein</b> <b>digests</b> tested must be given fairly slowly to avoid such reactions as vomiting. We have shown in an earlier report that the amino acid solutions are fully as well utilized on rapid injection as are the digest solutions upon slow injection (6). The saving in inconvenience to patient and doctor by more rapid injection is therefore at no cost in utilization. Such amino acid solutions have proven their value in human patients (1, I 0). We find that one amino acid, namely glutamic acid, is particularly likely to induce vomiting if included in the amino acid mixtures. The usual digests of casein possess a large content of glutamic acid, which may largely account for their lower tolerance. It is of further interest that addition of glycine to certain mixtures of the ten growth essential (Rose) amino acids improves tolerance. Good utilization of certain amino acid mixtures for blood plasma and hemoglobin formation, as well as positive nitrogen balance, has been previously reported (6, 11, 7). Certain <b>protein</b> <b>digests</b> have also been shown to be well utilized when given parenterally (4, 8, 11, 7), but their lower tolerance calls for improvement. Serious reactions apparently seldom if ever occur during the use of proper mixtures of amino acids or of <b>protein</b> <b>digests,</b> in contrast to the toxicities reported (2, 9) to injection of unnatural or large quantities of certain individual amino acids...|$|R

This results in a 30 times enhanced MALDI-TOF MS signal for a model peptide, allowing a significant improvement of the detection sensitivity limit (down to few tens of attomoles). Moreover, positive detection can be achieved from sub-nanomolar peptides solutions and better overall protein sequence coverages are obtained from few tens attomoles of <b>protein</b> <b>digest.</b> These results make DMF-MALDI a promising approach {{for the treatment of}} peptides samples as well as a key component for an integrated approach in the proteomic field...|$|E

40|$|Proteome {{complexity}} {{presents a}} major challenge {{in the field of}} proteomics. The majority of bottom-up methods begin with proteolysis, which increases the number of analytes in the mixture by about 30 - 50 fold. This level of complexity demands simplification, and there is an increasing requirement for strategies and reagents that reduce the complexity of a total proteome mixture. It may be argued that when analysing a complete <b>protein</b> <b>digest,</b> for instance by standard shotgun methods, more peptides are analysed than strictly necessary. An efficient proteomic strategy simplifies the proteome while preserving most of the information necessary for comprehensive analysis. A practical approach to proteome simplification is to target a specific structural region of the protein molecule.

These ten amino acids are as effective in plasma protein production,when given by vein as by mouth, and in many periods of 1 to 6 weeks as the sole source of protein derivatives maintained health and nitrogen equilibrium (Tables 1 and 2).
