40|$|This paper {{examines}} the logic behind the efficient feeding of grazing dairy cows {{with the objective}} of improving on-farm productivity. Efficient utilisation of feeds by grazing dairy cows requires a detailed knowledge and understanding of feed budgeting principles, based on an understanding of seasonal <b>pasture</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>pasture</b> accumulation rates, nutritive characteristics of the pasture consumed, relationships between allowance of <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> <b>pasture</b> intake, <b>and</b> interactions between <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> supplementary feeds.

30|$|The pastoralists in Baringo District of Kenya {{are mainly}} {{transhumance}} pastoralists, and they exemplify communities in ASALs that {{are dependent on}} livestock for their livelihood. Traditionally, they move seasonally from their home bases and drive their herds to places with <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> water {{and come back to}} their homesteads in other seasons when pasture improves. Of all the livestock kept by the Baringo pastoralists, cattle are regarded highly. Because of the importance attached to cattle, {{there is a tendency to}} accumulate them even under unfavourable environmental conditions, often exerting a lot of pressure on the meagre range resources, notably <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> water. Inevitably, there is competition amongst pastoralists in the district for the available range resources, necessitating frequent livestock movements within the range in search of <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> water (Raikes 1981). The occurrence of frequent droughts in ASALs, perhaps a manifestation of climate change, contributes to range resource shortages, leading to intense competition for the available <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> water. Thus, mobility remains the key pastoral risk management strategy during times of <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> water shortage. (Little et al. (2001)) point out that pastoralists who migrate with their herds during climatic disasters have considerably fewer livestock losses than those who do not. However, this mobility in itself causes conflict among the pastoralists due to competition for scarce <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> water.|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} {{typically}} found growing solitary or in groups on lawns, mulch, <b>pastures,</b> <b>and</b> open woods. A North American field guide notes an association with apple orchards and cornfields.|$|E
5|$|Further south, in Victoria and New South Wales, {{rainfall}} {{is spread}} more evenly {{throughout the year}} and the driest season lasts from December to May. At this time, southern populations congregate in inland flocking areas which include upland marshes, the edges of reservoirs and lakes, <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> agricultural land. When rain arrives in June and July, they disperse to the coastal freshwater marshes, shallow lakes, wet meadows and other wetlands where they breed.|$|E
5|$|Saproamanita thiersii inhabits lawns, <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> prairies {{throughout}} the Mississippi River Basin. It often forms fairy rings or arcs but also sometimes fruits as isolated specimens. It {{has been found}} growing in the same lawn as Chlorophyllum molybdites. Analysis using stable carbon isotopes has proved that this mushroom is saprotrophic in nature, unlike the other mycorrhizal Amanitas.|$|E

30|$|<b>Pasture</b> <b>and</b> water {{conflicts}} {{have long}} {{been part of the}} socio-cultural pattern of the pastoral communities in Kenya. The communal land ownership tenure system mostly evident in pastoralist areas provides everyone an equal right of exploiting the resources. The lands are traditional tribal grazing areas, such that migration in search of <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> water by one tribe into areas that belong to other tribes often causes conflict between pastoralists. Besides, livestock movements into grazing lands and watering points that stretch into crop-growing areas also result in conflicts (Dietz 1987). Over time however, <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> water around the settled areas steadily decreases, leading to emaciation and loss of livestock. Traditionally, whenever scarcity of <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> water or disease depleted a community's livestock, it often sought to replenish numbers through raiding/rustling (Mkutu 2000).|$|R

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is native {{only to the}} eastern United States, congregating in colonies that often consist of fewer than 20individuals. They prefer {{calcareous}} wetlands (areas containing lime), including meadows, bogs, marshes, and spring seeps, that have both wet and dry regions. Their habitat is often {{on the edge of}} woods. Bog turtles have sometimes been seen in cow <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> near beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{percent of the}} Abrahams Creek {{watershed}} is rural and 20 percent is urbanized. The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the urbanization. Its upper reaches contain second-growth forest, small patches of residential land, linear hedgerows, and agricultural land such as hay pastures, <b>pastures,</b> <b>and</b> farmland. The Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep to be developed, but many {{other areas of the}} watershed could easily be urbanized. The mining-affected land in the watershed is in West Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the global}} {{challenges}} of mitigating and alleviating land degradation and ensuring food security, particularly through protein production, <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> forage science together with rangeland science will remain imperative to sustainable livestock production systems. Recognising the scientific principles developed in this discipline the past 50 {{years and more}} in Southern Africa, customary to our diverse and unique environmental conditions will continue to guide and identify future research priorities. A journey from the past to the present can assist in avoiding reinvention <b>and</b> repetition of <b>pasture</b> research. This review highlights how research priorities have either remained the same over time or where research has received less or more priority. The review further illustrates {{that there has been}} more interest in species adaptation to drought, <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> forage water relations, alternative <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> forage species, and the combination of pasture species in the 21 st century than in the 20 th century. In conclusion, the soil–plant– livestock complex can serve as a conceptual basis for more effective research together with <b>pasture</b> breeding <b>and</b> nutrition. Finally, researching <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> forage sciences in an inter- and multi-disciplinary manner clearly supports the principles of holism applied by General JC Smuts, one of the first pioneers of <b>pasture</b> <b>and</b> forage sciences.

5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} a {{permanent}} resident throughout its range, although birds at the extreme north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, its range stretches to central Chile and Argentina. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or brush. It {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, <b>pastures,</b> <b>and</b> heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.|$|E
5|$|The third {{biological}} control agent to target Neoscapteriscus in Florida was the South American nematode Steinernema scapterisci. Small-scale releases proved it could persist for years in mole-cricket-infested sandy Florida soils. Its use as a biopesticide against Neoscapteriscus was patented, making it attractive to industry. Industrial-scale production on artificial diet allowed large-scale trial applications in <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> on golf courses, which succeeded in establishing populations in several counties, and these populations spread, but sales were disappointing, and the product was withdrawn from the market in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} (Cathartes aura), also known in some North American regions as the turkey buzzard (or just buzzard), {{and in some}} areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow, is the most {{widespread}} of the New World vultures. One of three species in the genus Cathartes of the family Cathartidae, the turkey vulture ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America.

Although requirements vary, overall {{there is a}} preference for acidic soils, although some species will grow on limestone. Narcissus scaberulus will grow on granite soils where it is moist in the growing season but dry in the summer, while Narcissus dubius thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus are eurychoric; {{they have}} a {{widespread}} geographic distribution in many different climates, but they are usually found in dry and mesic habitats. They {{are referred to as}} a tropical genus, but the type specimen was collected from temperate Sydney. They are found in sclerophyll woodland and forests, eucalypt woodland, Casuarina forests, mallee, hillsides, beaches and urban areas. These ants are arboreal ants and nests are located in bark, logs, rotten wood, sand, soil, under rocks and stones, tree stumps and twigs or branches. In urban areas, colonies are found under cracked paths, inside house walls or in patio areas. Some species are considered pests, and they forage into <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> houses where they show a preference for fluids and sweets. Ochetellus flavipes nesting habits are unique among Australian ants, and they construct small runways across the ground. These nests are structurally similar to nests built by some Polyrhachis ants, which construct platforms woven from plants that house the Hemiptera insects they attend to.|$|E
5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> wet woodland. Species of {{conservation}} concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely to}} benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus).
