Flux tube experiments can be classified by the flux tube’s evolution in a configuration space described by a normalized inverse aspect-ratio k̄ and current-to-magnetic flux ratio λ̄. A lengthening current-carrying magnetic flux tube traverses this k̄ - λ̄ space and crosses stability boundaries. We derive a single general criterion for {{the onset of the}} sausage and kink instabilities in idealized magnetic flux tubes with core and skin currents. The criterion indicates a dependence of the stability boundaries on current profiles and shows overlapping kink and sausage unstable regions in the k̄ - λ̄ space with two free parameters. Numerical investigation of the stability criterion reduces the number of free parameters to a single one that describes the current profile, and confirms the overlapping sausage and kink unstable regions in k̄ - λ̄ space. A lengthening, ideal current-carrying magnetic flux tube can therefore become sausage unstable after it becomes kink unstable.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Objective The {{objective of this}} study was to report the serum concentration of lignocaine after <b>pertubation</b> in patients with endometriosis. Design Prospective observational study. Setting The study was carried out at a gynaecological outpatient unit in Stockholm, Sweden. Population Eligible patients had endometriosis with a dysmenorrhoic pain score of[50 mm on a visual analogue scale, and patent fallopian tubes. Methods Patients with endometriosis (n = 25) were included in the study. The patients received pre-ovulatory pertubations with lignocaine hydrochloride 10 mg (n = 16) or ringer acetate (placebo, n = 9). The procedure comprised passing the study solution through the uterus and the fallopian tubes via an intra-cervical balloon cath-eter. Serum samples were collected at 0, 5, 15 and 30 min after <b>pertubation.</b> Main Outcome Measures The serum samples were ana-lysed for the concentration of lignocaine with an LCMS-SIM method. Results Low levels of lignocaine were detected in the serum samples following <b>pertubation</b> of 10 mg lignocaine hydrochloride. The highest observed concentration was seen after 30 min (mean 0. 050 lg/ml), with an individual maximum of 0. 124 lg/ml. Maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) could not be calculated, since the highest values were observed in the 30 -min samples, which was the last sample obtained. Lignocaine was not detected after <b>pertubation</b> with placebo. Conclusions The serum levels of lignocaine following <b>pertubation</b> of 10 mg lignocaine hydrochloride are detect-able but low. Lignocaine pertubated through the fallopian tubes reaches the peritoneal cavity and diffuses through the peritoneum into the blood circulation. <b>Pertubation</b> with lignocaine is safe and has no lignocaine-related adverse events. ...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{generalization}} of the Madelung transformation, we derive the hydrodynamic {{representation of the}} Klein-Gordon-Einstein equations in the weak field limit. We consider a complex self-interacting scalar field with a λ|φ|^ 4 potential. We study {{the evolution of the}} homogeneous background in the fluid representation and derive the linearized equations describing the evolution of small perturbations in a static and in an expanding universe. We compare the results with simplified models in which the gravitational potential is introduced by hand in the Klein-Gordon equation, and assumed to satisfy a (generalized) Poisson equation. We study the evolution of the perturbations in the matter era using the nonrelativistic limit of our formalism. Perturbations whose wavelength is below the Jeans length oscillate in time while <b>pertubations</b> whose wavelength is above the Jeans length grow linearly with the scale factor as in the cold dark matter model. The growth of perturbations in the scalar field model is substantially faster than in the cold dark matter model. When the wavelength of the <b>pertubations</b> approaches the cosmological horizon (Hubble length), a relativistic treatment is mandatory. In that case, we find that relativistic effects attenuate or even prevent the growth of <b>pertubations.</b> This paper exposes the general formalism and provides illustrations in simple cases.
