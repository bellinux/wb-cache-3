When warmed with mineral acid, limonene isomerizes to the conjugated diene α-terpinene (which {{can also}} easily {{be converted to}} <b>p-cymene).</b> Evidence for this isomerization includes the formation of Diels-Alder adducts between α-terpinene adducts and maleic anhydride.|$|E
25|$|Cumin's {{distinctive}} flavour is strong. It has a warm aroma due to {{its essential}} oil content. Its main constituent aroma compounds are cuminaldehyde (a promising agent against alpha-synuclein aggregation) and cuminic alcohol. Other important aroma compounds of toasted cumin are the substituted pyrazines, 2-ethoxy-3-isopropylpyrazine, 2-methoxy-3-sec-butylpyrazine, and 2-methoxy-3-methylpyrazine.

25|$|Epazote {{essential}} oil contains ascaridole (up to 70%), limonene, <b>p-cymene,</b> and smaller amounts of numerous other monoterpenes and monoterpene derivatives (α-pinene, myrcene, terpinene, thymol, camphor and trans-isocarveol). Ascaridole (1,4-peroxido-p-menth-2-ene) is rather an uncommon constituent of spices; another plant owing {{much of its}} character to this monoterpene peroxide is boldo. Ascaridole is toxic and has a pungent, not very pleasant flavor; in pure form, it is an explosive sensitive to shock.

F occidentalis adult females, first- and second-instar larvae and eggs were exposed for 2, 24 and 48 h to combinations of three <b>p-cymene</b> doses and two carbon dioxide levels (ambient, 10 %). Additional experiments were conducted on F occidentalis adult females with lower carbon dioxide levels (ambient, 2 %, 4 %, 6 %) applied in combination with <b>p-cymene.</b> Combined applications of <b>p-cymene</b> and carbon dioxide were found to increase significantly the fumigant toxicity of <b>p-cymene</b> against both adult female and larval thrips, but not thrips eggs.
