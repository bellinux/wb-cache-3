40|$|Sensory pleasures derive {{primarily}} from the contact senses that cover the body surface and the body apertures. It is proposed that, by the processes of preadaptation and increased accessibility, the subjective and expressive aspect of this <b>pleasure</b> <b>system</b> is, in later evolution and development, extended to {{a wider range of}} pleasure elicitors, including aesthetic and mastery pleasures. Many basic principles of hedonic systems may be studied in the more primitive sensory <b>pleasure</b> <b>system.</b> These include the properties of context dependence and the mappings between remembered, experienced, and anticipated pleasures. Pleasure in the food domain is specifically considered, including the elicitors of pleasure, the role of context, and the acquisition of likes and dislikes (hedonic changes). Special attention is paid to hedonic reversals, in which innately negative sensory hedonic responses become positive (for example, the case of chili pepper). It is argued that on the input/appraisal side, basic sensory pleasures are qualitatively different from aesthetic pleasures (such as music), but that both feed into the same subjective/expressive system. Some basic features of sensory pleasures are listed. Rozin-Pleasure and preadaptatio...|$|E
40|$|Consumption of sugar-sweetened {{beverages}} (SSBs) {{is considered}} to be a contributor to diabetes and the epidemic of obesity in many countries. The popularity of non-caloric carbonated soft drinks as an alternative to SSBs may be a factor in reducing the health risks associated with SSBs consumption. This study focuses on the perceptual discrimination of SSBs from artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs). 55 college students rated 14 commercially available carbonated soft drinks in terms of sweetness and likeability. They were also asked to recognize if the drinks contained sugar or a non-caloric artificial sweetener. Overall, participants showed poor accuracy in discriminating drinks’ sweeteners, with significantly lower accuracy for SSBs than ASBs. Interestingly, we found a dissociation between sweetener recognition and drink pleasantness. In fact, in spite of a chance-level discrimination accuracy of SSBs, their taste was systematically preferred to the taste of non-caloric beverages. Our findings support the idea that hedonic value of carbonated soft drinks is dissociable from its identification and that the activation of the <b>pleasure</b> <b>system</b> seems not to require explicit recognition of the sweetener contained in the soft drink. We hypothesize that preference for carbonated soft drinks containing sugar over non-caloric alternatives might be modulated by metabolic factors that are independent from conscious and rational consumers’ choices...|$|E
40|$|Self-injurious {{behavior}} (SIB) is {{a primary}} reason that individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) are either retained in restrictive environments or are administered psychotropic medication. There are no known causes and no universally accepted treatments for this complex behavior among individuals with NDD. There is developing evidence, however, that individuals exhibiting SIB have a disturbance of the opiate-mediated pain and <b>pleasure</b> <b>system.</b> One hypothesis is that SIB reflects insensitivity to pain and general sensory depression (hypoalgesia), perhaps related to chronic elevation of endogenous opiates. For instance, many self-injurious individuals do not exhibit the usual signs of pain after their “injurious” behavior. Moreover, for some individuals the addictive properties of elevated endogenous opiates (euphoria) {{may be responsible for}} maintaining their SIB. In this perspective, SIB may be viewed as an addiction because it supplies the "fix" for tolerant, down-regulated opiate receptors. Reports that levels of endogenous opiates at rest and after SIB episodes predict positive responses to opiate blockers (e. g., naltrexone) provide further support for opiate-mediated SIB and form the basis for a rational treatment strategy. Although the long term effects of opiate blockers on SIB are unknown, reduction in SIB following acute treatment provides support that a specific biological system may be dysregulated in a subgroup of patients. It is concluded that naltrexone produces a clinically significant reduction in the serious and life-threatening behavior of self injury for individuals who have not been responsive to any other type of treatment. Several suggestions and cautions are provided for regimens of naltrexone treatment of SIB...|$|E

40|$|The introduction, in 1997, of the Crimes (Menta/Impairment and Unfitness to be Tried) Act 1997 (Vic) (CMIA) marked {{dramatic}} {{legal and}} procedural {{changes to the}} common law system governing the post-acquittal detention of persons found {{not guilty by reason}} of insanity in Victoria which had endured for almost 200 years. The CMIA's express aim to restore the balance between community safety and the rights of persons found {{not guilty by reason of}} mental impairment (NGRMI) (as the verdict of insanity is now known), which, under the inflexible and opaque processes of the Governor's <b>Pleasure</b> <b>system,</b> had tipped too far in favour of the community, was lauded by the legislature and the courts. However, the absence of a comprehensive evaluation of the CMIA's operation has meant that the extent to which the CMIA has fulfilled its charter in the ensuing years has been unclear. Additionally and in contrast to the body of knowledge that surrounds insanity acquittees in overseas jurisdictions, comparatively little empirical information exists about NGRMI acquittees in Australia. The present study redresses this lack of empirical knowledge regarding the operation of the CMIA and the mental impairment defence by amassing an extensive body of data from which a salient snapshot of NGRMI acquittees can be drawn, as well as important information regarding detention and release patterns. The study also examines the extensive body of mental health jurisprudence that has developed as a result of the transfer by the CMIA of all major decision-making power regarding the ongoing management of NGRMI acquittees from the executive to the judiciary. Given that much, if not most, of the effectiveness of the CMIA is reliant upon the way the Act is interpreted by the courts, such an analysis is integral to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the CMIA's operation. Taken together, the foci of the study combine to produce a complete picture of the effectiveness of the CMIA and the degree to which it has been successful in achieving its stated aims, as well as highlighting areas that may potentially benefit from change. Participants in the study comprised all 146 individuals who had been found NGRMI in Victoria since the enactment of the CMIA in 1997. In addition, individuals who remained in detention under the Governor's <b>Pleasure</b> <b>system</b> at the time of the inception of the CMIA (and, therefore, became subject to the CMIA's transitional provisions) were included. The study utilised an archival approach, whereby data regarding participants' socio-demographic, psychiatric and criminological characteristics were drawn from institutional files. The course taken by participants through the "staggered" system of release established by the CMIA was also mapped over time, enabling calculation of the length of time taken by acquittees to move through the various stages of the system. Consistent with prior studies, the picture of the typical NGRMI acquittee that emerged was of a disenfranchised and seriously disordered individual with a strong history of contact with psychiatric services but whose contact with the criminal justice system resulting in the verdict of NGRMI was often an isolated event. The nature of the NGRMI offence was also consistent with previous findings; the majority of NGRMI acquittees were acquitted of committing a violent act, usually murder, against a family member or close acquaintance. However, the study found that a substantial minority of cases now involve minor or non-violent offences, suggesting that the new flexibility in dispositional options available to the courts under the CMIA has rendered the NGRMI defence a more attractive option than that which existed under the Governor's <b>Pleasure</b> <b>system.</b> Indeed, the study found that there has also been a sharp and steady increase in the number of NGRMI verdicts since the introduction of the CMIA which appears to be testament to the degree to which the detention, management and release system established by the CMIA is perceived, by interested parties, to have successfully restored the balance between community safety and the rights of persons found NGRMI. However, the findings related to detention and release patterns raised serious questions as to whether this perception has been borne out in practice. In particular, in contrast to the expectation that detention times would decrease as a result of the introduction of the CMIA, the study found that time served, for many NGRMI acquittees, has actually increased under the Act. This finding suggests that the old preoccupations and anxieties regarding persons adjudged not criminally responsible by reason of mental illness remain, with the only difference being that those preoccupations are now expressed in the language of the law rather than the platitude of politics. Indeed, an examination of the judicial interpretation of the CMIA exposed a clear tendency towards protectionism rather than treatment concerns. The study proposes that this tendency has been operationalised via the courts' adoption of decision-making principles which facilitate a conservative approach to the judicial task by ensuring that the seriousness of the NGRMI offence remains at the forefront of the risk assessment process, particularly at the dispositional stage. Consequently, the court has fallen into the trap of importing an element of punishment into the dispositional process, whereby disposition is largely determined on the basis of the seriousness of the NGRMI offence with little attention paid to the treatment and management needs of the acquittee. The study argues that this judicial vetting process along NGRMI offence lines is not only contrary to the CMIA's central criterion that "restrictions on a person's freedom and personal autonomy should be kept to a minimum consistent with the safety of the community" (s 39), but is also antithetical to the philosophical purpose of the NGMRI defence which is to negate criminal responsibility and the notion of punishment. However, more positively, the results indicated that, beyond the dispositional stage, the courts are not employing an informal tariff based on the seriousness of the NGRMI offence to determine length of detention. Instead, these later decision-making stages appear to be informed by a more comprehensive examination of dangerousness which takes account of a range of risk factors peculiar to each individual acquittee. Of these factors, the findings indicated that the most significant determinants of length of detention include factors relevant to successful community reintegration (such as level of education and employment prior to the NGRMI offence and/or relationship and parental status at the time of the NGRMI offence), the location of the NGRMI offence and the presence of a history of self-harm. The constellation of these particular factors as determinative of earlier release has resulted in the emergence of two sub-groups of NGRMI acquittees- namely female acquittees and intellectually disabled acquittees- as being likely to attract an atypical response judicial response at each decision-making stage. The picture of the CMIA's operation produced by the present study clearly illustrates that, despite the dramatic reforms introduced by the CMIA to the disposition and management of NGRMI acquittees in Victoria, the fact remains that "it is more difficult for forensic patients to leave the 'public safety regime' than to enter it" (Carroll, Lyall, & Forrester, 2004, p. 410). This finding. combined with the increased attractiveness of the NGRMI defence, has resulted in considerable pressure being placed on the forensic mental health system, both operationally and fiscally. Accordingly, the study concludes with an exploration of various options for remedying the immense pressure being placed on the system, with particular attention paid to ways in which the conservative bias of the judiciary can be shifted. Alternative models for the management of NGRMI acquittees established in other jurisdictions are also examined, raising the prospect that a centralised independent review board may represent the most effective means by which to achieve a fairer balance between considerations of public safety and the rights of NGRMI acquittees...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to a in depth study {{of the notion of}} pleasure such as it appears in Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal. Focusing upon a very restraint core of poems, the analysis unfurls according to the methodic tools provided by Michael Riffaterre, literary theorician and critic, in his Semiotics of poetry. Basing myself on a shrewd selection of texts, number of which were almost completely left out by baudelairean studies, my goal was to highlight the semiotical span owned by the different illustrations of pleasure in our poet's work. Weaving significant threads, first between signs and then between the text and its intertextuality, I achieved a detailed and global canvas of <b>pleasure's</b> descriptive <b>system</b> as it underlies Les Fleurs du Mal. The analysis defines pleasure's expression as a dichotomic construction. First opposing itself to reality, then to illusion and then to danger and others, it eventually builds itself against the notion of grief through bipolarization, caught into an insolvable cycle overhung by its evanescence. Interpretation allows us to draw interesting perspectives concerning the poet's epistemological choices...|$|R

60|$|About a {{year before}} the {{beginning}} of the travels described in these letters Jonas's father died and left a comfortable little property, which placed Pomona and her husband in independent circumstances. The ideas and ambitions of this eccentric but sensible young woman enlarged with her fortune. As her daughter was now going to school, Pomona was seized with the spirit of emulation, and determined as far as was possible to make the child's education an advantage to herself. Some of the books used by the little girl at school were carefully and earnestly studied by her mother, and as Jonas joined with hearty good-will in the labors and <b>pleasures</b> of this <b>system</b> of domestic study, the family standard of education was considerably raised. In the quick-witted and observant Pomona the improvement showed itself principally in her methods of expression, and although she could not be called at the time of these travels an educated woman, she was by no means an ignorant one.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exogenous}} opioids are completely opposite to anxiety symptomatology and suggest {{the existence of}} a relationship between opioid systems and Anxiety Disorders. The involvement of opioid systems in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is suggested by its analogy with other Anxiety Disorders and by the role of such system in disorders of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum (Tourette's Disorder, Substance-Related Disorders, Eating Disorders, Impulse-Control Disorders); some experimental evidence in patients affected by OCD and the effect of therapy with opioid agonists and antagonists further support this hypothesis. The involvement of endogenous opioids in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is widely supported. Opioid involvement in Panic Disorder is suggested by pharmacological evidence, such as naltrexone-induced Panic Attacks; moreover, the opioid system may decrease activity of the locus coeruleus. Finally, patients affected by Generalized Anxiety Disorder have higher beta-endorphin plasma levels than controls, before facing stressful situations. Therefore, these data suggest a possible opioid involvement in core psychopathological aspects of OCD, related to <b>pleasure</b> and reward <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the results obtained}} {{by a series of}} tests carried out on an hydraulic actuator for a ship roll stabilizing system, suitable to be fitted on medium size <b>pleasure</b> crafts. These <b>systems</b> are constituted by 2 or 4 fins fitted on hull sides, in a proper position; the hydrodynamic forces, generated by interacting with the water flow due to ship speed, can be controlled to obtain a momentum that counteract the wave action. So reducing the effects of roll motion on people onboard and on ship structures. A full scale fin hydraulic actuator has been installed in our hydraulic test bench where an hydraulic power pack and some hydraulic valves group allow to performs various tests. Reproducing the dynamic behaviour of the fin actuator system it is possible to evaluate the influence of some hydraulic component (i. e. a proportional valve) on the system performance and the feasibility of the adoption of less expensive components. Moreover an hydraulic accumulator has been added to the plant in order to improve the fin actuation speed and to reduce the pressure spikes in order to reduce hydraulic noise. In fact noise reduction represents a very important aspect onboard pleasure boats, where every effort is made to assure a high comfort level to passengers; in particular, noise is important when the boat is anchored and the fins work; in that condition the propulsion engines are stopped, the gensets are generally well insulated, and the hydrodynamic noise is absent because the speed is zero, so the stabilizing plant {{is one of the main}} noise source onboard, with the air conditioning plant of course...|$|R
