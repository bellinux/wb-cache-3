40|$|Tall fescue leaf blades {{elongate}} at near constant rates {{during most}} of the light and dark periods of the diurnal cycle, with the dark rate being higher by 60 to 65 %. Our objective was to determine relationships among diurnal rates <b>of</b> leaf <b>elongation,</b> deposition <b>of</b> water and deposition of dry matter (DM) into the elongation zone. Two separate experiments were conducted, both with a 15 -hour photoperiod and constant 21 °C at the growth zone. Increased rates <b>of</b> leaf <b>elongation</b> in darkness were due to proportionally increased rates <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> 4 -millimeter segments <b>of</b> the <b>elongation</b> zone. Length <b>of</b> the total <b>elongation</b> zone was 30 millimeters in both light and darkness. The spatial distribution of water contents in the elongation zone varied little during the diurnal cycle. Thus, dark stimulation <b>of</b> leaf <b>elongation</b> rate (+ 65 %) and of water deposition (+ 77 %) into elongation zones were similar. Water content per unit leaf length increased by 50 % between the basal and distal <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the <b>elongation</b> zone, indicating that tissue also grew in the lateral and vertical dimensions. Longitudinal growth of tissue, however, allowed 5 to 7 times more water deposition into the elongation zone than growth in cross-sectional area. This relationship was similar in light and darkness. In both light and darkness net rates of DM deposition (microgram per millimeter leaf length per hour) increased from the zone of cell division towards the region <b>of</b> most active <b>elongation,</b> 10 to 15 millimeters from the ligule, then decreased towards the distal end <b>of</b> the <b>elongation</b> zone. Net DM deposition rates (microgram per hour) integrated over the 30 -millimeter elongation zone were similar during light and darkness. Thus, DM in the elongation zone was diluted during darkness as a result of increased water deposition. Net DM deposition rates at and above the distal end <b>of</b> the <b>elongation</b> zone were clearly positive during the light, but were close to zero or negative in darkness. Thus, DM deposition into the elongation zone and the adjacent recently expanded tissue was differentially affected in the diurnal cycle, DM deposition occurred in both tissues in light, but was restricted to the elongation zone in darkness...|$|R

In the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> rapid <b>elongation</b> (such that no molecular relaxation occurs), the external work applied is all stored elastically and the Considere criterion originally developed in solid mechanics {{can be used to}} quantitatively predict the critical Hencky strain to failure. By comparing the predictions of the Doi-Edwards model for linear homopolymer melts with those of the "Pom-Pom" model for prototypical branched melts we show that the critical strain to failure in rapid <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> a rubbery material is intimately linked to the molecular topology of the chain, especially the degree of chain branching. The onset of necking instability is monotonically shifted to larger Hencky strains as the number of branches is increased. Numerical computations at finite Deborah numbers also show that there is an optimal range of deformation rates over which homogeneous extensions can be maintained to large strain. We also consider other rapid homogeneous stretching deformations, such as biaxial and planar stretching, and show that the degree of stabilization afforded by inclusion of material with long-chain branching is a sensitive function of the imposed mode of deformation...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed with an average follow up of 36 months 22 patients (22 elbows) who had been treated conservatively after a first episode of posterior dislocation of the elbow. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (86 %) reported an excellent or a good subjective result, although 64 % suffered occasionally from pain. None had presented a recurrent dislocation. At physical examination, 27 % had a restricted extension of the elbow of 10 degrees and more, and 27 % {{had some kind of}} chronic laxity. Fifty percent had modifications visible on the X-rays.

Imported DM used for WSC-free DM synthesis during darkness (67 % of the total in experiment I and 59 % in experiment II) was greater than during light (47 % in both experiments), suggesting that the 65 % higher leaf elongation rate during darkness was accompanied by higher rates of synthesis of cellular structural components. Deposition rates of WSC in the basal and central part <b>of</b> the <b>elongation</b> zone (0 - 20 mm from the ligule) were similar during light and darkness, but above 20 millimeters WSC deposition occurred during light and WSC loss occurred during darkness. WSC deposition and loss throughout the elongation zone and the recently expanded tissue were mostly due to net synthesis and degradation of fructan. Fructan was predominantly low molecular weight and contributed about 50 % of the total osmotic partial pressure of WSC. In the most actively growing region, where fructan synthesis was most rapid, no diurnal change occurred in molecular weight distribution of fructan. WSC solute concentrations were diluted in the most actively growing tissue during darkness because net monosaccharide and fructan deposition were unaltered and sucrose deposition was decreased, but growth-associated water deposition was increased by 77 %.

Based on the ubiquitous presence of 2 b-hydroxylated gibberellins (GAs), a major inactivating pathway for the plant hormone GA seems to be via GA 2 -oxidation. In this study, we used various approaches to determine the role of C 19 -GA 2 -oxidation in regulating GA concentration and GA-responsive plant growth and development. We show that Arabidopsis thaliana has five C 19 -GA 2 -oxidases, transcripts for one or more of which are present in all organs and at all stages of development examined. Expression of four of the five genes is subject to feed-forward regulation. By knocking out all five Arabidopsis C 19 -GA 2 -oxidases, we show that C 19 -GA 2 -oxidation limits bioactive GA content and regulates plant development at various stages during the plant life cycle: C 19 -GA 2 -oxidases prevent seed germination in the absence of light and cold stimuli, delay the vegetative and floral phase transitions, <b>limit</b> the number <b>of</b> flowers produced per inflorescence, and suppress <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> the pistil prior to fertilization.
