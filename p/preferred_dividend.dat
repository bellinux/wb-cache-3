40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} investigates the interaction of changes in accounting standards with institutions such as investor protection laws and corporate governance mechanisms. We examine the unintended consequences of fair value accounting in determining mandated <b>preferred</b> <b>dividends.</b> We study the case of Russian energy conglomerate UES, which had a good corporate governance track record and a consistent dividend history. Following its adoption of fair value accounting, UES reported the highest quarterly profit in world corporate history, but it subsequently omitted dividends for all its shareholders. The case analysis suggests that the transitory nature of fair value adjustments and the interaction with the investment policy were important considerations in justifying the dividend omission. The reduction in <b>preferred</b> <b>dividends</b> was not offset by any capital gains, {{and led to a}} wealth transfer from preferred to ordinary shareholders. Thus, requiring the use of fair value accounting when determining the dividend distribution base can lead to unintended consequences and increase agency costs for minority shareholders...|$|R
5000|$|Like bonds, {{preferred}} shares compensate owners with scheduled payments which resemble interest. However, preferred [...] "interest" [...] {{is actually in}} the form of a dividend.

40|$|We study a {{preferred}} equity infusion government program set to mitigate inter-bank contagion. Financial institutions {{are prone to}} insolvency risk channeled through the network of interbank debt and {{to the risk of}} bank runs. The government seeks to maximize, under budget constraints, the total net worth of the financial system or, equivalently, to minimize the dead-weight losses induced by bank runs. The government is assumed to have complete information on interbank debt. The problem of quantifying the optimal amount of infusions can be expressed as a convex combinatorial optimiza-tion problem, tractable when the set of banks eligible for intervention (core banks) is sufficiently, yet realistically, small. We find that no bank has an incentive to withdraw from the program, when the <b>preferred</b> <b>dividend</b> rate paid to the government is equal to the government’s outside return on the intervention budget. On the other hand, it may be optimal for the government to make infusions in a strict subset of core banks...|$|E

50|$|Like common stock, {{preferred}} stocks represent partial ownership in a company. Preferred stock shareholders {{may or may}} not enjoy any of the voting rights of those holding common stock. Also, unlike common stock, a preferred stock pays a fixed dividend that does not fluctuate. Often the dividend is cumulative. Thus, the company must pay all unpaid <b>preferred</b> <b>dividends</b> accumulated during previous periods before it can pay dividends to common shareholders. If the company is unable to pay this <b>dividend,</b> the <b>preferred</b> shareholders may have the right to force a liquidation of the company.|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} held that for tax reasons {{corporate}} shareholders {{are the only}} shareholders that <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends</b> to capital gains. This has led to clientele models where corporate blockholders migrate to firms paying dividends and use their voting power to increase dividends in these firms. We use panel data and trades of large blocks of stock to investigate these propositions. Although one-third of firms have corporate blockholders, we find no evidence that dividends are higher in these firms; that corporate blockholders are attracted to dividend-paying-firms; or that dividends increase after a corporation buys a large block of stock...|$|R
40|$|The {{idiosyncratic}} {{preferences of}} controlling shareholders {{play an important}} role in determining the payout policy of a company. Among controlling shareholders, families are quite common in Continental Western Europe (Faccio et al., 2001, Caprio et al., 2011). We know that family managers often take decisions in the interests of the family rather than in the interests of the company (Bertrand and Schoar, 2006; Morck and Young, 2004). Payout policy of family firms could be implemented in order to satisfy idiosyncratic preferences of the family owner rather than maximizing the value of the company. Using a sample of 777 Western European Companies, I observed the payout policy in the 1997 – 2010 year period. I find that family firms significantly <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends</b> to buyback. Considering family managers, I find that CEO founders do not like to payout dividends, while CEO heirs do <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends.</b> Family firms controlled and managed by founders are more likely to use buyback and show a lower amount of dividend payout. On the other side, heir CEOs disgorge much more cash though dividends. Jensen‟s FCF theory (1989) seems to hold for family firms managed by founders, because they over retain cash rather than distributing it. Warther‟s (1993) “sleeping dogs ” theory could be a good explanation for heir CEOs ‟ propensity to distribute cash dividends. In fact, they need to satisfy a larger controlling group and also they need to make the other heirs happy enough to avoid interfering into management decisions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} payout policy of Italian firms {{controlled}} by large majority shareholders (controlled firms). The paper {{reports that a}} firm’s share of dividends in total payout (dividends plus repurchases) is negatively related {{to the size of}} the cash flow stake of the firm’s controlling shareholder and positively associated with the wedge between the controlling shareholder’s control rights and cash flow rights. These findings are consistent with the substitute model of payout. One of the implications of this model is that controlled firms with weak corporate governance set-ups, in which controlling shareholders have strong incentives to expropriate minority shareholders, tend to <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends</b> over repurchases when disgorging cash...|$|R

50|$|The capital {{structure}} substitution theory (CSS) describes {{the relationship between}} earnings, stock price and {{capital structure}} of public companies. The theory is based on one simple hypothesis: company managements manipulate capital structure such that earnings-per-share (EPS) are maximized. The resulting dynamic debt-equity target explains why some companies use dividends and others do not. When redistributing cash to shareholders, company managements can typically choose between dividends and share repurchases. But as dividends are in most cases taxed higher than capital gains, investors are expected to prefer capital gains. However, the CSS theory shows that for some companies share repurchases lead {{to a reduction in}} EPS. These companies typically <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends</b> over share repurchases.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{ex-dividend}} day returns of several taxable and non-taxable distributions. The ex-dividend day returns for the taxable common stocks {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that dividends are taxed more heavily than capital gains. However, the cx-dividend day returns of preferred stocks suggest that <b>preferred</b> <b>dividends</b> are taxed at a lower rate than capital gains; non-taxable stock dividends and splits are priced on ex-dividend days as if they are fully taxable; and non-taxable cash distributions are priced as if investors recetve a tax rebate with them. We also find that each of these distributions exhibits abnormal return behavior for several days surrounding the ex-dividend day. We investigate several possible explanations for this anomaly, but none is capable of explaining the phenomenon. 1...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the days}} of Miller and Modigliani, {{academics}} have been studying dividend policy. There have been many theories as to why companies declare dividends, under what circumstances investors may <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends</b> {{to other forms of}} compensation, and factors that cause dividends to rise. However, the concept of liquidity has until very recently been largely ignored. This paper examines liquidity and dividend policy on the international level to determine what relationship the liquidity of a firm’s stock has on the decision of how much dividend to disburse to investors. It finds that in several specific cases, there is an inverse relationship between stock liquidity and the dividend amount paid. This perhaps would point to dividends indeed at times compensating for lower stock liquidity.   </p...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{the agency}} cost {{explanation}} of payout policy, I hypothesize that controlled firms with weak corporate governance set-ups, in which controlling shareholders have strong incentives to expropriate minority shareholders, pay out more and/or tend to <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends</b> over repurchases when disgorging cash. I study {{a sample of}} Italian controlled firms and find strong {{evidence in support of}} my hypotheses. A firm’s share of dividends in total payout (dividends plus repurchases) is negatively related {{to the size of the}} cash flow stake of the firm’s controlling shareholder and positively associated with the wedge between the controlling shareholder’s control rights and cash flow rights. Furthermore, familycontrolled firms, which are less severely affected by agency problems than other Italian controlled firms, choose lower payouts and are characterized by smaller fractions of dividends in total payout...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} tax and agency {{explanations}} of corporate payout policy by investigating the likelihood, {{the level and}} the method of payout in founder and family firms. Controlling founders and families are both subject to the tax disadvantage of dividends arising from their substantial shareholdings, but family firms are arguably subject to more severe agency conflicts than founder firms due to their susceptibility to wasteful expenditure and the adverse effects of intra-family conflicts. Results indicate that founder firms on average are less likely and pay {{a lower level of}} dividends than family firms. Moreover, founder firms prefer share repurchase over dividends as the main method of payout whereas family firms <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends</b> over share repurchase. Overall, our findings are consistent with the agency explanation of corporate payout policy. 18 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|Almost all {{preferred}} shares have a negotiated, fixed-dividend amount.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of upward fair value {{adjustments}} on dividend policies in Russia, where corporate governance is weak. We discuss the case of the utility company Unified Energy System (UES), which abolished its <b>dividends</b> (including mandatory <b>preferred</b> <b>dividends)</b> after reporting a record profit resulting from fair value adjustments. In a large sample of Russian firms, we find a negative relationship between upward fair value adjustments and dividend changes. We suggest that fair value adjustments may introduce noise and inhibit decision making because users may have difficulties in assessing the distribution relevance of the income components. In low investor protection countries, where outsiders generally lack the power to press corporate insiders to distribute cash, this may be seized upon by corporate insiders to adjust dividends downwards. Thus, introducing fair value accounting has corporate governance implications, and it may lead to outcomes that are detrimental to the interests of outsiders...|$|R
