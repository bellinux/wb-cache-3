5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|The ancient font by {{the west}} door dates from the twelfth century, and has an arcaded basin. The plain pointed arch forms the only {{ornament}} on the font, which has an octagonal ashlar shaft now mounted on a platform, and supporting the octagonal basin. Unfortunately the font has been subject to extensive and clumsy repair. Unusually, it is made of Purbeck marble, which is normally found in churches in south and eastern England; the only other example in Wales is in St David's Cathedral. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} massive stem dates from at least the nineteenth century, and stylistic evidence suggests that it is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> earlier; the font basin itself is undoubtedly ancient. Seddon's restoration work in the church commenced in 1869, and included dismantling the font. He carefully cleaned and stored the stonework, and re-erected it on new platform of Radyr conglomerate stone. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway. The font previously stood on a three step platform, in the same position as it now stands. The font cover is nineteenth century, in oak and wrought iron.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the episode}} begins with horror, similar to [...] "The Harrowing", it quickly {{moves into the}} more meta subject of {{television}} production; something [...] "more intimidating and <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> crueller" [...] than the supernatural. For the television critic Matt Baylis, the episode is a criticism of the callousness of reality television (such as Candid Camera) {{from the perspective of}} television plays. The horror {{at the start of the}} episode, he argues, continues even once the ruse is revealed. [...] "Ugliness" [...] remains in Terry's arrogance, Anne's self-obsession and the indifference of Gemma and Amanda. This builds gradually into a [...] "moral horror" [...] in which [...] "the unkind got their desserts".|$|E

500|$|Asked whether Robbins and Torres might marry in the future, Capshaw replied: [...] "There's <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{more stuff}} {{that has to}} happen before that happens. [...] I don't think they're {{going to get married}} just to get married. As Arizona goes, I think she has {{incredible}} discipline and she does, as you said, have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought." [...] Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: [...] "Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen to make it very playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing." ...|$|E
500|$|The Documentary {{received}} generally positive reviews. On Metacritic, The Documentary {{received an}} aggregate score of 72 out of 100 based on 19 reviews. Pitchfork Media called it [...] "the best West Coast street-rap album since DJ Quik's 2002 LP Under tha Influence" [...] {{and described the}} production as [...] "a rich, triumphant sonic tapestry". Allmusic wrote the album was an [...] "excellent debut" [...] that [...] "hints {{at a lot of}} potential" [...] and observed the [...] "most remarkable aspect of the Game is how he can be such a blatant product of gangsta rap... and leave a mark so fast." [...] Rolling Stone noted The Game was [...] "going for emotional impact rather than dazzling wordplay or laughs" [...] and PopMatters described him as [...] "a self-conscious, malicious, nihilistic gangsta rapper with a heart and lyrical content". On the other hand, Robert Christgau believed the album was [...] "dull even when he isn't describing his medical problems, this no-talent is masscult rock at its most brazen". The A.V. Club praised the production for being [...] "a sonic classic of slow-rolling G-funk and glossy hyper-soul", but panned The Game for his name dropping, suggesting if he [...] "cut all the references to rappers and albums... it'd be a good 15 to 20 minutes shorter—and <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more compelling." [...] Billboard declared it [...] "one of the best rap albums of the year" [...] and Entertainment Weekly suggested [...] "with the brightest hip-hop stars aligning for him, the Game may have willed himself a popular masterpiece." ...|$|E

Candace does not realize this as {{she is trying to}} convince her mother not to come in and ruin her good time, so when she tries to justify the beach's existence, she finds nothing but their normal backyard. Candace is depressed, but the boys find the day to be a successful one. Candace is helped inside by Isabella and Linda. At the end, the DJ from the beginning congratulates Phineas and Ferb and also says that tomorrow will be hot and sunny too, but then Ferb adds [...] "with a slight chance of scattered lawn gnomes", to which Phineas (and <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of viewers) laughs.

2500|$|González's parents, Manuel Antonio González and Carmen Alire Alonso, {{migrated}} from the Mexican state of Chihuahua to the U.S. {{in the early}} 1900s. González was born in 1928, the eldest of seven children. Kramer writes that [...] "Gorgo was not the poor Mexican-American that people assumed. He didn't come from a wealthy family, but from a stable middle-class background, <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like mine. He had a great mother {{and there was always}} a warm feeling of family loyalty. If anything, he might have been spoiled as a kid. It's a shame he suffered discrimination because of his Mexican heritage". However, according to other sources, Gonzales's father worked as a house-painter and he, along with his six siblings, were raised in a working-class neighborhood. In his autobiography, González states, [...] "We had few luxuries at our house. Food wasn't abundant but it was simple and filling, and we never went hungry. Our clothes were just clothes – inexpensive but clean." ...|$|E
