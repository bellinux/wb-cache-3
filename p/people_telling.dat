500|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} when Hair opened in London. [...] Irving Wardle in The Times wrote, [...] "Its honesty and passion {{give it the}} quality of a true {{theatrical}} celebration – the joyous sound of a group of <b>people</b> <b>telling</b> the world exactly what they feel." [...] In The Financial Times, B. A. Young agreed that Hair was [...] "not only a wildly enjoyable evening, but a thoroughly moral one." [...] However, in his final review before retiring after 48 years, 78-year-old W. A. Darlington of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he had [...] "tried hard", but found the evening [...] "a complete bore – noisy, ugly and quite desperately funny." ...|$|E
500|$|The cycle-chain scene became popular, with <b>people</b> <b>telling</b> Varma {{that they}} broke a cycle chain after seeing Siva; the {{director}} called them the [...] "ultimate {{example of how}} imagination can take over and become a reality in time". As of 2014, the chain used in the film is owned by Chakravarthy. Film-poster designers Anil and Bhanu said that posters should be designed to make a subconscious impact on the viewer, citing the title logo of Siva (with Nagarjuna and the cycle chain) as an example. Inspired by Varma's work in Siva, Rajamouli composed the action sequence during the intermission of his directorial debut Student No. 1 (2002), and followed the shot division of the cycle-chain scene for the same.|$|E

When asked about his experience with making songs for No Name Face {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "DreamWorks has been amazing in letting us make the record. They're super-artist-friendly. They let us make our record the way we wanted to make it. It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as far as what it's about for me personally. I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing <b>people</b> <b>telling</b> what's it's about to them because then I can go, 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still." [...] It was released on March 25, 2002 by DreamWorks Records.|$|E

500|$|Friday {{was marked}} {{during the game}} by Mark Lawrenson, who so {{frustrated}} the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then {{kicked him in the}} face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. [...] "I am sick and tired of it", Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November. [...] "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand". Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6–3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of <b>people</b> <b>telling</b> him what to do, and walked into Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.|$|E
500|$|Several <b>people,</b> <b>telling</b> amazing {{stories to}} those who would listen, passed {{themselves}} off as the [...] "sole survivor" [...] in the years following the slide. The most common such tale is that of an infant girl said to have been the only survivor of the slide. Her real name unknown, the girl was called [...] "Frankie Slide". Several stories were told of her miraculous escape: she was found in a bale of hay, lying on rocks, under the collapsed roof of her house or in the arms of her dead mother. The legend was based primarily on the story of Marion Leitch, who was thrown from her home into a pile of hay when the slide enveloped her home. [...] Her sisters also survived; they were found unharmed under a collapsed ceiling joist. Her parents and four brothers died. Influencing the story was the survival of two-year-old Gladys Ennis, who was found outside her home in the mud. [...] The last survivor of the slide, she died in 1995. In total, 23 people {{in the path of the}} slide survived, in addition to the 17 miners who escaped from the tunnels under Turtle Mountain.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s, Indian Agent J. W. Burns {{compiled}} local {{stories and}} published {{them in a}} series of Canadian newspaper articles.

According to Sts'Ailes accounts, the Sasquatch preferred to avoid white men and spoke the Lillooet language of the people at Port Douglas, British Columbia at the head of Harrison Lake.

Burns borrowed the term Sasquatch from the Halkomelem sásq'ets (...) and used it in his articles to describe a hypothetical single type of creature portrayed in the local stories.|$|E

2500|$|Acquired {{situational}} narcissism (ASN) {{is a form}} of narcissism {{that develops}} in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of celebrity. It was coined by Robert B. Millman, {{professor of psychiatry at the}} Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society. [...] Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. [...] "Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people." [...] In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from narcissistic personality disorder, differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. [...] "The lack of social norms, controls, and of <b>people</b> <b>telling</b> them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable," [...] so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is Norma Desmond, the main character of Sunset Boulevard.|$|E
