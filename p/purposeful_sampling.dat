40|$|Informed {{decisions}} about sampling {{are critical to}} {{improving the quality of}} research synthesis. Even though several qualitative research synthesists have recommended <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> for synthesizing qualitative research, the published literature holds sparse discussion on how different strategies for <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> may be applied to a research synthesis. In primary research, Patton is frequently cited as an authority on the topic of <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling.</b> In Patton’s original texts that are referred to in this article, Patton does not make any suggestion of using <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> for research synthesis. This article makes a unique contribution to the literature by examining the adaptability of each of Patton’s 16 <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> strategies to the process of qualitative research synthesis. It illuminates how different <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> strategies might be particularly suited to constructing multi-perspectival, emancipatory, participatory and deconstructive interpretations of published research...|$|E
40|$|Background An {{increasing}} number of qualitative evidence syntheses papers are found in health care literature. Many of these syntheses use a strictly exhaustive search strategy to collect articles, mirroring the standard template developed by major review {{organizations such as the}} Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration. The hegemonic idea behind it is that non-comprehensive samples in systematic reviews may introduce selection bias. However, exhaustive sampling in a qualitative evidence synthesis has been questioned, and a more purposeful way of sampling papers has been proposed as an alternative, although {{there is a lack of}} transparency on how these <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> strategies might be applied to a qualitative evidence synthesis. We discuss in our paper why and how we used <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> in a qualitative evidence synthesis about ‘sexual adjustment to a cancer trajectory’, by giving a worked example. Methods We have chosen a mixed <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling,</b> combining three different strategies that we considered the most consistent with our research purpose: intensity sampling, maximum variation sampling and confirming/disconfirming case sampling. Results The concept of <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> on the meta-level could not readily been borrowed from the logic applied in basic research projects. It also demands a considerable amount of flexibility, and is labour-intensive, which goes against the argument of many authors that using <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> provides a pragmatic solution or a short cut for researchers, compared with exhaustive sampling. Opportunities of <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> were the possible inclusion of new perspectives to the line-of-argument and the enhancement of the theoretical diversity of the papers being included, which could make the results more conceptually aligned with the synthesis purpose. Conclusions This paper helps researchers to make decisions related to <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling</b> in a more systematic and transparent way. Future research could confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis of conceptual enhancement by comparing the findings of a purposefully sampled qualitative evidence synthesis with those drawing on an exhaustive sample of the literature. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Researchers have {{increasingly}} turned to mixed-method techniques {{to expand the}} scope and improve the analytic power of their studies. Yet there is still relatively little direction on and much confusion about how to combine qualitative and quantitative techniques. These tech-niques are neither paradigm- nor method-linked; researchers ’ orientations to inquiry and their methodological commitments will influence how they use them. Examples of sampling combina-tions include criterion sampling from instrument scores, random <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling,</b> and strat-ified <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling.</b> Examples of data collection combinations {{include the use of}} instru-ments for fuller qualitative description, for validation, as guides for <b>purposeful</b> <b>sampling,</b> and as elicitation devices in interviews. Examples of data analysis combinations include interpretively linking qualitative and quantitative data sets and the transformation processes of qualitizing an...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether intrinsic, extrinsic, and quest {{religious}} motivations mediate the relationship between the religious philosophy and perceived well-being of believers. The intrinsic-extrinsic-quest paradigm has been the dominant measure of religious motivation for more than 3 decades. However, the different effects of intrinsic, extrinsic, and quest motivation on the well-being of believers has not been tested on a stratified, <b>purposeful</b> <b>sample</b> of the major world religions. A quantitative, quasi-experimental research design was used with an online, self-report questionnaire and mediation analysis to examine the effects of religious motivation on the relationship between religious philosophy and well-being. A stratified, <b>purposeful</b> <b>sample</b> of 763 members of the major world religions completed assessments of religion and well-being. Linear regressions revealed that intrinsic, extrinsic, and quest religious motivations were three distinct constructs, that they do exist across the world religions, and that they mediated the relationship between different religions and well-being, depending on which predictor and outcome variables were being examined in the mediation triangle. Positive social change is possible for counselors, therapists, psychologists of religion, religious leaders, and laypersons at the individual and societal level through knowing which religious beliefs, motivations, and practices are associated with positive affect, satisfaction with life, the fulfilment of basic human needs, eudaimonic well-being, and better physical health.
