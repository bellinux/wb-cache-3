5|$|The {{many forms}} of dance provide {{entertainment}} for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when {{it is used to}} express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines {{many forms of}} entertainment music, movement, storytelling, theatre it <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.|$|E

25|$|This {{formula is}} not exact, as it assumes the current density is totally uniform in the conductor, {{which is not}} always true in {{practical}} situations. However, this formula still <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.|$|E
25|$|However, as Thomas {{states the}} {{rational}} model <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> perspective since in modern society rationality plays {{a central role}} and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, {{it does not seem}} strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerial photo}} taken {{in about the}} 1940s <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> view of the cottages. The modern {{streetscape}} {{is more difficult to}} see because of trees.

25|$|Some {{market data}} {{providers}} (like Data Explorers and SunGard Financial Systems) believe that stock lending data <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> proxy for short interest levels (excluding any naked short interest). SunGard provides daily data on short interest by tracking the proxy variables based on {{borrowing and lending}} data it collects.|$|E
25|$|Oval-shaped {{diamonds}} {{have been}} created and introduced by Lazare Kaplan {{way back in the}} 1960s. Usually noted to have 56 facets, the weight of such diamonds is estimated by measuring the length and width of the stone. A ratio of 1.33 to 1.66 <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> traditional range of oval-shaped diamonds.|$|E
25|$|Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, {{designed}} in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and {{included in a}} large number of cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> encryption rate in software and no effective cryptanalysis of it has been found to date. However, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) now receives more attention.|$|E

25|$|Bowling alleys built {{during this}} period often {{featured}} restaurants or nightclubs where locally or even nationally prominent entertainers would perform. In the 1948 movie Road House, the title refers to a large bowling alley with a nightclub attached, {{where much of the}} action takes place. The film <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> historical glance at bowling alleys of the era.|$|E
25|$|A spherical 180°×360° {{panorama}} can be {{projected onto}} any polyhedron; but the rhombicuboctahedron <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> enough approximation of a sphere while being easy to build. This type of projection, called Philosphere, is possible from some panorama assembly software. It {{consists of two}} images that are printed separately and cut with scissors while leaving some flaps for assembly with glue.|$|E
25|$|All-fifths tuning is {{typically}} used for mandolins, cellos, violas, and violins. On a guitar, tuning the strings in fifths {{would mean the}} first string would be a high B, something that was impractical until recently. NST <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> approximation to all-fifths tuning. Like other regular tunings, NST allows chord fingerings to be shifted from one set of strings to another.|$|E

25|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of {{molecular}} underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the genetic material. The central dogma of molecular biology where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being an oversimplified picture of molecular biology, still <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> starting point for understanding the field. This picture, however, is undergoing revision in light of emerging novel roles for RNA.|$|E
25|$|A mask is {{considered}} to fit well when it seals comfortably and effectively all round the skirt, and <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> field of vision, without pressing on the nose or forehead while in use underwater. A low internal volume {{is considered}} desirable by freedivers, as less breath is wasted to equalise, and by scuba divers, as there is less tendency to press up under the nose due to buoyancy, which becomes uncomfortable quite quickly.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} Figure 5.2's speed lines <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{example of why}} it is {{inappropriate}} {{to use the term}} choke in association with a maximum flow of all centrifugal compressor speed lines. In summary; most industrial and commercial centrifugal compressors are selected or designed to operate at or near their highest efficiencies and to avoid operation at low efficiencies. For this reason there is seldom a reason to illustrate centrifugal compressor performance below 60% efficiency.|$|E

25|$|The {{inclusive}} fitness theory <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{overview of}} possible {{solutions to the}} fundamental problem of cooperation: its contradiction to natural selection. The theory {{is based on the}} hypothesis that cooperation helps in transmitting underlying genes to future generations either through increasing the reproductive successes of the individual (direct fitness) or of other individuals who carry the same genes (indirect fitness). Direct benefits can result from simple by-product of cooperation or enforcement mechanisms, while indirect benefits can result from cooperation with genetically similar individuals.|$|E
25|$|Cattle hides and tallow, {{along with}} marine mammal fur and other goods, {{provided}} the necessary trade articles for mutually beneficial trade. The first American, English, and Russian trading ships {{first appeared in}} California {{a few years before}} 1820. The classic book Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> first hand account of this trade. From 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year—a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.|$|E
25|$|Squash {{provides}} an excellent cardiovascular workout. In one hour of squash, a player may expend approximately 600 to 1000 food calories (3,000 to 4,000 kJ). The sport also <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> upper and lower body workout by exercising both the legs in running around the court and the arms and torso in swinging the racket. In 2003, Forbes rated squash as the number one healthiest sport to play. However, some studies have implicated squash {{as a cause of}} possible fatal cardiac arrhythmia and argued that squash is an inappropriate form of exercise for older men with heart disease.|$|E
