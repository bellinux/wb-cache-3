50|$|The {{transition}} can {{be readily}} understood {{by the use of}} the Holstein-Primakoff transformation applied to a two-level atom. As a result of this transformation, the atoms become Lorentz harmonic oscillators with frequencies equal to the difference between the energy levels. The whole system then simplifies to a system of interacting harmonic oscillators of atoms, and the field known as Hopfield dielectric which further predicts in the normal state polarons for photons or polaritons.If the interaction with the field is so strong that the system collapses in the harmonic approximation and complex polariton frequencies (soft modes) appear, then the physical system with nonlinear terms of the higher orderbecomes the system with the Mexican hat-like potential, and will undergo ferroelectric-like phase transition.In this model, the system is mathematically equivalent for one mode of excitation to the Trojan wave packet, when the circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>field</b> intensity corresponds to the electromagnetic coupling constant. Above the critical value, it changes to the unstable motion of the ionization.|$|E
5000|$|He began {{these studies}} in 1976 in {{connection}} with experimental studies carried out at AMOLF by group of Marnix van der Wiel. Initially, his interest was focused on multi-photon transitions treated by non-perturbation quantum theory. However, he switched to perturbation methods in quantum theory when it became possible experimentally to attain ultra-high laser intensities at very high frequencies based on the High-Intensity High-Frequency Floquet Theory (HI-HFFT). His investigations lead to very surprising results—the phenomenon of ``atomic dichotomy" [...] in which the hydrogen atom when it is placed in a linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>field</b> exhibits a splitting of its spherical charge distribution into two lobes that oscillate in the laser field. On the other hand, in a circularly polarized laser field, thehydrogen atom's charge distribution takes on a toroidal shape with its symmetry axis oriented along the propagation vector {{of the field and}} passing {{through the center of the}} atom. His theory also predicts for two-electron atoms the appearance of a new bound state which is induced by the ultra-intense laser field; these are 'light-induced excited states'. Apparently paradoxical events do occur in the presence of the extremely intense laser field: a proton can bind more than two electrons thus leading to the formation of hydrogen negative ions with multiple negative charges that are relatively stable. Other novel and unexpected properties of molecules were also predicted in the presence of such ultra-intense laser fields.|$|E

We derive a generalized two-center interference condition for elliptically <b>polarized</b> <b>fields,</b> which accounts for s-p mixing and the orbital symmetry, within the strong-field and the single-active electron approximation. We show that the non-vanishing ellipticity introduces an effective dynamic shift in the angle for which the two-center interference maxima and minima occur, {{with regard to the}} existing condition for linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>fields.</b> This shift depends on the ratio between the field-dressed momentum components of the returning electron parallel and perpendicular to the major ellipticity axis along each possible orbit. Because of this dependence, we find {{that there will be a}} blurring in the two-center interference minima, and that increasing ellipticity leads to splitting in such patterns.

40|$|Development of QED cascades in a {{standing}} electromagnetic wave for circular and linear polarizations is simulated numerically with a 3 D PIC-MC code. It is demonstrated {{that for the}} same laser energy the number of particles produced in a circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>field</b> is greater than in a linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>field,</b> though the acquiring mean energy per particle is larger in the latter case. The qualitative model of laser-assisted QED cascades is extended by including the effect of polarization of the field. It turns out that cascade dynamics is notably more complicated {{in the case of}} linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>field,</b> where separation into the qualitatively different "electric" and "magnetic" regions (where the electric field is stronger than the magnetic field and vice versa) becomes essential. In the "electric" regions acceleration is suppressed and moreover the high-energy electrons are even getting cooled by photon emission. The volumes of the "electric" and "magnetic" regions evolve periodically in time, and so does the cascade growth rate. In contrast to the linear polarization the charged particles can be accelerated by circularly polarized wave even in "magnetic" region. The "electric" and "magnetic" regions do not evolve in time and cascade growth rate almost does not depend on time for circular polarization. Comment: 28 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

A phenomenological parametrization of the photodetachment cross section for a fixed-in-space molecular system in terms of two scalar dynamical parameters is presented and circular dichroism effects are discussed. Analytic results for the dynamical molecular parameters within the ZRP molecular model are used to analyze interference phenomena (including two-center interference) and dichroic effects in the detached electron angular distributions and their dependence on the interatomic distance R and on the orientation of the molecular axis with respect to the polarization plane.

40|$|High-harmonic {{generation}} {{driven by}} two-color counter-rotating circularly <b>polarized</b> laser <b>fields</b> was recently demonstrated experimentally as a breakthrough source of bright, coherent, circularly polarized beams {{in the extreme}} ultraviolet and soft-x-ray regions. However, the conditions for optimizing the single-atom yield are significantly more complex than for linearly polarized driving lasers and are not fully understood. In this thesis, I present a comprehensive study of strong-field ionization–the complementary process to high-harmonic generation–driven by two-color circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>fields.</b> First, I describe a new experimental method that allows for the reconstruction of three-dimensional photoelectron angular distributions generated with two-color circularly <b>polarized</b> laser <b>fields.</b> Second, I present the first measurements of electron-ion rescattering in these fields, showing that the process can be systematically controlled by changing {{the parameters of the}} driving lasers.

40|$|An {{analytic}} {{description of}} laser-assisted electron-atom scattering (LAES) in an elliptically <b>polarized</b> <b>field</b> is presented using time-dependent effective range (TDER) theory to treat both electron-laser and electron-atom interactions non-perturbatively. Closed-form formulas describing plateau features in LAES spectra are derived quantum mechanically in the low-frequency limit. These formulas provide an analytic explanation for key {{features of the}} LAES differential cross section. For the low-energy region of the LAES spectrum, our result generalizes the Kroll-Watson formula {{to the case of}} elliptic polarization. For the high-energy (rescattering) plateau in the LAES spectrum, our result generalizes prior results for a linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>field</b> valid for the high-energy end of the rescattering plateau [A. V. Flegel et al., J. Phys. B 42, 241002 (2009) ] and confirms the factorization of the LAES cross section into three factors: two field-free elastic electron-atom scattering cross sections (with laser-modified momenta) and a laser field-dependent factor (insensitive to the scattering potential) describing the laser-driven motion of the electron in the elliptically <b>polarized</b> <b>field.</b> We present also approximate analytic expressions for the exact TDER LAES amplitude that are valid over the entire rescattering plateau and reduce to the three-factor form in the plateau cutoff region. The theory is illustrated for the cases of e-H scattering in a CO_ 2 -laser field and e-F scattering in a mid-infrared laser field of wavelength λ= 3. 5 μm, for which the analytic results are shown to be in good agreement with exact numerical TDER results...|$|E

This investigation is performed semi-analytically at the single-molecule response and single-active orbital level, using the strong-field approximation and the steepest descent method. We show that the velocity form of the dipole operator is superior to the length form in providing information about this distortion.
