Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 165 : 294 - 299, 1969. Serum lysozyme levels {{are found to be}} increased in adjuvant polyarthritic rats and correlate well with gross limb findings and the decreases in turbidity measurements as determined by the stability of serum protein against heat denaturation. <b>Paramethasone,</b> phenylbutazone and indometha-cin, which have been shown to normalize limb swelling and turbidity levels in adjuvant rats, also prevent the observed increases in serum lysozyme activity. Acetylsalicylic acid is found to be ineffective. An increase in lysozyme levels accompanied by a decrease in turbidity is noted in rats following acute stress. The serum lysozyme and turbidity levels in endocrine-deficient rats and the effects of <b>paramethasone</b> have been compared.

40|$|Arthritis induced in rats by mycobacterial {{adjuvant}} {{has been}} used for the study of compounds of known value in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in man. The development of the arthritic syndrome in treated and control rats was followed by measuring the changes in foot thickness of both hind-feet with a micrometer. This method allowed the effect of anti-inflammatory compounds to be expressed quantitatively. Anti-inflammatory activity was readily observed in certain steroids, pyrazolidines, salicylates and sodium aurothiomalate. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were inactive. The inhibition obtained by daily treatment with the steroid <b>paramethasone</b> disappeared when treatment was withdrawn...|$|E
40|$|Topical {{application}} of 400 μg of cantharidin to the rat's ear caused an approximate doubling {{in the mean}} weight of uniform ear punch samples when compared to vehicle-treated controls at 72 hr, and produced a maximal response at 7 days. Dexamethasone reduced the increase in weight when applied topically, but was ineffective when given subcutaneously or orally at the same doses. Hydrocortisone, prednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone, flurometholone, <b>paramethasone</b> acetate, fluocinolone acetonide, fluocinonide, and flurandrenolide showed significant suppression of cantharidin-induced inflammation. Cholesterol, diphenhydramine, tripelennamine, chlorpheniramine, promethazine, cyproheptadine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, alpha-tocopherol, indomethacin, and bufexamac were inactive. It is suggested that the procedure employed {{may be useful in}} the screening and evaluation of topical anti-inflammatory agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} some {{commonly}} used anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic {{drugs on the}} inflammatory and immunological manifestations of type II collagen-induced arthritis in rats were studied. Among the anti-inflammatory drugs tested at a given dosage (mg/kg/day), benoxaprofen (10), aspirin (25) and indomethacin (3) inhibited the hind paw swelling and anti-type II collagen antibody formation in type II collagen-treated rats. Benoxaprofen also inhibited the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to type II collagen. Phenylbutazone (30) and fenoprofen (40) partially suppressed the paw swelling, but had no significant effect on humoral and cellular responses. Among the other anti-arthritic drugs, levamisol (25), chloroquine (25) and D-penicillamine significantly suppressed the paw swelling, anti-type II collagen antibody titres and DTH response. Gold chlorophosphene (10) and colchicine (3) {{had no effect on}} any of these three parameters. <b>Paramethasone</b> (0. 1), cyclophosphamide (1) and azathioprine (10) were very effective when dosed daily, or once (at a different dose) 72 hr prior to immunization with type II collagen...|$|E
40|$|Cultured rabbit peritoneal macrophages, after {{stimulation}} with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), {{produce a}} factor that induces normal rabbit articular cartilage cells (chondrocytes) to release collagenase and other neutral proteases in their culture medium. The release of the factor {{as well as the}} activation of chondrocytes can be significantly inhibited by <b>paramethasone</b> (10 (- 6) M). Rabbit peripheral blood monocytes produce this factor in smaller quantities. Activation with LPS does not enhance the release of factor any further by these cells. Lymphocytes have no direct effect on the chondrocytic protease synthesis. Furthermore, conditioned medium of activated lymphocytes failed to stimulate monocytes or macrophages in the absence of LPS. The macrophage medium exhibits mitogenic and phytohaemagglutinin-enhancing activity towards thymocytes of C 3 H/HeJ mice, but not against species-specific rabbit lymphocytes. The lymphocyte-activating factor, derived from a mouse macrophage cell line, P 388 D 1 cells, or from other sources, was unable to stimulate chondrocytic protease secretion. Such specific induction of chondrocytic proteases by a macrophage-derived factor may have an important role in cartilage destruction in arthritic conditions, where synovium is only marginally involved...|$|E
40|$|Of 180 {{cases with}} acute and chronic {{hepatitis}} and liver cirrhosis treated with glucocorticoids, 33 cases of steroid diabetets {{were selected for}} this study. Atmpts were done on the relation of a mode of occurrence and the clinical feature of steroid diabetes to pathologic changes of the liver. The results were as follows: 1) Steroid diabetes was found in seven cases of 39 acute hepatitis (17. 9 %), nine of 65 chronic hepatitis (13. 0 %) and 17 of 72 liver cirrhosis. 2) The incidence of steroid diabetes was slightly high in the obese cases and patients with serum hepatitis, and significantly high in patients with diabetic desposition. 3) There {{was no significant difference}} among Prednisolone, Dexamethasone and <b>Paramethasone</b> in the incidence of steroid diabetes. Although the cases treated with both Norandrostenolone phenylpropionate and Androstanolone showed no differece from those with glucocorticoid alone, the cases treated with the combination of Oxymetholone showed extremely high incidence of steroid diabetes. (eight of 17 cases; 47. 1 %) 4) Steroid diabetes could be classified into two types; early developed and lately developed type, according to the time of developmnt and the clinical feature The former showed clinical findings of diabetes. On the contrally, no diabetic findings were shown in the latter. 5) In liver cirrhosis, more early developed types of steroid diabetes were found and in acute and chronic hepatitis, no difference was seen in the incidence of the two types. 6) In the early developed type, a considerable number of cases showed heredity of diabetes, obesity, fatty degeneation of the liver cells and vacuole degeneration of nuclei at a punch biopsy, and abnormal glucose tolerance test (not diabetic) before the treatment of glucocorticoids. On the other hand, the lately developed type did not show those above mentioned. 7) Diabetic desposition or latent diabetes and abnormal glucose metabolism caused by a original disease were found in many of the early developed type, and few in the lately developed type. It is presumed that these differences played a important role in the time of the development and the clinical feature of steroid diabetes. 8) The incidence and the clinical feature of steroid diabetes, and the time of onset and disappearance of glycosuria were not always closely related to the degree of the disturbance of liverfunctions. However, they were closely related to the fatty degeneration of the liver cells and vacuole degeneration of the nuclei. 9) In many cases of steroid diabetes, the fatty degeneration of the liver cells and vacuole degeneration of the nuclei appeared or progressed after the glucocorticoids treatment. However, no tendency was seen in distribution of fat in acini of the liver...|$|E
