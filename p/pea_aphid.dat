25|$|Less {{is known}} about {{secondary}} endosymbionts. The <b>pea</b> <b>aphid</b> (Acyrthosiphon pisum) is known to contain at least three secondary endosymbionts, Hamiltonella defensa, Regiella insecticola, and Serratia symbiotica. H. defensa aids in defending the insect from parasitoids. Sodalis glossinidius is a secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies that lives inter- and intracellularly in various host tissues, including the midgut and hemolymph. Phylogenetic studies have not indicated a correlation between evolution of Sodalis and tsetse. Unlike tsetse's P-symbiont Wigglesworthia, though, Sodalis has been cultured in vitro.|$|E
25|$|Among primary endosymbionts of insects, the best-studied are the <b>pea</b> <b>aphid</b> (Acyrthosiphon pisum) and its endosymbiont Buchnera sp. APS, the {{tsetse fly}} Glossina morsitans morsitans and its endosymbiont Wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis and the endosymbiotic protists in lower termites. As with endo{{symbiosis}} in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate in {{that neither the}} bacteria nor the insect is viable without the other. Scientists {{have been unable to}} cultivate the bacteria in lab conditions outside of the insect. With special nutritionally-enhanced diets, the insects can survive, but are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.|$|E
25|$|In {{heteroecious}} species, the aphids spend winter on tree or bush primary hosts; in summer, they {{migrate to}} their secondary host on a herbaceous plant, then the gynoparae {{return to the}} tree in autumn. The <b>pea</b> <b>aphid</b> has a primary host of a perennial vetch and secondary of the annual pea. This is likely due to the decline of food quality in trees during the summer, as well as overcrowding amongst aphids which they sense when they bump into each other too often. The heteroecious life cycle (which is mainly linked to consumption of angiosperms and represents 10% of all aphids) {{is believed to have}} evolved from the ancestral autoecious form (on conifers); this is believed to have reverted to the ancestral form in some species that were once heteroecious.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pea</b> <b>aphids</b> (Acyrthosiphon pisum) contain {{multiple}} genes from fungi. Plants, fungi, and microorganisms can synthesize carotenoids, but torulene made by <b>pea</b> <b>aphids</b> {{is the only}} carotenoid known to be synthesized by an organism in the animal kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Some parasites {{manipulate}} {{the behavior of}} their host, causing them to expose themselves to greater risks of predation to enable the parasite to proceed to the next life-cycle stage. Some carpenter ants and termites use autothysis, producing a sticky secretion to trap colony marauders, and <b>pea</b> <b>aphids</b> will sometimes explode, protecting other <b>pea</b> <b>aphids</b> from ladybugs.|$|R

50|$|More than 20 legume genera {{are known}} to host <b>pea</b> <b>aphids,</b> though the {{complete}} host range remains undetermined. On crops such as peas and alfalfa, A. pisum is considered among the aphid species or major agronomical importance. Yields can {{be affected by the}} sap intake that directly weakens plants, although <b>pea</b> <b>aphids</b> seldom reach densities that might significantly reduce crop production. However, like many aphid species, A. pisum can be a vector of viral diseases to the plants it visits. Protection against <b>pea</b> <b>aphids</b> includes the use of chemical insecticides, natural predators and parasitoids, and the selection of resistant cultivars. No insecticide resistance is documented in A. pisum, as opposed to many aphid pests.|$|R
50|$|Acyrthosiphon pisum is {{a rather}} large aphid whose body can reach 4 mm in adults. It {{generally}} feeds on the lower sides of leaves, buds and pods of legumes, ingesting phloem sap through its stylets.

It is very similar in {{appearance}} to the closely related <b>pea</b> <b>aphid</b> (Acyrthosiphon pisum), but is often a more bluish shade of green. One significant difference from the <b>pea</b> <b>aphid</b> is that the blue alfalfa aphid has uniformly dark-coloured antennae. Both wingless and winged female forms occur, with the winged aphids being able to disperse and colonise new plants. Males also sometimes occur, are smaller than females, and are green with brown markings on head, thorax and abdomen.|$|E

50|$|Population densities are {{at their}} highest in early summer, then {{decrease}} through predation and parasitism. In autumn, the lengthening of the night triggers {{the production of a}} single generation of sexual individuals (males and oviparous females) by the same parthenogenetic parent females. Inseminated sexual females will lay overwintering eggs, from which new parthenogenetic females will emerge in early spring.When the colony begins to become overcrowded, some winged females are produced. These disperse to infest other plants, where they continue to reproduce asexually. When temperatures become colder and day lengths shorter, sexual winged females and males appear. These mate, the females lay diapausing eggs and the life cycle starts again. <b>Pea</b> <b>aphids</b> can complete their whole reproductive cycle without shifting host plant.Several morphs exists in <b>pea</b> <b>aphids.</b> Besides differences between sexual and parthenogenetic morphs, winged and wingless morphs exist. Overcrowding and poor food quality may trigger the development of winged individuals in subsequent generations. Winged aphids can then colonize other host plants. <b>Pea</b> <b>aphids</b> also show hereditary body color variations of green or red/pink. The green morphs are generally more frequent in natural populations.|$|R

50|$|Pea aphids, {{although}} collectively {{designated by}} the single scientific name A. pisum, encompass several biotypes described as cryptic species, subspecies or races, which are specialized on different host species. Therefore, the <b>pea</b> <b>aphid</b> is more accurately described as a species complex.|$|E
50|$|A {{native of}} Asia, the species {{has spread to}} other parts of the world {{including}} North America, South America, Australia and New Zealand; it was first detected in the United States in California in 1974 and had spread to Nebraska by 1979, Georgia and Kentucky by 1983 and Maryland by 1992. It is mainly a pest of plants in the Leguminosae family including alfalfa, pea, lentil and cowpea. Its host range in North America is very similar to that of the <b>pea</b> <b>aphid,</b> however, it is seen earlier in the spring and is more tolerant of cool weather than the <b>pea</b> <b>aphid.</b> As populations build up, they are increasingly affected by entomopathogenic fungi and parasitoids, with populations peaking and stabilising. Hot summer weather, with temperatures averaging above , favours the plants' natural resistance mechanisms, and numbers of aphids reduce sharply.|$|E
40|$|The {{infestation}} of <b>peas</b> by <b>aphids</b> and moths {{was assessed}} in winter pea sole crops and compared to spring pea sole and winter pea-triticale intercrops.

The maximum number of <b>pea</b> <b>aphids</b> per plant {{and the percentage of}} attacked plants were lower in semi-leafless and normal-leafed winter pea sole crops than in semi-leafless spring peas. Pea moth larvae damaged 6 - 32 % of seeds in winter peas and 40 - 55 % of seeds in spring peas. Winter pea-triticale intercropping reduced the attack of <b>pea</b> <b>aphids,</b> whereas no beneficial effect of intercropping was observed concerning moth-damaged peas. Owing to the earlier maturity, winter peas were less susceptible to pea pest attacks than spring peas. Winter-pea intercropping is a partially effective method for pest control in peas...|$|R

50|$|Buchnera {{are housed}} in specialized, aphid-derived cells located in the hemocoel of the A. pisum body cavity. Each Buchnera cell has an inner and outer gram-negative cell {{membrane}} and is individually enclosed in an aphid-derived symbiosomal membrane. These encased cells are then grouped into specialized, aphid-derived bacteriocytes (mycetocytes). Bacteriocytes are large, polyploid cells surrounded by a thin lining of flat sheath cells. There are about 60-80 bacteriocytes in each <b>pea</b> <b>aphid</b> and are organized into the bi-lobed bacteriome. A bacteriome is a specialized organ that runs {{along the length of}} the <b>pea</b> <b>aphid</b> on two sides of the body and joins near the hindgut.Bacteriocytes are located near the ovariole cluster and Buchnera cells are vertically transferred from the mother’s ovaries through transovarial transmission.

50|$|Polymorphism and {{physiology}} explaining phenotypic variations in aphids - Loci and physiological mechanisms underlying body color, reproductive cycle {{and the presence}} of wings in males (which is genetically based) have been identified in <b>pea</b> <b>aphids</b> or are being investigated. A. pisum is notable for being the only animal organism so-far identified that has the ability to synthesize a carotenoid. Plants, fungi, and microorganisms can synthesize carotenoids, but torulene (3',4'-didehydro-β,γ-carotene, specifically a hydrocarbon carotene) made by <b>pea</b> <b>aphids,</b> is the only carotenoid known to be synthesized by an organism in the animal kingdom. Torulene imparts natural, red-colored patches to some aphids, which possibly aid in their camouflage and escape from predation by wasps.

40|$|The aphid alarm {{pheromone}} {{is known}} to trigger wing induction in <b>pea</b> <b>aphids</b> (Acyrthosiphon pisum). In reaction to alarm pheromone, aphids drop off the plant or walk away. While searching for a new feeding site they repeatedly encounter {{other members of the}} aphid colony and this increased contact rate is assumed to be important for wing induction ("pseudo-crowding" hypothesis). Because the encounter rate is a function of aphid colony size, wing induction in aphids {{in the presence of a}} predator should be a function of the number of aphids on the plant. We placed two, seven or 13 adult <b>pea</b> <b>aphids</b> on bean plants, and exposed the different-sized colonies to synthetic alarm pheromone to test the density-dependence of predator-induced wing induction. The mean percentage of winged morphs among the offspring produced on the plants ranged from 10 to 80 percent and increased both with aphid number and exposure to alarm pheromone. There was no synergy between aphid number and alarm pheromone exposure indicating that both factors are additive. The implications for aphid metapopulation dynamics are discussed...|$|R
