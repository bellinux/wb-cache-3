40|$|The {{influence}} of model flexibility upon simulated viscosity was investigated. NEMD simulations of viscosity {{were performed on}} seven pure fluids using three different models for each: one with rigid bonds and angles, one with flexible angles and rigid bonds, and one with flexible bonds and angles. Three nonpolar fluids (propane, n-butane and isobutane), two moderately polar fluids (<b>propyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and acetone), and two strongly polar fluids (methanol and water) were studied. Internal flexibility had little effect upon the simulated viscosity of nonpolar fluids. While model flexibility did affect the simulated viscosity of the polar fluids, it did so principally by allowing a density-dependent change in the dipole moment of the fluid. By using a rigid model with the same geometry and dipole moment as the average flexible molecule at the same density, it was shown that the direct effect of flexibility is small even in polar fluids. It was concluded that internal model flexibility does not [...] ...|$|E

Besides applications in catalysis, ionosilicas offer great opportunities in the fields of separation and molecular recognition. The chapter emphasizes that ionosilicas should be considered as a distinct family in the area of silica hybrid materials. Surface-functionalized ionosilicas are generally synthesized either via postsynthesis grafting or hydrolysis–cocondensation reactions involving trialkoxysilylated ionic precursors. The chapter illustrates the two different synthetic methods involving a monosilylated imidazolium precursor 3 -methyl- 1 -(3 -(triethoxysilyl) <b>propyl)</b> -imidazolium <b>chloride.</b> Cocondensation reactions involving ionic compounds are of particular interest in soft templating approaches to nanostructured ionosilicas as the ionic nature of the precursor offers the possibility to induce modified precursor–surfactant interactions...|$|R

Detailed insight in the hydrolysis polycondensation behaviour of this precursor was obtained via co-condensation reactions of the ionic precursor with a silica network former tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). It appears that the formation of nanostructured phases in the presence of anionic surfactants can be explained by ionic interactions between the template and the organo-cationic substructure of the imidazolium precursor in the hydrolysis polycondensation mixture.

To address these problems, we devised an oral delivery system for telomerase reverse transcriptase siRNA using N-((2 -hydroxy- 3 -trimethylammonium) <b>propyl)</b> chitosan <b>chloride</b> (HTCC) nanoparticles (HNP). Both the porous {{structure and the}} positive charge of HNP facilitated siRNA encapsulation. The outer coating of HTCC not only protected siRNA from enzymatic degradation, but also improved siRNA permeability in intestine tract. In vivo and in vitro experiments proved that HNP could effectively deliver siRNA to lesion site and further into tumor cells. On the basis of confirming the antitumor activity of HNP:siRNA, we continued to encapsulate a hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug-paclitaxel (PTX) into HNP to form a "two-in-one" nano-complex (HNP:siRNA/PTX). We demonstrated that HNP:siRNA/PTX could simultaneously ferry siRNA and PTX into tumor cells and increase drug concentration, which, in particular, was much more effective in tumor suppression than that of traditional cocktail therapy. These results suggested that the HNP, as a powerful delivery system for both siRNA and chemotherapeutic drug, would have a far-reaching application in human cancer therapy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Combining two solutions of oppositely charged diblock copolymers, PMPC-b-PMAPTAC and PMPC-b-PAMPS, led to the spontaneous formation of polyion complex vesicles (PICsomes). The PICsomes were characterized using 1 H NMR, static abd dynamic light scattering, transmittance electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy.

These nanoparticles were small (similar to 130 nm), had a narrow size distribution, and displayed high loading efficiency owing to the homogeneous distribution of PTX nanocrystals. The matrix hydrophilicity and porous structure of the obtained nanoparticles accelerated their degradation and improved drug release. In vitro and in vivo transport experiments had proved {{that the presence of}} positive charges enhanced the intestinal permeability of these nanoparticles. Further in vitro experiment of cytotoxicity showed that the PTX-loaded HTCC nanoparticle (HTCC-NP:PTX) was more effective than native PTX owing to enhanced cellular uptake.

Subsequent tumor xenograft assays demonstrated the promising therapeutic effect of HTCC-NP:PTX on inhibition of tumor growth and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells.

The present study was aimed at answering this question. To this end, we complexed N-(1 -(2, 3 -dioleoyloxy) <b>propyl)</b> -N,N,N-trimethylammonium <b>chloride</b> (DOTAP) liposomes, in dispersion, with either 18 -mer phosphorothiote homo-oligonucleotides composed of either adenine, thymidine or cytosine; or one of three structurally related 18 -mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (S-ODNs) (G 3139, its reverse sequence and its two-base mismatch). After ODN addition to vesicles at different mole ratios, changes in pH and electrical surface potential at the lipid^water interface were analyzed by using the fluorophore heptadecyl- 7 -hydroxycoumarin while particle size distributions were analyzed by static-light scattering. The results indicate that each homo-oligonucleotide does indeed exhibit different complexation behavior. In particular, the maximal level of DOTAP neutralization by the polyadenine S-ODN is much lower than that for the two other homo-oligonucleotides and hence its lipoplex is much more positively charged. Much smaller electrostatic differences are also apparent between lipoplexes formed from each of the G 3139 -related ODNs.

40|$|G 3139 is an {{antisense}} oligonucleotide (ODN) that can down-regulate bcl- 2, thus potentially {{acting as a}} potent anticancer drug. However, effective therapy requires efficient ODN delivery, which may be achieved by employing G 3139 lipoplexes. Yet, lipofection is a complex, multifactorial process that is still poorly understood. In order to shed more light on this issue, we prepared 18 different G 3139 lipoplex formulations and compared {{them in terms of}} their capability to transfect MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. Each formulation was composed of a cationic lipid and sometimes a helper lipid. The cationic lipid was either DOTAP (N-(1 -(2, 3 -dioleoyloxy) <b>propyl)</b> -N,N,N-trimethylammonium <b>chloride),</b> DC-CHOL (3 β[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane) carbamoyl]-cholesterol), or CCS (ceramide carbomoyl spermine). The helper lipid was either DOPC, DOPE, or cholesterol.

Cell proliferation assays were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of G 3139 lipoplexes, control cationic lipid assemblies, and free G 3139. Western blots were used to confirm the specific activity of G 3139 as an anti-bcl- 2 antisense agent.

The interaction was evaluated using atomic force microscopy (AFM), gel electrophoresis and HPLC analysis. Cytofluorimetric analysis and fluorescence microscopy were applied to evaluate the uptake and intracellular distribution of fluorescently labelled PS-ODN after transfection in two cell lines, COS I (fibroblast cell) and HaCaT (immortalized keratinocyte cell). The AFM studies reveal that the liposome/PS-ODN interaction leads {{the formation of a}} new irregular structure that completely hides the PS-ODN. Gel electrophoresis experiments and HPLC analysis have clearly demonstrated that also neutral liposomes are able to keep a little amount of PS-ODN but without strain to the complexation; the interaction was weak and rapidly destabilized when the complex was added to the cells. Transfection experiments performed with different incubation times show that DOTAP liposomes increase the rate of cellular uptake of PS-ODN and seem to influence its intracellular distribution in COS I cells where the oligonucleotide looks localized in nucleoli.

The transfection efficiency was dependent on the lamellarity of the liposomes used to prepare the lipoplexes. Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) were more effective than large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of ∼ 100 nm, irrespective of lipid composition. The optimal DNA/DOTAP mole ratio for transfection was ≤ 0. 5, at which only 10 – 30 % of DOTAP in the lipoplex is neutralized. Prolonged incubation time of lipoplexes before addition to cells slightly decreased the level of transfection. A major influence on the lipofection level was found when the mode of lipoplex preparation was varied. Mixing plasmid DNA and DOTAP/DOPE (1 : 1) LUV in two steps instead of one step resulted in a higher lipofection when at the first step the DNA/DOTAP mole ratio was 0. 5 than when it was 2. 0. Only static light-scattering measurement, which is related to particle size and particle size instability, revealed differences between the lipoplexes {{as a function of}} lamellarity of the vesicles (MLV or LUV), mixing order, and number of mixing steps. Other physical properties of these lipoplexes were dependent only on the DNA/DOTAP mole ratio, i. e. the extent of DOTAP neutralization (as monitored by ionization of the fluorophore 4 -heptadecyl- 7 -hydroxycoumarin) and the extent of defects in lipid organization (as monitored by level of exposure of the fluorophore 1 -(4 -trimethylammoniumphenyl) - 6 -phenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene to water). The secondary and tertiary structure of DNA in lipoplexes was evaluated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results of this study point out that the structure of lipoplexes should be physicochemically characterized at two different levels: the macro level, which relates to size and size instability, and the micro level, which relates to the properties described above which are involved in the intimate interaction between the plasmid DNA and the lipids. At the micro level, all parameters are reversible, history-independent and are determined by DNA/DOTAP mole ratio.

Water bodies are being compromised due to inadequate remediation technologies available. Conventional technologies are known to cause secondary pollution upon usage, which is of serious concern as they do not eliminate the predicament. Non-conventional methods are being considered because they are environmentally friendly and cost efficient. Dyes are one of the primary pollutants of water resources being very toxic and when discharged into the environment, they pose a threat to human and animal health due to their tetragenic, mutagenic and carcinogenic potentials. This study explores the use of microorganisms in bioremediation of dyes. In doing so, four bacteria viz: Gram-negative (i. e., E. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (i. e.,Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillaceae bacterium) were used. The bacteria were subjected to physical pre-treatment using an autoclave, mechanical pretreatment by grinding the inactive biomass and lastly, chemical pre-treatment using chemicals such as nitric acid, <b>propyl</b> amine, calcium <b>chloride</b> and ammonia. The pre-treatment techniques were applied to investigate their effect on the adsorption of dye. The Lagergren pseudo second-order kinetic was used to deduce the adsorption capacities as it was the best fit, implying that adsorption occurred by the chermisoption mechanism. The adsorption capacities of the bacteria improved tremendously from 68. 49 to 161. 29 mg/g in comparison to that of the untreated biomass (9. 37 to 29. 11 mg/g). It was also observed that in untreated biomass, no methyl orange (MO) adsorption took place whereas in treated biomass, bacteria had the ability to absorb and remove MO.

High photosynthetic efficiency, combined with high lipid content and low fresh water requirement, has contributed to the 2 ̆ 7 biofuels feedstock 2 ̆ 7 status of microalgae. In some communities, microalgae have also been cultivated in wastewater in facultative lagoons to remove phosphorus and nitrogen through the growth of microalgae. With such systems in place, complete biological wastewater treatment can be achieved and the harvested microalgae could provide feedstock for biodiesel and various other bioproducts. Due to small cell size, low culture concentrations, and the electrostatic repulsive forces that keep the cells in suspension, harvesting microalgae entails high energy inputs and associated high costs. Of the several harvesting methods tested, chemical precipitation {{has been shown to be}} the only method to harvest microalgae on a large scale. Although effective in wastewater treatment, the use of inorganic metal coagulants for microalgae harvesting leads to high dosage requirements, excess volume of sludge, and high costs, and due to the presence of associated metal hydroxide, the harvested biomass is unsuitable as feedstock for bioproducts. The drawbacks of inorganic coagulants for microalgae harvesting can be overcome by using cationic starch. Corn and potato starch were cationized using 3 -methacryloyl amino <b>propyl</b> trimethyl ammonium <b>chloride</b> and biogenic amines. Flocculation efficiencies of the cationic starches were tested in a jar test apparatus using single strain microalga, Scenedesmus obliquus, and mixed culture wastewater from the Logan City, Utah lagoons. Cationic starches showed better or comparable removal of total suspended solids compared to aluminum sulfate. Total phosphorus removal efficiencies for cationic starches were lower compared to aluminum sulfate. Effect of cationic starch harvested and alum harvested S. obliquus on biodiesel, acetone, butanol, ethanol production, and Escherichia coli growth was also studied. Results suggested significantly higher yields of bioproducts when cationic starch was used to harvest microalgae and the biomass was used as feedstock.
