25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1980s, glasses with large, <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> were in fashion for both men and women. Small metal framed {{eyeglasses}} made a return to fashion in 1984 and 1985, and in the late 1980s, glasses with tortoise-shell coloring became popular. These were smaller and rounder than the type that was popular earlier in the decade. Throughout the 1980s, Ray-Ban Wayfarers were extremely popular, as worn by Tom Cruise in the 1983 movie Risky Business.|$|E
25|$|Other celebrities {{have used}} glasses to {{differentiate}} {{themselves from the}} characters they play, such as Anne Kirkbride, who wore oversized, 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as Deirdre Barlow in the soap opera Coronation Street, and Masaharu Morimoto, who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a chef from his stage persona as Iron Chef Japanese. In 2012 some NBA players wear lensless glasses with thick <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> like horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic that draws comparisons to Steve Urkel.|$|E

The {{design and construction}} of that aluminum plate was critical to ensuring an even temperature distribution with no hot or cool spots across the flat, rectangular cell. The battery pack has its own cooling circuit that is similar to, but independent from, the engine cooling system." ...|$|E

The glass aquarium is standard for sizes up to about [...] However, glass as a material is brittle and has very little give before fracturing, though generally the sealant fails first.

50|$|At {{one point}} {{it had a}} factory that {{produced}} <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> for glasses and raised chinchillas for their fur. Both endeavours were economic failures. The village also houses an archaeological museum (named after Ami Saull, father of Dror Shaul) displaying artifacts found in the surrounding area. Kissufim is currently undergoing a process of privatization in which homes will soon be owned by individuals rather than the collective.|$|E
50|$|Crutches {{are limited}} to what type of frames they can be placed on. Both metal and <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> can be used, but may have limitations. A skilled {{craftsman}} can successfully install Ptosis eye crutches to almost any frame. The upper eyewire must {{be close to the}} orbit of the eyelid. Frames with large or small B measurements may be difficult to work with for Ptosis crutches.|$|E

50|$|Means {{of holding}} the bladder walls apart to {{encourage}} drying between uses are available, such as a <b>plastic</b> <b>frame</b> that collapses {{to pass through the}} fill opening, but expands inside the bladder to hold the sides apart even near the corners.|$|R

50|$|Polaroid filters in {{disposable}} cardboard frames were typical {{during the}} 1950s, but more comfortable <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> with somewhat larger filters, considerably more expensive {{for the theater}} owner, were also in use. Patrons were normally instructed to turn them in when leaving {{so that they could}} be sanitized and reissued, and it was not uncommon for ushers to be stationed at the exits to attempt to collect them from forgetful or souvenir-loving patrons.|$|E

5000|$|The Flow Hive is a {{proprietary}} {{design for a}} beehive launched in 2015 on Indiegogo. It {{was based on a}} design by father and son team of beekeepers and inventors, Stuart and Cedar Anderson from Australia to find a way of extracting honey from comb without the need to open the hive. The system uses food-grade <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> which can be split using a special tool and the honey then flows into containers without the need to remove any frames.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} horn-rimmed glasses, browline glasses, {{became one of}} the {{defining}} eyeglass styles of the 1940s and 1950s. Invented in 1947, the style combined the aesthetics of horn-rimmed glasses with the stability of metal frames by fitting prominent plastic [...] "brows" [...] over the tops of metal frames, creating a distinctive look that was also sturdier than solid <b>plastic</b> <b>frames.</b> Browlines quickly became popular in post-World War II America, and composed half of all eyeglass sales throughout the 1950s. Ray-Ban introduced the Wayfarer sunglasses in 1952.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{versions}} of the device available. The original TNR-W (Tenori-On White) features a magnesium frame, 256 rear panel LEDs and can run on batteries whilst the more affordable TNR-O (Tenori-On Orange) features a white <b>plastic</b> <b>frame,</b> has no rear LEDs and does not take batteries. The modes and sound sets in these instruments are the same.|$|R

5000|$|Browlines {{continued}} to remain popular through the 1960s, but their market influence slowly waned throughout the decade as advances in plastics manufacturing offered wearers even further frame customization via solid plastic eyeglasses, which {{could now be}} made in more shapes, sizes, and colors than in the past. Wearers who wished to wear <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> but still liked the browline style flocked to [...] "plastic browlines," [...] plastic glasses with transparent lower portions and solid upper portions, which became a major frame style of the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Most aquaria {{consist of}} glass panes bonded {{together}} by 100% silicone sealant, with <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> {{attached to the}} upper and lower edges for decoration.

50|$|The mouse bungee {{consists}} of a wide, stable base plate with non-slip bottom and a crane-like, oblique, sprung clamp for the cable, which rises about 10 cm high. In <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> a stabilization weight is incorporated, which ensures the necessary weight. Ideally, it {{is in front of}} the Mouse and the cable length is manually set so that the entire mouse pad can be easily reached with the mouse, but does not create unnecessary loops or loops in the cable. The back of the cable remains lying quiet and safe on the table without causing an annoyance.|$|E
50|$|Ultrastars {{are also}} single-column pistols, which is {{unusual for a}} newly {{designed}} pistol these days, and helps make the gun slim and comfortable. They could have been designed even more slim, but instead there is significant thickness, with reinforcing webs, under each grip area. This gives the frame a very solid feel, something lacking in many other <b>plastic</b> <b>framed</b> pistols.|$|R
