40|$|A Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (<b>PHICH)</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} element of the Long Term Evolution (LTE), Release 8 communication system. Via the <b>PHICH,</b> a Hybrid ARQ Indicator (HI) acknowledge message is transmitted. The HI informs the result if the previous data transfer in uplink direction. Imperfect protection of <b>PHICH</b> transfer can cause superfluous repetitions of incorrect confirmed data and uplink overhead grows. In the paper, the <b>PHICH</b> signal processing and performance results of a single HI message in AWGN and fading channel models are presented depending on the representative antenna modes. The performance results for a number of HI messages greater than one within a single <b>PHICH</b> group, have not been found...|$|E

The performance of the proposed receiver structures for the physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) and the physical hybrid-ARQ indicator channel (<b>PHICH)</b> is analyzed for various fading-channel models and MIMO schemes including space frequency block codes (SFBC). Analytical expressions for the average probability of error are derived {{for each of these}} physical channels. The impact of channel-estimation error on the orthogonality of the spreading codes applied to users in a <b>PHICH</b> group is investigated, and an expression for the signal-to-self interference plus noise ratio is derived for Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) systems. Finally, a matched filter bound on the probability of error for the <b>PHICH</b> in a multipath fading channel is derived. The analytical results are validated against computer simulations. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRealization of {{transmitter}} {{and receiver}} architecture for LTE is the major research work being carried out by implementation experts. There are four Control channels available in LTE for both uplink and downlink. The uplink control channel is PUCCH. The downlink control channels are PDCCH, PCFICH and <b>PHICH.</b> The Physical Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Indicator Channel(PHICH) is the control channel which carries the acknowledgement (ACK/NACK), denoted as Hybrid ARQ Indicator(HI). These control channels {{play a key role}} in the correct decoding of the payload information. The HI is used to indicate the ACK for data sent using Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), and is important for the system performance. In this paper, the realization of architecture for the <b>PHICH</b> are done using FPGA, where the main aim is to estimate the HI correctly in the receiver side. The simulations are done using Modelsim and are implemented in Xilinx Spartan 3 E kit...|$|E
40|$|LTE-A (Long Term Evolution-Advanced) is {{the fourth}} {{generation}} technology {{to increase the speed}} of wireless data network. The LTE-A Physical layer provides both data and control information between an enhanced base station and mobile user equipment which is quite complex and consists of a mixture of technologies. Since there is requirement for more resources to accommodate all the channels in a single FPGA, Partial Reconfiguration (PR) technique is introduced to configure the total hardware into sub modules that configure and operate in different instants of time. PR enables a part of FPGA to be reconfigured, while the rest continues to function without any interruptions and reduces the hardware resource power and fabric area. This work proposes the realization of transmitter and receiver architecture of Physical Hybrid Indicator Channel (<b>PHICH)</b> channel for LTE-A using partial reconfiguration on xc 6 vlx 240 tff 1156 - 1 FPGA. The receiver architecture for <b>PHICH</b> is to report the correct reception of uplink user data to the User Equipment (UE) in the form of Acknowledgment (ACK), or Negative ACK (NACK) in a 1 millisecond duration sub-frame of Long Term Evolution (LTE) System. The modules for the different diversities are reconfigured based on the control signals from the transmitter...|$|E
40|$|As mobile {{communication}} technologies have evolved rapidly {{during the last}} few years, wireless communication standards such as WiMax and LTE are developed with the need of new services on mobile devices. In this thesis, the design and implementation of the encoder and decoder of Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel(PHICH) of LTE are presented. <b>PHICH</b> carries Acknowledgements(ACKs) and Negative Acknowledgements(NACKs) from the base station (eNodeB) to the mobile devices (UE). The encoder is designed to encode the ACK/NACK sent from the base station to the UE while the decoder is designed to decode the encoded data and provide control information for the UE. The encoder and decoder are implemented in MATLAB...|$|E
30|$|In our {{previous}} work in IEEE 802.16, the channel capacity {{was assumed to}} be static, and the threshold of data accumulation (DATA_TH) was practically set as the size of a time frame (i.e., the number of bits that can be carried in a time frame). In LTE, the channel capacity varies due to the adaptively selected Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) for each UE. LTE eNB typically selects MCS for a UE depending on a prediction of the DL channel condition, which is according to the channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback transmitted by that UE. 3 GPP gives a table of reference for efficiency of each CQI index as shown in Table  1. The estimation of the channel capacity of LTE is therefore based on the CQI report from the UE and the corresponding efficiency value in Table  1. Moreover, since LTE physical control channels (such as PDCCH, PCFICH, and <b>PHICH)</b> also make use of the REs in the TTI, estimation of the capacity for the user data should exclude the REs reserved for the control channels.|$|E

40|$|Long Term Evolution (LTE) {{defines a}} number of {{physical}} channels to carry information blocks received from the MAC and higher layers. This paper presents two types of Physical channels: the first type is downlink physical channels which consist of Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH), Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH), Physical Multicast Channel (PMCH), Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH) and Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (<b>PHICH).</b> The second type of Physical channels is uplink physical channels which consist of Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) and Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH).

40|$|THE nociceptin {{derivative}} [Phe(1) <b>Phi(CH</b> 2 -NH) Gly(2) ]-nociceptin-(1 - 13) -NH 2 (Phe Phi noc) {{has been}} reported to act either as a simple antagonist or as a full agonist at the opioid receptor-like (ORL 1) receptor. In the present study, we identified the expression of the ORL 1 receptor in murine N 1 E- 115 neuroblastoma cells and used this neuronal system to investigate the pharmacological activity of Phe Phi noc. Like nociceptin, Phe Phi noc stimulated the binding of [S- 35]GTP gamma S (EC 50 = 120 nM) and inhibited forskolin-stimulated [H- 3]cAMP formation (EC 50 = 3. 3 nM). However, Phe Phi noc elicited maximal effects lower than those induced by nociceptin, and when combined with nociceptin potently antagonized the responses to the natural agonist (K-i = 0. 9 nM). These data indicate that Phe Phi noc acts as a partial agonist at the ORL 1 receptor endogenously expressed in N 1 E- 115 cells.

40|$|Abstract—Physical Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) Indicator Channel (<b>PHICH)</b> is used {{to report}} the correct {{reception}} of the uplink user data to the User Equipment (UE) {{in the form of}} Acknowledgment (ACK) or Negative ACK (NACK). In Long Term Evolution –Advanced (LTE-A) base station and UE have multiple antenna ports to provide transmit and receive diversities. An algorithm for decoding the HARQ value at UE is designed using maximum likelihood (ML) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) methods. Further, novel low complexity receiver architectures based on the VLSI Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques- folding method and parallel processing with folding method to reduce the operational units is proposed to reduce resource consumption. Tradeoff analysis of the proposed structures in terms of the timing cycles, operational resource requirement and resource complexity is discussed. The proposed system is optimal compared to other possible ways as it employs parallel processing with folding approach. It is a suitable solution for the area optimized hardware implementation of physical downlink channel receiver structures LTE-A whose delay results also meet the frame timing constraint. The proposed architectures are used to implement in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Virtex- 5 xc 5 vlx 50 tff 1136 - 1 device for single/multiple antenna configurations at base station and UE...|$|E
40|$|The 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) {{introduced}} Long Term Evolution (LTE) as the 3 rd {{generation of}} mobile communication standards. LTE Release 8 describes a mobile communication standard which supports up to 300 Mbps of data transmission in downlink using the OFDM scheme {{as well as}} up to 75 Mbps throughput for uplink using the SC-FDMA modulation. In this thesis, an in-depth study of LTE performance based on Release 8 is conducted for uplink and downlink under different scenarios. The main objective {{of this study is}} to investigate a comprehensive analysis of physical layer throughput of LTE Release 8 based on standard parameters for different channel bandwidths, duplex schemes, antenna diversity and other scenarios. Our study of the FDD operation mode shows that the maximum throughput for downlink data is 299. 122 by using 4 antenna ports with the least possible control overhead (one OFDM symbol assigned to PDCCH), 64 -QAM data modulation scheme, the maximum code rate (0. 92), and the maximum channel bandwidth (20 MHz). This throughput result is based on PDSCH that is used for data transmission only and does not include control information (PDCCH, <b>PHICH,</b> and PCFICH), broadcast channel (PBCH), reference signals, and Synchronization Signals (P-SS and S-SS). Our study also shows that the maximum uplink throughput for the FDD operation is 71. 97 Mbps excluding control channel information (PUCCH), and reference signals (demodulation reference signals and sounding reference signal). This maximum throughput result is based on assuming 64 -QAM data modulation, maximum bandwidth (20 MHz), and 0. 85 code rate. This study also presents other throughput results based on different parameters. Overall, this thesis provides a comprehensive investigation of the LTE performance analysis based on detailed physical layer parameters to fill the existing gap in current literature in performance study of LTE...|$|E
