This observation violates the game-theoretic principle that timing of unobserved moves is irrelevant. We extend this work by varying timing of unobservable moves in ultimatum bargaining games and "weak link" coordination games. Timing without observability affects both bargaining and coordination, but only weakly. The results are consistent with theories that allow "virtual observability" of first-mover choices, rather than theories in which timing matters only because first-mover advantage is used as a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> selection...|$|E

In a quiet environment, {{the ears of}} many vertebrates become unstable and emit one to several tones. These spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, the most striking manifestation of the inner ear's active process, must result from self-sustained mechanical oscillations of aural constituents. The mechanoreceptive hair bundles of hair cells in the bullfrog's sacculus {{have the ability to}} amplify mechanical stimuli and oscillate spontaneously. By comparing a hair bundle's spontaneous oscillations with its response to small mechanical stimuli, we demonstrate a breakdown in a general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> thermodynamics, the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. We thus confirm that a hair bundle's spontaneous movements are produced by energy-consuming elements within the hair cell. To characterize the dynamical behavior of the active process, we introduce an effective temperature that, for each frequency component, quantifies a hair bundle's deviation from thermal equilibrium. The effective temperature diverges near the bundle's frequency of spontaneous oscillation. This behavior, which is not generic for active oscillators, can be accommodated by a simple model that characterizes quantitatively the fluctuations of the spontaneous movements as well as the hair bundle's linear response function...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years {{vehicular}} traffic density has continuously increased and {{it is likely that the}} traffic demand will further increase in the future. In many metropolitan areas the road infrastructure is no longer able to handle the peak traffic demand and the existing road network cannot be easily extended. The best way to improve the traffic situation is to optimise the resources available in the transportation network and to coordinate the traffic demand. The approach that we propose in this paper makes use of a collaborative traffic coordination protocol which collects real-time Floating Car Data (FCD) directly from participating vehicles and suggests dynamic routes in order to minimize travel delay. Information such as speed, position and direction is sent to one or more Traffic Coordination Points (TCPs) where it is aggregated to obtain a global picture of the traffic conditions in real-time. Based on this data, we continuously compute the route that minimizes the travel time to a given destination by applying Wardrop’s first <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Our results show that, by coordinating the vehicles, we are able to better distribute the overall traffic demand throughout the transportation network, reducing the average travel times and accommodating more vehicles...|$|E

40|$|The oxygen {{isotope ratio}} (18 O/ 16 O) of {{inorganic}} and biogenic carbonate minerals is used extensively to reconstruct past temperatures, sea level, ice volume and hydrologic changes. These reconstructions assume that temperature {{is the dominant}} controlling factor for the carbonate-water oxygen isotope fractionation (αc/w) but there is evidence for temperature-independent variations in αc/w. Uncertainties surrounding the reasons for αc/w variations complicate paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on carbonate 18 O/ 16 O. Carbonate- 18 O/ 16 O thermometry {{is based on the}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> isotope fractionation but recent work suggests that carbonate-water equilibrium fractionation is the exception in nature rather than the norm. A major advance in understanding oxygen isotopes in carbonates has been to view carbonate-water fractionation as the result of kinetic and/or equilibrium fractionations occurring between water and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) species and between the DIC species and carbonate. However, quantifying the intermediate fractionation steps is in its infancy. This thesis presents a new general model of oxygen isotope fractionations in the CaCO 3 -DIC-H 2 O system that quantifies DIC-H 2 O and CaCO 3 -DIC fractionation as a function of temperature, pH, salinity, calcite or aragonite saturation state (Ω), DIC residence time in solution and the activity of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.

40|$|Premiums {{constitute}} {{the cost of}} insurance protection. There are however authors who tend to find some tax elements in them. This article aims at presenting {{the conditions in which}} such a view may be regarded as correct and when the marks which are the characteristics of taxes can also appear in premiums paid on account of insurance as part of the Polish insurance system. Taxes are commonly regarded as being obligatory and not subject to refund. Compulsion cannot, however, be the right criterion that differentiates taxes from other payments and also from premiums. Although premiums are compulsory payments paid by the insured they cannot be compared to taxes. It is not because of the fiscal reasons that obligatory insurance was introduced. It was destined to popularize it in those fields in which such popularization proved to be necessary. Premiums as a cost for insurance protection must be equivalent. The degree of the rate of payment depends upon the realization of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> between the premiums and the amount recoverable. In practice the premiums paid by the insured are not only destined to make good any loss or damage or to pay benefits, but also form a preventive fund and a reserve fund. The part of premiums which constitutes the preventive fund can be regarded as a specific kind of tax securing financial means for undertakings preventing the occurrence of events. The other part of the premiums which provides for the reserve fund bears even more distinctive marks of a tax. This fund is a form of revenue subject to refunding. As the insurance company has never exercised its right to that fund the payments on that account may be considered a permanent source of budget income.
