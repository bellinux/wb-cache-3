5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in India is at 68 years, {{with life}} expectancy for women being 69.6 years and for men being 67.3. There are around 50 physicians per 100,000 Indians. The number of Indians living {{in urban areas}} has grown by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. Yet, in 2001, over 70% lived in rural areas. The level of urbanisation increased from 27.81% in 2001 Census to 31.16% in 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall growth rate of population {{was due to the}} sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991. According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population. The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males. The rural urban literacy gap which was 21.2 <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> 2001, dropped to 16.1 <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> 2011. The improvement in literacy rate in rural area is two times that in urban areas. Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{document}} declining labor share using {{a sample}} of international companies from developed economies. While this trend makes internal funds available for financing innovation, we find that R&D expenditures fall alike. Firm-level fixed effects estimation, controlling for the intensity of competition and financial constraints, confirms {{a positive correlation between}} labor share and R&D expenditures. A counterfactual analysis shows that a <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> fall <b>in</b> labor share reduces output growth by 0. 01 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the short run, and up to 0. 02 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the long run, due to declining innovation...|$|R
40|$|As policymakers, {{election}} officials, and {{the public}} consider whether New York should change {{the way in which}} voters are allowed to register to participate in elections, and bring New York State election law into compliance with the Help America Vote Act, the following report provides an analysis of the potential impact of election day registration (EDR) in New York. EDR in New York has the potential to increase voter participation for New Yorkers by as much as: Over 12 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase <b>in</b> turnout by 18 -to- 25 -year-olds. Nearly 10 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase <b>in</b> turnout by thosewith a grade school education or less.

40|$|Using panel data {{of public}} {{unemployment}} expenditure {{as a percentage}} of GDP of 34 OECD nations across year 1980 - 2010, I explore the effect of this ratio on three unemployment outcomes: total unemployment rate, long-term unemployment rate and youth unemployment, as well as labor participation rate and investment rate. After taking into account potential endogeneity of this ratio using Durbin-Wu-Hausman test, I find the data does not support the hypothesized aggregate demand effect of unemployment insurance (UI) expenditure in theory but gives strong support for hypothesized disincentive effect in theory. The estimates indicate that every <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase <b>in</b> public unemployment welfare expenditure relative to GDP leads to 0. 9 to 1. 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase <b>in</b> total unemployment rate and 4. 5 to 4. 7 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase <b>in</b> long term unemployment rate. The distortionary effect of UI program on business is also verified by an estimate that every <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase <b>in</b> this unemployment spending rate is associated with about 2. 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> decrease <b>in</b> investment rate. ...|$|R

40|$|Procyclical TFP {{growth has}} been a {{persisting}} feature of the US economy {{for more than a}} century. Everything else equal, a reduction of one <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the unemployment rate has added approximately. 9 <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> to the TFP growth rate, and consequently to the rate of growth of total output, and an increase of one <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the unemployment rate has done the reverse. This relationship is estimated on data for the private nonfarm economy from 1890 through 2004 and is stable across subperiods during which the trend growth rate of TFP has been quite different. This paper lays out the empirical evidence for this regularity, discusses its implications for our understanding of the much weaker cyclicality of growth in output per hour, and considers why the sources of procyclical TFP differ from those that fuel secular advance. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{participation}} {{of women in}} science has consistently dropped {{since the turn of}} the century. This trend has been observed in all sectors of the larger economies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia. Mexico is a notable exception, having recorded a slight increase. Some of the decrease may be attributed to women transferring to agricultural sciences in these countries. Another negative trend is the drop in female doctoral students and in the labour force. Of those countries reporting data, the majority signal a significant drop of 10–20 <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> the transition from master’s to doctoral graduates.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party holds a {{plurality}} of registrations in Delaware. Until the 2000 presidential election, the state tended to be a Presidential bellwether, sending its three electoral votes to the winning candidate since 1952.

In 2004 John Kerry won Delaware by eight <b>percentage</b> <b>points.</b> <b>In</b> 2008 Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Delaware 62.63% to 37.37%.

The estimated correlation is quantitatively significant: an additional 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the fraction of illegal immigrants is associated with a 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase <b>in</b> the propensity to support the Senate plan.|$|R
