A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E

5|$|Before {{striking}} Japan, Higos produced {{strong winds}} in the Northern Marianas Islands while passing to their north. These winds damaged {{the food supply}} on two islands. Later, Higos moved across Japan with wind gusts as strong as 161km/h (100mph), including record gusts at several locations. A total of 608,130buildings in the country were left without power, and two people were electrocuted in the storm's aftermath. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 346mm (13.6in). The rains flooded houses {{across the country and}} caused mudslides. High waves washed 25boats ashore and killed one person along the coast.

5|$|Schafer's {{original}} {{vision for}} the game had not anticipated a celebrity cast. In particular, though Eddie came to resemble Black, the team had not planned on having Jack Black voice the character. After learning that Black was a fan of Schafer's previous game, Psychonauts, they met with the actor/musician and recognized he was an avid gamer and metal fan and understood all the choices the team made in the game, and subsequently signed on for the voice work. Black also performed live-action sequences as himself used for the in-game menu screens and additional promotional material. Once Black had {{signed up for the}} project, Schafer found that other artists and <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the heavy metal scene became very interested in participating though a domino effect and word of mouth, allowing Schafer to sign them on as voice talent or as part of the game's soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of Kanon, the Key staff started production on Air and expanded the number of <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> this project compared to Kanon. The executive producer for Air was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company that Key is under. The planning for Air was headed by Jun Maeda who {{was also one of}} two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa. Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and Yūichi Suzumoto. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino.

5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E
5|$|In 1567, Jain ascetic Srutakirti of Mysore {{translated}} from Sanskrit a biographic poem of a Hoysala lady Vijayakumari in Vijayakumari Charite. The writing goes into detail about a city (believed to be Vijayanagara, the royal capital), discussing its shops, guilds and businesses. The text describes the rigid caste-based human settlements and notes that <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> mundane duties such as washing, barbering, pot-making and carpentry lived outside the fort walls in streets constructed specifically for them. Salva (1550) authored two poems called Rasa Ratnakar and Sharada Vilas. The former is about rasa (poetical sentiment or flavour) and the latter, only portions {{of which have}} been recovered, is about the dhvani (suggested meaning) in poems. Thimma's Navarasalankara of the 16th century also discusses poetical flavour. In the 16th century, lexicons were written by Lingamantri (Kabbigarakaipidi) and Devottama (Nanaratha Ratnakara). At the turn of the 17th century, Bhattakalanka Deva wrote comprehensively on old Kannada grammar. His Karnataka Sabdanusasanam is modelled on the lines of Sanskrit grammar and is considered an exhaustive work.|$|E

However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.|$|E
