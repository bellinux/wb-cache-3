25|$|The Central Committee was a {{collective}} organ elected {{at the annual}} party congress. It was mandated to meet {{at least twice a}} year to act as the party's supreme organ. Over the years, membership in the Central Committee increased; in 1934 there were 71 full members, in 1976 there were 287 full members. Central Committee members were elected to the seats because of the offices they held, not their personal merit. Because of this, the Central Committee was commonly considered an indicator for Sovietologists to study the strength of the different institutions. The Politburo was elected by and reported to the Central Committee. Besides the Politburo the Central Committee also elected the Secretariat and the General Secretary, the de facto leader of the Soviet Union. In 1919–1952 the Orgburo was also elected {{in the same manner as}} the Politburo and the Secretariat by the <b>plenums</b> of the Central Committee. In between Central Committee <b>plenums,</b> the Politburo and the Secretariat was legally empowered to make decisions on its behalf. The Central Committee (or the Politburo and/or Secretariat in its behalf) could issue nationwide decisions; decisions on behalf of the party were transmitted from the top to the bottom.|$|E

Trường Chinh endorsed the program of the 8th plenum of the 5th Central Committee and [...] "new economic concepts", but told the attendees that the 5th Politburo had undertaken a systematic assessment of economic policies, which included the continuation of a mixed economy, the acceptance of private ownership for the foreseeable future, the need to end bureaucratic centralism, and the need for decentralization in economic decision-making. In his speech to the 4th Congress of the Hồ Chí Minh City Party Organization, Nguyễn Văn Linh, a member of the 5th Politburo and 5th Secretariat, endorsed the platforms of 6th, 7th and 8th <b>plenums</b> of the 5th Central Committee while supporting the conclusion reached at the 10th plenum of the 5th Central Committee. He emphasized several Politburo directives. Phạm Hùng, the Minister of Interior, in his speech to the Cuu Long Provincial Congress said that the reintroduction of the market economy and the renewed acceptance of private ownership would not hurt Vietnam's socialist transformation. To secure Vietnam's socialist credentials, the state would remain dominant to protect Vietnam from the uncontrolled free market. The 11th plenum (17–25 November 1986), the last plenum before the 6th Congress, endorsed the platform for the congress.|$|E

In the Dubossary city soviet, an organ with OSTK preponderance but not dominance, the majority prevailed with the support of only 49 of the 86 deputies (57%). [...] While results were more one sided elsewhere, everywhere confusion abounded. Many governmental institutions—the police, public prosecutors, judges—remained loyal to the government in Chişinău; some enterprises or villages defected from one local soviet to another to end up on the right side; paramilitary men competed with police to provide law and order, and during 1991 began attempting to evict them from their former stations. Even in Tiraspol, consolidation was to take upwards of a year.|$|E
40|$|Cool {{supply air}} {{flowing through the}} {{underfloor}} <b>plenum</b> is exposed to heat gain from both the concrete slab (conducted from the warm return air on the adjacent floor below the slab) and the raised floor panels (conducted from the warmer room above). The magnitude of this heat gain can be quite high, resulting in undesirable loss of control of the supply air temperature from the <b>plenum</b> into the occupied space. These warmer supply air temperatures can {{make it more difficult}} to maintain comfort in the occupied space (without increasing airflow rates), particularly in perimeter zones where cooling loads reach their highest levels. How to predict <b>plenum</b> thermal performance is one of the key design issues facing practicing engineers – evidence from completed projects indicates that excessive temperature rise in the <b>plenum</b> can be a problem. One of the recommended strategies for addressing temperature rise in UFAD systems is the use of ductwork (flexible or rigid) within the underfloor <b>plenum</b> to deliver cool air preferentially to perimeter zones or other critical areas of high cooling demand. Several experiments were carried out in a full-scale underfloor <b>plenum</b> test facility, in order to characterize all the phenomena that take place in an underfloor <b>plenum</b> equipped with a fabric or metal duct. Experimental data were collected for validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the <b>plenum.</b> This paper describes the first part of a more comprehensive work, whose aim is to use the validated CFD <b>plenum</b> model to conduct simulations of a broader range of <b>plenum</b> design and operational parameters.

50|$|Variable-Length Intake Manifold (VLIM) is an {{internal}} combustion engine manifold technology.Four common implementations exist. First, two discrete intake runners with different length are employed, and a butterfly valve can close the short path. Second the intake runners can be bent around a common <b>plenum,</b> and a sliding valve separates them from the <b>plenum</b> with a variable length. Straight high-speed runners can receive plugs, which contain small long runner extensions. The <b>plenum</b> of a 6- or 8-cylinder engine can be parted into halves, with the even firing cylinders in one half and the odd firing cylinders in the other part. Both sub-plenums and the air intake are connected to an Y (sort of main <b>plenum).</b> The air oscillates between both sub-plenums, with a large pressure oscillation there, but a constant pressure at the main <b>plenum.</b> Each runner from a sub <b>plenum</b> to the main <b>plenum</b> can be changed in length.

2500|$|During {{the height}} of the Malenkov–Khrushchev struggle, Khrushchev {{actively}} fought for improvements in Soviet agriculture and the strengthening {{of the role of the}} Central Committee. Khrushchev tried to revitalise the Central Committee by hosting several discussions on agriculture at the Central Committee <b>plenums.</b> While no other Presidium members were enthusiastic for such an approach, Khrushchev held several Central Committee meetings from February to March 1954 to discuss agriculture alone. By doing this, Khrushchev was acknowledging a long forgotten fact; the Presidium, the Secretariat and he himself were responsible to the Central Committee. Khrushchev could have gone the other way, since some people were already calling for decreasing the Central Committee's role to [...] "cadres and propaganda" [...] alone". A further change was democratisation at the top of the party hierarchy, as Voroshilov noted at a Presidium meeting in 1954. By August 1954 Malenkov's role as de facto head of government was over; Nikolai Bulganin began signing Council of Ministers decrees (a right beholden to the Chairman) and the Presidium gave in to Khrushchev's wishes to replace Malenkov. Malenkov was called of revisionism because of his wishes to prioritise light industry over heavy industry. At the same time, Malenkov was accused of being involved in the Leningrad Affair which led to the deaths of innocent party officials. At the Central Committee plenum of 25 January 1955, Khrushchev accused Malenkov of ideological deviations at the same level as former, anti-Stalinist Bukharin and Alexey Rykov of the 1920s. Malenkov spoke twice to the plenum, but it failed to alter his position, and on 8 March 1955 he was forced to resign from his post as Chairman of the Council of Ministers; he was succeeded by Nikolai Bulganin, a protege of Khrushchev dating back to the 1930s. Malenkov still remained a powerful figure, and he retained his seat in the Presidium.|$|E
2500|$|Beria was no easy man to defeat, and his ethnicisation {{policies}} (that a {{local or}} republican leaders {{had to have}} ethnic origins, and speak {{the language of the}} given area) proved to be a tool to strengthen the MVD's grip on local party organs. Khrushchev and Malenkov, who had begun receiving information which stated that the MVD had begun spying on party officials, started to act in the spring of 1953. Beria was defeated at the next Presidium <b>plenums</b> by a majority against him, and not long after, Khrushchev and Malenkov started to plan Beria's fall from power. However, this was no easy task, as Beria was able to inspire fear in his colleagues. In Khrushchev's and Malenkov's first discussion with Kliment Voroshilov, Voroshilov did not {{want anything to do with}} it, because he feared [...] "Beria's ears". However, Khrushchev and Malenkov were able to gather enough support for Beria's ouster, but only when a rumour of a potential coup led by Beria began to take hold within the party leadership. Afraid of the power Beria held, Khrushchev and Malenkov were prepared for a potential civil war. This did not happen, and Beria was forced to resign from all his party posts on 26 June, and was later executed on 23 December. Beria's fall also led to criticism of Stalin; the party leadership accused Beria of using Stalin, a sick and old man, to force his own will on the Soviet Union during Stalin's last days. This criticism, and much more, led party and state newspapers to launch more general criticism of Stalin and the Stalin era. A party history pamphlet went so far as to state that the party needed to eliminate [...] "the incorrect, un-Marxist interpretation of the role of the individual in history, which is expressed in propaganda by the idealist theory of the cult of personality, which is alien to Marxism".|$|E
2500|$|In October the {{communist}} party began attempting to reassert its power in the eastern cities. During the strike, the city committees and city soviets of the eastern cities had allowed the OSTK to deeply insinuate itself into city government structures; after the strike, city communist leaders tried {{to take the initiative}} back into their own hands. For example, cooperation with the OSTK in the city soviets led deputies in Tiraspol, Bendery, and Rȋbniţa to suspend the introduction of the language laws and deputies in Tiraspol and Rȋbniţa to agree to a referendum on the creation of a Transnistrian autonomous republic. Once the strike was over, however, communist leaders attempted rollback these concessions. The republican communist party leaders in Chişinău were especially keen to see this happen and put pressure on local communists to repeal [...] "illegal" [...] decisions taken during the strike. In a meeting in October, Associate Chair of the Presidium of the Moldovan Supreme Soviet, Victor Puşcaş, in the presence of Communist Party First Secretary, Semion Grossu, berated local communists for losing control of the situation in Transnistria. It would look better for the city soviets to repeal all illegal decisions by themselves, he concluded. [...] "However," [...] he warned, [...] "if you cannot get them to repeal these resolutions, we will do it for them." [...] Back home, the first secretaries of the eastern cities convened <b>plenums</b> of the city committees and sessions of the city soviets. Some OSTK members were allowed to attend and participate, but Semion Grossu attended in order {{to keep an eye on}} the proceedings and make sure the sessions went as planned. The local communist party meetings called on the city soviets to bring local law into accordance with republican law and decisions adopted by the local soviets supported acceptance of the language laws in Transnistria. Communist-run state media also criticized the OSTK and local communists attempted to shut down OSTK newspapers, a measure that prevented the organization from putting out its publication for much of late 1989.|$|E
