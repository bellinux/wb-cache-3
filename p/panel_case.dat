A procedure to compute the asymptotic p-values of Hansen's CADF test is also a side-contribution of the paper.

40|$|This paper overviews {{some recent}} {{developments}} in panel data asymptotics, concentrating on the nonstationary <b>panel</b> <b>case</b> and gives a new result for models with individual effects. Underlying recent theory are asymptotics for multi-indexed processes in which both indexes may pass to infinity. We review {{some of the new}} limit theory that has been developed, show how it can be applied and give a new interpretation of individual effects in nonstationary panel data. Fundamental to the interpretation of much of the asymptotics is the concept of a panel regression coefficient which measures the long run average relation across a section of the panel. This concept is analogous to the statistical interpretation of the coefficient in a classical regression relation. A variety of nonstationary panel data models are discussed and the paper reviews the asymptotic properties of estimators in these various models.

The programs run individually to determine the flutter behavior of a flat panel where the finite elements which model the panel each have four degrees of freedom (DOF), a curved panel where the finite elements each have four DOF, and a curved panel where the finite elements each have six DOF. The panels are assumed to be of infinite aspect ratio and are subjected to either simply-supported or clamped boundary conditions. The aerodynamics used by these programs are based on piston theory. Application of the program is illustrated by sample cases where the number of beam finite elements equals four, the in-plane tension parameter is 0. 0, the maximum camber to panel length ratio for a curved <b>panel</b> <b>case</b> is 0. 05, and the Mach number is 2. 0.

40|$|We extend three {{existing}} cross-sectional limited {{dependent variable}} (LDV) estimators, {{that allow for}} endogenous regressors, to a panel data model. We focus on estimation of effects of timeinvariant endogenous regressors, since to our knowledge, besides joint maximum likelihood, no other alternative consistent parametric estimators than the ones suggested here exist. We compare their small sample performance of estimates of marginal effects to i. i. d. LDV estimators {{as well as to}} linear estimators by means of Monte Carlo Studies. Some notable differences in the performance of the LDV estimators appear. One estimator, the 2 SIV, performs reasonably well in terms of bias, even with weak instruments. Another type, the AGLS estimators, have a large small sample bias when no endogeneity is present. The 2 SCML estimators seem to perform reasonable in most scenarios even under some types of misspecification. In addition, 2 SLS performed relatively well, but had a substantial MSE with weak instruments and substantial bias in misspecified scenarios. Although potentially important because of heterogeneity bias, our extension of LDV models to the <b>panel</b> <b>case</b> did not give improvements in small sample performance over the cross-sectional estimators.

However, in practice, the number of trade disputes related to CVA and GATT V is large and their practical importance is not negligible. It is quite important for trade practitioners who deal with disputes under CVA and GATT V to be able to discuss with their counterparts issues that are not only based on their own interpretations, but are also based on the Panel's decision.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} costs and benefits of the two main construction methods in the prefabricated homes category: panelized and modular. The main goal is to provide a framework of the implications and tradeoffs of both construction methods for single family homes, as well as determine which is more cost effective. The methodology consists of a qualitative analysis that includes the overview of the benefits of each construction method over the other, and quantitative analysis which compares the cost of the finished homes per square foot to determine which one is more cost effective. Both analyses are conducted by evaluating two case studies of single family homes with similar characteristics, one built with panels and the other with modules. The benefits identified for panelized homes have to do with transportation, equipment and machinery, and insulation technology; on the other hand, the benefits for modular homes are related to quality control, on-site work and trades. The quantitative results showed that the modular construction method is only marginally more cost effective than the panelized construction method under the given circumstances. As a second part of the quantitative analysis, the <b>panel</b> <b>case</b> study was calculated as if it would be built with modules, and the results of both analyses were consistent, but both with the same limitations. Through the proposed method, it is possible to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the two construction methods for single family prefabricated home projects which could serve as a valuable tool for decision making...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} interdisciplinary applications of computational methods in quantitative economics. Particularly, this thesis focuses on problems in productive efficiency analysis and benchmarking that are hardly approachable or solvable using conventional methods.  In productive efficiency analysis, null or zero values are often produced {{due to the}} wrong skewness or low kurtosis of the inefficiency distribution as against the distributional assumption on the inefficiency term. This thesis uses the deconvolution technique, which is traditionally used in image processing for noise removal, to develop a fully non-parametric method for efficiency estimation. Publications 1 and 2 are devoted to this topic, with focus being laid on the cross-sectional case and <b>panel</b> <b>case,</b> respectively. Through Monte-Carlo simulations and empirical applications to Finnish electricity distribution network data and Finnish banking data, {{the results show that}} the Richardson-Lucy blind deconvolution method is insensitive to the distributio-nal assumptions, robust to the data noise levels and heteroscedasticity on efficiency estimation.  In benchmarking, which could be the next step of productive efficiency analysis, the 'best practice' target may not perform under the same operational environment with the DMU under study. This would render the benchmarks impractical to follow and adversely affects the managers to make the correct decisions on performance improvement of a DMU. This dissertation proposes a clustering-based benchmarking framework in Publication 3. The empirical study on Finnish electricity distribution network reveals that the proposed framework novels not only in its consideration on the differences of the operational environment among DMUs, but also its extreme flexibility. We conducted a comparison analysis on the different combinations of the clustering and efficiency estimation techniques using computational simulations and empirical applications to Finnish electricity distribution network data, based on which Publication 4 specifies an efficient combination for benchmarking in energy regulation.   This dissertation endeavors to solve problems in quantitative economics using interdisciplinary approaches. The methods developed benefit this field and the way how we approach the problems open a new perspective...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{parameter estimation}} in panels of intercorrelated time series. By a factorisation of the conditional log-likelihood function we obtain a new estimator â_n,T for panels of intercorrelated autoregressive time series. We generalise this model to a factor model, where a single underlying background process {{is responsible for}} the common behaviour of the time series in the panel, and derive the corresponding conditional maximum likelihood estimators. Consistency and asymptotic normality are proved for the estimators in both models. It turns out that â_n,T is asymptotically equivalent to the estimator â_HT given in Hjellvik and Tjøstheim (1999 a) if the number of time series in the panel tends to infinity. It is more efficient if only the length of the time series increases. Furthermore the mean squared errors of the dominant terms in the stochastic expansions of these estimators have the ratio (n- 1) /n, which indicates that already the small sample bias of â_n,T is smaller than that of â_HT. These properties are confirmed in the simulations. The second part of the thesis is concerned with robust estimation in panels of autoregressive time series. We investigate three different approaches. Firstly we robustify the above estimators in a direct way. Furthermore we generalise the robust autocovariance estimator of Ma and Genton (2000) to the <b>panel</b> <b>case.</b> We define a panel breakdown point for time series in two ways {{depending on the type of}} outliers assumed and compute its value for the panel autocovariance estimator. The estimated autocovariances are then used for the robust parameter estimation. Finally we propose an outlier test based upon the phase space representation of the time series in the panel, which can be used for eliminating outliers from the data set before using a non-robust method of estimation. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic and define a robust version of the test. For comparison we include other estimators in the analysis. The performance of the proposed robust procedures is investigated in a simulation study. For assessing the applicability of the above methods we analyse two sets of empirical data...|$|E
