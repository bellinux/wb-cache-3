40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{assessment}} was to identify location, type and size of wetlands in the Tanzanian part of Lake Victoria basin including both fringing and non-fringing wetlands. Assessment of fringing wetlands has been completed and a report that shows wetland location/distribution, area, threats and social economic values has been produced. Some preliminary qualitative data on major rivers were collected. Physical parameters of water were measured for the river Mara, Rubana, Mbalageti, Simiyu, Nyashishi and Mahina. Nutrients, and heavy metals were not measured due to delays in procurement of laboratory equipment and chemicals Mara river had highest water quality compared to all other rivers sampled, probably this was contributed by buffering effect by a big wetland which is associated with Mara river system. In Mara region, Mara River has indicated higher water quality with respect to Turbidity, Electric Conductivity, Total Hardness and Chloride content compared with Rubana and Mbalageti rivers. This {{might be due to}} the reason that, Mara River flows through extensive wetland. In Mwanza region, Simiyu River and its main tributary, Duma has indicated higher values of pH, Electric Conductivity, Total Alkalinity, Hardness and Chloride content than Nyashishi and Mahina rivers. This generally indicates that, Simiyu and Duma rivers have higher mineral content compared to Nyashishi and Mahina. Higher <b>Permanganate</b> <b>Values</b> were also indicated for Nyashishi river compared with the other rivers and this is an indication of higher organic content in the Nyashishi River...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{assess the}} {{development}} of main components of natural forage base in nursery ponds {{during the period of}} rearing the carp fish seeds in monoculture. Methodology. Hydrobiological (bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoobenthos) and hydrochemical samples have been collected and processes according to generally accepted methods. Findings. Qualitative and quantitative parameters of {{the development of}} bacterio-, phyto-, zooplankton and zoobenthos in nursery ponds have been studied when rearing young-of-the-year Lubin few scale carp, Antoninsko-Zozulenets carp and their reciprocal crosses in monoculture (50 thousand fish/ha). General water mineralization in ponds was 292. 7 – 315. 7 mg/dm 3 and according to O. A. Alekin’s classification, pond water belonged to hydrocarbonate class of calcium group. Water pH was 7. 4 – 7. 5. <b>Permanganate</b> <b>values</b> were 12. 5 – 14. 9 mgO/dm 3. On average, average ammonium nitrogen content, nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, mineral phosphorus, total iron did not exceed normative values. Qualitative and quantitative parameters of phyto-, bacterio-, zooplankton of nursery ponds have been studied. The seasonal development of phytoplankton was within 15. 96 – 20. 88 mg/dm 3 with the predominance of Chlorococcales in the floristic spectrum. The development of bacterioplankton was within 5. 08 – 5. 81 mg/dm 3. Zooplankton was dominated by cladoceran-copepod complex with average seasonal values of 5. 27 – 17. 20 g/m 3. Zoobenthos was formed of Diptera larvae (Chironomidae and Chaoboridae) with average seasonal biomasses of 0. 51 – 1. 8 g/m 2. According to saprobic parameters, pond water belonged to β-mesosabrobic zone and corresponded to the water quality class II (“clean enough” category).

30|$|The {{progress}} of lignin oxidation during oxygenalkali bleaching of pulp was {{evaluated by the}} method based on the difference between permanganate consumption of original pulp {{and that of the}} mixture of pulp and effluent after oxygen-alkali bleaching. By low-consistency oxygen bleaching of softwood kraft pulp, the permanganate consumption decreased very little. When the kappa number of the pulp was halved (from 25.4 to 13.4), the decrease in permanganate consumption of 1 g pulp was only 1.22 ml of 0.02 mol/l potassium <b>permanganate.</b> This <b>value</b> was smaller than that obtained for the oxygen-alkali treatment of a corresponding amount of isolated residual lignin, 6.40 ml. This was not due to the slow oxidation of lignin in pulp but to the formation of permanganate-consuming substances from carbohydrates. Those newly formed substances cannot be oxidized by oxygen-alkali treatment. Taking these facts into account, lignin originally present in pulp was found to be oxidized well. Reduction of carbonyl groups in carbohydrates prevented the formation of such substances.|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of chlorinated ethenes by {{potassium permanganate}} (KMnO 4) is increasingly {{being used to}} remediate contaminated ground water. Typically the remediation of these sites is assessed by tracking changes in the concentrations of the chlorinated compounds and the chloride produced by the reaction. However, this method can be problematic in a fractured bedrock environment, due to the inherent complexity of the fracture network and the injection process that can displace contaminant mass and result in erroneous determinations. In this study, carbon and chlorine isotopes were tested to monitor the oxidation of trichloroethene (TCE) by potassium permanganate at a fractured limestone site. Laboratory experiments were performed to evaluate isotope enrichment factors, and the isotopic composition of a TCE plume was monitored under pre-injection and post-injection conditions. Large fractionation of stable carbon isotopes was observed in laboratory experiments at various mass ratios of TCE to potassium <b>permanganate</b> with <b>values</b> for the enrichment factor around- 28. 0 ‰, which is in agreement with previous studies. The experimental data suggests that carbon isotope fractionation remained constant with time, and was independen...|$|R

The analysis based on in-situ samples upstream to downstream (Puhekou, Jiajia'an, Yanziyu Panjiakou and Baqian) showed that three harmful algae species of Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta prevail in the reservoir. The variations in algal concentrations presented a seasonal cycle with high values in the flood season and low values in the drought season and a spatial concentration in main water storage area of the reservoir.
