5|$|As {{the murder}} {{investigation}} unfolds, Skinner tells agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{not to get}} involved. He refuses to take a <b>polygraph</b> test and {{is viewed as a}} suspect. Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) examines Sayles' corpse, finding a phosphorescent glow around her lips. Mulder finds out that Sayles was a prostitute and interviews her madam, who claims that Skinner's credit card number was collected the previous night.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{thinking}} that the Garza murder {{had taken place in}} San Antonio because Feit had trained there, Tacheny called authorities in that city and said that he could no longer keep the secret of Feit's confession. The investigation into Garza's death was reopened that year. Texas Rangers investigator Rudy Jaramillo contacted Father Joseph O'Brien, a priest who worked with Feit {{at the time of the}} Garza murder. O'Brien told a television program in 2000 that he did not know anything about Garza's death. He softened with Jaramillo, first telling the investigator that he had suspected Feit at the time, then admitting that Feit had confessed shortly after the murder. In August 2002, the <b>polygraph</b> examiner who tested Feit in 1960 said that he questioned the reported results. Feit had been said to have passed his <b>polygraph</b> and documentation was later amended to show that the results were inconclusive, but the examiner felt that Feit had failed the test.|$|E
5|$|Church members {{reported}} that Father Feit's confession line moved slowly {{that night and}} that he was away from the sanctuary several times. When the canal at the crime scene was drained several days after the discovery of Garza's body, Feit's photo slide viewer was found in the canal. Fellow priests noticed scratch marks on Feit's hands after midnight mass, and they said it was irregular for Feit to have taken Garza to the church rectory to hear her confession. The McAllen Police Department initially said that Feit passed <b>polygraph</b> tests, but the tests were later said to be inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the CIA and NSA <b>polygraphs,</b> DIA <b>polygraphs</b> {{are only}} of Counterintelligence Scope (CI), rather than Full Scope (FS) (also known as Expanded Scope Screening or ESS), which is ostensibly more {{intrusive}} {{as far as}} one's personal life is concerned. DIA administered {{only a handful of}} FS <b>polygraphs</b> and only for those personnel who were to be detailed to the CIA. Additionally, DIA conducted a handful of FS <b>polygraphs</b> on its personnel remaining overseas in excess of 6.5 years, although this practice appeared to be outside the scope of DIA's authorization at the time.|$|R

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials questioned about 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex offenders and Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. They carried out almost 50 <b>polygraph</b> examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which was larger than any amount of money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest who heard Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance. The 27-year-old priest {{had been at the}} church since completing seminary training in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Nickell finally {{consented to}} a <b>polygraph</b> {{examination}} in November 1986. She failed it and investigators narrowed their focus to her even further; however, concrete evidence proving that Nickell had ever purchased or used cyanide was lacking, and despite their relative certainty that Stella Nickell had orchestrated the poisonings as either an elaborate cover-up for an insurance-motivated {{murder of her}} husband, or as {{a desperate attempt to}} force her husband's death to be ruled an accident, to increase her insurance payout, they were unable to build a strong enough case to support an arrest.|$|E

Massino also reported that Vincent Basciano, arrested in November, had conspired to kill prosecutor Greg Andres, but after failing a <b>polygraph</b> test regarding the discussion he agreed to wear a wire when meeting the acting boss in jail. While Massino was unable to extract an unambiguous confession regarding Andres, he did record Basciano freely admit to ordering the murder of associate Randolph Pizzolo.|$|E

5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} the abduction of his stepdaughter from {{within sight of}} their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several <b>polygraph</b> tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, {{a former}} Pakistani {{intelligence}} officer approached the U.S. embassy station chief in Islamabad {{and offered to}} reveal bin Laden's location, {{in return for the}} $25 million reward, according to a retired senior U.S. intelligence official. This story was corroborated by two U.S. intelligence officials speaking to NBC News, and had been previously reported by intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse. The Pakistani official informed U.S. intelligence that bin Laden had been located by Pakistani ISI in 2006, and held under house arrest near Pakistani intelligence and military centers ever since. The official passed <b>polygraph</b> tests, after which the U.S. began local and satellite surveillance of bin Laden's Abbottabad residence.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of an Egyptian agent, the CIA had {{obtained}} a sample of soil from the facility taken in December 1997 showing the presence of O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid (EMPTA), a substance used in the production of VX nerve gas, at 2.5 times trace levels. (Reports are contradictory on whether the soil was obtained from within the compound itself, or outside.) The collected soil was split into three samples, which were then analyzed by a private laboratory. The agent's bona fides were later confirmed through <b>polygraph</b> testing; however, the CIA produced a report on Al-Shifa on July 24, 1998, questioning whether Al-Shifa produced chemical weapons or simply stored precursors, and the agency advised collecting more soil samples. Cohen and Tenet later briefed U.S. senators on intercepted telephone communications from the plant that reputedly bolstered the American case against Al-Shifa. U.S. intelligence also purportedly researched the Al-Shifa factory online and searched commercial databases, but did not find any medicines for sale.|$|E

40|$|We prove, {{as claimed}} by A. Carboni and P. T. Johnstone, that the {{category}} of non-unital <b>polygraphs,</b> i. e. <b>polygraphs</b> where the source and target of each generator are not identity arrows, is a presheaf category. More generally we develop a new criterion for proving that certain classes of <b>polygraphs</b> are presheaf categories. This criterion also applies to the larger class of <b>polygraphs</b> where only the source of each generator is not an identity, and to the class of "many-to-one polygraphs", producing a new, more direct, proof {{that this is a}} presheaf category. The criterion itself seems to be extendable to more general type of operads over possibly different combinatorics, but we leave this question for future work. In an appendix we explain why this result is relevant if one wants to fix the arguments of a famous paper of M. Kapranov and V. Voevodsky and makes them into a proof of C. Simpson's semi-strictification conjecture. We briefly present a program aiming at proving this conjecture. Comment: 45 page...|$|R

5|$|On 19 and 20 October, Singaporean police {{questioned}} Took as part {{of their}} investigations; he said that three Chinese men kidnapped the girl. After questioning Took, police accompanied him home and to the police station again for a <b>polygraph</b> test. On the way, they stopped at a restaurant along Pasir Panjang Road for a meal. While eating, Took said he needed to go to the toilet, escaped, took a taxi to Woodlands and sneaked across the Causeway to Malaysia. Singaporean police searched for him until he turned himself in on 30 October, confessing that he had accidentally strangled Huang Na during a game of hide-and-seek in a storeroom. The following day, Huang Na's body was found at Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Took was charged with her murder. Direct Singapore Funeral Services oversaw her funeral for free. Thousands attended Huang Na's wake and funeral; some gave bai jin and gifts, such as sweets, flowers and her favourite Hello Kitty merchandise. However, some Singaporeans tried to make money from the girl's death by buying 4D numbers associated with her. Others spread rumours that Shuying was having affairs and was greedy for donations.|$|E
5|$|The CIA {{began to}} {{investigate}} the disappearances of its agents, initially suspecting that bad tradecraft, a Soviet breach of Moscow Station or the CIA's communications, or a mole {{was responsible for the}} disaster. Suspicions fell on spy dust (METKA), a KGB compromise of CIA cables, or new Soviet surveillance tactics, but these probes proved unsuccessful. Ames' conspicuous spending drew the attention of the molehunters in late 1989, but he passed a <b>polygraph</b> test. However, the molehunt regained momentum in 1991 as it received more officers to work on the case. Attention focused on Ames and other suspects, and his finances were investigated once more in 1992; in August, the investigators linked Ames' bank deposits with his meetings with the Soviets. In March 1993, the molehunter unit concluded that there was a KGB mole within the CIA who had followed Howard, and the FBI began close surveillance of Ames, monitoring his office and home, and tracking his car. A June 25 search of his office found about 144 classified documents unrelated to his work; an analysis of his finances found an unexplained $1,326,310; and subsequent searches of Ames' trash and residence found further documents on CIA operations and agents, as well as Ames' own espionage for the KGB. On February 21, 1994, Ames and his wife, Rosario, were arrested by FBI agents: The duo pled guilty to espionage, and the Senate Intelligence Committee requested that the CIA's Inspector General review the case.|$|E
5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation {{and was surprised to}} find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a <b>polygraph</b> test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E

Linear <b>polygraphs</b> allow more possibilities of termination orders than those associated to Gröbner bases. We introduce polygraphic resolutions of algebras giving a description obtained by rewriting of higher-dimensional syzygies for presentations of algebras. We show how to compute polygraphic resolu-tions starting from a convergent presentation, and how to relate these resolutions with the Koszul property of algebras...|$|R

40|$|String {{rewriting}} {{systems have}} proved very useful to study monoids. In good cases, they give finite presentations of monoids, allowing computations on those and their manipulation by a computer. Even better, when the presentation is confluent and terminating, they provide {{one with a}} notion of canonical representative {{of the elements of}} the presented monoid. <b>Polygraphs</b> are a higher-dimensional generalization of this notion of presentation, from the setting of monoids to the much more general setting of n-categories. One of the main purposes {{of this article is to}} give a progressive introduction to the notion of higher-dimensional rewriting system provided by <b>polygraphs,</b> and describe its links with classical rewriting theory, string and term rewriting systems in particular.
