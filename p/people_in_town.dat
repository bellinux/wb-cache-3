5|$|Wickersham {{estimated}} 500 <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> {{and another}} count estimated 1,000, with 387 houses under construction, six saloons, and no churches. Before spring arrived, Wickersham published the first {{newspaper in the}} settlement—the Fairbanks Miner—on a typewriter. It sold seven copies at $5 per copy. But even as the walls of Wickersham's courthouse were going up, dissatisfied miners were leaving the area. Hundreds left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City. By June 1903, cabins on city lots were selling {{for as little as}} $10. Meanwhile, Barnette sold two-thirds of his store to the Alaska Commercial Company and arranged {{for the establishment of a}} post office at his settlement.|$|E

25|$|During {{his spare}} time, Hogan worked out at Hector's Gym in the Tampa Bay area, where he began lifting. Many of the wrestlers who were {{competing}} in the Florida region visited the bars where Ruckus was performing. Among those attending his performances were Jack and Gerald Brisco, two brothers who wrestled together as a tag team in the Florida region. Impressed by Hogan's physical stature, the Brisco brothers asked Hiro Matsuda the man who trained wrestlers working for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) {{to make him a}} potential trainee. In 1976, the two brothers asked Hogan to try wrestling. Having been a wrestling fan since childhood, Hogan eventually agreed. At first, however, Mike Graham, the son of CWF promoter Eddie Graham, refused to put Hogan in the ring; according to Hogan, he met Graham while in high school and the two did not get along. However, after Hogan quit Ruckus and started telling <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> {{that he was going to}} be a wrestler, Graham finally agreed to accept the Brisco Brothers' request.|$|E

2500|$|Until Token Black and {{his family}} were given a more notable role {{starting}} in the show's fourth season, Chef was portrayed as the only black resident in all of South Park. Parker and co-creator Matt Stone initially planned to have one of themselves voice the character, fearing that their ideal candidates of Hayes, Lou Rawls, and Barry White would never agree to voice the character because the duo had admittedly and purposefully created him as a [...] "stereotype" [...] to reflect what they felt was the perception most inhabitants of less-diverse mountainous Colorado towns had of black people. However, Hayes agreed to voice the character {{due in part to the}} audacity of some of the show's early scripts. Chef (usually kindheartedly, though not always) referred to most <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> with the pejorative [...] "crackers", including the children.|$|E

6000|$|These are {{the words}} in which the worthy manager of the Maranon estate related to me {{the coming of the}} {{supposed}} anarchist. He meant to keep him--out of a sense of duty to the company--and the name he had given him would prevent the fellow from obtaining employment anywhere in Horta. The vaqueros of the estate, when they went on leave, spread it all over the town. They did not know what an anarchist was, nor yet what Barcelona meant. They called him Anarchisto de Barcelona, as if it were his Christian name and surname. But the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> had been reading in their papers about the anarchists in Europe and were very much impressed. Over the jocular addition of [...] "de Barcelona" [...] Mr. Harry Gee chuckled with immense satisfaction. [...] "That breed is particularly murderous, isn't it?

But all that matters nothin' to me. You're engaged to be married to me; you know it yourself; and everybody knows it; and what you've got to do is to marry, or pay.
