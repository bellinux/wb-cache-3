40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} misuse {{potential of}} category 1, 2 and 3 firework´s products. An algorithm for selection of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>products</b> {{with the biggest}} potential of misuse was created and experimetally tested on common firework products. An experiment replicating the Boston incident was also conducted. And in this experiment was found out, that pyrotechnical compositions used in common firework products could have been used...|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{findings}} of the study, bilateral trade agreement is able to expand the export of the Philippines with its trade partner, Japan. Based on the export data of Philippine export to Japan, there are certain commodities that were initially decreasing prior to the agreement that significantly increased, 7  years since the implementation of the agreement such as: meat and edible meat offal (15, 3312.2 %), umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops and parts thereof (1878.1 %), explosives; <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>products,</b> matches, pyrophoric alloys, certain combustible preparations (1091.7 %). It is therefore recommended {{to increase the number of}} bilateral trade agreement of the Philippines with other countries in order to boost export. It is further recommended to pursue assessment of other trade agreements undertaken by the Philippines to support this conclusion.|$|E
40|$|This {{multidisciplinary}} research studied {{the relationship between}} components of a <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>product</b> and how manufacturing, in particular the mixing method employed, affects its macroscopic structure and properties. For pyrotechnics to produce the desired effect the ingredients must be intimately mixed, however, the present physical mixing approach can lead to inconsistencies in performance between batches. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was used to investigate the distribution of components in a pyrotechnic mixture. Near neighbour distances between particles were calculated and {{used to assess the}} homogeneity of the mixtures and the efficiency of combustion. Another strand of this research to overcome batch inconsistencies was by chemically binding pyrotechnic ingredients rather than physically mixing them together. One method of achieving this was through incorporating two or more components within the same crystalline lattice. This may be achieved through co-crystallisation or coordination in functional frameworks, thereby reducing the number of components in a physical mixture and minimising the variation between batches. Li et al. have investigated using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to stabilise energetic materials. 1 The research presented here uses MOFs to bring together fuels and oxidisers into one framework to create a so-called MOFirework. Numerous linkers and metal centres were investigated to build up a structural family to correlate structure with pyrotechnic function (e. g. changing burn colour; Sr = red, Ba = green). Both powder and single crystal Xray diffraction were used to characterise the products. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to study the thermal profiles to investigate their possible uses as pyrotechnics. Lastly, a burn test was carried out to determine their pyrotechnic effect. <br/...|$|R
5000|$|The {{roof of the}} University of Phoenix Stadium {{was opened}} {{several times during the}} event, marking the third time in WrestleMania history after WrestleMania IX and XXIV that the event has been held in an open-air venue. As in the {{previous}} open-air events, a steel tarpaulin structure was placed over the ring, which was placed at the 50-yard line. Custom-built from Belgium, the tarpaulin held 30 tons of light and camera equipment, with much of the equipment shipped from the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Over 1,000 lights were used, adapting to the decrease in sunlight as the show continued into the night. The entrance stage stood 8 ft off the stadium floor and measured 120 ft wide. In an interview with The Arizona Republic, production manager Brian Petree described the stage design as a [...] "completely new design that hasn't been done anywhere and won't be done again", while production designer Jason Robinson discussed basing his stage design themes often on local flavors. The entrance ramp linking to the stage has been lined with cauldrons of fire, each at a temperature of [...] In addition, 400,000 individual pieces of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>product</b> have been launched 200 ft into the open air after Robinson promised to introduce new types of pyrotechnics never used in a WWE show before. Pre-planning for the set-up began six months before the event, while the construction structures and equipment inside the stadium began two weeks before the event. It is estimated that 100 trucks were used to deliver equipment, in comparison to the 12 semi-trucks used in a regular WWE show.|$|R
50|$|The Special Effects Technician {{classification}} is {{the most}} advanced classification in Canada. Individuals may use any <b>pyrotechnic</b> device or <b>product</b> approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, {{and set up a}} special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics device typically prohibited. A Special Effects Technician may also apply for special certification to use restricted material, such as detonating cord and exploding bolts. Certification is valid for five years.|$|R
40|$|Assessing the {{toxicity}} of military <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>products</b> {{is a growing}} challenge in the current context of Human and Environment protection. The Allied Ordnance Publication (AOP) 45 and the Standard NATO Agreement (STANAG) 4588 “Guidelines for toxicity testing of smokes, obscurants and pyrotechnics mixtures” proposed a practical framework to assess {{the toxicity}} of obscurant smoke compositions in relation with human health hazard and environmental impact. However, the latter document was not ratified and therefore withdrawn as it was impractical to implement. The PROTOCOL study, carried out by LACROIX and TNO and sponsored by the Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA), allowed {{to pave the way}} for a new methodological approach for assessing the acute inhalation toxicity of obscurant and decoy smoke compositions. The aim was to establish to which extent in silico predictions and/or in vitro toxicity experiments can replace animal testing. On the basis of experimental results, it appeared that at the present time the in silico and in vitro approaches cannot replace totally in vivo toxicity tests on animals. Nevertheless, a methodological procedure was proposed allowing the reduction of animal use...|$|E
40|$|Pyrotechnic {{composite}} materials {{are widely used}} in military and civil applications as solid composite (heterogeneous) propellants and gas-generators in rocket motors. Nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are used to detect defects which can disturb in reliable and safe functioning of these materials and products or distinctly decrease {{the level of their}} performance characteristics. These defects are caused by intrusions, voids, caverns (e. g. air bubbles), cracks and stratifications of different size, having different shapes and densities than the main (matrix) material. Defects in composite <b>pyrotechnic</b> materials and <b>products</b> can be created in their production stage or in service time esp. during long-term storage. The diverse and changeable environmental conditions appearing in life cycles of composite <b>pyrotechnic</b> materials and <b>products</b> including such materials, decide in considerable degree about their physicochemical properties such as thermal and mechanical characteristics, physicochemical stability, material compatibility (esp. chemical reactivity) and durability. In this paper both computer simulations to define defects which could be detected by using IR thermography method, and selected experimental investigations are presented...|$|R
50|$|The Senior Pyrotechnician {{classification}} is {{the intermediate}} classification in Canada. Individuals can supervise other pyrotechnicians and use any <b>pyrotechnic</b> device or <b>product</b> approved {{for use in}} Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, {{and set up a}} special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics typically prohibited while under the direct supervision of a Special Effects Technician. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Special Effects Technician certification. Certification is valid for five years.|$|R
50|$|Thermalite a {{specific}} type of fuse used in <b>pyrotechnic</b> applications. The <b>product</b> was designed to be used in cross matching safety fuses of the Bickford type. As safety fuse is designed to neither give nor take fire through the heavy fuse jacket, ignition may be achieved by punching a hole perpendicular to and through a safety fuse powder core, threading a piece of Thermalite or similar igniter cord through the hole, then gently squeezing the safety fuse with pliers or similar to bring the powder core into contact with the igniter cord. The Thermalite could be ignited by a match, or more certainly by a purpose made igniter, similar to a wire sparkler.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{missiles}} {{equipped with}} modern seeker technology {{are able to}} distinguish between target and decoy flares evaluating spectroscopic emission. So, future flares must be adapted to the thermal and spectral emissivity of the platform to be protected. One way to achieve such spectral flares consists {{in the application of}} so-called pyro-organic flares. The idea is to combine hydrocarbon combustion to meet spectral requirements and pyrotechnic mixtures to increase the radiation intensity. In this study HTPB bonded samples with AP as oxidizer and different pyrotechnical mixtures were prepared and tested with regard to potential use as a spectral flare. Two thermite mixtures, and a titanium/graphite mixture compared to pure titanium and a titanium carbide mixture were used. The combustion experiments were performed once in free atmosphere at normal pressure, and even at reduced pressure levels. It can be shown that all investigated samples have good combustion properties as well as very good spectral properties even at reduced pressure. The oxidation of the binder and post combustion with ambient air of the <b>pyrotechnic</b> reaction <b>products</b> lead to a second reaction phase resulting in a favorable β/α-ratio. Most promising mixtures for further investigations are with thermite as pyrotechnic component...|$|R
40|$|IR decoy flares proved as {{effective}} measure to protect various military platforms {{as well as}} civilian airplanes. Recent missiles equipped with modern seeker technology are able to distinguish between target and decoy flares evaluating spectroscopic emission. So advanced decoy flares have to be adapted to the thermal and spectral emissivity of the platform to be protected. Conventional MTV decoy flares emit a continuous IR spectrum, whereas the exhaust plume of a jet gives distinct band signatures {{of carbon dioxide and}} water. In [1] an approach called “pyro-organic flares” was introduced including the idea to combine hydrocarbon combustion to settle spectral requirements and pyrotechnic mixtures to increase the radiation intensity. In recent developments HTPB bonded samples including AP as oxidizer and different pyrotechnical mixtures were prepared and tested with regard to potential use as a spectral flare. Two thermite mixtures and a titanium/graphite mixture were used. Lab-scale combustion experiments were performed once in free atmosphere at normal pressure, and in a vessel at reduced air pressure of 10 to 100 kPa that covers the complete profile of potential application. All investigated samples satisfied in combustion properties as well as spectral properties at these pressure levels. Measured emission temperatures determined on the distinct CO 2 and water bands were several hundred Kelvin higher compared of MTV. The studies indicate post-combustion with ambient air of the binder residues and the <b>pyrotechnic</b> reaction <b>product</b> TiC resulting in a favorable β/α-ratio. Most promising compositions were selected for real scale investigations at the ICT aerodynamic test stand in flow fields corresponding to helicopter, transporter and jet plane conditions. All specimens ignite prompt and burn stable under all tested aerodynamic conditions forming large flare volumes with thermal and spectral properties close to those achieved during the lab-scale tests...|$|R
