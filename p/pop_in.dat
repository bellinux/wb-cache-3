5|$|As {{leaders in}} the punk rock scene, the Ramones' music has usually been {{identified}} with that label, while some have defined their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk and others as power <b>pop.</b> <b>In</b> the 1980s, the band sometimes veered into hardcore punk territory, as can be heard on Too Tough to Die.|$|E
5|$|During the {{recording}} of the album <b>Pop</b> <b>in</b> 1996, Mullen suffered from severe back problems. Recording was delayed due to surgery. When he left the hospital, he arrived back in the studio to find {{the rest of the}} band experimenting more than ever with electronic drum machines, something driven largely by guitarist The Edge's interest in dance and hip-hop music, and, given his weakness after the operation, he relented, allowing The Edge to continue using drum machines, which contributed heavily to the album's electronic feel.|$|E

With McKagan performing lead vocals and bass duties, Loaded's line-up consisted of guitarists Dez Cadena and Michael Barragan as well as drummer Taz Bentley.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1980s {{also saw}} Gospel music see its {{popularity}} peak. A {{new form of}} gospel had evolved, called Contemporary Christian music (CCM). CCM had {{been around since the}} late 1960s, and consisted of a pop/rock sound with slight religious lyrics. CCM had become the most popular form of gospel by the mid-1980s, especially with artists like Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, and Kathy Troccoli. Amy Grant was the most popular CCM, and gospel, singer of the 1980s, and after experiencing unprecedented success in CCM, crossed over into mainstream <b>pop</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s and 1990s. Michael W. Smith also had considerable success in CCM before crossing over to a successful career in pop music as well. Grant would later produce CCM's first #1 pop hit ("Baby Baby"), and CCM's best-selling album (Heart In Motion).|$|E

40|$|Most birds preen their {{feathers}} with an oily excrete {{from the}} uropygial (preen) gland. This oily excrete contains {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs), which make the preen gland a potential route of depuration of <b>POPs</b> <b>in</b> birds. Black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) were studied during two periods of high energy demand: incubation and chick-rearing. A rather high concentration of <b>POPs</b> <b>in</b> preen gland tissue indicates that the preen gland secrete is an excretory pathway for <b>POPs</b> <b>in</b> kittiwakes. The similarity <b>in</b> the <b>POP</b> profile detected <b>in</b> this study of liver, preen gland and feathers suggests that <b>POPs</b> found <b>in</b> the feathers are excreted through the preen gland. The finding also indicates that excretion of POPs through the preen gland is compound unspecific. This qualitative study should be followed up by a new quantitative study to determine the importance of excretion of POPs through the preen gland...|$|R

Some uncertainty over the cause of his injury exists, however, with other sources contending that he damaged his elbow while throwing to first after fielding a bunt from Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton.
