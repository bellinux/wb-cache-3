5|$|Planning for the 6th National Congress {{began at}} the 19-day-long 10th <b>plenum</b> of the 5th Central Committee (19 May – 9 June 1986). Lê Duẩn, the General Secretary, gave the opening speech, where he reaffirmed the central party leadership's {{commitment}} to reform. The 10th <b>plenum</b> unanimously approved the draft Political Report for the 6th National Congress. Preparations for the Congress began with party congresses at the grass-root and provincial-levels, during which delegates were elected.|$|E
5|$|Before the 5th Central Committee <b>Plenum,</b> Lê Duẩn {{believed}} that Vietnam {{was in a}} perilous position, although no talk of reforms followed. Beginning in 1979, Lê Duẩn acknowledged that economic policy mistakes {{had been made by}} the national Party and State leadership.|$|E

5|$|Developed {{alongside}} the subsonic and smaller Hawker Siddeley P.1127/Kestrel, the P.1154 {{was derived from}} the P.1150. The P.1150 proposal did not meet NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 and, consequently, the P.1154 was born. This Mach 2-capable aircraft retained <b>plenum</b> chamber burning previously designed for the P.1150. Although the technical winner of eleven submissions, follow-on testing and production for the P.1154 did not proceed as a result of political strife.|$|E
5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th <b>plenum</b> of the 9th Central Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the general secretary, the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} Central Committee from one-fourth to one-third, holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, empowering delegates to self-nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one. These suggestions, with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier, were rejected at the 11th <b>plenum</b> of the 9th Central Committee in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|The 1st <b>plenum</b> of the 6th Central Committee {{brought an}} end to the {{protracted}} generational succession which had begun at the 4th National Congress in 1976. On 17 December, the Congress' third day, the three top leadersTrường Chinh, Lê Đức Thọand head of government Phạm Văn Đồng, announced that they would not seek membership of the 6th Politburo or the 6th Central Committee. However, these three were appointed to the Advisory Council to the Central Committee. This was not new; at the 5th National Congress six senior members of the 5th Politburo retired. When asked by foreign journalists if the same pattern would continue, a party spokesman stated that it would continue at the 6th National Congress. Văn Tiến Dũng, the Minister of National Defense, retired from the politburo but retained his seat in the 6th Central Committee. The 1st <b>plenum</b> elected Nguyễn Văn Linh to succeed Trường Chinh as party General Secretary.|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of a gross argon spill from the DO detector, the liquid argon is caught in three <b>plenums.</b> These <b>plenums</b> are to be {{connected}} by bellows to make a horizontal trough open at one end for removing the argon. The design of these bellows is dependent on the maximum argon load they must carry. Bellows to connect the three argon-catching <b>plenums</b> in the DO detector must be able to carry at least 92 lbs of argon when closed and 231 lbs when open, plus the load due to argon in the convolutions. Examples of such loads and the method for their calculations are contained in the Discussion. It should be noted that a set of assumptions was used in these calculations. First, we considered a uniform channel and uniform flow. Second, we used a value for Manning's n meant for a similar, but not exactly the same, case. Finally, we were forced to define an average depth, d, to be used to state the hydraulic radius, R, and area of flow, A. These facts may warrant consideration in future calculations...|$|R

5|$|The 10th Politburo {{comprised}} 14 members. As {{was decided}} {{at the first}} <b>plenum,</b> the ranking given to Politburo members was {{to be decided by}} the number of approval votes the official earned during the election. Lê Hồng Anh, the Minister of Public Security, was ranked second in the Politburo because he received the second-most approval votes for his candidacy. Of the 14 members of the Politburo, five were concurrently members of the 10th Secretariat. The Secretariat comprised eight members, amongst whom the highest rank was general secretary.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{approved}} the general secretary's Political Report, Report on Orientations and Tasks for Socio-Economic Development for the 2006–10 Period, and the Report on Party building and amendments {{made to the}} party statute. These reports' main objectives were to accelerate the reform process and strengthen the socialist-oriented market economy. The congress allowed existing party members to engage in private ownership. This was a controversial amendment and was a break with the theory of exploitation of man by man. While the amendment was approved, the third <b>plenum</b> of the 10th Central Committee restricted the change to party members who had worked in state-owned enterprises which have been privatized.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{development}} of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of <b>plenum</b> chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the thermal}} {{efficiency}} of a solar air collector called unglazed transpired collector (UTC) {{has been investigated}} both experimentally and numerically (CFD). Experimental measurements included the following variables: the temperatures of the air entering and leaving the UTC for three air mass fluxes, three distinct irradiations and two <b>plenums</b> thicknesses. A commercial finite volume software (Fluent) was used to model the heat transfer through the UTC. Turbulent effects were modelled by the RNG k–ɛ turbulence model. It was found that a weak heat exchange process mainly {{took place at the}} plenum; the maximum efficiency differences expected between the two <b>plenums</b> widths (5 and 15 cm) was 2. 85 %...|$|R
40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} high-performance thermal distribution panel (TDP) concept using high-conductivity (greater than 800 W/mK) macro composite skin with in situ heat pipes. The processing technologies proposed to build such a panel {{result in a}} one-piece, inseparable assembly with high conductance in both the X and Y planes. The TDP configuration {{can also be used}} to produce panels with high structural stiffness. The one-piece construction of the TDP eliminates the thermal interface between the cooling <b>plenums</b> and the heat spreader base, and obviates the need for bulky mounting flanges and thick heat spreaders used on baseline designs. The conductivity of the TDP can be configured to exceed 800 W/mK with a mass density below 2. 5 grams per cubic centimeter. This material can provide efficient conductive heat transfer between the in situ heat <b>plenums,</b> permitting the use of thinner panel thicknesses. The <b>plenums</b> may be used as heat pipes, loop heat pipes, or liquid cooling channels. The panel technology used in the TDP is a macro-composite comprised of aluminum-encapsulated annealed pyrolytic graphite (APG). APG is highly aligned crystalline graphite with an in-plane thermal conductivity of 1, 700 W/mK. APG has low shear strength and does not constrain the encapsulating material. The proposed concept has no thermal interfaces between the heat pipes and the spreader plate, further improving the overall conductance of the system. The in situ <b>plenums</b> can also be used for liquid cooling applications. The process can be used to fabricate structural panels by adding a second thin sheet...|$|R
5|$|Consequently, on 13April1961, HSA {{decided to}} conduct {{preliminary}} {{work on a}} supersonic derivative of the P.1127 {{under the guidance of}} Ralph Hooper. This would result in a new design, designated P.1150, which was 50% larger than the preceding P.1127; it was proposed that a new performance enhancing feature be adopted {{in the form of the}} <b>plenum</b> chamber burning (PCB)– essentially an afterburner – in the engine. The P.1150 proposal broadly resembled its P.1127 predecessor despite major changes being made, including its revised fuselage, the adoption of a thinner wing, and an advanced version of the Pegasus engine. The Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine was equipped with a similar arrangement of four swivelling exhaust nozzles, the front nozzles of which were to be equipped with PCB. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the P.1150 was to have been capable of Mach 1.3.|$|E
5|$|Following Nikolai Podgorny's {{removal from}} office, rumours started {{circulating}} within the top circles, {{and on the}} streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health. During one of Kosygin's spells on sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov, a like-minded conservative, to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; through this office Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a backup role. For example, at a Central Committee <b>plenum</b> in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. Following Kosygin's resignation in 1980, Tikhonov, {{at the age of}} 75, was elected the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. At the end of his life, Kosygin feared the complete failure of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985), believing that the sitting leadership was reluctant to reform the stagnant Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in fact, Brezhnev portrayed {{himself as}} a moderate— not as radical as Kosygin but not as {{conservative}} as Shelepin. Brezhnev gave the Central Committee formal permission to initiate Kosygin's 1965 economic reform. According to historian Robert Service, Brezhnev did modify some of Kosygin's reform proposals, {{many of which were}} unhelpful at best. In his early days, Brezhnev asked for advice from provincial party secretaries, and spent hours each day on such conversations. During the March 1965 Central Committee <b>plenum,</b> Brezhnev took control of Soviet agriculture, another hint that he opposed Kosygin's reform program. Brezhnev believed, in contrast to Khrushchev, that rather than wholesale re-organization, the key to increasing agricultural output was making the existing system work more efficiently.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the charter}} is the party's highest {{document}} de jure, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il breached party protocol during their rule by not convening party congresses or Central Committee <b>plenums.</b> The charter is, in fact, powerless {{since there is}} no oversight of central-level compliance.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this program was the {{characterization}} of the soils beneath the main air ducts connecting the exhaust <b>plenums</b> with the Fan House. The air <b>plenums</b> experienced water intrusion during BGRR operations and after shutdown. The water intrusions were attributed to rainwater leaks into degraded parts {{of the system and}} to internal cooling water system leaks. As part of the overall characterization efforts, a state-of-the-art gaseous perfluorocarbon tracer technology was utilized to characterize leak pathways from the ducts. This in turn suggests what soil regions under or adjacent to the ductwork should be emphasized in the characterization process. Knowledge of where gaseous tracers leak from the ducts yields a conservative picture of where water transport, out of or into, the ducts might have occurred...|$|R
5|$|Lê Duẩn was informally {{chosen as}} the Party's First Secretary (later known as the General Secretary) by Hồ in 1959, at the January <b>plenum</b> of the Central Committee and {{was elected to the}} post de jure at the 3rd National Congress. Lê Duẩn was not Hồ's {{original}} choice for First Secretary according to Bùi Tín; his preferred candidate was Võ Nguyên Giáp, but since Lê Duẩn was supported by the influential Lê Đức Thọ, the Head of the Party Organisational Department, Lê Duẩn was picked for the post. Lê Duẩn was considered a safe choice because of his time in prison during French rule, his thesis The Road to the South and his strong belief in Vietnamese reunification. Hoàng Văn Hoan claimed, after being sent into exile, that the 3rd National Congress also purged several party members. Indeed, three former ambassadors lost their Central Committee seats.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a glove box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a <b>plenum</b> downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|The Secret Speech, {{combined}} {{with the death of}} Polish communist leader Boleslaw Bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the Speech, sparked considerable liberalization in Poland and Hungary. In Poland, a worker's strike in Poznań developed into disturbances which left more than 50 dead in October 1956. When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim, and instead made concessions to the workers. With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw. While the Soviets were refused entry to the Polish Central Committee <b>plenum</b> where the election was taking place, they met with the Polish Presidium. The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship.|$|E

5|$|The Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{expected to}} reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and loans from international agencies of the capitalist world. The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed {{it would be impossible to}} meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th <b>Plenum</b> of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party's agricultural policies.|$|E
5|$|A First Deputy Premier {{was usually}} given {{responsibility}} over one specific area. For example, Kirill Mazurov {{was responsible for}} industry, and Dmitry Polyansky was agriculture. However, after Polyansky's departure in 1973 Mazurov was left the sole First Deputy Premier until Tikhonov was appointed in 1976. An officeholder could also be responsible for coordinating the activities of ministries and state committees and other subordinate bodies of the Council of Ministers. To do this the First Deputy Premier had to give these bodies guidance in an expeditious manner to ensure the implementation of plans for {{economic and social development}} and to check if the orders and decisions of the Council of Ministers were being followed. If the Premier could not perform his duties one of the First Deputy Premiers would take on the role of acting Premier until the Premier's return. During the late 1970s, when the health of Premier Alexei Kosygin deteriorated, Nikolai Tikhonov, the First Deputy Premier, acted on his behalf during his absence. When Tikhonov took command of the Soviet economy, Kosygin served in a standby role. At a Central Committee <b>plenum</b> in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, and not Kosygin.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{consolidation}} {{to power}} weakened Kosygin's influence and prestige within the Politburo. By the 1970s, when Kosygin's position was given one blow after another, he was frequently hospitalised and at several occasions Kiril Mazurov, the First Deputy {{chairman of the}} Council of Ministers, acted on his behalf during Kosygin's absence. Kosygin suffered his first heart attack in 1976. After this incident, {{it is said that}} Kosygin changed from having a vibrant personality to being tired and fed up; he, according to people close to him, seemed to have lost the will to continue his work. He twice filed a letter of resignation between 1976 and 1980, but was turned down on both occasions. During Kosygin's sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Tikhonov, as with Brezhnev, was a conservative, and through his post as First Deputy chairman Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby role. At a Central Committee <b>plenum</b> in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. The powers of the Premier diminished to the point where Kosygin was forced to discuss all decisions made by the Council of Ministers with Brezhnev.|$|E
50|$|WPK congresses and <b>plenums</b> {{became less}} and less frequent, and their {{deliberations}} {{less and less}} substantive. Part {{of the reason for}} the “subservience” of the delegates appears to be the significant turnover between congresses: between 41 and 72 percent of the members of Central Committees selected at each party congress were new to their positions.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to making leadership changes, the Congress also reviews and changes, if necessary, the Party's Constitution, and selects the Central Committee, a powerful decision making body.
