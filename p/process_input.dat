25|$|These {{issues have}} been tied to {{grammatical}} processing performance by testing native speakers of English on the same tasks under stressful conditions: there is shown to be difficulty in grammatical agreement when memory capacity is curtailed, important cues in the language when given noisy input, and processing important structures when not given enough time to <b>process</b> <b>input.</b> This shows that knowledge cannot always be automatically and consistently applied under stressful situations without having processing difficulties. However, these issues are not necessarily independent of each other, as low decoding ability of structure could affect processing speed. Overall, individual differences in L2 working memory and decoding ability are correlated to grammaticality judgment accuracy and latencies. However, there is no correlation between speed of processing measure and grammaticality judgment performance, age of arrival correlates with syntactic mastery, and knowledge of vocabulary probably drives grammaticality performance.|$|E

30|$|In today’s rapidly {{changing}} scenario {{in the manufacturing}} industries, optimization of process parameters is essential for a manufacturing unit to respond effectively to the severe competitiveness and increasing demand for quality products in the market (Cook et al. 2000). Previously, to obtain optimal combinations of <b>input</b> <b>process</b> parameters, engineers used a trial-and-error-based approach, which relied on engineers’ experience and intuition. However, the trial-and-error-based approach is expensive and time consuming; thus, it is not suitable for complex manufacturing processes (Chen et al. 2009). Thus, researchers have focused their attention on developing alternate methods to the trial-and-error-based approach that can help engineers obtain the combination of process parameters that will minimize or maximize the desired objective value for a given process. The methods for obtaining these combinations of process parameters can be split into 2 main categories: 1. forward mapping of <b>process</b> <b>inputs</b> to a performance indicator with backwards optimization and 2. reverse mapping between the performance indicators and the <b>process</b> <b>inputs.</b> In forward mappings, first, a model is created between the <b>process</b> <b>inputs</b> and the performance indicators using either physics-based models, regressions models, or intelligent techniques. Once a satisfactory model has been created, it is then utilized to obtain the combination of process parameters {{that will lead to}} a desired value of the output using optimization techniques such as the Genetic algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), etc. The desired output can either be to a. minimize a given performance indicator or b. reach a desired level of a performance indicator.|$|R
