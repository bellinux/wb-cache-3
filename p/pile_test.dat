This article provides a critical analysis of the research literature on the clinimetric properties of tests to measure neck muscle strength or endurance in patients with non-specific neck pain, which can be used in daily practice. Methods A computerised literature search was performed in the Medline, CINAHL and Embase databases from 1980 to January 2007. Two reviewers independently assessed the clinimetric properties of identified measurement methods, using a checklist of generally accepted criteria for reproducibility (inter- and intra-observer reliability and agreement), construct validity, responsiveness and feasibility. Results The search identified a total of 16 studies. The instruments or tests included were: muscle endurance tests for short neck flexors, craniocervical flexion test with an inflatable pressure biofeedback unit, manual muscle testing of neck musculature, dynamometry and functional lifting tests (the cervical progressive iso-inertial lifting evaluation (<b>PILE)</b> <b>test</b> and the timed weighted overhead test). All the articles included report information on the reproducibility of the tests. Acceptable intra- and inter-observer reliability was demonstrated for t enduranctest for short neck flexors and the cervical <b>PILE</b> <b>test.</b> Construct validity and responsiveness have hardly been documented for tests on muscle functioning. Conclusion The endurance test of the short neck flexors and the cervical <b>PILE</b> <b>test</b> can be regarded as appropriate instruments for measuring different aspects of neck muscle function in patients with non-specific neck pain.

The Kentledge system (a <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> loaded in between two tension piles) has been used to execute the <b>pile</b> <b>tests.</b> The soil stratigraphy has been surveyed with standard penetration tests, cone penetration tests and borings, and consists of a ten to twelve meter soft clayey soil on top of a hard clay layer. Three identical <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed on bored piles with a pile diameter of 0. 6 m and a pile length of 30 m. In addition, two identical <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed on driven piles with a squared cross section of 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m and a pile length of about 21 m. The aims of these tests were, first to evaluate the pile bearing capacity for both the bored and the driven pile types, in order to decide which pile type will be used finally, for the foundation of a factory; and second, to study the influence of the pile installation process on the pile bearing capacity of both pile types. During the testing of the bored piles, load measurements in different sections of the pile suggested that almost all bearing capacity came from the pile section in the upper soft clay layer. Since it is impossible to have such a relative large friction along the pile shaft in the soft soil, and because far more concrete was used for making the pile than expected, it had to be concluded that the liquid concrete has widened the pile diameter just above the hard soil layer, leading to a bulking effect in the pile. Therefore, the pile was leaning on this hard soil layer.

ObjectiveThe principal objective {{of this study is}} to search differences in abilities of maximal lifting, aerobic capacities and endurance of the spinal extensors, which are determinants of ability of lifting, between obese and non obese patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Material and methodsA progressive iso-inertial lifting evaluation, a Sorensen test and a cycloergometer exercise test with VO 2 measurement were performed on 321 patients hospitalized in the unit of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of the hospital of Château-Renault for rehabilitation for a chronic pain syndrome. ResultsThe maximum weight lifted during <b>PILE</b> <b>test</b> (in kilogram) was more important in obese patients (n= 65) than in non-obese patients (n= 166), and the difference was in the limit of significativity (p= 0. 0472).

40|$|Due to {{wind and}} wave actions, ship impacts, {{high-speed}} vehicles, {{and other sources}} of loading, structures such as offshore platforms, tall buildings, high-rise bridges, and electric transmission towers undergo significant torsional loads. Insufficient design of the foundations of these structures against torsional loads may affect the serviceability and safety of these structures. The objectives of this research are: (1) {{through a series of}} centrifuge model tests, to build basic understanding of load sharing mechanisms in pile groups subjected to torsion, pile-soil-pile interactions in torsionally loaded pile groups, and the load-deformation coupling effects in the pile groups and (2) to develop a model to analyze the problems in a rational manner. A series of centrifuge tests, including eight laterally loaded single <b>pile</b> <b>tests,</b> twelve torsionally loaded single <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> and seven torsionally loaded <b>pile</b> group <b>tests,</b> were performed to achieve the objectives. The laterally loaded single <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> and the torsionally loaded single <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> were performed using a robotic manipulator. It is perhaps {{the first time that a}} robotic manipulator was used to perform the two types of single <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> in centrifuge. The robotic manipulator was utilized to conduct multiple activities in each test and multiple tests at different loading rates. A separate testing system was developed to conduct the torsionally loaded <b>pile</b> group <b>tests.</b> The testing system can achieve pile jacking and torsional loading without stopping the centrifuge. Using this testing system, seven model tests on 1 x 2, 2 x 2, and 3 x 3 pile groups subjected to torsion were conducted. These tests produced the first batch of experimental data on performance of torsionally loaded pile groups. Test results of the pile groups were compared with those of the single <b>piles.</b> The <b>test</b> results reveal the load sharing mechanism. An applied torque on a pile group is primarily resisted by the torsional and lateral resistances of the individual piles in the group. The torsional and lateral resistances of the piles significantly rely on their locations in the group. The different lateral displacements of the piles at different locations are proportional to the distances from the piles to the torsional centre of the group. Consequently, different shear resistances are mobilized in the piles. Through the deflection-torsion coupling effect, the different lateral resistances then result in the different torsional resistances. In addition, pile-soil-pile interactions also influence the load sharing. Test results show that pile-soil-pile interactions are different for the piles at different locations in the pile group. The <b>pile</b> group <b>test</b> results reveal that effects of lateral movement of the pile on lateral and torsional behaviours of adjacent piles exist in torsionally loaded pile groups. In the 3 x 3 <b>pile</b> group <b>tests,</b> both the pile-head shear forces and the p-y curves demonstrate that side piles and the corner piles in the group interact each other. The induced reductions of the soil resistances in these piles were different. Meanwhile, the side piles were found to affect the torque distributions of the corner piles, as well as their torsional resistances. Patterns of shear zones of piles in pile groups subjected to torsion and lateral loading were found to be significantly different. The difference implies that empirical interaction factors from numerous laterally loaded <b>pile</b> group <b>tests</b> can hardly be used to analyze torsionally loaded pile groups. The deflection-torsion coupling effect was also analyzed. Generally, for a pile in a torsionally loaded pile group, the increase of the soil pressures in front of the pile in lateral loading direction contributes to increase normal stresses on the pile surface. Therefore, the torsional shaft friction increases with the group torsional angle. A factor is introduced to quantify the coupling effect in the <b>pile</b> group <b>tests.</b> A relation between the factor and lateral soil reaction is proposed. Through studying the results of the centrifuge tests, a hybrid model was developed to formulate the problem. In the model, load-transfer curves were used to model nonlinear soil behaviour, which occurs in the near fields around piles. The pile-soil-pile interactions were predicted through Mindlin's solutions. A coupling coefficient was introduced to formulate the deflection-torsion coupling effect in pile groups. This model achieved fairly good agreement with the centrifuge test results...|$|R
