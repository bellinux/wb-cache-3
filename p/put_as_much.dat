500|$|The Ise {{class were}} the only Japanese battleships to place the powder {{magazine}} above the shell magazine as the IJN wished to <b>put</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> space as possible between the highly flammable propellant and mine and torpedo detonations. The danger from plunging shells at long distances was not appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions of three British battlecruisers during the 1916 Battle of Jutland graphically demonstrated the point. To further protect the magazines {{the depth of the}} double bottom was increased to a total of [...] underneath the barbettes and magazines. Additionally, the vessels contained 660 watertight compartments to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage. In addition to the torpedo bulge added when the ships were modernized, the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total thickness of 140mm. Inside the original skin of the ships, two torpedo bulkheads were also added and the turret roofs were increased to a total of [...] of armour.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{the problem}} with {{creating}} [...] "mytharc" [...] for the writers was due to the fact that, because there were so few mythology episodes each season, they were often forced to <b>put</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> material as they could into each episode. Originally, {{a large portion of the}} episode was supposed to reveal the history of the Syndicate via flashback. Reportedly, these scenes would have featured younger versions of Bill Mulder (played by Peter Donat), The Smoking Man, Dr. Openshaw, the Elders, and many others. However, this never panned out, and Carter and Spotnitz had to reframe the episode around narration courtesy of the Smoking Man, which was filmed and edited under extreme pressure near the end of production. While the previous episode, [...] "Two Fathers", was titled after the duality of Bill Mulder and The Smoking Man, this episode was titled [...] "One Son" [...] to reflect the fact that Mulder was the only remaining son of either of these fathers, after the shooting of Jeffrey Spender and the rejection of Alex Krycek.|$|E

Rotten Tomatoes sampled 349 reviewers and judged 93% of the reviews to be positive, while the film scored 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 49 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". A number of critics, including Kate Muir, reviewing for The Times, Philip French, writing in The Observer, IGN's Daniel Krupa and the reviewers for the Irish Independent and the Daily Record, all asked whether Skyfall was the best Bond film produced. The Daily Telegraphs film reviewer, Robbie Collin, considered Skyfall to be [...] "often dazzling, always audacious", with excellent action sequences in a film that contained humour and emotion. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter thought that Skyfall was [...] "dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor", going {{on to say that}} it was a film that had [...] "some weight and complexity to it". Variety Peter DeBruge suggested that the film's greatest strength lay in its willingness to <b>put</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> focus on characterisation as it did action set-pieces, allowing the two to co-exist rather than compete for the audience's attention, while Manohla Dargis, reviewing for The New York Times, considered Skyfall to be [...] "a superior follow-up to Casino Royale" [...] which is [...] "opulent rather than outlandish and insistently, progressively low-key". Kim Newman, reviewing the film for Empire, concluded, [...] "Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as [...] "a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon". Reviewing for the New Statesman, Ryan Gilbey saw that [...] "nostalgia permeates the movie", going on to say that [...] "sometimes the old ways are the best".|$|E

2500|$|In cingulate or subfalcine herniation, {{the most}} common type, the {{innermost}} part of the frontal lobe is scraped under part of the falx cerebri, the dura mater {{at the top of}} the head between the two hemispheres of the brain. Cingulate herniation can be caused when one hemisphere swells and pushes the cingulate gyrus by the falx cerebri. This does not <b>put</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> pressure on the brainstem as the other types of herniation, but it may interfere with blood vessels in the frontal lobes that are close to the site of injury (anterior cerebral artery), or it may progress to central herniation. [...] Interference with the blood supply can cause dangerous increases in ICP that can lead to more dangerous forms of herniation. [...] Symptoms for cingulate herniation are not well defined. [...] Usually occurring in addition to uncal herniation, cingulate herniation may present with abnormal posturing and coma.

2500|$|The {{problem of}} {{producing}} {{large amounts of}} high purity uranium was solved by Frank Spedding using the thermite or [...] "Ames" [...] process. Ames Laboratory was established in 1942 to produce the large amounts of natural (unenriched) uranium metal that would be necessary for the research to come. The critical nuclear chain-reaction success of the Chicago Pile-1 (December2, 1942) which used unenriched (natural) uranium, like all of the atomic [...] "piles" [...] which produced the plutonium for the atomic bomb, was also due specifically to Szilard's realization that very pure graphite {{could be used for}} the moderator of even natural uranium [...] "piles". In wartime Germany, failure to appreciate the qualities of very pure graphite led to reactor designs dependent on heavy water, which in turn was denied the Germans by Allied attacks in Norway, where heavy water was produced. These difficulties—among many others— prevented the Nazis from building a nuclear reactor capable of criticality during the war, although they never <b>put</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> effort as the United States into nuclear research, focusing on other technologies (see German nuclear energy project for more details).|$|E
