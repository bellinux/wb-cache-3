The first {{member of the}} family discovered, it was originally identified by accident in the 1950s. A component of mouse leukemia extract capable of causing tumors, particularly in the parotid gland, in newborn mice was reported by Ludwik Gross in 1953 and identified as a virus by Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy at the National Cancer Institute, after whom it was once called [...] "SE polyoma".

50|$|The gland {{most likely}} {{affected}} is the parotid gland. In fact, {{it is the}} only tumor virtually restricted to the parotid gland. Though much less likely to occur than pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin's tumor is the second most common benign <b>parotid</b> <b>tumor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of parotid gland tumors is sometimes {{difficult because of}} the anatomical relations {{of the facial nerve}} parotid lodge, as well as the increased potential for postoperative relapse. Thus, detection of early stages of a <b>parotid</b> <b>tumor</b> is extremely important in terms of postoperative prognosis.

40|$|The {{preoperative}} and intraoperative {{diagnosis of}} <b>parotid</b> gland <b>tumors</b> is difficult, but {{is important for}} their surgical management. In order to explore an intraoperative diagnostic method, Raman spectroscopy is applied to detect the normal <b>parotid</b> gland and <b>tumors,</b> including pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin's tumor and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. In the 600 - 1800 cm- 1 region of the Raman shift, there are numerous spectral differences between the <b>parotid</b> gland and <b>tumors.</b> Compared with Raman spectra of the normal parotid gland, the Raman spectra of <b>parotid</b> <b>tumors</b> show an increase of the peaks assigned to nucleic acids and proteins, but a decrease of the peaks related to lipids. Spectral differences also exist between the spectra of <b>parotid</b> <b>tumors.</b> Based on these differences, a remarkable classification and diagnosis of the <b>parotid</b> gland and <b>tumors</b> are carried out by support vector machine (SVM), with high accuracy (96. 7 ～ 100 %), sensitivity (93. 3 ～ 100 %) and specificity (96. 7 ～ 100 %).

The {{purpose of this}} study was to retrospectively analyze all cases of <b>parotid</b> <b>tumors</b> treated at our institution from 1953 to 2003. Methods. All patients with primary <b>parotid</b> <b>tumors</b> were selected; clinical and histopathological data were analyzed and described. Results. 600 cases of <b>parotid</b> <b>tumors</b> were selected; 369 were benign and 231 were malignant. Pleomorphic adenoma was the most frequent benign tumor. The most common malignant tumor was the mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Therapy in most cases consisted of parotidectomy. Adjuvant therapy – mainly radiotherapy – was used in some cases with malignant tumors. The incidences of local, regional and distant recurrences of malignant tumors were 10 %, 8 % and 9 %. Conclusion. Patients with <b>parotid</b> <b>tumors</b> treated at our institution were mainly adults, with marginally more female patients.

40|$|Abstract. Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) infection {{has been}} shown to be associated with human tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the association between HPV infection and <b>parotid</b> gland <b>tumors.</b> Paraffin‑embedded tissue sections from 59 cases of <b>parotid</b> gland <b>tumors</b> and 20 normal oral mucosa were subjected to DNA extraction and flow‑through hybridization and gene chip technology to detect infection of 37 HPV types. The HPV-positive rate was 57. 6 % in <b>parotid</b> gland <b>tumor</b> paraffin‑embedded tissue specimens, whereas, the normal control group was negative for HPV. The HPV-positive rate was 59. 6 % in <b>parotid</b> gland benign <b>tumor</b> tissues and 42. 9 % in parotid malignant tissues. HPV infec-tion in <b>parotid</b> gland <b>tumors</b> was dominated by the high-risk subtypes (80. 7 %), which mainly consisted of HPV 16, 18 and 52 (61. 4 %). In addition, <b>parotid</b> gland <b>tumor</b> tissues were found to be infected by multiple or single types of HPV, but were predominantly infected by mixed HPV types.

MethodsHBsAg and HBcAg were examined in parotid biopsy tissues from patients with suspected <b>parotid</b> <b>tumor</b> and positive serum HBV markers by immunocytochemistry, and HBV DNA was detected in parotid tissues by PCR. ResultsAmong the 22 patients with a <b>parotid</b> <b>tumor,</b> only one was pathologically confirmed as a neoplasm; all others were benign. HBsAg and HBcAg were present in parotid cells with positive rates of 45. 5 % (10 / 22) and 40. 9 % (9 / 22), respectively, with an overall positive rate of 54. 5 % (12 / 22). Of the 22 cases with serum markers of HBV infection, seven (31. 8 %) had both HBsAg and HBcAg in the parotid cells.
