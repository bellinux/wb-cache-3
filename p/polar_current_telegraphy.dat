A normal convection current system exists quasi-persistently in the polar cap during extended quiet or weakly disturbed periods of auroral electrojet activity.

30|$|We {{contend that}} the {{possibility}} of there being two types of high-latitude current systems might have been implicit in some of the earlier studies that relied only on ground-based magnetic observations (Pytte et al. 1978). Two types of <b>polar</b> <b>current</b> systems, DP 1 and DP 2, have been proposed (Nishida and Kamide 1983). DP 2 consists of the eastward electrojet centered in the evening sector and the westward electrojet centered in the late morning sector, while DP 1 is dominated by the westward electrojet in the midnight sector. It {{is important to note that}} these two modes do coexist at all times during disturbed periods and that the relative strength of these two current systems varies from time to time, making individual current patterns very complicated.|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} for {{the electric}} <b>current</b> in the <b>polar</b> ionosphere {{have been made}} by assuming some realistic distributions of the electric field and conductivity. Two dynamo actions are taken into account; one of which is induced by ionospheric winds and the other by the solar wind. For the solar wind dynamo action, it is found that the secondary polarization field caused by nonuniform distribution of ionospheric conductivity is much larger than the primary field induced by the solar wind, suggesting its important effect on charged particles in the magnetosphere, and that the irrotational current having a source and sink is of the same order of magnitude as the solenoidal current closing its circuit in the ionosphere.

60|$|But our broad simple {{statement}} about the upper current from the equator, and the under current from the pole, requires a slight modification, which we thought it best not to mingle with the statement itself. The heated air from the equator does indeed commence to flow in an upper current, and the cooled air from the pole in an under current; but, as the upper currents of air are speedily cooled by exposure to space, and the under currents are heated by contact with the earth's surface, they constantly change places--the lower current becoming the upper, and vice versa. But they do not change direction. The Equatorial Current ascends, rushes north to a point about latitude 30 degrees, where, being sufficiently cooled, it swoops down, and continues its Northward rush along the earth. At another point the <b>Polar</b> <b>Current</b> quits the earth, and soaring up, in consequence of its recently acquired heat, becomes the upper current.

He sailed for some distance along those rugged and forbidding shores, a land of desolation, with jagged mountains and furrowed cliffs, wrapped in snow and ice. No trace of the lost civilization of the Norsemen met his eyes. The Portuguese pilot considered Greenland at its southern point to be an outstanding promontory of Asia, and he struggled hard to pass beyond it westward to a more favoured region. But his path was blocked by 'enormous masses of frozen snow floating on the sea, and moving {{under the influence of the}} waves.' It is clear that he was met not merely by the field ice of the Arctic ocean, but also by great icebergs moving slowly with the <b>polar</b> <b>current.</b> The narrative tells how Corte-Real's crew obtained fresh water from the icebergs. 'Owing to the heat of the sun, fresh and clear water is melted on the summits, and, descending by small channels formed by the water itself, it eats away the base where it falls. The boats were sent in, and in that way as much was taken as was needed.' ...|$|R
3000|$|The {{satellite}} {{sees as a}} {{field of}} internal origin {{the sum of the}} main field generated by the dynamo, the lithospheric field, and the field generated by electric currents flowing in the ionosphere below the perigee of the satellite, especially according to the classical views, in the E layer at 110 km altitude (Ratcliffe, 1972). The satellites also encounter electric currents since they are flying in {{the upper part of the}} F layer. In particular, the fields associated with field-aligned electric <b>currents</b> in the <b>polar</b> regions can be large. But, as discussed in Section 2.6, despite their large magnitude, they do not severely affect the aimed modeling (the computation of internal low ([...] 13) degree Gauss coefficients from data covering a given time interval). So, we may reasonably assume that the essential part of the field which is external to the solid Earth but internal to the satellites orbits is generated by currents in the E layer, i.e., currents driven by the atmospheric dynamo and currents driven in high latitude regions by forces originating high in the ionosphere (the <b>polar</b> <b>current</b> system) (Ratcliffe, 1972; Encrenaz et al., 2004).|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{analyses}} of recently collected bathymetric and sparker seismic data, support a new {{interpretation of the}} Landes Plateau field of sediment waves located on the Aquitaine upper continental slope (Bay of Biscay). The wave geometry, previously described {{as the result of}} a major sediment failure, is interpreted as a structure with a complex origin including the interaction of depositional and gravity deformation processes. Depositional processes are mainly recorded by the upslope migrating pattern of the waves resulting from oblique or sigmoid downlap reflections on the upslope flank of the waves and by toplapping and truncated reflections on the downslope flank. Hemipelagic and turbiditic sedimentation may be involved in the wave building as well as contouritic processes that could be related to the existing northward <b>polar</b> <b>current</b> and internal waves. Gravity deformations are syndepositional, discontinuous and of low amplitude, affecting thick layers which alternate with undeformed layers. They seem to correspond to gentle sediment creeping or stretching associated with minor listric or compaction-like faults, and possible limited back rotation of sediment blocks. These multi-process generated sediment waves could be rather common on the continental margins as they could have been mistaken with either depositional or deformational structures. <br/...|$|R
