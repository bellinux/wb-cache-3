40|$|The present {{activities}} of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), a Directorate General of the European Commission, {{in the field of}} monitoring sea-based oil pollution are described. The methodology used to process and interpret a massive set of satellite images (i. e., mosaics over all European Seas) and the relevant legal framework are briefly introduced. Both the issues of accidental and deliberate oil discharges are addressed. The presentation then focuses on JRC experience acquired on the use of satellite images during the Prestige accident emergency in 2002. At that time, the JRC provided technical assistance on the interpretation of the satellite images to the EC Civil Protection Mechanism and interested EU Member States. In addition to this task, JRC is carrying out a systematic mapping of the illicit vessel discharges using mosaics of satellite images over all the European Seas. These maps and the associated statistics are repeated on an annual basis in order to assess its evolution. The results obtained for the Mediterranean and the Black Sea are of special interest {{due to the lack of}} a regular aerial surveillance as that in the North and in the Baltic Sea. This action helped to reveal for the first time the dimension of the oil pollution problem, thus stressing the need for more concerted international actions. Finally, a strategy to tackle this issue is presented. In this context, the need for additional research efforts involving the competent regional/national authorities and the importance of securing the role of space-borne sensors in support to aerial and naval means are outlined. The proposed strategy is based on the involvement of the end-users. Consequently, the JRC together with DG Environment has established a <b>permanent</b> <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> on satellite monitoring of sea-based oil pollution. JRC.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to elicit an opinion from experts on the {{probable}} extent of the silent spread of Foot -and-mouth-disease (FMD) in Finland in an intensive pig production area starting in a pig farm (Ilmajoki) and an intensive cattle herding area starting in a cattle herd (Nivala). The twelve experts {{involved in the project}} belong to the <b>permanent</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> national <b>experts</b> (epidemiologists, veterinarians and virologists) required by the FMD directive. The assignment consisted of identification and evaluation of major risk factors or spreading the disease in Finnish animal husbandry settings, and the actual estimation of the probable spread based on the risk factors and compiled background information. The most important risk factors were transport of animals (from farm to farm, to the slaughterhouse, carcass disposal), and visits by members of certain professions (e. g. veterinarians) to the farms. Airborne spread was not considered to constitute a significant risk in Finland. The infection was estimated to silently spread to four pig farms and three cattle herds in Ilmajoki area whereas in Nivala it would spread to seven cattle herds and one pig farm. Sheep husbandry is a very minor industry in both areas and the infection was not estimated to spread to sheep flocks in either area. The figures are averages <b>of</b> the twelve <b>expert</b> estimates. The variance in the estimates is satisfactorily moderate. The widest margin in estimates was in the number of infected cattle herds in Nivala area which had a range of 2 – 15 herds...|$|R
