40|$|Wings were a {{fundamental}} morphological innovation for the adaptive radiation of insects, the most diversified group among all animals. Pterygote insects have {{two pairs of}} wings, the mesothoracic (T 2) forewings and the metathoracic (T 3) hindwings, whereas the prothorax (T 1) is wingless. Using RNA interference approaches, {{we have found that}} the gene Sex combs reduced (Scr) determines the wingless identity of T 1 in the cockroach Blattella germanica. Interference of Scr triggers the formation of ectopic wing structures in T 1, which are formed from the expansion of the latero-posterior region of the pronotum, along with a contribution of the epimeron, a <b>pleurite</b> of T 1. These data support the theory of a dual origin for insect wings, from pronotal (tergal origin theory) and pleural (pleural origin theory) structures and genes.

40|$|O trabalho descreve um surto de {{pneumonia}} em ovinos em uma propriedade na região central de Minas Gerais. Clinicamente os animais apresentavam apatia, mostravam dificuldade respiratória durante dois ou três dias ou morriam subitamente. À necropsia as alterações pulmonares eram similares em todos os ovinos. Havia consolidação dos lobos craniais e da parte ventral dos lobos caudais e ao corte fluía exsudato mucopurulento da traquéia e dos brônquios. No parênquima dos lobos craniais havia áreas brancas multifocais a coalescentes com 0, 2 - 0, 5 cm de diâmetro, levemente proeminentes e intercaladas por áreas vermelho-escuras. <b>Pleurite</b> fibrinosa foi observada nos Ovinos 1, 2 e 3. As lesões de consolidação ocupavam cerca de 70 - 80 % da extensão pulmonar. Microscopicamente, as alterações eram de broncopneumonia fibrinopurulenta com intensa hiperemia, áreas com hemorragia intra-alveolar e espessamento dos septos interlobulares por inúmeros neutrófilos, restos celulares e intensa exsudação de fibrina. Áreas multifocais com necrose de liquefação contendo numerosas colônias bacterianas foram observadas no Ovino 3. Nos lobos craniais dos Ovinos 1, 2 e 3, haviam áreas com neutrófilos degenerados formando aglomerados de células alongadas com formato de "grãos de aveia" associados a colônias bacterianas. As alterações histológicas foram características de pneumonia causada por Mannheimia (M.) haemolytica. Amostras dos lobos craniais de todos os ovinos foram encaminhadas para cultivo bacteriológico e M. haemolytica foi isolada e identificada em todos os animais. Este é o primeiro relato correlacionando os achados patológicos e o isolamento de M. haemolytica como causa de broncopneumonia em ovinos no Brasil. This paper {{describes an}} outbreak of pneumonia in a sheep herd in the central region of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Clinically, the animals presented apathy, exhibited respiratory difficulty during 2 to 3 days or sudden death. The animals were not medicated and found dead. Grossly, the pulmonary findings were similar in all sheep. The pulmonary cranial lobes and the ventral portion of caudal lobes were consolidated and purulent exsudate streamed out of the airways. In the parenchyma of the cranial lobes there were white slightly prominent multifocal to coalescent areas with 0. 2 to 0. 5 cm in diameter intercalated with dark red areas. Consolidated lesions occupied 70 to 80 % of the lungs. Fibrinous pleuritis was observed in sheep 1, 2 and 3. Microscopically, the findings were fibrinopurulent bronchopneumonia with intense hyperemia, areas with intra-alveolar hemorrhage and thickening of interlobular septa with numerous neutrophils, cellular rests and scattering fibrin. Multifocal areas with liquefaction necrosis containing numerous bacterial colonies were observed in sheep 1, 2 and 3. In the cranial lobes of these sheep, there were areas with degenerated neutrophils forming clusters of basophilic cells with alongated nuclei ("oat cells") associated with bacterial colonies. The histological findings were characteristic of pneumonia caused by Mannheimia (M.) haemolytica. Samples of the cranial lobes were sent for bacterial culture, and M. haemolytica was isolated and identified in all animals.

Os fragmentos pleurais foram colocados em três frascos distintos: FRA 1 - 3 = 3 primeiros fragmentos, FRA 4 - 8 = 5 fragmentos subseqüentes e FRB 1 - 5 = 5 fragmentos em segundo sítio da superfície pleural. Era retirada a agulha até o subcutâneo, feitas inclinação lateral e reintrodução no espaço pleural. A análise dos fragmentos provindos do FRA 1 - 3 evidenciou {{granuloma}} em 72 / 92 casos de tuberculose (78, 3 %) e no FRA 4 - 8 e FRB 1 - 5, em 74 / 92 casos (80, 5 %). Em 6 / 92 pacientes foram encontrados <b>pleurite</b> inespecífica no FRA 1 - 3 e granuloma no FRA 4 - 8, resultando em acréscimo diagnóstico de 8, 3 % (6 aos 72 pacientes). Em 7 / 92 pacientes (7, 6 %) a HP foi inespecífica no sítio A e mostrou granuloma no sítio B, resultando em acréscimo diagnóstico de 9, 0 % (7 aos 78 pacientes). A concordância histológica intra-observador teve um índice kappa de 0, 62 (0, 54 a 0, 70) e interobservador de 0, 64 (0, 56 a 0, 72). Concluímos que a realização de múltiplas biópsias em dois sítios diferentes da superfície pleural diagnosticou 13 pacientes que não obteriam diagnóstico definitivo se fossem retirados apenas três fragmentos pleurais, resultando em incremento diagnóstico de 18, 0 % (13 aos 72 diagnosticados no FRA 1 - 3), sendo considerado significativo do ponto de vista médico e social. For {{diagnostic purposes}} of pleural tuberculosis, three pleural fragments are routinely {{obtained from a}} single site by needle biopsy. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare the diagnostic yield of the routine procedure with two different approaches: harvesting five fragments on a single site (A), and collection of fragments at an additional site (B); from the same cutaneous orifice, the needle was partially removed up to the subcutaneous tissue and redirected at a 45 º angle. The authors performed a prospective study in 115 patients submitted to pleural biopsy. The first three pleural fragments were placed in a vial (VA 1 - 3), the 5 subsequent fragments obtained at the same site were placed in a second vial (VA 4 - 8), and the five fragments from the second site were placed in a third vial (VB 1 - 5). Analysis of fragments from VA 1 - 3 revealed granuloma in 72 / 92 tuberculosis cases (78. 3 %), whereas in fragments VA 5 - 8 and VB 1 - 5, granuloma was observed in 74 / 92 cases (80. 5 %). In 6 / 92 patients the diagnosis at VA 1 - 3 was non-specific pleuritis, but granuloma was found in VA 4 - 8, resulting in a diagnosis increment of 8. 3 % (adding six to the 72 patients). In 7 / 92 patients (7. 6 %) the histopathological examination at site A led to a non-specific result but granuloma was found at site B, leading to a diagnostic increment of 9. 0 % (7 to 78 patients). Histological concordance of two examinations by the same pathologist had a kappa index of 0. 62 (0. 54 to 0. 7) whereas concordance between two different pathologists had a kappa index of 0. 64 (0. 56 to 0. 72). The performance of multiple biopsies at two different sites at the pleural surface led to an additional diagnosis of 13 patients, i. e., an increase of 18 % (13 to 72) relative to the routine procedure. Considering the low cost increase of obtaining the fragments, adoption of this method is recommended in routine pleural tuberculosis diagnosis...|$|E

50|$|The American {{cockroach}} shows {{a characteristic}} insect morphology with its body bearing divisions as head, trunk, and abdomen. The trunk, or thorax, is divisible in prothorax, mesothorax and metathorax. Each thoracic segment {{gives rise to}} a pair of walking appendages (known as legs). The organism bears two wings. The forewings, known as tegmina arises from mesothorax and is dark and opaque. The hind wings arise from metathorax and are used in flight, though they rarely do. The abdomen is divisible into ten segments each of which is surrounded by chitinous exoskeleton plates called sclerites, including dorsal tergites, ventral sternites and lateral <b>pleurites.</b>|$|R
