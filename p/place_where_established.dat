40|$|This Article posits ten first {{principles}} {{on which a}} regulatory response to the sharing economy must rest. Given the rapid diversification of products in the sharing economy, this Article gives particular focus to the short-term rental market, typified by Airbnb, as one lens through which to illustrate these principles. This Article then turns to review existing regulatory responses to the sharing economy. Here again, the Article focuses on regulations related to the short-term rental market with a particular emphasis on the two strictest, existing local government regulatory structures: those of San Francisco, California and Portland, Oregon. This Article next proposes a response beyond such traditional regulatory strategies that are not well suited to regulating the sharing economy. Instead, this Article proposes a markets-based mechanism, transferable sharing rights, which is better suited to internalize externalities in the short-term rental market. Finally, this Article examines the corporatization of the sharing movement and the implications for regulations as sharing evolves from a peer-to-peer enterprise to a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>established</b> market participants seek to assert themselves in the sharing economy’s new domains...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the article is the {{analysis}} of the notion of communality in the relation between the two protagonists of The Road by Cormac McCarthy. Traversing the post-apocalyptic landscape populated mostly by wretched savages harbouring ill intent towards other human beings, the heroes ostensibly seek a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>establishing</b> a sustainable society composed of the “good guys” can still be possible. However, while for the young son this goal implies the necessity of maintaining a sense of openness and hospitality towards the other, for the father it is the matter of day-to-day survival that takes precedence, which leads to repeated instances of withdrawing help from destitute survivors and avoiding human contact. The boy objects to this behavior, despite being wholly dependent on his father, as his sense of responsibility seems innate and unconditional. The man, on the other hand, gradually recognizes that he was so profoundly afflicted by the experience of losing his world that he cannot overcome his radical pessimism and distrust of the other. Therefore, when the man arrives {{at the end of his}} life, he comes to understand that it is only without him at his side that the son can enter a larger community...|$|R

The goal was to create an independent, accurate, balanced and impartial trilingual (Albanian, Serbian, English) website which offered bias free news and opinion on Kosovo and all related problems. The “Forum” was a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> we <b>established</b> a culture of dialogue {{at the time it}} was missing in real life, bringing together politicians, publicists and experts from both sides in this unique online public space. The project also provided in-depth research on the attitudes among the population at large on how the ordinary man on the street - Albanian and Serb - see “the other”.|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} have made significant investments in nuclear medicine (NM) technology with {{the acquisition of}} modern equipment and establishment of facilities, however, often appropriate training is not considered as part of these investments. Training for NM professionals is continually evolving, with a need to meet changing requirements in the workforce. Even <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>established</b> higher education courses are available, these do not necessarily cater to the practical component of training and the ever-changing technology that is central to medical imaging. The continuing advances in NM technology and growth of applications in quantitative clinical assessment place increases the pressure on technologists to learn and practice new techniques. Not only is training to understand new concepts limited but often there is inadequate training in the basics of NM and {{this can be a}} major constraint to the effective use of the evolving technology. Developing appropriate training programs for the broader international NM community is {{one of the goals of}} the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A particularly successful and relevant development has been the program on 2 ̆ 7 distance assisted training (DAT) for NM professionals 2 ̆ 7. The development of DAT was initiated in the 1990 s through Australian Government funding, administered under auspices of the IAEA through its Regional Cooperative Agreement, involving most countries in Asia that are Member States of the IAEA. The project has resulted in the development of a set of training modules which are designed for use under direct supervision in the workplace, delivered through means of distance-learning. The program has undergone several revisions and peer reviews with the current version providing a comprehensive training package that is now available online. DAT has been utilized widely in Asia or the Pacific region, Latin America, and parts of Africa and Europe. Currently there are approximately 1000 registered participants, including persons providing student support, in the program...|$|R
50|$|As {{better known}} Gjakovar gunsmiths are {{mentioned}} Tusha from the 18th century, {{whose name is}} related to the development of gunsmithery and silversmithery in this town, whereas in the 19th century Emin Kazari, Murat Nuka, Ramadan Nuka, Çaush Basha, Beqir Pula, etc. are mentioned. Referring to the gunsmithery tradition, Theodor Ippen, among other things, wrote, “…Earlier, in Shkodra, Prizren, and in Gjakova, there were large gunsmith, long rifle, and side-handgun and yataghan workshops. These old guns were then in wide use. There are facts, according to which Gjakovar gunsmiths set up workshops also outside their place, competing successfully the products of those <b>places</b> <b>where</b> they <b>established</b> their shops. Thus they caused the discontent of the local gunsmiths. In a letter sent to prince Milos, on 6 October 1837, it is said that in Gurgusovac there is a gunsmith from Gjakova, Bajram Mustafa with his two sons-apprentices, against whom the local craftsmen were complaining.|$|R

5000|$|Escanaba, Michigan (originally called Flat Rock), {{was one of}} the <b>places</b> <b>where</b> Ludington <b>established</b> a sawmill. Since he was {{a pioneer}} of the area and an early {{territory}} developer he gave the name for the city. The name for this new town was suggested to him because of the river nearby, that was called [...] "Escanawba" [...] by the local Indians because of the river bottom consisting of smooth flat rocks. He had a local Indian pronounce the name for his hired surveyor Eli Parsons Royce so that he could write it down on his town design schematic he was making in accordance with instructions from Harrison Ludington. The local American Indian repeated the name several times and Royce put that down on his design lay-out of the new town. The original written spelling was Escanawba and that became the legal name in the Laws of Michigan for 1863. It was changed {{a couple of years later}} by the pioneers to the shortened [...] "Escanaba" [...] with the [...] "w" [...] dropped and became known by that name ever since.|$|R

After having stayed for a few days longer, Galba marched towards Pluvina, and then set up his camp {{on the banks of the}} river Osphagus, not far from the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> Philip had <b>established</b> his camp. Here Galba spent his time securing the territory and taking a number of towns, but did not directly engage Philip in battle. In the autumn Galba went back with his army to Apollonia.

25|$|During {{his years}} as a privateer, Enríquez {{established}} close links with the Spanish Monarchy. His ships were also responsible for the distribution of urgent messages that arrived at San Juan or La Aguada {{to the rest of the}} West Indies. When there was a shortage of royal vessels, Enríquez's fleet was responsible for transporting items on behalf of Spain without charge. His fleet also provided transportation for the authorities that arrived at Puerto Rico en route to other locations and for missionaries. Throughout the War of the Spanish Succession, Enríquez's fleet was responsible for guarding the Antilles from incursions by the British and Dutch. Among the <b>places</b> <b>where</b> he <b>established</b> connections was the adjacent island of St. Thomas. Enríquez also dealt directly with the governor of Curaçao. At a time when letters of marque were being regularly issued in neighboring islands his actions converted San Juan into one of the most important ports in the Caribbean. Between 1702 and 1713 Enríquez owned a fleet of more than thirty vessels, losing at least a dozen and capturing more than twenty others. By the time that his career was over, he had reportedly commanded a fleet of over 300 privateer ships, of which approximately 150 were lost, employing close to 1,500 sailors.|$|R

50|$|In Augusta Triumphans, Andrew Moreton {{promotes}} {{the foundation of}} a university, an academy of music and a hospital for foundlings. He begins with calling for a university in London and stresses the reasons for making it non-residential. Firstly, by keep living under the same roof with their families of origin, students are not left to their own devices. and are less likely to fall into temptation. Young men who are sent to Cambridge or Oxford, on the other hand, waste their time drinking rather than learning themselves. Secondly, by daily returning to their family's quarter, they contribute to the cultural flourish of London society; they can spread the academic knowledge they acquire through conversation. Overall, the privileged beneficiary of this plan is the gentry whose residential areas are included in the list of <b>places</b> <b>where</b> Moreton advises <b>establishing</b> colleges: Westminster, St. James and Ormond Street. This social group is also invited to finance the whole project “by subscription”.|$|R
60|$|A huge waggon was procured, {{and in it}} a bed was laid, {{on which}} the unfortunate old man could sit, and with the two horses which they had brought with them from Durbellière, they started on their journey. They rested the first night at St. Laurent, the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> Agatha had <b>established</b> an hospital, and where Cathelineau had died. The Sisters of Mercy who had tended it were still there, but the wards were now deserted. Not that the wars afforded no {{occupants}} for them, but {{the approach of the}} republicans had frightened away even the maimed and sick. On the following morning Madame de Lescure declared that she could no longer endure the slow progress of the waggon, and consequently, Chapeau having with difficulty succeeded in procuring three horses, she started, accompanied by him and her sister-in-law, to make her way as best she could to her husband, while the Marquis and his daughter, with a guide, followed in the cumbrous waggon.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There is high {{relation}} between economic, {{social and cultural}} developments of cities and the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> they are <b>established.</b> Features such as physical conditions of geographical places, location, geomorphologic-geologic structure and mines, climate, vegetation and water sources are significantly influential upon development. Investments should be made by planning physical and human geographical features. In this research, Düzce has been evaluated in terms of these mentioned features. Particularly, post- 1999 earthquake process is evaluated in terms of urban development. It is concluded that physical and human geographical features are appropriate {{for the development of}} Düzce. However, it is revealed that some mistakes are made for selecting the places of settlements, industrial facilities and transportation facilities and these mistakes continue to be made. If structure with multi-floors is designed instead of structures with 3 floors, lesser place from plain will be occupied. As a result, it is suggested that settlement be made on the parts of northeast which has stronger ground as soon as possible instead of creating settlements in Düzce Plain, which is a productive agricultural area...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} part of the literature on regulatory economics is based on the US experience, where a well-established regulator faces a privately owned monopoly. It is sometimes forgotten that this model does not apply in many <b>places</b> <b>where</b> a newly <b>established</b> regulator faces a government owned, or a newly privatized, company. It definitely does not apply to the case of the Israeli communication industry where the government serves as regulator {{and at the same time}} is the owner of the wireline monopolist. The paper follows the regulatory experience of the Israeli communication industry over the last 20 years, analyzing its impact on consumers' welfare, the monopoly's profitability and its productivity. Though the Israeli institutions may look to a Western observer today as unique they were quite common in most of the developed economies prior to the wave of privatizations and deregulation in the 90 s. The lessons learned from the Israeli experience have, however, more than a historic interest, and may be relevant for the regulatory process in general. ...|$|R
50|$|PatternHunter {{utilizes}} numerous seeds (tiny search strings) with optimal intervals between them. Searches {{that employ}} seeds are extremely fast because they only determine homology in <b>places</b> <b>where</b> hits are <b>established.</b> The sensitivity of a search string is {{greatly influenced by}} the amount of space between adjacent strings. Large seeds are unable to find isolated homologies, whereas small ones generate numerous arbitrary hits that delay computation. PatternHunter strikes a delicate balance in this area by providing optimal spacing between search strings. It uses alternate k (k = 11) letters as seeds in contrast with BLAST, which utilizes successive k letters as seeds. The first stage in PatternHunter analysis entails a filtering phase where the program hunts for matches in k alternating points as denoted by the most advantageous pattern. The second stage is the alignment phase, which is identical to BLAST. In addition, it is possible to use more than one seed at a go with PatternHunter. This elevates the sensitivity of the tool without interfering with its speed.|$|R
