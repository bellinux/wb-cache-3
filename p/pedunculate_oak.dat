Shrubs include hawthorn, elder, holly, yew and rowan, with garden escapes like buddleia, Oregon grape, cotoneaster, privet. There are some saplings of <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak,</b> mostly around the edge, and holm oak. The field layer is mainly thick bramble, with ivy in denser shade. Ferns include male fern, broad buckler fern and the less common lady fern.|$|E
5|$|The forest areas {{suffer from}} strong {{demographic}} pressure and intensive agriculture. Some forests locally known as bouças are defined areas with maritime pines, oaks and eucalyptus plantations. Forests are still important in parishes {{surrounded by the}} Serra de Rates, whose flora is distinguished by the <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak</b> or the european holly. In the 18th century, the monks of Tibães planted pines, which characterized the civil parish of Estela. In the past the Atlantic forest predominated, with trees such as oaks, ash trees, hazels, strawberry trees, holm oak, and alders.|$|E
5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E

25|$|Oak forests, {{above all}} of <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur), {{are the most}} common in the Atlantic zone. They {{represent}} the typical forest floor formation of basal trees, extending to an altitude of some 600 metres. In higher regions, as one ascends the mountains, they yield to beech forests; {{at the bottom of the}} valleys they are replaced by ash trees and hazel tree groves. There are two main types of oak: the <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak</b> and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). The latter extends furthest into the interior and highest in altitude, but plays a secondary part; in general, when the climate begins to show its continental character, these oak forests are replaced by Pyrenean oak.|$|E
25|$|This mixed {{secondary}} woodland consists {{largely of}} sycamore and ash, with much <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak,</b> hawthorn and willow.

25|$|The {{woodland}} predominantly {{dates from}} the past 40 years, {{although there are some}} mature oaks and other trees. The main species are common alder (Alnus glutinosa), <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur), silver birch (Betula pendula) and willow (Salix), with common bramble (Rubus fruticosus) predominant in the undergrowth.|$|E
25|$|Predominant {{tree species}} are <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betuloides), silver birch (Betula pendula) and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Indicator species of long-uninterrupted woodland include service-tree (Sorbus torminalis) butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus) and drooping sedge (Carex pendula) A {{wide range of}} animals are found, including fallow deer (Dama dama), muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and European adder (Vipera berus).|$|E
25|$|The land {{on which}} these oaks stood is the most altered, as it is well suited to meadows and crops. Oaks are often {{accompanied}} by chestnut trees and birches. When these forests degrade, they are taken over by thorny plants, piornales, and in the final extreme heather and gorse. The <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak</b> would have been indigenous to {{a large part of}} the area currently occupied by pine forests and eucalyptus.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{trees in}} this ancient wood, on wet chalky clay, are <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oaks.</b> The ground flora is diverse, including locally uncommon {{species such as}} broad-leaved helleborine and sweet woodruff. There {{are a variety of}} mosses and ferns.|$|R
40|$|The taxonomic {{status of}} oak species on 70 plots {{selected}} from the 134 plots of the Harth Forest Ecological Observation Areawas identified using leaf morphological analysis. About 40 % of teh studied trees were <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus Robur), the other trees being mainly sessile oaks (Quercus petraea). A strong reduction of radial growth has been pointed out in recent years throught a dendroecological study, this decline being stronger for <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oaks.</b> Both a restricting pedoclimat(shallow and stony soils) and a hight leaf area index (old coppice with standards) are responsible dor severe and frequent droughts. Reduction of radial growth has been clearly related to water shortage as computed from a daily soil water balance model...|$|R
50|$|The SSSI is ancient {{semi-natural}} woodlands {{with many}} trees which are mature or over-mature, especially <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oaks.</b> There are also many ash {{trees and a}} scattering of silver birches and aspens.

25|$|Oak marble galls {{develop as}} a {{chemically}} induced distortion of leaf buds on <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) or their hybrid Quercus × rosacea, trees, {{caused by the}} parthenogenetic gall wasp (Andricus kollari, (Hartig, 1843)) which lays eggs within leaf buds using their ovipositor. The Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), introduced into Britain in 1735, {{is required for the}} completion of the life cycle of the gall. The oak marble gall is frequently confused with the oak apple gall, caused by another gall wasp, Biorhiza pallida. Oak marble galls are also known as the bullet gall, oak nut or Devonshire gall. Synonyms for the species are Cynips kollari, Andricus quercusgemmae, A. minor, A. indigenus and A. circulans.|$|E

500|$|To {{the north}} of the river bank {{northwest}} of Langport are the Aller and Beer Woods and Aller Hill biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Aller and Beer Woods is a Somerset Wildlife Trust reserve. It consists of large blocks of semi-natural ancient woodland along the west-facing slope of Aller Hill, overlooking King's Sedgemoor. The reserve is about [...] and the underlying geology of most of it is Lias limestone. Prior to the 20thcentury it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional coppice woodland, and it provides an outstanding example of ancient escarpment woodland. The woodland is a variant of the calcareous ash/wych elm stand-type, with <b>pedunculate</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur), and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of wych elm (Ulmus glabra). Ancient woodland indicators include small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), both of which are locally common. Plants of particular interest include bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and the very rare Red Data Book species purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum). Aller Hill contains three species of plant which are nationally rare and a further three which are of restricted distribution in Somerset. The central area contains a sward dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) in combination with yellow oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) and quaking-grass (Briza media). Salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) forms a major component of the sward with the two nationally rare species rough marsh-mallow (Althaea hirsuta) and nit-grass (Gastridium ventricosum), also present.|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{artificial}} regeneration {{of the forest}} on the calamity clearing areas LCR LS Jablunkov. The main objective of this bachelor thesis was to evaluate the growth development of 5 - 8 years aged plantations of Norway spruce, silver fir, European Beech, <b>pedunculated</b> <b>oak,</b> small-leaved lime tree and black alder, after planting at water-affected sites. The other objective was to compare the results with growth at nutrient sites. The following parameters were evaluated: Losses, length of the shoot, last increment, diameter of the root collar, length of the needles, size of the assimilation apparatus of leaves, color of the needles, damaging, warp of the stem, vertical deflection of the stem, deployment height of forked trees, stem form {{and shape of the}} crown. Evaluation of trees´ root system was also part of this work. Results showed, that black alder and Norway spruce grow the best at the water-affected sites. Planting of small-leaved lime tree and <b>pedunculated</b> <b>oak</b> didn´t approve, on the contrary. Another problem was the fact, that there were serious deformations of the root system at all tree species. The last issue were the high losses due to the poor quality of the planting stock, improper way of planting, and large number of the occurring game. The comparison between water-affected and nutrient sites shows, that the trees grow better and reach better parametres and smaller losses at the nutrient sites...|$|R
