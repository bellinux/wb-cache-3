25|$|The {{album is}} known for its graphic cover art. The cover depicts a bloody Barbie doll on a {{crucifix}} with nails hanging from a <b>plastic</b> <b>frame,</b> a buried person with a rosary protruding from the person's nose, and a knife impaling a Bible. This album cover appalled Limp Bizkit member Fred Durst so much that he attempted to remove Staind from a concert bill shortly before their performance. Durst thought that Staind were Theistic Satanists. Despite his attempts to stop the band from performing, Durst eventually changed his mind and allowed Staind to perform. After hearing Staind perform, Durst was so impressed that he signed them to Flip Records by February 1998. Durst produced Staind's second album Dysfunction (1999).|$|E

[...] The M's sturdy design, including its heavy steel backplate and strong <b>plastic</b> <b>frame,</b> has allowed even the most abused examples to survive for years.|$|E
2500|$|Around the 1980s to 1990s, Woman's Weekly {{magazine}} {{gave away}} a plastic on-needle knitting row counter of unusual design. It {{was presented as}} a self-assembly kit, in a small blue envelope with assembly instructions and a diagram on the back. According to the diagram, the gadget consists of (a) two blue front and back plates, pierced to show the numbers; (b) an inner white soft <b>plastic</b> <b>frame</b> to hold the number discs and to which are attached the two loops to bend back and thread on the needle; (c) the two number discs. [...] So the disks don't spin on an axis; they spin within circular spaces in the inner frame.|$|E

50|$|Ultrastars {{are also}} single-column pistols, which is {{unusual for a}} newly {{designed}} pistol these days, and helps make the gun slim and comfortable. They could have been designed even more slim, but instead there is significant thickness, with reinforcing webs, under each grip area. This gives the frame a very solid feel, something lacking in many other <b>plastic</b> <b>framed</b> pistols.|$|R

50|$|At {{one point}} {{it had a}} factory that {{produced}} <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> for glasses and raised chinchillas for their fur. Both endeavours were economic failures. The village also houses an archaeological museum (named after Ami Saull, father of Dror Shaul) displaying artifacts found in the surrounding area. Kissufim is currently undergoing a process of privatization in which homes will soon be owned by individuals rather than the collective.|$|R

Frames with large or small B measurements may be difficult to work with for Ptosis crutches.|$|R

50|$|Polaroid filters in {{disposable}} cardboard frames were typical {{during the}} 1950s, but more comfortable <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> with somewhat larger filters, considerably more expensive {{for the theater}} owner, were also in use.

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1980s, glasses with large, <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> were in fashion for both men and women. Small metal framed {{eyeglasses}} made a return to fashion in 1984 and 1985, and in the late 1980s, glasses with tortoise-shell coloring became popular. These were smaller and rounder than the type that was popular earlier in the decade. Throughout the 1980s, Ray-Ban Wayfarers were extremely popular, as worn by Tom Cruise in the 1983 movie Risky Business.|$|R

In 2012 some NBA players wear lensless glasses with thick <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> like horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic that draws comparisons to Steve Urkel.|$|R

50|$|Inline skating is a multi-disciplinary sport practiced widely internationally.

The system uses food-grade <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> which can be split using a special tool and the honey then flows into containers without the need to remove any frames.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variant of}} horn-rimmed glasses, browline glasses, {{became one of}} the {{defining}} eyeglass styles of the 1940s and 1950s. Invented in 1947, the style combined the aesthetics of horn-rimmed glasses with the stability of metal frames by fitting prominent plastic [...] "brows" [...] over the tops of metal frames, creating a distinctive look that was also sturdier than solid <b>plastic</b> <b>frames.</b> Browlines quickly became popular in post-World War II America, and composed half of all eyeglass sales throughout the 1950s. Ray-Ban introduced the Wayfarer sunglasses in 1952.|$|R
