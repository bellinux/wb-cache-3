The degree of optical coupling to the <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> as a function of height must therefore be determined individually for a given instrument and <b>probe</b> <b>tip.</b> In practice, this is usually determined during instrument calibration by scanning the probe perpendicular to the surface and monitoring the detector signal as a function of tip height.

Conductive AFM provides pico-amp resolution to identify and localize electrical failures such as shorts, opens, resistive contacts and leakage paths, enabling accurate probe positioning for current-voltage measurements. AFM based nanoprobers enable nanometer scale device defect localization and accurate transistor device characterization without the physical damage and electrical bias induced by high energy electron beam exposure.For SEM based nanoprobers, the ultra-high resolution of the microscopes that house the nanoprobing system allow the operator to navigate the <b>probe</b> <b>tips</b> with precise movement, allowing the user to see exactly where the tips will be landed, in real time. Existing nanoprobe needles or “probe tips” have a typical end-point radius ranging from 5 to 35 nm. The fine tips enable access to individual contacts nodes of modern IC transistors. Navigation of the <b>probe</b> <b>tips</b> in SEM based nanoprobers are typically controlled by precision piezoelectric manipulators.

The behavior of the <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> is then characterized utilizing bifurcation diagrams, phase portraits, power spectra, Poincaré maps, and maximum Lyapunov exponent plots. The results indicate that the <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> behavior is significantly dependent on the magnitude of the vibrational amplitude.

50|$|CFM {{has been}} {{primarily}} developed by Charles Lieber at Harvard University in 1994. The method was demonstrated using hydrophobicity where polar molecules (e.g. COOH) {{tend to have}} the strongest binding to each other, followed by nonpolar (e.g. CH3-CH3) bonding, and a combination being the weakest. <b>Probe</b> <b>tips</b> are functionalized and substrates patterned with these molecules. All combinations of functionalization were tested, both by tip contact and removal as well as spatial mapping of substrates patterned with both moieties and observing the complementarity in image contrast. Both of these methods are discussed below. The AFM instrument used {{is similar to the}} one in Figure 1.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{ablative}} {{nature of}} the patterning process, no development step (as in: selective removal of either the exposed or non-exposed regions of the resist as for e-beam and optical lithography) is needed, neither are optical proximity corrections. Maximum linear writing speeds of up to 20 mm/s have been shown with throughputs in the 104 - 105 μm2 h−1 range which is comparable to single-column, Gaussian-shaped e-beam using HSQ as resist. The resolution of t-SPL {{is determined by the}} probe tip shape and not limited by the diffraction limit or by the focal spot size of beam approaches, however, tip-sample interactions during the in-situ metrology process create tip wear, limiting the lifetime of the probes. In order to extend the lifetime of the <b>probe</b> <b>tips,</b> Ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) and Silicon-Carbide (SiC)-coated tips or wear-less floating contact imaging methods have been demonstrated. No electron damage or charging is caused to the patterned surfaces due to the absence of electron or ion beams.|$|E
50|$|The {{resolution}} of a PSTM instrument is {{highly dependent on}} probe tip geometry and diameter. Probes are typically fabricated via chemical etching of an optical fiber in a solution of HF and can be apertured or apertureless. Using chemical etching, fiber tips with a curvature radius as low as 20 nm have been made. In apertured tips, {{the sides of the}} sharpened fiber are sputter coated in a metal or other material. This helps to limit tunnelling of photons {{into the side of the}} probe in order to maintain more consistent and accurate evanescent field coupling. Due to the rigidity of the fiber probe, even brief contact with the surface will destroy the probe tip. Larger <b>probe</b> <b>tips</b> have a greater degree of coupling to the evanescent field and will therefore have greater collection efficiency due to a larger area of the optical fiber interacting with the field. The primary limitation of a large tip is the increased probability of collision with rougher surface features as well as photon tunnelling into the side of the probe. A narrower probe tip is necessary to resolve more abrupt surface features without collision, however the collection efficiency will be reduced. Figure 3 shows that fiber probe with metal coating. In metal coated fiber probes, the diameter and geometry of the aperture, or uncoated area at the tip of the probe, determines the collection efficiency. Wider cone angles result in larger aperture diameters and shorter probe lengths, while narrower cone angles result in smaller aperture diameters and longer probes. Double tapered probetips have been developed in which a long, narrow region of the probe tapers into a tip with a wider cone angle. This provides a wider aperture for greater collection efficiency while still maintaining a long narrow probe tip capable of resolving abrupt surface features with low risk of collision.|$|E

In this paper, we first summarize the experimental measurements of the deformation of graphene membranes due to interactions with the STM <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> and a back gate electrode. We then carry out systematic coarse grained, (CG), simulations to offer a mechanistic interpretation of STM tip-induced straining of the graphene drumhead.
