40|$|Thyroid {{stimulating}} hormone (TSH) secreting adenomas are {{the rarest}} type of pituitary adenomas (1 : 1000000 in the population; 0. 2 - 2. 8 % of adenomas). Plurihormonal thyrotropic adenomas are even rarer usually having cosecretion of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin. We report {{perhaps for the}} first time, TSH, GH, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and gonadotropins secreting pituitary macroadenoma diagnosed in a 40 year lady presenting with features of thyrotoxicosis for 5 months, amenorrhea for 3 months and newly diagnosed diabetes and hypertension for 2 months along with headache, nausea, and vomiting, who had acromegaloid habitus, grade-II goitre, increased uptake on Technitium- 99 pertechnate thyroid scan (4. 1 %; normal: 0. 24 - 3. 34 %), with increased T 3 (5. 98 pg/ ml; 1. 5 - 4. 1), increased T 4 (2. 34 ng/dl; 0. 9 - 1. 8), inappropriately high TSH (2. 32 Î¼IU/ml; 0. 4 - 4. 2), insulin like growth factor- 1 (711 ng/ ml; 109 - 264), non-suppressed post-glucose GH (15. 9 ng/ml; < 1 ng/ml), normal estradiol (52 pg/ml; 21 - 251), inappropriately high luteinizing hormone (53. 5 mIU/ml; 1. 1 - 11. 6), inappropriately high follicle stimulating hormone (59 mIU/ml; 3 - 14. 4), non-suppressed overnight dexamethasone cortisol (5. 8 mcg/dl; < 2), elevated ACTH (58 pg/ml 5 - 15), withdrawal bleed on <b>progestrogen</b> challenge, bitemporal hemianopia on automated perimetry and pituitary macroadenoma on MRI imaging of sella. Thyroid hormone resistance was ruled out by documenting normal sex hormone binding globulin and ferritin levels. Her clinical and biochemical phenotype was not suggestive of multiple hormone resistance seen in pseudohypoparathyroidism. This report intends to highlight the challenges in the diagnosis of plurihormonal thyrotropic adenoma...|$|E
