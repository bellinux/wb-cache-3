25|$|Dexlansoprazole is an (R)-(+)-enantiomer of lansoprazole, {{marketed as}} Dexilant. After oral {{appliance}} of the racemic lansoprazole, the circulating drug is 80% dexlansoprazole. Moreover, both enantiomers have similar {{effects on the}} proton pump. Consequently, the main advantage of Dexilant is not {{the fact that it}} is an enantiopure substance. The advantage is the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>formulation</b> of the drug, which is based on a dual release technology, with the first quick release producing a blood plasma peak concentration about one hour after application, and the second retarded release producing another peak about four hours later.|$|E
