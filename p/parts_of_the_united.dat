5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. {{national}} defenses, {{to support}} military transport, the National Highway System was expanded with Interstate highways, beginning in 1955, across many <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.

The wide-open spaces along the highways became a basis for numerous billboards showing advertisements.|$|E

5|$|In rare cases, a {{plant species}} {{may only be}} {{effectively}} pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered {{at least in part}} because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote bush in the arid <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States southwest, for example.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany and his regime's anti-Semitic {{policies}} significantly affected American pre-Code filmmaking. Although Hitler had become unpopular in many <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, Germany was still a voluminous importer of American films and the studios wanted to appease the German government. The ban on Jews and negative portrayals of Germany in the Fatherland even led to {{a significant reduction in}} work for Jews in Hollywood until after the end of World War II. As a result, only two social problem films released by independent film companies addressed the mania in Germany during the pre-Code era (Are We Civilized? and Hitler's Reign of Terror).|$|E
5|$|After {{devolution}} {{began to}} take place in other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected regional assemblies as a counterweight.

However, when the proposal was rejected by the northern England devolution referendums, 2004 in the North East, further referendums were cancelled. The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective Regional Development Agencies and a new system of Local authority leaders' boards.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of South West England, Portishead has a {{temperate}} climate generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10°C (50°F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but the modifying effect of the sea restricts the range to less than that in most other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom. January is the coldest month, with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south-west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of {{south-west}} England, the Blackdown Hills have a temperate climate that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The mean temperature is approximately 10°C (50°F) and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation, but because of the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom (UK). January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months, with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). December is normally the most cloudy month and June the sunniest. High pressure over the Azores often brings clear skies to south-west England, particularly in summer.|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, in a similar manner to pancakes in some <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

5|$|Earwigs are {{abundant}} {{and can be}} found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have few}} predators besides humans. They have been trapped since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand {{that they were}} extirpated from several <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Conservation and {{protection}} measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its historic limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices fell in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.|$|E
