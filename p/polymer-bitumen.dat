40|$|Owing to {{the high}} {{viscosity}} of the materials involved, mixing is often a critical step when processing polymer-modified bitumen (PMB), directly influencing the microstructure and the stability of final products. We provide experimental evidence suggesting that laminar chaotic advection may prove a valuable strategy for obtaining a homogeneous and finely interdispersed <b>polymer-bitumen</b> mixture in affordable time. As a case study, we investigate the mixing performance of a lab-scale flat-bottomed cylindrical vessel stirred by a radial impeller, either located symmetrically or eccentrically {{with respect to the}} vessel axis. The same geometries with a flat-disk impeller are also considered for comparison. The Mix-Norm is used in combination with image analysis as an objective measure of mixing performance. Results of mixing performance are independently validated by rheological tests. The experiments pinpoint kinematic chaos as the fundamental transport mechanism enhancing both the dispersion process and the microstructural quality of the resulting PMBs mixture.

40|$|AbstractLong-lasting asphalt {{pavements}} as {{a concept}} arose in the late XX century. According to assumptions {{it is possible to}} achieve durability even for 50 years. The key to achieve so long-lived is appropriate choice of an asphalt binder, except for the relevant properties of asphalt mixtures. A few years ago a new family of highly modified binders was created which was characterized by reversed-phase of <b>polymer-bitumen</b> mixture, and it is now a perfect example of a binder which fulfil the pavement longevity assumptions concept. Based on a new, special polymer which was developed by polymer industry, a new family of binders – Highly Modified Asphalts (HiMA), has been developed – ‘hard’ (EN 25 / 55 - 80, PG 94 - 22), ‘middle’ (EN 45 / 80 - 80, PG 82 - 28) and ‘soft’ (EN 65 / 105 - 80, PG 76 - 28). All binders were tested according to very wide test program. Results confirmed superior performance of tested binders and their very positive influence on asphalt. The paper presents tests results and analysis of polymer modified binders, HiMA type. The research has been done based on the European standards and according to the Superpave (PG grade system) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a formulation for a polymer modified bitumen emulsion road surfacing product called microsurfacing to a mid-scale prototype stage. A supplementary part of the development was to investigate the <b>polymer-bitumen</b> interactions and how they affected the products end properties using confocal microscopy. The formulation development consisted of three stages: technical design specifications, initial design, detailed design. The technical specification was developed to define the product performance in quantitative measures, and set the initial formulation parameters to work within. The initial design development screened three polymers, four methods of adding polymer to the emulsion and two grades of bitumen. Experimental design techniques were used to determine the best <b>polymer-bitumen</b> combination and emulsion process method. Further experimental investigations consisted of screening three emulsifiers and assessing the effect of aggregate cleanliness on the surfacing abrasion and curing rate. The detailed design used experimental factorial design {{to examine the effects of}} polymer concentration, emulsifier level, and emulsifier pH on the emulsion stability, microsurfacing wear resistance and cure rate. The emulsion residue was observed using confocal microscopy with fluorescence light and the microsurfacing mixture using both fluorescent and reflected light. The research showed that a emulsion using 100 penetration grade Safaniya bitumen with SBR latex polymer post added could provide microsurfacing abrasion resistance of less than 100 g/m 2; an improvement of 85 % on the minimum specification. The vertical permanent deformation was less than the 10 % and could not be attained without polymer addition. The use of aggregate with a high cleanliness and an alkyl amidoamine emulsifier resulted in surfacing cohesion development of 20 kg-cm within 90 minutes, which compares closely to the international specification. Unexpected results not reported before were that the emulsion residue from biphase modified emulsions had a softening point up to 10 °C higher than polymer modified hot bitumen with the same polymer concentration. The biphase emulsified binder residue also has a very different microstructure to hot modified bitumen and this structure has been proposed to help account for the improved resistance to high temperature and applied stress. Modifications to the formulation are to improve the emulsion settlement and should focus on the density difference between the bitumen and polymer latex. This research has shown that a microsurfacing reading product can be successfully formulated with New Zealand bitumen and aggregate sources to meet key specified performance requirements. By systematically investigating the effects of materials on the performance properties of the product, a formulation ready for a mid-scale experiment has been proposed...|$|E
40|$|The paving {{industry}} is currently demanding polymer modified bitumens (PMBs) with enhanced in-service performance and low enough viscosity at lower application temperatures. With this aim, this study {{focuses on the}} use of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers with low melting temperatures and explores the effect on the desired properties of the vinyl acetate (VA) content and Melt Flow Index (MFI). To that end, binders were prepared from EVA copolymers having varying VA contents from 7 to 33 wt. %, and MFI from 2 to 800. A comprehensive characterization based on viscous flow curves, dynamic shear temperature sweeps, standardized technological tests, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and optical microscopy analysis was conducted on EVA-binders with 5 and 7. 5 wt. % EVA. Low VA contents proved to endow bitumen with improved performance at medium-high in-service temperatures. Interestingly, binder viscosity at 135 ºC decreased with increasing the MFI, regardless the selected VA content. This means that tailored PMBs can be designed with both improved in-service performance at medium-high temperatures and reduced viscosity to facilitate <b>polymer-bitumen</b> mixing, mineral coating and asphalt mix laydown/compaction at lower temperatures.

40|$|A coupled diffusion–flow {{model by}} phase-field method is {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} {{with the goal of}} predicting the storage stability of polymer-modified bitumen (PMB). In this study, the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations were coupled with a previously developed phase-field model for PMB phase separation. The coupled model was implemented in a finite element software package with experimentally calibrated parameters and reported data in the literature. Effects of the parameters (bitumen density and dynamic viscosity) that affected the gravity-driven flow and phase separation in PMB were evaluated at 180 °C with the simulation results. The results indicate that the coupled diffusion–flow model can predict the storage stability (and instability) of PMBs. A good correlation between the simulation results and the previously reported experimental results (storage stability tube test) was observed. The different gravity-driven phase separation behaviors of PMBs might have resulted from the different composition of the equilibrium phases in the PMBs as well as the different densities and dynamic viscosities of the individual components (polymer and bitumen). A bigger <b>polymer–bitumen</b> density difference, a lower bitumen dynamic viscosity, or both caused a faster flow and separation in the PMB at storage temperature. The investigated variation of bitumen dynamic viscosity had a more significant influence than the investigated variation of bitumen density in this study, but this finding might depend on the specific values of the model parameters. With this study as a foundation, further experimental and numerical studies will be conducted to increase understanding of storage-stable PMB binders and to develop a more efficient test method for determining PMB storage stability.

40|$|AbstractThis paper forms part of {{research}} to solve two main problems in Ghana: firstly, the management of municipal solid waste (MSW), particularly with regards to used plastics which have overwhelmed major cities and towns; secondly, the formation of potholes onroads due to excessive traffic and axle weight. This study examines the effect of blending waste thermoplastic polymers, namely High density polyethylene (HDPE) and Polypropylene (PP) in Conventional AC- 20 graded bitumen, at various plastic compositions. The plastics were shredded and blended with the bitumen ‘in-situ’, with a shear mixer at a temperature range of 160 °C– 170 °C. Basic rheological parameters such as penetration, ring & ball softening point and viscosity tests were employed to determine the resulting changes from base bitumen. FTIR spectroscopy was also employed to study the chemical functionalities present in the bitumen composite. The properties of the unmodified bitumen {{were found to be}} enhanced with the changes recorded in the rheological properties of the polymer modified bitumen (PMB). It was observed that polypropylene polymer, showed profound effect on homogeneity and compatibility with slight linear increment in the viscosity, softening and penetration values as against relatively high changes for HDPE modified bitumen. The viscosity of unmodified bitumen was enhanced with the addition of the polymers and thixotropic effect was observed for both HDPE and PP at 60 °C. For all modified binders prepared, the penetration values decrease as <b>polymer-bitumen</b> ratio increases whiles softening temperature generally increases as polymer ratio increases. The most compatible and incompatible blends for HDPE were respectively observed at 2 % and 3 % polymer loading. The most enhanced, homogenous blend is achieved with PP at 3 % polymer loading. Three prominent peaks were identified in the spectrum of the unmodified bitumen, occurring at the 3000 – 2850 cm− 1 IR frequency range, typical of aliphatic CH symmetrical and asymmetrical stretches in alkanes. CH 2 and CH 3 bends were also observed at the characteristic frequencies of 1465 cm− 1 and 1375 cm− 1 respectively. A low intensity peak was observed within the 2400 cm− 1 – 2100 cm− 1 range, indicating the presence of a very weak −CC- or −CN group with an absorbance of precisely 0. 12. The use of waste commodity plastics in binder modification carries the advantage of a cheap and effective means of enhancing conventional bitumen binder performance characteristics and is an alternative way to utilise plastic waste...|$|E
