This is especially true for higher stabilisation levels with reductions to total <b>permissible</b> <b>emissions</b> of over 30 %. There is an “optimal pathway ” to each stabilisation level, defined as that allowing maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>emissions</b> to reach it. Here, we demonstrate how the climate-carbon cycle feedback influences such pathways. It is found that both the climate sensitivity (to increases in greenhouse gases) and the carbon cycle sensitivity to changing climate affect the strength of the climate-carbon cycle feedback, and in turn the <b>permissible</b> <b>emissions</b> to achieve stabilisation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Avoiding ‘dangerous climate change’ by {{stabilization}} of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations at a desired level requires reducing {{the rate of}} anthropogenic carbon emissions {{so that they are}} balanced by uptake of carbon by the natural terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycles. Previous calculations of profiles of emissions which lead to stabilized CO 2 levels have assumed no impact of climate change on this natural carbon uptake. However, future climate change effects on the land carbon cycle are predicted to reduce its ability to act as a sink for anthropogenic carbon emissions and so quantification of this feedback is required to determine future <b>permissible</b> <b>emissions.</b> Here, we assess the impact of the climate-carbon cycle feedback and attempt to quantify its uncertainty due to both within-model parameter uncertainty and between-model structural uncertainty. We assess the use of observational constraints to reduce uncertainty in the future <b>permissible</b> <b>emissions</b> for climate stabilization and find that all realistic carbon cycle feedbacks consistent with the observational record give <b>permissible</b> <b>emissions</b> significantly less than previously assumed. However, the observational record proves to be insufficient to tightly constrain carbon cycle processes or future feedback strength with implications for climate-carbon cycle model evaluation. ...|$|E

The objective of the study was to measure the distribution of mercury in the kiln system, to measure the hold up time of Hg, to measure the portion of emission through the chimneys, and to see the dependence of the injection sites on these parameters. The results showed that the amounts of mercury being emitted through the exhaust gases were largely dependent on where it was injected. The residence time of mercury in the system was nevertheless long, after 10 hours it was still increase in the count rate of the mercury absorbed.

40|$|Voyager {{measurements}} of the upper atmosphere of Uranus are analyzed and developed. The upper atmosphere of Uranus is predominantly H 2, with at most 10 percent He by volume, and the dominant constituent of the exosphere is H. The thermosphere is warm, with an asymptotic isothermal temperature of about 800 K. Atomic hydrogen at this temperature forms an extensive thermal corona and creates gas drag that severely limits the lifetime of small ring particles. The upper atmosphere emits copious amounts of UV radiation from pressures greater than 0. 01 microbar. The depth of this emission level imposes a powerful constraint on <b>permissible</b> <b>emission</b> mechanisms.

40|$|This book {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} the optimization techniques that are becoming essential to meet the increasing stringency and variety of requirements for automotive systems. It shows the reader how to move away from earlier  approaches, based on some degree of heuristics, to the use of  more and more common systematic methods. Even systematic methods can be developed and applied in a large number of forms so the text collects contributions from across the theory, methods and real-world automotive applications of optimization. Greater fuel economy, significant reductions in <b>permissible</b> <b>emissions,</b> new drivability requirements and the generally increasing complexity of automotive systems are among the criteria that the contributing authors set themselves to meet. In many cases multiple and often conflicting requirements give rise to multi-objective constrained optimization problems which are also considered. Some of these problems fall into the domain of the traditional multi-disciplinary optimization applied to system, sub-system or component design parameters and is performed based on system models; others require applications of optimization directly to experimental systems to determine either optimal calibration or the optimal control trajectory/control law. Optimization and Optimal Control in Automotive Systems reflects the state-of-the-art in and promotes a comprehensive approach to optimization in automotive systems by addressing its different facets, by discussing basic methods and showing practical approaches and specific applications of optimization to design and control problems for automotive systems. The book will be of interest both to academic researchers, either studying optimization or who have links with the automotive industry and to industrially-based engineers and automotive designers...|$|E

Research objectives: selection of a complex of the technical and organizational decisions that allow us to reach target (permissible) limits of dispersion of harmful emissions, thereby, having minimized the risks of damage to the environment and health of the population. Materials and methods: as primary materials, we used forms of the state statistical reporting “ 2 tp-air”, volumes of maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>emissions</b> of the enterprise-the model site, data about technical and organizational decisions to reduce emissions to the atmosphere. The main methods of the research: geoinformation modeling, functional zoning, the structural analysis. Results: we simulated dispersion of priority pollutant of the leading source of construction dust emissions in the region, and we classified, by the degree of ecological and hygienic risk, the territory of the model site - town of Mikhaylovka. The activities to reduce the range of dispersion of harmful emissions are selected in the form of modernization of technological processes, installation of dust filters, improvement of the ventilation system, carrying out other organizational and technical activities {{to prevent the spread of}} dust on the territory of the enterprise and beyond.

30|$|The {{following}} regional {{electricity and}} heat supply management problem is used to demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} developed ITSDP model. In this study system, a decision maker is responsible for {{electricity and heat}} to multiple users through several technologies on an annual cycle based on different pollutants <b>emission</b> <b>permissible</b> levels. Since different environmental restrictions, the decision maker would take expected electricity and heat demand into account to make fossil and renewable resources utilization optimal, manage electricity and heat generation and plan the equipment expansion. Mostly, increasing electricity and heat demand could lead to facility expansion, fuel exploitation and energy imports. However, it is unpractical to achieve sustainable development with the ever-increasing economic and environmental costs, unlimited facility expansion and energy exploitation (Liu et al. [2000]). Thus, the problem is how to incorporate different pollutants emission reduction control levels into regional electricity and heat planning. In this study system, planning period is on an annual cycle, with heating seasons and no heating seasons. Multiple energy resources/technologies need to be allocated to multiple end users. Traditional energy resources (e.g., coal, natural gas) with limited availabilities and renewable resources (e.g., wind) are utilized to meet the electricity and heat demand. More specifically, coal and natural gas are both used for electricity generation; wind is a supplement for electricity generation; the cogeneration system of electricity and heat is another energy-efficient way. The electricity and heat demands during one year are affected by many uncertainties, such as the growing population, energy-transformation rate, electricity and heat prices and changing weather; all of those factors would produce many complicated uncertainties (Li et al. Li et al. [2006 a], [b]; Liu [2007]; Li et al. [2008]). In addition, these uncertainties are intricate because of a series of imprecise information (e.g., social, economic, environmental, seasonal and geographic conditions, energy carrier characteristics). They could only be expressed as distribution information or intervals when most data can hardly be available determinately. Once these uncertainties are determined, system costs, efficiencies and capacities of each technology could be defined.|$|R
40|$|A thermodynamic, model-based, {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{relative}} performance of methanol and dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis systems using CO- and CO 2 -based syngas feeds.

The objective was to establish whether the energy requirements and CO 2 emissions associated with upstream conversion of CO 2 to CO were justified by increased productivity in the methanol/DME systems. In {{the first part of the}} study, the performance of four systems was evaluated and compared in terms of energy efficiency and CO 2 conversion: (1) methanol synthesis system, (2) direct DME synthesis system, (3) two-step DME synthesis system with an interposed syngas separation step between the methanol production reactor and methanol dehydration reactor and (4) two-step DME synthesis system with no separation step between the two reactors. Based on equilibrium yields at 250 °C and 50 bar, the direct DME synthesis system was found to exhibit the highest energy conversion efficiencies with both CO 2 - and CO-based syngas. Although this system demonstrated the lowest CO 2 emissions per methanol equivalent product with a CO-based feed, the benefits were offset by emissions associated with the upstream conversion of H 2 O and CO 2 to H 2 and CO, evaluated in the second part of the study. It was determined that CO 2 could be utilised directly in the direct DME synthesis route, whereas upstream conversion of CO 2 to CO was necessary to achieve effective yields in the methanol/two-step DME systems. CO-based syngas production via high temperature co-electrolysis of H 2 O and CO 2, or alternatively high temperature CO 2 electrolysis coupled with the water–gas shift process, was identified as the best technology based on energy consumption and CO 2 utilisation...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} {{that more than half of}} Australia’s {{greenhouse}} gas emissions are generated by the stationary energy sector, express environmental considerations have not featured in the recent sweeping reforms of the Australian Energy Market’s legislative and regulatory framework. On the contrary, current energy market laws, rules and regulations are devoid of any express environmental or sustainability provisions. This is in stark contrast to energy market developments in the European Union and the United Kingdom, where environmental considerations – greenhouse gas emissions and climate change – are fast becoming an integral part of energy market regulation. In 2008 for instance, the UK Parliament successfully enacted several pieces of complementary legislation directed towards supporting the UK’s long term energy and climate change strategy, including the Energy Act, the Planning Act and the Climate Change Act. Remarkably, the UK Government has committed to achieving an 80 per cent reduction on emissions, by 2050. Another interesting feature of the UK Climate Change Act 2008 is the introduction of carbon budgets, which set a legally binding cap on the total volume of <b>permissible</b> greenhouse gas <b>emissions</b> from the UK, measured over five year periods up to 2050. As noted by the UK Government, the ‘Climate Change Act creates a new approach to managing and responding to climate change in the UK, by setting ambitious, legally binding targets, taking powers to help meet those targets, strengthening the institutional framework, enhancing the UK’s ability to adapt to the impact of climate change, and establishing clear and regular accountability to the UK Parliament and to the devolved legislatures’. In light of the environmental deficiencies in the current NEM legislative and regulatory framework, questions arise as to the ways in which the Australian energy market legislative and regulatory framework could be reformed to take adequate account of environmental externalities such as climate change. How, for instance, should current energy market practices be modified to enable sustainability based decision making? What kinds of energy market framework amendments will be necessary to assist with moving the NEM market towards a lower carbon intensive future? Answering these kinds of questions involves, in part, giving consideration to existing measures and responses – direct and indirect – to the climate change challenges faced by energy markets and their participants. In particular, greater attention needs to be given to the possible role of key energy market regulators, namely the AEMC and the AER, in assisting Australian energy markets transition towards a low carbon future. In view of that, the extent to which sustainable regulation and decision making features in the NEM legislative and regulatory framework is the primary focus of the discussion in this chapter. In addition to considering possible amendments to the NEM legislative framework, especially the powers and functions of the two central key market regulators, the AEMC and AER, the role of Courts and Tribunals and the emergence of a body of climate change law is also considered. status: publishe...|$|R
