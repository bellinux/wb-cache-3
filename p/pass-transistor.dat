Because of the smaller cell, a higher integration density is possible. We demonstrate arrays up to a size of 16 × 16, processed on thin (25 μm) poly(ethylene naphthalate) substrates, using Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO) as the semiconductor and 200 nm-thick P(VDF-TrFE) as a ferroelectric gate dielectric. The memory transistors have remnant current modulations of ∼ 105 with a retention time of more than 12 days. They can be switched in less than 1 μs at operating voltages of 25 V. Switching speed is strongly decreased with decreasing voltage: at ∼ 10 V the transistors do not switch within 10 s. This difference in switching speed of more than 4 orders in magnitude when changing the electric field {{by a factor of}} only 2. 5 makes these memories robust towards disturb voltages, and forms the basis of integration of these transistors in passive matrix-addressable transistor arrays that contains only one (memory) transistor per cell.
