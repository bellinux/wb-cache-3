2500|$|In their differing ways, British singers Joss Stone (who, in 2011, named American singer Gwen Stefani as {{her style}} icon and was by then {{combining}} an independent professional {{career with the}} lifestyle of a [...] "Devon hippy") and (notwithstanding an early tendency {{to be associated with}} photographic spreads for [...] "lads' magazines") Rachel Stevens were both held up in the mid-noughties as exemplars of boho. So, a few years later, were Diana Vickers and another teenaged singer, Pixie Lott. Following an event in 2009, the Daily Mail commented about Vickers that looked like a cross between a stylish sixties icon and a rambler as she donned a stunning backless dress with a tramp's boots for an X Factor <b>party</b> <b>last</b> night. The 17-year-old, who spent much of her time on the ITV show running around barefoot, opted to cover up her feet with the charity shop footwear. The footwear drew attention away from the singer's stylish sixties style black and red dress which was split open at the back to reveal her bra." ...|$|E
