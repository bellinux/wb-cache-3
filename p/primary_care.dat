40|$|While {{the vision}} for {{restructuring}} {{health care in}} South Africa {{is based on a}} comprehensive <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> system, <b>care</b> at the <b>primary</b> level remains largely biomedical in orientation. Given this, I argue that whilst adding mental health <b>care</b> to <b>primary</b> level <b>care</b> may increase accessibility of psychiatric care, it will not, however, provide for comprehensive integrated <b>primary</b> mental health <b>care</b> as planned. This would require a paradigm shift towards a comprehensive discourse of care which includes mental health care. While efforts towards reorienting health care personnel in South Africa towards the <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> approach have been initiated, an examination of the <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> system in one sub-district in South Africa, reveals that the delivery of biomedical care is sustained by a number of factors within the <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> system as well as within the macro-context. A shift in the paradigm of care provided would therefore require the transformation of the system on many fronts. Of central importance would be the restructuring of the <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> system to be supportive of emotional labour, health promotion, empowerment of service users and of care which takes the subjectivity of the illness experience for the patient into account.

A broad range of professional quality improvement activities are undertaken in <b>primary</b> health <b>care.</b> However, there is limited evidence regarding patient safety and the effectiveness of patient safety solutions in <b>primary</b> health <b>care.</b> Much of the Australian research that exists focuses on incidents and errors in general practice or medicine safety risks in the community. Little is known of patient risks within the wider <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> sector.
