The highway heads east along the two-lane municipally maintained street to its intersection with MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue), which meets the western end of MD 193 (University Boulevard) two blocks to the north.

At St. Paul Street, the highway passes the Kensington station on MARC's Brunswick Line, which follows CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision. MD 192 parallels the railroad southeast out of the town of Kensington. The highway curves east away from the tracks and continues on Capitol View Avenue, which has a sharp turn to the south then a more gentle turn southeast at Stoneybrook Drive. Stoneybrook Drive leads south across the railroad to the Washington D.C. Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Beach Drive in Rock Creek Park.|$|E
25|$|Residents {{of a large}} {{swath of}} South-Eastern Montgomery County have Silver Spring mailing addresses. This area extends roughly from the Washington, D.C., Prince George's County, Maryland and Howard County, Maryland lines to the west, north and east, and Rock Creek Park and <b>Plyers</b> Mill Road {{to the west and}} north-west. This postal code even {{includes}} nearby towns; such as Four Corners, Wheaton, Glenmont, Forest Glen, Aspen Hill, Hillandale, White Oak, Colesville, Colesville Park, Cloverly, Calverton, Briggs Chaney, Greencastle, Northwood Park, Sunset Terrace, Fairland, and Kemp Mill. Surprisingly, even a tiny portion of the Langley Park and Adelphi neighborhoods have Silver Spring Zip Codes, though they are in Prince George's County. These boundaries make Silver Spring larger in area than any city in Maryland except for Baltimore. Some notable landmarks are the world headquarters of Discovery Communications, the AFI Silver Theatre, the NOAA headquarters, the world headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the headquarters of the US Food and Drug Administration, and the national headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.|$|E
25|$|MD 192 {{from the}} 7th Street Pike (now Georgia Avenue) west to Seminary Road was paved as a macadam road by 1923. The macadam road was {{extended}} to Kensington by 1927. MD 192's original western terminus was at St. Paul Avenue, which was the original course of MD 193. The highway was extended west along Metropolitan Avenue and <b>Plyers</b> Mill RoadMD 193 (now MD 185) was relocated around the center of Kensington after its grade separation of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was built in 1936by 1950. MD 192 was extended east from MD 97 along Forest Glen Road to Sligo Creek starting in 1934. That same year, a separate segment was built {{on a part of}} Forest Glen Road then named Fairway Avenue from US 29 west to Dallas Avenue. The Fairway Avenue segment was designated MD 597 by 1939, but became part of MD 192 when the portion of Forest Glen Road between Sligo Creek and Dallas Avenue was brought into the state highway system by 1946. This middle segment between Sligo Creek Parkway and Dallas Avenue was transferred to Montgomery County by 1961. The eastern segment of MD 192, whose eastern end had been shorn off by the construction of US 29's interchange with I-495, was removed from the state highway system in 1977. The final eastern segment of MD 192 from MD 97 to Sligo Creek Parkway was transferred to county maintenance between 1989 and 1991.|$|E

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 70 : 47 in length. Telemann???s D Major Concerto, composed between 1712 and 1721, {{is a good}} example of the baroque horn concerto style. The three movement form includes a lively opening movement of signaling style followed by the high, floating, melodic line of the second movement. The third movement is a Minuet (without Trio) in two parts. In performance, authentic baroque ornamentation is used at the <b>plyers</b> discretion giving the piece spontaneity. Thea Musgrave???s Music for horn and piano (1967) is an example of contemporary horn writing. Both rhythmic and arrhythmic sections are included along with the various tonal effects of natural, stopped and echo tones. Although, it may be less understandable to some in the audience, its positioning as the second work performed gives it a good listening since audience attention tends to be at its peak during second pieces on recitals. Alec Wilder???s Suite for Horn and Piano is first and foremost a happy, fun piece. Its practicality for use on a recital of serious music is self-evident. It is musically rewarding work requiring a virtuoso technique of the performer. Wilder???s musical ideas are drawn from his own experience in popular idioms and helps make the piece an appropriate finish for the first half of the recital. The Brahms Horn Trop Op. 40 is a favorite of romantic period horn compositions. The Trio???s individual musical personality combines rich melody and harmonic enterprise with the blended colors possible from horn, violin, and piano. The adoption of multi-subject schemes permitted expansion of traditional sonata style. It is the logical closing piece on this recital. The varied repertoire is the major strong point of this recital program. The recital???s emphasis on a wide range of technique, versatility, and musical styles is not only good from a programming standpoint but also sheds favorable light on the accomplishments of the performer...|$|E
