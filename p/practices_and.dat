40|$|This {{article focuses}} on my own <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> {{experience}} of teaching in the performing arts to examine how reflection {{could be used as}} a tool for facilitating learning in a way that does not construct <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> theory as distinct or opposing binaries. In it I argue that the superficial nature of the boundary between <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> theory often traps creative and performing arts students in a mindset that militates against critical and analytic writing as they struggle to make connections between their studio <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> wider theoretical contexts. Consequently, the article draws primarily on Maziar Raein's argument for a 'cohesive framework for knowledge' that recognizes the inter-relatedness of theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in knowledge formation to argue that <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> theory operate along a continuum of knowledge. The article equally considers Paul Kleiman's argument about the centrality of the creative process in bridging the perceived gap between <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> theory within the creative and performing arts. Finally, I discuss the use of 'reflective breaks' in my teaching on the performing arts programme at Swansea Metropolitan University as a way of deconstructing the artificial boundaries between <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> theory...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{understanding}} of the role of reflective processes and the importance of reflective practice in social work education, <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> research has developed significantly. The context of these developments has been one of technical-rational responses to a growing recognition of complexity and uncertainty in professional and academic arenas and an associated marginalising of the 'self' in learning <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> Drawing from my experiences as a social work practitioner, educator and researcher this paper seeks to explore contemporary understandings and applications of reflective <b>practice,</b> <b>and</b> in particular the role of anxiety, in professional practice. Exploration in the inter-connected settings of education, <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> research highlights the inextricable and essential partnerships between the academy <b>and</b> <b>practice,</b> theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> research which characterise professional social work education. The paper concludes by acknowledging the centrality of the self in the process of lifelong learning and the potentially enriching and dynamic relationships between the academy, the <b>practice</b> setting <b>and</b> research.
