5000|$|The court {{decided to}} value Garlock’s {{responsibility}} by “divorcing” it from Garlock’s long history settling cases and the substantial jury verdicts against it. The company “contended {{that it was}} manipulated into overpaying in settlements with <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>lawyers</b> who withheld evidence that their clients were exposed to other manufacturers’ products.” [...] The judge then ordered discovery on 15 cases, held a hearing and concluded that attorneys for the asbestos victims “withheld evidence that their clients were exposed to asbestos products from other companies.” ...|$|E
30|$|Recall {{that the}} {{construction}} of the network requires the notion of a lawyer wining or losing. We take the following approach: In proceedings where the lawsuit was accepted or partially accepted, we say that the <b>plaintiff’s</b> <b>lawyers</b> won over the defendant’s lawyers, giving rise to a directed (and weighted) edge from every defendant’s <b>lawyer</b> to every <b>plaintiff’s</b> <b>lawyer</b> (complete bipartite graph). In a dismissed case, we consider what the <b>plaintiff’s</b> <b>lawyers</b> lost to the defendant’s lawyers, giving rise to a directed (and weighted) edge from every <b>plaintiff’s</b> <b>lawyer</b> to every defendant’s lawyer.|$|R

40|$|We study a {{model of}} civil dispute with {{delegation}} in which a <b>plaintiff's</b> <b>lawyer</b> works on a contingent-fee basis but a defendant's lawyer on an hourly fee basis. We first derive the condition under which delegation to the lawyers brings both litigants more payoffs compared with the case of no delegation. We then show that under this profitable delegation condition, the contingent-fee fraction for the <b>plaintiff's</b> <b>lawyer</b> is about one-third. Next, allowing the plaintiff {{to choose between the}} two fees, we show that under the profitable delegation condition, the plaintiff chooses the contingent fee, given that the defendant adopts the hourly fee.

5000|$|In June 1820 {{the case}} was appealed to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Chief Justice Isaac Blackford was the {{son-in-law}} of McDonald, one of the <b>plaintiff's</b> <b>lawyers.</b> The <b>plaintiff's</b> <b>lawyers</b> argued that the constitution superseded all other laws, including one written prior to the constitution's adoption, and that the Northwest Ordinance ceased to apply to Indiana after statehood. The defense argued that the Northwest Ordinance, a federal law, superseded the state constitution {{and that it could}} have been repealed only by the federal government but was not repealed, it was still in effect regardless of Indiana's status in the Union. The court decided in favor of Polly and in the July decision court stated that...the framers of our constitution intended a total and entire prohibition of slavery in this state. ...it follows, as an irresistible conclusion, that, under our present form of government, that slavery can have no existence in the State of Indiana, and, of course, that the claim of the said Lasselle cannot be supported.|$|R
