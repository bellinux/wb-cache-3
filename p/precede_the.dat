5|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order}} to avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an üünijg preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> predicate.|$|E
5|$|Tamil is a {{consistently}} head-final language. The verb {{comes at}} the end of the clause, with a typical word order of subject–object–verb (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> verb of the matrix clause.|$|E
5|$|Although Maryland {{remained}} in the Union, secessionist sentiment {{and support for the}} Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of sabotage to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause derailment and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.|$|E

5|$|Complying with Eighth Army's {{order for}} a spoiling attack against the North Koreans {{northwest}} of Taegu, Gay ordered the 7th Cavalry to attack on September 2 and seize Hill 518. Situated north of the lateral Waegwan-Tabu–dong road, and about midway between the two towns, it was a critical terrain feature dominating the road between the two places. After securing Hill 518, the 7th Cavalry attack was to continue on to Hill 314. Air strikes and artillery preparations were to <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> infantry attack.|$|E
5|$|Locating prey: The wolves {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E
5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> noun they modify.|$|E

5|$|Little {{can be said}} of the {{evolutionary}} history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E
5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} on certain individual regions where severe weather is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive {{for the development of}} severe thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that severe weather will occur, and usually <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> onset of severe weather by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E
5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> appearance of any lesion by some hours; and pain, {{which is often}} {{out of proportion to}} the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol {{is not well}} understood. In animals, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surge {{has been shown to}} <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion. This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: estrogen receptor alpha, which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and estrogen receptor beta, which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship. However, in humans {{it has been shown that}} high levels of estradiol can provoke abrupt increases in LH, even when GnRH levels and pulse frequencies are held constant, suggesting that estrogen acts directly on the pituitary to provoke the LH surge.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, {{and may be}} preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a shear line, though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and sea breeze boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E
5|$|After being {{admitted}} to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion. While the sport's lack of a following {{in much of the}} world was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League now does during the Winter Olympic Games. Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> major league season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.|$|E
