5|$|During production, Hergé kept {{abreast of}} the {{turbulent}} <b>political</b> <b>developments</b> in Tibet. In March 1959, Tibet's foremost political and spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled the region into self-imposed exile in India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising. In May 2001, when Tintin in Tibet was published in China, state authorities renamed it Tintin in Chinese Tibet. When Casterman and the Hergé Foundation protested, the authorities restored the book's original title.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, no {{relevant}} information {{is found in}} the contemporary Greek Linear B records.

Catalan political gatherings were banned during the 1923–1930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, travel was difficult during the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, and political gatherings were again banned during (and for some time after) the Franco dictatorship of 1939–1975.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{speculated that the}} {{emergence}} of modern {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) will boost <b>political</b> <b>development</b> in the developing world. This expectation anchors on solid foundation since, presumably, the ICT revolution would radically alter access to information, dislodge entrenched social cleavages, and unleash new patterns of citizen consciousness and civic engagement by hitherto marginalized mass publics, and orchestrate new and decisive political equilibriums. In this research, we provide an empirical assessment of the impact of ICTs on <b>political</b> <b>development</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis suggests that speculation about the potential for ICTS to enhance <b>political</b> <b>development</b> in the sub-Sahara is not unrealistic. The levels of phone, computer, and internet diffusion are associated with <b>political</b> <b>development,</b> although only the effect of the phone remains once other variables are specified. The phone is the most robust of all individual factors explaining variations in <b>political</b> <b>development.</b> However, t he effect of ICTs on <b>political</b> <b>development</b> can neither be certified as revolutionary, nor can they be codified as panacea...|$|R

50|$|Huntington {{identifies}} two {{characteristics of}} <b>political</b> <b>development.</b> The {{first is that}} development is synonymous with modernization, thus <b>political</b> <b>development</b> {{can be defined as}} political modernization. The second is that there are many criteria to measure <b>political</b> <b>development</b> because modernization and development are such broad topics, covering many areas. There are four generally agreed upon criteria to determine <b>political</b> <b>development.</b> The first is rationalization, which involves the movement from particularism to universalism, or, from a political standpoint, a focus on functional differentiation and achievement criteria. The second criteria is nationalism, and national integration. This emphasizes nation-states and nation-building as a key aspect of <b>political</b> <b>development.</b> The third criteria is a focus on democratization, which is in essence a focus on competition and equalization of power. The final criteria is mobilization, which is a focus on political participation. The greater the development, the greater the modernization, the greater the mobilization, and therefore the greater the political participation. Ultimately, <b>political</b> <b>development</b> can be defined as an increase in national political unity and an increase in political participation.|$|R
5|$|During much of Anne’s reign, the Duke of Marlborough was abroad {{fighting}} the War of the Spanish Succession, while Sarah remained in England. Despite {{being the most}} powerful woman in England besides the Queen, she appeared at court only rarely, preferring to oversee the construction of her new estate, Woodstock Manor (the site of the later Blenheim Palace), a gift from Queen Anne after the duke's victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Nevertheless, Anne sent her news of <b>political</b> <b>developments</b> in letters and consulted Sarah's advice in most matters.|$|E
5|$|However, Brazil's {{champion}} {{in the fight for}} the abolition of slavery was dying. While in Europe, the first symptoms of mouth cancer appeared. Rio Branco was a heavy smoker, and he would daily smoke up to thirty Cuban cigars specially imported for him from Havana. Until July 1880, he was still making appearances in Parliament to deliver speeches, but after that date he no longer attended. Rio Branco still kept a close watch on <b>political</b> <b>developments,</b> however, and continued to appear at meetings of the Council of State. He had already retired from teaching in 1877.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 Pracheachon's spokesperson, Non Suon, criticized Sihanouk {{for failing}} to tackle inflation, unemployment, and {{corruption}} in the country. Non Suon's criticisms gave Sihanouk the impetus to arrest Pracheachon leaders, and according to him, he had discovered plans by their party to monitor local <b>political</b> <b>developments</b> on behalf of foreign powers. In May 1962 Tou Samouth, Pracheachon's secretary-general, disappeared, and its ideological ally, the Communist Party of Kampuchea, suspected that Samouth had been secretly captured and killed by police. However, Sihanouk allowed Sangkum's left-wing politicians to run again in the 1962 general elections, which they all won. He even appointed two left-wing politicians, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, as secretaries for planning and commerce, respectively, after the election.|$|E

40|$|This article reviews {{four decades}} of {{scholarship}} on <b>political</b> <b>development.</b> It contends that the theoretical ambitions of the early <b>political</b> <b>development</b> literature to frame the comparative inquiry of politics and political change in less developed countries were undermined by intellec-tual challenges to the paradigms of modernization and structural functionalism and that the liter-ature’s teleological dimension was contradicted by real-world events. Nonetheless, in subse-quent decades, the field made great advances {{in the study of}} political institutions, democratic stability and breakdown, state structures, civil society, and the uneven character of <b>political</b> <b>development</b> itself. The article argues that amid manifold evidence of plural forms of <b>political</b> <b>development</b> and decay at the century’s end, the field should avoid relapses into neomodernization theory and instead focus on such issues as state reform, democratic governance, political repre-sentation and accountability, and the organization of civil societies. Such an expansive and fluid research agenda will enable the field of <b>political</b> <b>development</b> to generate important theoretical advances in comparative politics...|$|R

5|$|Since {{incorporation}} into Greece {{was not an}} option after the recent <b>political</b> <b>developments,</b> Zografos proposed three main solutions to the representatives of the International Commission: complete autonomy under the sovereignty of the Albanian prince, administrative and canton type autonomy, and direct administration and control by the European Powers. The Northern Epirote side also demanded the extension of the area in which the Greek population would enjoy education in its native language to include the regions around Vlorë and Durrës (in central Albania, to the north of Northern Epirus), the appointment of Greek Orthodox higher officials in the main towns of Northern Epirus and the exemption from military service of the local population, even in time of war.|$|E
5|$|The Ordinances {{were never}} again reissued, and {{therefore}} hold no permanent {{position in the}} legal history of England {{in the way that}} Magna Carta, for instance, does. The criticism has been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the ascendancy of the commons. Yet the document, and the movement behind it, reflected new <b>political</b> <b>developments</b> in its emphasis on how assent was to be obtained by the barons in parliament. It {{was only a matter of}} time before it was generally acknowledged that the Commons were an integral part of that institution.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} {{of nuclear weapons}} arose from scientific and <b>political</b> <b>developments</b> of the 1930s. The decade saw many new discoveries {{about the nature of}} atoms, including the existence of nuclear fission. The concurrent rise of fascist governments in Europe led to a fear of a German nuclear weapon project, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. When their calculations showed that nuclear weapons were theoretically feasible, the British and United States governments supported an all-out effort to build them.|$|E

5|$|During Romania's {{restrictive}} communist period, {{which lasted}} between 1948 and 1989, the critical evaluation of Ion Creangă's work went through several periods, complementing <b>political</b> <b>developments.</b> Throughout {{the first part}} of this interval, when socialist realism was politically imposed on Romanian letters, Creangă was spared the posthumous censorship which affected several other classical writers (see Censorship in Communist Romania). His work was officially praised for its aesthetic qualities, but its association with the condemned Junimea was omitted from critical commentary, and readers were instead referred to Creangă as a realist critical of bourgeois society. In 1948, the new authorities granted him posthumous membership in the Romanian Academy. The following year, at the height of Soviet occupation, official critic Barbu Lăzăreanu controversially described Creangă as a writer indebted to Russian folklore.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{was also}} a major {{contributor}} to the political tensions in Biafra. Considering Nigeria a potential danger to French-influenced African states, Foccart sent Houphouët-Boigny and Lieutenant-Colonel Raymond Bichelot on a mission in 1963 to monitor <b>political</b> <b>developments</b> in the country. The opportunity to weaken the former British colony presented itself in May 1967, when Biafra, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, undertook to secede from Nigeria. French-aligned African countries supported the secessionists who, provided with mercenaries and weapons by Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré, began a civil war. By the end of the 1960s, French-supported nations suddenly and openly distanced themselves from France and Côte d'Ivoire's position on the civil war. Isolated on the international scene, both countries decided to suspend their assistance to Ojukwu, who eventually went into exile in Côte d'Ivoire.|$|E
5|$|In early 1859, at {{the close}} of a {{turbulent}} period, Wallachia and Moldavia entered a personal union, later formalized as the Romanian United Principalities, under Moldavian-born Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza (himself a former revolutionary). Having been allowed to return from exile after the Treaty of Paris, most of the surviving revolutionaries played a major part in the <b>political</b> <b>developments,</b> and organized themselves as Partida Națională, which promoted Cuza during simultaneous elections for the ad hoc Divans. The role of Paris-based Wallachian émigrés in promoting sympathy for common Romanian goals was decisive. Partida succeeded in becoming the major factor in Romanian political life, before forming the basis of the liberal current. With Cuza's rule, the pace of Westernization increased, and, during the 1860s, a moderate land reform was carried out, monastery estates were secularized, while corvées and boyar ranks were outlawed.|$|E
50|$|Political decay is a {{political}} theory, originally described by Samuel P. Huntington, which describes how chaos and disorder can arise from social modernization increasing more rapidly than political and institutional modernization. Huntington provides different definitions for <b>political</b> <b>development</b> and describes the form of political decay according to the various definitions. Huntington focuses primarily on <b>political</b> <b>development</b> as modernization and institutionalization. Although {{he points to the}} different definitions of <b>political</b> <b>development</b> as being arbitrary ways to understanding the rise of political systems and the relationship between the political systems in different nations.|$|R

5|$|Rather than {{treating}} Prokofiev as {{a fugitive}} or exile, the Moscow government chose to consider {{him as a}} general ambassador for Soviet culture, and the composer returned the compliment by registering in France as {{a citizen of the}} Soviet Union, the new state formed on 20 December 1922 by Russia and the states of the former Russian Empire. Prokofiev expressed support for the <b>political</b> <b>developments</b> in what he still considered his homeland, and was keen to resume contacts there. He was accorded VIP status when he paid his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1927, for a recital tour. Further trips followed, and in 1930 Prokofiev took a flat in Moscow, although Paris remained his principal home. During this period of rapprochement he consciously sought to simplify his musical language into a form that he believed would be consistent with the official Soviet concept of art.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 general {{elections}} {{had left the}} Liberals as a minority government dependent upon the support of Irish Nationalists. As desired by the Nationalists, Asquith introduced legislation that would give Ireland Home Rule, but the Conservatives and Unionists opposed it. As tempers rose over the Home Rule Bill, which {{would never have been}} possible without the Parliament Act, relations between the elderly Knollys and the Conservatives became poor, and he was pushed into retirement. Desperate to avoid the prospect of civil war in Ireland between Unionists and Nationalists, George called a meeting of all parties at Buckingham Palace in July 1914 in an attempt to negotiate a settlement. After four days the conference ended without an agreement. <b>Political</b> <b>developments</b> in Britain and Ireland were overtaken by events in Europe, and the issue of Irish Home Rule was shelved.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{was divided}} into provinces such as Banavasi-12000, Nolambavadi-32000, Gangavadi-96000, each name {{including}} the number of villages under its jurisdiction. The large provinces were divided into smaller provinces containing a lesser number of villages, as in Belavola-300. The big provinces were called Mandala and under them were Nadu further divided into Kampanas (groups of villages) and finally a Bada (village). A Mandala was under {{a member of the}} royal family, a trusted feudatory or a senior official. Tailapa II himself was in charge of Tardavadi province during the Rashtrakuta rule. Chiefs of Mandalas were transferable based on <b>political</b> <b>developments.</b> For example, an official named Bammanayya administered Banavasi-12000 under King Someshvara III but was later transferred to Halasige-12000. Women from the royal family also administered Nadus and Kampanas. Army commanders were titled Mahamandaleshwaras and those who headed a Nadu were entitled Nadugouvnda.|$|E
