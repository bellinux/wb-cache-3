5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> that send electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these substations, six 735kV <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> traverse the vast expanses of taiga and boreal forest in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The terrain that the <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> cross {{is for the}} most part not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines sometimes do run in a pair. Two intermediate 735kV <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> one in the north and one in the south, connect all six <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> along their path to southern Quebec.|$|E
5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Broadband <b>power</b> <b>line</b> (BPL) data {{transmission}} deals with transfer of data via the existing <b>power</b> <b>line</b> systems {{and is a}} fast emerging technology. The main advantage of BPL {{is being able to}} use the existing <b>power</b> <b>line</b> infrastructure, thereby reducing the cost. However, <b>power</b> <b>line</b> systems were not designed for high-speed {{data transmission}} as they consist of various branches and <b>power</b> <b>line</b> elements such as bridges, taps, transformers and capacitor banks. Therefore, the <b>power</b> <b>line</b> transmission medium not only introduces noise but is also adverse to high-speed data transfer in terms of the channel bandwidth. In this paper a <b>power</b> <b>line</b> channel has been modelled using Matlab and the effects of variations in the direct length, branch length and branch load on the channel frequency response are investigated. Simulations indicate suitability of multi-carrier transmission over the <b>power</b> <b>line</b> channels...|$|R

One tree fell onto a car, killing a person, and there were three deaths overall in the state, along with $3million in damage. There was also a death in neighboring Vermont. Carol produced winds of up to 80mph (130km/h) in Augusta, Maine. Throughout the state, the winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which damaged houses, wrecked cars, destroyed one building, or fell onto <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Fallen trees blocked highways, and one person was injured by a falling tree limb. Downed <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> left several counties without power or telephone services.

A physically based <b>power</b> <b>line</b> communication channel model is derived.
