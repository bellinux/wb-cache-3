40|$|Masonry infills panels placed among framed {{structures}} meshes have a relevant influence in presence seismic actions {{in terms of}} strength stiffness and global displacement capacity. In the case of RC structures, the modifications of internal forces due to infill-frame interaction may be not compatible with surrounding frame members strength especially considering additional shear forces arising at the ends of beams and columns in contact with the panel under lateral actions. Such effects may be in many cases the cause of unexpected brittle collapse mechanisms which compromise the safety of the entire structure. In this paper by means of a double (micromodeling and macromodeling) procedure regarding RC meshes infilled with hollow brick masonry, a parametric study is provided defining a connection between local shear forces in critical frame regions and axial force on diagonal <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> <b>strut.</b> Proposed strategy allows to predict effective local shear forces using the simple macromodeling approach to reproduce the effect of masonry infills in models...|$|E
40|$|The recent large {{interest}} in nonlinear seismic analysis methods, static and dynamic, has required proper strategies of modeling based on reliable, {{and at the}} same time easy to use, constitutive laws for the structural elements. Regarding the behavior of framed structures, special attention has to be devoted to infills because of the key role they play in modifying overall stiffness, strength and ductility under seismic excitation. Pointing out the attention on this topic the paper discusses a criteria for modeling the structural behavior of infills based on a macromodeling approach, that is to say on the substitution of infills with diagonal <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> <b>struts.</b> Is here shown how multilinear plastic link elements governed by a hysteretic Pivot model, available in different FEM codes, can be appropriately used to model the equivalent struts to perform linear or nonlinear analyses. In order to enlarge experimental knowledge on cyclic behavior of infilled frames structures and as reference for developing the above mentioned modeling strategy, an experimental campaign on single-storey, single-bay, fully infilled frames with different kinds of masonry and subjected to lateral cyclical loads, was carried out, and some others available in the literature are referred to. Validation of Pivot modeling approach was carried out comparing experimental results and computer simulations of the experimental tests. In the paper hysteresis parameters values calibrating Pivot law are also given for involved masonry infills typologies and some proposals for correlation between strength and stiffness of infilled frames and of masonry infills are provided as a tool for the quick calibration of the Pivot model in practical applications...|$|R
40|$|Infill masonry {{walls in}} framed {{structures}} {{make a significant}} contribution to the response under seismic actions. With special regard to reinforced concrete (RC) structures, it is known that internal forces modifications caused by the frame-infill interaction may be not supported by the surrounding frame because of the additional shear forces arising at the ends of beams and columns. Such additional forces may lead to the activation of brittle collapse mechanisms and hence their prediction is basic in capacity assessment, especially for structures that disregard the details for seismic zones. In this paper a parametric study is carried out addressed to the prediction of the shear forces mentioned before. The results of this study {{can be used as a}} support when the simplified model is adopted consisting in the substitution of infill with an equivalent <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> concentric <b>strut,</b> because in this case the structural analysis fails in the prediction of the shear forces in question. Through the paper, in which existing RC infilled frames designed only for vertical loads are discussed, analytical laws, depending on the level of the axial force arising in a concentric strut equivalent to infill, are proposed, the above analytical law allowing to correct the local shear forces in the frame critical sections, which are not predictable in the case of substitution of infill with an equivalent concentric strut...|$|R

40|$|The {{non-linear}} programming algorithms for {{the minimum}} weight design of structural frames {{are presented in}} this thesis. The first, which is applied to rigidly <b>jointed</b> and <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> plane frames subject to deflexion constraints, consists of a search in a feasible design space. Successive trial designs are developed so that the feasibility and the optimality of the designs are improved simultaneously. It is found that this method is restricted lo the design of structures with few unknown variables. The second non-linear programming algorithm is presented. in a general form. This consists of two types of search, one improving feasibility and the other optimality. The method speeds up the 'feasible direction' approach by obtaining a constant weight direction vector that is influenced by dominating constraints. For <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> plane and space frames this method is used to obtain a 'minimum weight' design which satisfies restrictions on stresses and deflexions. The matrix force method enables the design requirements to be expressed in a general form and the design problem is automatically formulated within the computer. Examples are given to explain the method and the design criteria are extended to include member buckling. Fundamental theorems are proposed and proved to confirm that structures are inter-related. These theorems are applicable to linear elastic structures and facilitate the prediction of the behaviour of one structure {{from the results of}} analysing another, more general, or related structure. It becomes possible to evaluate the significance of each member in the behaviour of a structure and the problem of minimum weight design is extended to include shape. A method is proposed to design structures of optimum shape with stress and deflexion limitations. Finally a detailed investigation is carried out into the design of structures to study the factors that influence their shape...|$|R

For this purpose, slider-crank mechanisms which {{are widely used}} in many fields of industry are chosen. Flexible coupler of the mechanism is considered as a <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> beam under the effect of elastic oscillations in transverse direction. Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is considered to obtain dynamic responses of the elastic link. Lumped parameters approach is used to model the flexible links. Since, the assumption of small deflections is made, linear and continuous form of the elastic curve equation is written for each lumped masses on the beam to derive the equations of motion of the system. Derived set of nonlinear partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations by applying finite difference method. Finally, a symbolic mathematical program which gives the dynamic responses {{of the system is}} developed to solve the equations of motion. The results obtained from the developed program are tested and verified by the results available in the literature.

40|$|We analyse {{the stress}} state of built – up timber columns by the {{standard}} {{for the design of}} timber structures SIST EN 1995 - 1 - 1. Columns are <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> at both ends. The cross - sections in a centrically compressed columns should be symmetrical so that the compressive stress over the entire section does not change. The computer program, created with the tool Microsoft Excel, allows the selection of the “boxed” and "I" section, which are the most common and effective for dimensioning built - up columns. The load capacity of a column mainly depends on its relative slenderness and rigidity of the connection between wooden elements, provided by the mechanical fasteners. Properties of the built -up column are captured by the effective bending stiffness and the slip modulus of mechanical fasteners. Shear connectors are wood - wood type and have one shear plane in which, when load is applied, the shear stress occurs. This shear stress is taken by the nails through their shear resistance. Fasteners are selected based on the type of wood, the cross - section dimensions and size of the load that fasteners have to bear. Based on the given geometry of the element, selected wood species, the applied time and size of load, the carrying capacity of elements, regarding column buckling and fasteners carrying capacity is checked.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} one dimensional mechanical lattice structures. Structures formed from freely <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> rigid links with either vertical or torsional springs at the pivots, or both, are studied under the in uence of an axial load. These studies fall into three parts: static behaviour of a `simple' mechanical system with only vertical springs, dynamic behaviour of this `simple' system, and static behaviour of a compound mechanical lattice with both vertical and torsional springs. The �rst part uses ideas from the �eld of discrete mechanics to derive several discrete boundary value problems that model the static equilibrium states of the `simple' mechanical lattice. This application of discrete mechanics allows us to better understand the relationships between the mechanical system and the discrete boundary value problem used to model it. The resulting discrete boundary value problem is studied in detail and interesting complex behaviour is observed. The study of the dynamic behaviour of the `simple' mechanical lattice concentrates on the existence and stability of time periodic spatially localised solutions called discrete breathers. Discrete breathers are found to exist and to be stable. Also, related solutions called phonobreathers are found to exist and, although the exact phonobreather solutions are unstable, interesting nonlinear dynamic behaviour is observed close to the unstable solutions. Finally, the static behaviour of a new compound mechanical lattice, a discrete version of the strut on a linear foundation, is studied in Chapter 6. We see how the behaviour of two simpler mechanical lattices is manifested in this compound lattice, before presenting analytic and numerical results on the primary, static, bifurcations of this compound lattice. The localised behaviour of the most physically relevant static equilibrium states is also investigated. Extensions to the discrete boundary value problem methods of the earlier chapters are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{research}} projects are being pursued involving the dynamics {{and control of}} large plate-like space platforms made up of repetitive lattice-type truss structures. A method involving finite element modelling of an equivalent continuum formulation based on matching the strain energy and kinetic energy is developed for truss type lattices with pinned joints. The method is shown to give modal results consistent with those obtained using detailed finite element modelling of the <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> space lattice structure, even for structures with fairly small numbers of repetitions of an identical unit cell. Feedback controllers designed using reduced system models derived from these modal results using Modal Cost Analysis are shown to perform as well as controllers designed using the detailed analysis results. ^ The efficiency of this method for coupled structure, control system design is demonstrated with a parametric study. Lattice plate finite elements are {{used to examine the}} effect of variation of several fundamental structural parameters on the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the structure. Feedback control systems are designed and the resulting system performance evaluated by examining the steady state regulation cost of the structure {{as a function of the}} structural design parameters. ^ A micropolar plate continuum model of large plate-like repetitive space lattice structures with rigid joints is derived. A plate finite element is derived based on this continuum model with micropolar rotations and transverse shear deformations included as nodal degrees of freedom (d. o. f. 2 ̆ 7 s). The natural frequencies and mode shapes are calculated using this element for a free floating hexahedral plate-like space lattice structure. These natural frequencies and mode shapes are compared to those calculated using a detailed finite element model (with every structural member modelled by a beam-column element) for several sets of frame member cross sectional properties. The static deflections of a centrally loaded and corner supported rectangular plate-like space lattice structure are also obtained and compared using these two types of structural models. ...|$|R

40|$|Aerodynamic {{investigations}} have shown' that variable camber wings (VCW) for transport aircraft have considerable potential {{in terms of}} improving aircraft performance and enhancing their operational flexibility. In order to justify these benefits {{it is essential that}} the camber varying system is structurally and mechanically feasible. This research examined the feasibility of providing variable camber to two supercritical aerofoil sections of different'characteristics. The unique method of camber vaTiation was applied by rotating the forward and aft regions of the aerofoil on a circular arc and keeping the surface continuous and matching at their attachment to the main wing box. The change in camber thus increased the chord due to translational motion of the aforementioned regions. The geometries required for varying the forward camber by this method presented formidable design difficulties and no immediate solutions could be found. As a result, an alternative geometry was devised which accepts camber by simply drooping the nose region. A novel idea was developed for aft camber variation, which is considered to be universal for all supercritical aerofoil sections. The system utilises a tracking mechanism which guides a trailing edge element on a continuous arc. Surface continuity is provided by a flexible skin on the upper side and a spring loaded hinged panel on the under side. The flexible skin remains attached to the trailing edge element through a series of roller link arrangement which locate the skin in a separate guide rail. The large moment arm and therefore the increased torsional loads created due to the translational motion of the trailing edge element necessitated investigation of alternative deployment geometries. As a result two additional geometries were schemed. One had reduced radius of rotation and therefore reduced extension, while the other changed camber by drooping the aft region without any chordal extension. Since there was no aerodynamic evidence on the possible benefits offered by these geometries it was decide to postpone them until such information was available. Some detailed aspects of the proposed concept for aft camber variation were considered by applying the system to a modem transport aircraft wing. This resulted in a design which is practically feasible. Justification of this concept was made by designing and testing a half scale structural model of one trailing edge segment. Three dimensional (3 -D) geometric investigation showed that the camber-varying elements ride on a frustum of a cone and therefore their deployment is skewed to the line of flight. The 3 -D geometric implications of variable camber clearly suggested that the camber variation by rotation on a circular arc, on a tapered wing can be possible if the rotating element is made to flex and twist or it utilises a <b>pin</b> <b>jointed</b> arrangement. To provide the necessary flexibility to the trailing edge element, its structural box best be made from fibre reinforced plastic material. The deployment of the trailing edge element on the structural m(; del was made possible by designing it in laminated wood. Comparison of the proposed variable camber system with a conventional single slotted flap arrangement suggests that the two systems could be equally complex but the variable camber could be slightly heavier., Further systems investigations are required to quantify overall aerodynamic, mass, and cost implications of the use of VCW on transport aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Multi-storey precast {{concrete}} skeletal structures are assembled from individual prefabricated components which are erected on-site using {{various types of}} connections. In the current design of these structures, beam-to-column connections {{are assumed to be}} <b>pin</b> <b>jointed.</b> This current research work focuses on the flexural behaviour of the beam-to-column connections and their effect on the behaviour of the global {{precast concrete}} frame. The experimental work has involved the determination of moment-rotation relationships for semi-rigid precast concrete connections both in full scale connection tests and smaller isolated joint tests. This has been done using the so called "component method" in which the deformation of various parts of the connection and their interfaces are summated, and compared with results from full scale sub-frame connection tests. The effects of stress redistribution, shear interaction etc. are taken of by linear transformation in the results from the full scale tests, enabling parametric equations to be formulated empirically in order to describe the semi-rigid behaviour. Eight full scale column-beam-slab assemblages were tested to determine the (hogging) moment-rotation behaviour of double (balanced loading) and single sided in-plane connections. Two of the most common types of connection were used, the welded plate and the billet type. Proprietary hollow core slabs were tied to the beams by tensile reinforcing bars, which also provide the in-plane continuity across the joint. The strength of the connections in the double sided tests was at least 0. 84 times the predicted moment of resistance of the composite beam and slab. The strength of the single sided connections was limited by the strength of the connection itself, and was approximately half of that for the double sided connection, even though the connection was identical. The secant stiffness of the connections ranged from 0. 7 to 3. 9 times the flexural stiffness of the attached beam. When the connections were tested without the floor slabs and tie steel, the reduced strength and stiffness were approximately a third and half respectively. This remarkable contribution of the floor strength and stiffness to the flexural capacity of the joint is currently neglected in the design process for precast concrete frames. Measurements of the extent of damaged zones near to the connection in full scale tests showed that, unlike steel connections, semi-rigid behaviour in precast concrete does not occur at a single nodal position. In general the double sided connections were found to be more suited to a semi-rigid design approach than the single sided ones. Analytical studies were carried out to determine empirical design equations for column effective length factors β in unbraced and partially braced precast concrete frames. The main variables were the relative flexural stiffness α of the frame members, and the relative linear rotational stiffness Ks of the connection to that of an encastre beam. The variation of β factors with Ks and α are presented graphically and in the form of design equations similar to those currently used in BS 8 110. The change in the response of a structure is greatest when 0 2 the changes in the behaviour are so small that they may be ignored within the usual levels of accuracy associated with stability analysis. This is an important finding because the experiments have found Ks to be generally less than 2 for typical sizes of beam. The results enable designers to determine β factors for situations currently not catered for in design codes of practice, in particular the upper storey of a partially braced frame. A design method is proposed to extend the concrete column design approach in BS 8110 and EC 2, whereby the strength and semi-rigid stiffness of the connection enables column bending moments to be distributed to the connected beams. However, the suitability of each type of connection towards a semi-rigid design approach must be related to the stiffness and strength of the frame for which it is a part...|$|R
