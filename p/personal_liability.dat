25|$|Partnerships {{recognized}} {{by a government}} body may enjoy special benefits from taxation policy. Among developed countries, for example, business partnerships are often favored over corporations in taxation policy, since dividend taxes only occur on profit before they are distributed to the partners. However, depending on the partnership structure and the jurisdiction in which it operates, owners of a partnership may be exposed to greater <b>personal</b> <b>liability</b> than they would as shareholders of a corporation. In such countries, partnerships are often regulated via anti-trust laws, so as to inhibit monopolistic practices and foster free market competition. Enforcement of the laws, however, varies considerably. Domestic partnerships {{recognized by}} governments typically enjoy tax benefits, as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{the country}} districts, {{as has been}} stated, the magistri pagorum had {{authority}} to maintain the viae vicinales. In Rome itself each householder was legally responsible for the repairs to {{that portion of the}} street which passed his own house. It was the duty of the aediles to enforce this responsibility. The portion of any street which passed a temple or public building was repaired by the aediles at the public expense. When a street passed between a public building or temple and a private house, the public treasury and the private owner shared the expense equally. No doubt, if only to secure uniformity, the <b>personal</b> <b>liability</b> of householders to execute repairs of the streets was commuted for a paving rate payable to the public authorities who were responsible from time to time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{portion of}} taxes {{collected}} from the employee for Social Security {{are referred to as}} [...] "trust fund taxes" [...] and the employer is required to remit them to the government. These taxes take priority over everything, and represent the only debts of a corporation or LLC that can impose <b>personal</b> <b>liability</b> upon its officers or managers. A sole proprietor and officers of a corporation and managers of an LLC can be held personally liable for non-payment of the income tax and social security taxes whether or not actually {{collected from the}} employee.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} a {{bankruptcy}} discharge is to eliminate only the debtor's <b>personal</b> <b>liability,</b> not the in rem liability for a secured debt {{to the extent of}} the value of collateral. The term [...] "in rem" [...] essentially means [...] "with respect to the thing itself" [...] (i.e., the collateral). For example, if a debt in the amount of $100,000 is secured by property having a value of only $80,000, the $20,000 deficiency is treated, in bankruptcy, as an unsecured claim (even though it's part of a [...] "secured" [...] debt). The $80,000 portion of the debt is treated as a secured claim. Assuming a discharge is granted and none of the $20,000 deficiency is paid (e.g., due to insufficiency of funds), the $20,000 deficiency—the debtor's personal liability—is discharged (assuming the debt is not non-dischargeable under another Bankruptcy Code provision). The $80,000 portion of the debt is the in rem liability, and it is not discharged by the court's discharge order. This liability can presumably be satisfied by the creditor taking the asset itself. An essential concept is that when commentators say that a debt is [...] "dischargeable," [...] they are referring only to the debtor's <b>personal</b> <b>liability</b> on the debt. To the extent that a liability is covered by the value of collateral, the debt is not discharged.|$|E

2500|$|Police {{routinely}} exercise {{discretion in}} their work. [...] Requiring {{the police to}} decide whether a crime is a fine-only crime, for which he could not arrest the suspect, {{in the heat of}} the moment ultimately exposes the police to greater legal consequences—either exclusion of illegally obtained evidence, or <b>personal</b> <b>liability</b> for violating the suspect's constitutional rights. [...] Balancing of Fourth Amendment interests through [...] "probable cause" [...] and [...] "extraordinary" [...] circumstances has been delineated in Terry v. Ohio, [...] [...] Given the choice to abandon or abridge the requirement of probable cause for arrest in the case of fine-only misdemeanors, the Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment imposed the same standard for all crimes: probable cause.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{insuring}} negligence in supervising organizations, or wrongful {{acts and}} misrepresentation in financial statements is controversial {{due to its}} effect on accountability, otherwise known as the moral hazard problem. In the United States, corporate boards have a [...] "duty of care", but if personal financial consequences for violating that duty of care are lacking, the boards may not perform proper due diligence. [...] In the famous case of Smith v. Van Gorkom (1985), the Delaware Supreme Court found a board grossly negligent and therefore liable. The decision created a backlash and a statute change in Delaware which allowed a corporation to amend its charter to eliminate directors' <b>personal</b> <b>liability</b> for violation of the duty of care; {{a version of this}} statute has been passed in all states, and most large corporations have such an [...] "exculpatory clause".|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, Miscavige {{set up a}} new {{organizational}} structure to release Hubbard from <b>personal</b> <b>liability</b> and to handle the Scientology founder's personal wealth through a corporate entity outside of the Scientology organization.

Miscavige has held the title of Chairman of the Board of the Religious Technology Center since the organization's founding. The Church of Spiritual Technology was created at the same time with an option to repurchase all of RTC's intellectual property rights. In a 1982 probate case, Ronald DeWolf, Hubbard's estranged son, accused Miscavige of embezzling from and manipulating his father. Hubbard denied this in a written statement, saying that his business affairs were being well managed by Author Services Inc., of which Miscavige was the Chairman of the Board. In the same document L. Ron Hubbard called David Miscavige a [...] "trusted associate" [...] and [...] "good friend" [...] who had kept Hubbard's affairs in good order. A judge ruled the statement was authentic.

2500|$|Tottenham Hotspur F.C. {{became a}} limited company, The Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd, on 2 March 1898 {{so as to}} raise funds for the club and limit the <b>personal</b> <b>liability</b> of its members. [...] 8,000 shares were issued at £1 each, {{although}} only 1,558 shares were taken up in the first year. Members of the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s and were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in the 1960s and 1970s, were once the largest shareholder of the club. In the early 1980s, cost overruns in {{the construction of a new}} West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to financial difficulties for the club. In November 1982, Irving Scholar bought 25% of the club for £600,000, and together with Paul Bobroff gained control of the club. Scholar floated Tottenham Hotspur plc, which wholly owns the football club, on the London Stock Exchange in 1983, the first European sports club to be listed in a stock market. The share issue was successful with 3.8 million shares quickly sold. However, ill-judged financial decisions led to accumulating debts, and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing £3.25 million. Sugar however would increase his stake to £8 million by December 1991 and became the dominant partner with effective control of the club. In May 1993, Venables was sacked from the board after a dispute. [...] By 2000, Sugar began to consider selling the club, and in February 2001, he sold the major part of his shareholding to ENIC International Ltd.|$|E
2500|$|Problems arise where serious torts, and {{particularly}} fatal injuries {{occur as a}} result of actions by company employees. All torts committed by employees in the course of employment will attribute liability to their company even if acting wholly outside authority, so long as there is some temporal and close connection to work. It is also clear that acts by directors become acts of the company, as they are [...] "the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation." [...] But despite strict liability in tort, civil remedies are in some instances insufficient to provide a deterrent to a company pursuing business practices that could seriously injure the life, health and environment of other people. Even with additional regulation by government bodies, such as the Health and Safety Executive or the Environment Agency, companies may still have a collective incentive to ignore the rules in the knowledge that the costs and likelihood of enforcement is weaker than potential profits. Criminal sanctions remain problematic, for instance if a company director had no intention to harm anyone, no mens rea, and managers in the corporate hierarchy had systems to prevent employees committing offences. One step toward reform is found in the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007. This creates a criminal offence for manslaughter, meaning a penal fine of up to 10 per cent of turnover against companies whose managers conduct business in a grossly negligent fashion, resulting in deaths. Without lifting the veil there remains, however, no <b>personal</b> <b>liability</b> for directors or employees acting in the course of employment, for corporate manslaughter or otherwise. The quality of a company's accountability to a broader public and the conscientiousness of its behaviour must rely also, in great measure, on its governance.|$|E
