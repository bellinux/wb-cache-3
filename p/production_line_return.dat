40|$|Graduation date: 2007 One of {{the classic}} {{problems}} in industrial engineering is the buffer allocation problem. The objective of the buffer allocation problem is to maximize some line output, typically throughput, through the allocation of buffers throughout the <b>production</b> <b>line.</b> Previous {{work in this area}} has focused on either determining general design rules or developing heuristics to determine optimal buffer placement. Most of this work was done on <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> which were assumed to have an unlimited supply of jobs to the first workstation and an unlimited storage space after the last workstation (open <b>production</b> <b>lines).</b> The purpose of this research was to study buffer allocation in closed <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> and focus on the validation and development of general design rules for buffer placement. Balanced and unbalanced lines were studied with workstations representing manual stations, and then with workstations representing automated machines. The general approach taken was to first identify an existing buffer allocation rule established for open lines and then determine the corresponding rule for closed <b>production</b> <b>lines.</b> Next, a set of experiments were designed to test the closed <b>production</b> <b>line</b> design rule. Finally, the design rule was validated, modified, or reformulated. The findings of this research indicate that an even buffer allocation is optimal for balanced closed <b>production</b> <b>lines.</b> It also showed similar behavior to open <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> when a bottleneck is present, but the effect of the bottleneck is not as strong. Also, differences between reliable and unreliable lines were observed. Finally, the rules developed seemed to be consistent for short lines as well as long ones. Several of the rules developed in this research can be utilized immediately in the design of closed <b>production</b> <b>lines.</b> Also, {{because of the lack of}} literature on closed <b>production</b> <b>lines,</b> it will serve as a good first step into the understanding of the role of buffers in closed <b>production</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{traditional}} <b>production</b> <b>lines,</b> such as assembly lines, each {{worker is}} usually {{assigned to a}} fixed task, which is beneficial since it reduces the amount of training needed for workers to master their assigned tas ks. However, when workers complete their tasks at different speeds, the slowest worker will determine the overall pace of the <b>production</b> <b>line</b> and limit <b>production.</b> To avoid this problem, the self-balancing <b>production</b> <b>line</b> was introduced. In this type of <b>production</b> <b>line,</b> each worker works dynamically, thus they can maintain balanced production. Previous research analyzing the performance of these lines has ignored the walk-back time associated with dynamic workers. U-shaped <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> have also been analyzed and policies for such lines have been proposed. However, the walk-back time cannot be ignored in practice, and research taking this factor into account is needed to enable balanced production and thus the maximum production rate. In this paper, we propose production policies for a <b>production</b> <b>line</b> with the walk-back time taken into account, and define and analyze the conditions for self-balancing. Furthermore, we have compar ed the performance of such a line with that of other <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> under the same conditions, and the result...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} explored several alternative coliforms and E. coli detection strategies {{proposed for}} industrial application especially low-resource settings and less advanced food manufacturers. The colony count using 2 industrial favourites (i. e., PetrifilmTM by 3 M and regular pour plate techniques) were contrasted to 4 alternative lowcost strategies. Two modified conventional protocol (i. e., pour and spread plate techniques) in standard mini Petri dishes and two drop plate techniques in microtiter plate formats (i. e., 24 - and 96 -well plate) {{were applied to}} count industrial frozen food samples. The colony detection in all treatments was visually facilitated by low-cost digital microscopy technique comparing colony count, the detection time and the colony area in pixels. All experiments except for the PetrifilmTM E. coli/Coliform (EC) Plate utilized Chromocult® Coliform Agar (CCA). The inoculum sizes were varied depending on the cell count technique used; 10 μl and 5 μl for the 24 - and 96 -well microtiter plates, 50 μl for the mini-plate (both pour and spread plate techniques), and 1000 μl for the full-size Petri dishes and PetrifilmTM E. coli/Coliform (EC) Plate. The incubation temperature was fixed at 35 ± 2 °C. The number of colonies from the conventional pour plate technique was plotted against {{those of the other}} techniques. In all treatments, the relationship plots showed highly linearity from the lower detection limit (100 CFU/ml depending on technique used) to the upper detection limit (10, 000 CFU/ml). The slopes of all regression lines were close to unity showing very high correlation of the values of colony counts from different techniques. All techniques were applied to evaluate actual swap samples from the <b>production</b> <b>line</b> and <b>returned</b> highly consistent colony count numbers and good separation of E. coli from coliforms.
