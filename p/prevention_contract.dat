5000|$|A suicide <b>prevention</b> <b>{{contract}}</b> is {{a contract}} that contains an agreement not to commit suicide. It is often used by medical professionals dealing with depressive clients. Typically, the client {{will be asked to}} agree to talk with the professional prior to carrying out any decision to commit suicide. Suicide prevention contracts have been described as a [...] "widely used but overvalued clinical and risk-management technique." [...] Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} such contracts [...] "may in fact increase danger by providing psychiatrists with a false sense of security, thus decreasing their clinical vigilance." [...] It has also been argued that such contracts can anger or inhibit the client and introduce coercion into therapy.|$|E
40|$|In {{the managed}} care era, mental health {{professionals}} increasingly rely upon suicide prevention contracts {{in the management of}} patients at suicide risk. Al-though asking a patient {{if he or she is}} suicidal and obtaining a written or oral contract against suicide can be useful, these measures by themselves are insuf-ficient. "No harm " contracts cannot take the place of formal suicide risk assess-ments. Obtaining a suicide <b>prevention</b> <b>contract</b> from the patient tends to be an event whereas suicide risk assessment is a process. The suicide <b>prevention</b> <b>contract</b> is not a legal document that will exculpate the clinician from malpractice liability if the patient commits suicide. The contract against self-harm is only as good as the underlying soundness of the therapeutic alliance. The risks and benefits of suicide prevention contracts must be clearly understood. In the managed care era, {{mental health professionals}} increasingly rely upon sui-cide prevention contracts in the manage-ment of patients at suicide risk.

50|$|In {{those with}} mental health {{problems}} a number of treatments may {{reduce the risk of}} suicide. Those who are actively suicidal may be admitted to psychiatric care either voluntarily or involuntarily. Possessions that may be used to harm oneself are typically removed. Some clinicians get patients to sign suicide <b>prevention</b> <b>contracts</b> where they agree to not harm themselves if released. Evidence however does not support a significant effect from this practice. If a person is at low risk, outpatient mental health treatment may be arranged. Short-term hospitalization has not been found to be more effective than community care for improving outcomes in those with borderline personality disorder who are chronically suicidal.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} examined {{mental health}} practitioners' attitudes towards, satisfaction with {{and use of}} suicide <b>prevention</b> <b>contracting</b> (SPC) techniques. Survey respondents comprised consultant psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, mental health nurses, psychologists, registered medical officers and social workers. A self-report questionnaire was mailed to 1347 potential respondents, together with three follow-up letters sent out at two-week intervals. There was a 31 % response rate, producing 420 valid questionnaires. The results of the research re-confirm the historical trajectory of SPC, from its early beginnings as a relationship-based suicide-risk assessment technique to one that is used in contemporary practice by practitioners to meet a range of objectives. The research focused on three SPC techniques in operation in clinical practice: verbal no-suicide assurances, no-suicide agreements, and written no-suicide contracts. Analysis of the data suggests {{a number of important}} findings. The first of these is that practitioners perceive different utility among these three techniques. Secondly, the least experienced practitioners were significantly less likely to use no-suicide contracts, despite seeing more suicidality and having more formal training {{in the use of the}} technique. Thirdly, a practitioner's gender, and formal training were significant in the perception and application of SPC techniques. Finally, suicidal behaviours and completed suicide was a clinical outcome in some situations irrespective of the use and non-use of SPC. The findings of this research are used to provide an emerging conceptual framework and associated nomenclature that inform clinical decision-making in relation to SPC. In addition, a conceptual model is presented which demonstrates that the potential for injudicious use of SPC techniques is as much precipitated by individual factors as it is by broader environmental factors.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Bipolar {{patients}} {{are at high}} risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. Suicidal behavior is correlated with poor family communication and/or high levels of intrafamilial conflict, particularly among adolescent bipolar patients. This article describes the application of family-focused therapy (FFT) as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in the management of suicidal ideation and behavior among bipolar patients. METHODS: We describe the empirical basis of FFT in studies of adult and adolescent patients. We then describe the manner by which the three modules of FFT - psychoeducation, communication skills training and problem solving - are adapted to address the clinical issues presented by suicidal bipolar adults or adolescents and their families. RESULTS: Key objectives of the treatment are to help the family recognize that suicidal behavior {{is a part of the}} pathophysiology of bipolar disorder but that it is also to some extent under environmental control. Thus, the family is in a unique position to develop and help assure the success of a suicide <b>prevention</b> <b>contract.</b> A case study of an adolescent with suicidal behavior is presented. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should include a focus on: (i) cross-cultural issues in suicide and bipolar disorder; and (ii) the adaptation of interventions shown to be effective in reducing suicidal behaviors in non-bipolar populations...|$|E

Can {{groups and individuals}} from disparate government and non-government sectors work together to reduce or prevent crime? This article will address these and other questions by using developments in Belgium as its case study.

Traces the development of the Belgian crime <b>prevention</b> <b>contracts</b> and examines the difficulties experienced with "multi-agency crime prevention" and suggests that much of the political rhetoric in Belgium calling for local, community and intersectorial "partnerships" has, like several other countries including England and Wales, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, lacked clear practical expression. However, some promising initiatives indicate that this prevention approach may be capable of producing effective crime prevention and community safety outcomes.

A work accident can be defined as any body injury that a worker (acting as an employee) suffers during or as a result of work. Agriculture {{is one of the most}} hazardous sectors. Work-related non-fatal accident rates are 1. 7 times higher than the average and the number of fatal work accidents is three times higher than the average. The agricultural sector and the agro-food industry are economic activities whose preventive policies would have a significant positive impact on workers safety and health. The primary data was obtained through personal interviews in all the companies of the province. We analyse and quantify their different type as well as the type and amount of investments to prevent such accidents through interviews with human resource responsible in these companies. The results show how 61 % of the companies recorded accidents with injuries and 41 % of the companies recorded 10 or more accidents with injuries. Also, every accident at work has an average cost between 1, 000 and 3, 000 euros (41 % of companies), with a sick leave average duration of 8 days per accident.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{investigate}} the impact of restaurant health inspection reports on consumer behavioral intention. Four separate studies were conducted. First, the availability of restaurant health inspection reports was investigated on governmental websites. The second study, a pilot study, was conducted prior to the third study which adapted PMT in order to investigate behavioral intention based on health inspection reports. Lastly, the fourth study examined the effect of information source and message style on consumers‘ response to restaurant health inspection reports. The study searched websites to collect the data (Study 1) and employed questionnaires (Study 2, Study 3, and Study 4). Significances among PMT variables were found in relation to protection motivation and behavioral intention. It should be noted that protection motivation and behavioral intention did not have any relationship to each other. Protection motivation did not predict behavioral intention. ^ The results suggested that number of violations affected the responses significantly which suggested that moderator effects were detected. Respondents appeared willing to dine at a restaurant which received fewer violations. PMT studies have been conducted in health preventive behavior and provided consistent results.

While health disparities can be addressed at multiple levels, this guide focuses on policy, systems, and environmental improvements designed to improve the places where people live, learn, work, and play. Heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and stroke {{are the most common}} causes of illness, disability, and death affecting a growing number of Americans. Many of these chronic conditions tend to be more common, diagnosed later, and result in worse outcomes for particular individuals, such as people of color, people in low-income neighborhoods, and others whose life conditions place them at risk for poor health. Despite decades of efforts to reduce and eliminate health disparities, they persist 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 dand in some cases, they are widening among some population groups. Such disparities do not have a single cause. They are created and maintained through multiple, interconnected, and complex pathways. While health disparities can be addressed at multiple levels, this resource focuses on policy, systems, and environmental improvement strategies designed to improve the places where people live, learn, work, and play. Many of the 20 th and 21 st century 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s greatest public health achievements (e. g., water fluoridation, motor vehicle safety, food safety) have relied on the use of laws, regulations, and environmental improvement strategies. Health practitioners {{play an important role in}} these improvements by engaging the community, identifying needs, conducting analyses, developing partnerships, as well as implementing and evaluating evidence-based interventions.

40|$|In March 23, 2010, President Obama {{signed into}} law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), which {{included}} several provisions intended to improve the health of Americans and prevent the onset of preventable chronic disease conditions. Section 4103 of the ACA, entitled Medicare Coverage of Annual Wellness Visit Providing a Personalized Prevention Plan, mandates that starting in January 1, 2011, Medicare will cover, without cost to beneficiaries, an annual wellness visit (AWV) that includes a health risk assessment (HRA) followed by provision of a customized wellness or personal prevention plan. Section 4103 also states that an HRA is to be completed prior to, or as part of, a visit with a health professional who may be a physician, medical practitioner, medical professional (e. g., health educator, registered dietician, nutrition professional) or a team of medical professionals. The law specifies that the HRA 1) must identify chronic diseases, injury risks, modifiable risk factors, and urgent health needs of an individual; 2) may be furnished through an interactive telephonic or web-based program; 3) may be offered during the encounter with a health care professional or through community-based prevention programs, or 4) may be provided through any other means appropriate to maximize accessibility {{and ease of use}} by beneficiaries, while ensuring the privacy of beneficiaries. Other provisions of Section 4103 include 1) establishing standards for interactive or Web-based programs used to furnish HRAs, and 2) determining ways of using the HRA in the formulation of a personalized prevention plan for beneficiaries who are administered the HRA. The law also calls for making available to the public an HRA 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 model 22 ̆ 0 ac? (unspecified) 18 months after the passage of ACA, ensuring that HRAs are made available and easily accessible to beneficiaries, providing support to those wishing to complete HRAs, and publicizing the requirement that beneficiaries complete an HRA prior to, or concurrent with, receiving personalized prevention plan services. The statute recognizes the critical nature of follow-up services by encouraging integration of HRAs with health information technology (HIT), including electronic medical record (EMRs) and personal health records (PHRs), and the leveraging of these technologies in the development of self-management skills and management of, and adherence to, provider recommendations as a means of improving the health of beneficiaries. Further, as part of the law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to establish publicly available guidelines for an HRA, to be formulated in consultation with relevant groups and entities. With this as background, the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and <b>Prevention</b> (CDC) <b>contracted</b> with Partnership for Prevention and its subcontractor Thomson Reuters to develop this guidance document to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to direct health care providers, health promotion vendors, and other professionals wishing to implement Section 4103 of the ACA. The guidance document presented here is informed by interviews with subject matter experts, input received in response to a Federal Register Notice, insights provided by attendees at a public forum hosted by the CDC on February 122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2, 2011, and knowledge by the authors derived from an understanding of the literature focused on this topic (see Appendix B). The guidance document addresses the use of HRAs and follow-up counseling, coaching and behavior change interventions in clinical settings aimed at improving {{the health and well-being of}} Medicare beneficiaries.

40|$|E-Governance {{is the use}} of {{information}} and communication technologies to support good governance. A number of countries across the world have adopted E-governance schemes to transform the life pattern of their denizens. Information and communication technologies have a valuable potential to help meet good governance goals in India. The government of India and several state governments have been continuously endeavoring to provide citizen services in a better manner in all areas of Public administration such as Public Services, Rural Services, Social Services, Agricultural and Revenue Services,etc. The benchmark step taken by the Indian Government is the enactment of Information Technology Act (2000). It has provisions to facilitate electronic commerce and electronic transactions, electronic <b>contracts,</b> <b>prevention</b> of computer crimes, electronic filing and digital signature, etc. The Union Government had approved the National E-Governance Action Plan for implementation during the year 2003 - 2007. The plan is an attempt to lay the foundation and provide impetus for long-term growth of e-governance within the country. E- Governance has helped in timely and accurate issuance of Records of Rights (ROR) to land owners. Agmarknet, Kisan Call Centres. E- Panchayats, E- Chaupal, E-learning in education, business and railways are other areas where E- governance is proving the effectiveness. India has a large network of Public Distribution System (PDS) and fair price shops (FPS) to provide essential commodities to the rural folk and E- governance will minimize the corruption and mismanagement of PDS. One goal of e-government will be greater citizen participation. Through the internet, {{people from all over the}} country can interact with politicians or public servants and make their voices heard. India has enforced the Right to Information Act (2005) and IT based services would lead to greater transparency in providing information under this Act. India is a country of villages and several types of disputes arise there. The pending court cases have brought the legal system to a halt. The application of ICT in Supreme Court and High Courts has enabled the parties to get information about their cases from remote areas. Further it will not only save the money and time of citizens but will also reduce the backlog of cases. The Postal department has already started effective services like delivery of Money Orders through Extended Satellite Money Order (ESMO) centres in certain stations. These services are being provided with the help of satellite based Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs). There have been several successful initiatives and noteworthy projects undertaken in various states of India. Some of the successful initiatives are: Bhoomi (Karnataka), Gyandoot (M. P.), E-seva(Andhra Pradesh),ASHA (Assam),Lokmitra (HP), Gramdoot (Rajasthan),Lokvani (U. P.),Sari (Tamilnadu), Akshaya (Kerala), SETU(Maharashtra) and SUDA(Gujarat), etc. This paper specifically focuses on the E-Governance initiatives that have changed the life style of rural citizens and in which the citizens derive benefit through direct transactions with the services provided by the union and the provincial governments. The paper also highlights the variety of constraints in implementing the E-governance projects in rural areas. Article DOI : 10. 5958 / 2347 - 6869. 2017. 00009. ...|$|R
