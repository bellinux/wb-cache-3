The geology of the Gwalior range rock formations is ochre coloured sandstone covered with basalt. There is a horizontal stratum, 342 ft at its highest <b>point</b> (<b>length</b> 1.5 mi and average width 1000 yard m). The stratum forms a near-perpendicular precipice. A small river, the Swarnrekha, flows close to the palace.|$|E

5000|$|A {{closed tube}} (also called a [...] "stopped pipe" [...] in the organ) is a tube which is closed at one end. The tube has a {{fundamental}} frequency {{but can be}} overblown to produce other higher frequencies or notes. These overblown registers can be tuned by using different degrees of conical taper. A closed tube resonates at the same fundamental frequency as an open tube twice its length, with a wavelength equal to four times its length. In a closed tube, a displacement node, or point of no vibration, always appears at the closed end and if the tube is resonating, it will have an antinode, or point greatest vibration at the Phi <b>point</b> (<b>length</b> × 0.618) near the open end.|$|E

The payment of many fringe benefit type of allowances has been either ceased or tightened up for new recruits offered appointment on or after June 1, 2000 to reflect present day circumstances [...] In June 2004, the CSB has commenced a review on fringe benefit type of allowances to ensure that payment of civil service allowances is in line with today’s circumstances, to enhance control over government expenditure in this area, and to improve efficiency in the administration of these allowances.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the International Ski Federation {{replaced}} the calculation point as {{the measurement of}} the size of a hill with hill size. The hill size is the length from the takeoff in a straight line to the knoll and then along the level of the landing slope to the hill size point. The hill size point is calculated based on the technical data of a hill based on radius, angle of inclination and record distance. The calculation point or K-point is slightly further up in the hill and denotes the point where the landing slope is the steepest. It is still used for the calculation of distance points, which along with style points determine the winner of an event. For hills up to large, the scoring system grants 60 points to jumps which reach the critical point. For ski flying hills, 120 points are granted for the critical <b>point</b> <b>length.</b> Based on the hill's length, distance points are calculated, which are added for each meter beyond the critical point and subtracted for each point shorter than the critical point. A meter has more distance points in smaller hills. Hills also have a fall line; a jumper who falls or otherwise touches the ground with their body after the fall line is not penalized.|$|E

Cloak oblong or subquadrate, with the margin slightly sinuated {{and turned up}} at the sides, and also in front, where it is bent back in a rounded lobe; the posterior end bending inwards behind the branchiae: the cloak is densely freckled {{like the rest of}} the body, having an irregular pale line running down each side: the margin is also pale, with a few black and yellow spots; and an irregular line of light spots runs along each side of the body below the pallial margin. An obtuse carinated ridge reaches from the mantle to the tail. Dorsal tentacles clavate and laminated, freckled with the same dark colour as the body. Branchial plumes five, small, twice or thrice pinnated, and placed a little apart from each other and from the anal nipple; they are darkly freckled above, with yellow tips; the under surface pale. Head squared in front and produced considerably beyond the cloak, the sides forming two moderate-sized tentacular processes held laterally. Foot yellowish, without markings, truncated in front, and rather narrow, with the sides almost parallel, extending beyond the cloak for about one-fourth of the whole length of the body, and terminating in a blunt <b>point.</b> <b>Length</b> nearly an inch.

Fluoroscopic based computerized navigation system can increase precision in screw placement while performing the surgical task, and markedly reduce radiation.

In {{order to improve}} the reliability of SEP monitoring, {{an investigation of the}} application of various time-frequency analysis (TFA) techniques to detect both temporal and spectral changes in SEP waveforms was conducted. SEP signals from 15 scoliosis patients were analysed using various methods. The time-frequency distributions (TFDs) computed using these methods were assessed and compared.

If the LCX runs close and crosses between the CS-GCV and mitral annulus, there is high risk of compression of LCX due to the percutaneous mitral annuloplasty. In 68  % of patients, the LCX may run inferior to the CS, {{as a result of}} which it is located between the CS and mitral valve annulus, with an overlapping segment > 30  mm in 17.58  % of these patients. If the LCX is coursing between the CS and MVA for a long distance, a percutaneous procedure is not possible since it might cause LCX compression [35].|$|E

40|$|The local heat {{transfer}} coefficients downstream of a backward-facing step were measured at various jet locations and jet velocities by discharging a jet perpendicularly {{to the main}} flow to control the {{heat transfer}} characteristics.

40|$|Smoke {{points were}} {{measured}} in microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS) {{as part of}} the Smoke Points in Coflow Experiment (SPICE), and in normal gravity conditions. In microgravity conditions increasing the coflow velocity or decreasing the burner diameter increased the smoke point flame length. A simplified prediction of centerline jet velocity did not yield residence-time-based criticalities or data collapse. Simulation of non-reacting flows showed that the simplified centerline velocity prediction was able to predict velocity decay for only relatively weak coflows. An improved model may yield different results. In normal earth gravity coflow velocity exhibited mixed effects. For burner diameters of 0. 41, 0. 76, and 1. 6 mm, smoke points increased with increases of coflow velocity.

40|$|An {{assemblage}} of prehistoric Huron chipped stone tools has been analyzed {{in terms of}} its inherently dynamic properties.
