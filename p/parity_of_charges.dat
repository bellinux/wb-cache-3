40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{experimental}} progress towards the measurement and manipulation of Majorana fermions with superconducting circuits, we propose a device interfacing Majorana fermions with circuit quantum electrodynamics. The proposed circuit {{acts as a}} charge parity detector changing the resonance frequency of a superconducting λ/ 4 - resonator conditioned on the <b>parity</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> on nearby gates. Operating at both charge and flux sweet spots, this device is highly insensitive to environmental noise. It enables high-fidelity single-shot quantum non demolition readout {{of the state of}} a pair of Majorana fermions encoding a topologically protected qubit. Additionally, the interaction permits the realization of an arbitrary phase gate on the topological qubit, closing the loop for computational completeness. Away from the charge sweet spot, this device {{can be used as a}} highly sensitive charge detector with a sensitivity better than 10 ^- 4 e / √(Hz) and bandwidth larger than 1 MHz.

40|$|Topological Weyl semimetals can host Weyl nodes with {{monopole}} {{charges in}} momentum space. How {{to detect the}} signature <b>of</b> the monopole <b>charges</b> in quantum transport remains a challenging topic. Here, we reveal {{the connection between the}} <b>parity</b> <b>of</b> monopole <b>charge</b> in topological semimetals and the quantum interference corrections to the conductivity. We show that the <b>parity</b> <b>of</b> monopole <b>charge</b> determines the sign of the quantum interference correction, with odd and even parity yielding the weak antilocalization and weak localization effects, respectively. This is attributed to the Berry phase difference between time-reversed trajectories circulating the Fermi sphere that encloses the monopole charges. From standard Feynman diagram calculations, we further show that the weak-field magnetoconductivity at low temperatures is proportional to +B √ in double-Weyl semimetals and −B √ in single-Weyl semimetals, respectively, which could be verified experimentally. postprin...|$|R

40|$|Utilizing a SU(2) gauge {{symmetry}} {{technique in}} the quasiclassical diffusive regime, we theoretically study finite-sized two-dimensional intrinsic spin-orbit coupled superconductor/normal-metal/superconductor (S/N/S) hybrid structures {{with a single}} spin-active interface. We consider intrinsic spin-orbit interactions (ISOIs) that are confined within the N wire and absent in the s-wave superconducting electrodes (S). Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the coupling of the ISOIs and spin moment of the spin-active interface results in maximum singlet-triplet conversion and accumulation of spin current density {{at the corners of}} the N wire nearest the spin-active interface. By solely modulating the superconducting phase difference, we show how the opposing <b>parities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> and spin currents provide an effective venue to experimentally examine pure edge spin currents not accompanied by charge currents. These effects occur in the absence of externally imposed fields, and moreover are insensitive to the arbitrary orientations of the interface spin moment.

40|$|Controlling {{electron}} spins strongly {{coupled to}} magnetic and nuclear spins in solid state systems {{is an important}} challenege {{in the field of}} spintronics and quantum computation. We show here that electron droplets with no net spin in semiconductor quantum dots strongly coupled with magnetic ion/nuclear spin systems break down at low temperature and form a non-trivial anti-ferromagnetic spatially ordered spin-texture of magneto-polarons. The spatially ordered combined electron-magnetic ion spin-texture, associated with spontaneous symmetry-breaking in the <b>parity</b> <b>of</b> electronic <b>charge</b> density and magnetization of magnetic ions, emerge from both ab-initio density functional approach to the electronic system coupled with mean-field approximation for the magnetic/nuclear spin system and fully mircoscopic exact diagonalization of small systems.

This prediction may arrest fluctuations in spin system and open the way to control, manipulate and prepare magnetic and nuclear spin ensembles in semiconductor nanostructures.

40|$|We first detail our {{previous}} findings for four classes of Standard Model Extensions (SMEs) violating Super-Symmetry (SuSy) and Lorentz Symmetry (LoSy). The classes {{differ in the}} <b>parity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Charge</b> conjugation-Parity-Time reversal (CPT) symmetry and whether considering the impact of photinos on photon propagation. The violations occurring at the very high energies of the early universe show visible traces in the Dispersion Relations (DRs) at our energy scales of present times. For the CPT odd classes (V_μ breaking vector) associated to the Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) model, the DRs show an effective mass of the photon. Arranging the CPT-odd Lagrangian in a non-explicit covariant form, a massive de Broglie-Proca (dBP), but gauge invariant, term arises. The mass, below 10 ^- 55 kg, is proportional to |V⃗|, while the group velocity exhibits a classic dBP dependence on the inverse of the frequency squared. For the CPT even classes (k_F breaking tensor), the DRs display a massless but subluminal non-Maxwellian behaviour. All DRs display an angular dependence and lack LoSy invariance. We push forward our past analysis showing herein for the odd CPT sector how i) complex frequencies and superluminal speeds may arise in specific conditions; ii) bi- and tri-refringence emerge; for both CPT sectors, iii) the circumstances for which SuSy and LoSy breakings, possibly along {{with the presence of}} an external field, lead to the non-conservation of the photon energy-momentum tensor...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the fall}} <b>of</b> <b>parity</b> in electroweak {{interactions}} the discrete transformations <b>of</b> <b>parity,</b> <b>charge</b> conjugation and time reversal are under close scrutiny {{for any sign}} of deviation from maximality where symmetry breaking seems to be complete (like P violation in beta decay) and {{for any sign of}} symmetry breaking when this has not yet been observed (like T violation in beta decay). The Standard Model (SM) of electroweak interactions remains robust in explaining the outcome of all experiments with beta rays. Bounds set by P- and T-reversal tests are tightening but remain stubbornly within the SM. However, the solar-neutrino issue enters the era beyond the SM by requiring upsilon oscillations and a non-zero upsilon mass. This review emphasizes experiments with beta rays, but includes solar-neutrino and beta beta-decay findings and devotes some attention to the broken symmetry in biochirality. Theoretical descriptions attempt to implement the symmetry breaking in a causal way, pointing to a possible earlier manifest left-right symmetry, and stimulating searches for deviations from the above maximality as a 'fossil' remnant of symmetry at a deeper level...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{realization}} {{in a model}} of graphene of the phenomenon whereby the tendency of gauge-field mediated interactions to break chiral symmetry spontaneously is greatly enhanced in an external magnetic field. We prove that, in the weak coupling limit, and where the electron-electron interaction satisfies certain mild conditions, the ground state <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> neutral graphene in an external magnetic field is a quantum Hall ferromagnet which spontaneously breaks the emergent U(4) symmetry to U(2) XU(2). We argue that, due to a residual CP symmetry, the quantum Hall ferromagnet order parameter is given exactly by the leading order in perturbation theory. On the other hand, the chiral condensate which is the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking generically obtains contributions at all orders. We compute the leading correction to the chiral condensate. We argue that the ensuing fermion spectrum resembles that of massive fermions with a vanishing U(4) -valued chemical potential. We discuss the realization <b>of</b> <b>parity</b> and <b>charge</b> conjugation symmetries and argue that, {{in the context of}} our model, the charge neutral quantum Hall state in graphene is a bulk insulator, with vanishing longitudinal conductivity due to a charge gap and Hall conductivity vanishing due to a residual discrete particle-hole symmetry.
