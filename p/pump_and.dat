5|$|In early 1943, Ingersoll Rand pulled out. Keith {{approached}} the Clark Compressor Company and Worthington <b>Pump</b> <b>and</b> Machinery but they turned it down, {{saying that it}} could not be done. So Keith and Groves saw executives at Allis-Chalmers, who agreed to build a new factory to produce the pumps, even though the pump design was still uncertain. The SAM Laboratories came up with a design, and Westinghouse built some prototypes that were successfully tested. Then Judson Swearingen at the Elliott Company came up with a revolutionary and promising design that was mechanically stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers.|$|E

5|$|In the late-1930s it {{was decided}} to replace the <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, {{designed}} by Sir Edwin Lutyens, were memorials to Lord Jellicoe and Lord Beatty, although busts of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War. The fountains cost almost £50,000. The old ones were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in Ottawa's Confederation Park and Regina's Wascana Centre.|$|E
5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of a {{butterfly}} or moth contains the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli {{which may or may not}} be visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E
5|$|To {{provide the}} desired performance, several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} production has put an increased strain on limited freshwater resources in Jordan and Palestine. The area currently has an abundant supply of saline water {{which has not}} been utilized for agriculture due to the economics associated with <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalinization. Limited availability to electricity and high operational costs of diesel generators are major obstacles to irrigation <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalination in the area. In order to determine the technical and economic feasibility of solar powered water <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalination for agriculture, a detailed system model was developed using industrial component performance and geographically specific resource data. Hourly simulations over the course of one year were performed to evaluate different system configurations, technologies, and control strategies. Results show that while PV powered <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalination is not profitable for most crops, under good conditions certain high-value crops yield reasonable returns. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to estimate water <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalination costs in under a variety of conditions...|$|R
40|$|Microfluidic <b>pumps</b> <b>and</b> valves {{based on}} {{pneumatically}} actuated diaphragms made of Teflon AF polymers {{are being developed}} for incorporation into laboratory-on-a-chip devices that must perform well over temperature ranges wider than those of prior diaphragm-based microfluidic <b>pumps</b> <b>and</b> valves. Other potential applications include implanted biomedical microfluidic devices, wherein the biocompatability of Teflon AF polymers would be highly advantageous. These <b>pumps</b> <b>and</b> valves have been demonstrated to function stably after cycling through temperatures from - 125 to 120 C. These <b>pumps</b> <b>and</b> valves are intended to be successors to similar prior <b>pumps</b> <b>and</b> valves containing diaphragms made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [commonly known as silicone rubber]. The PDMS-containing valves ae designed to function stably only within the temperature range from 5 to 80 C. Undesirably, PDMS membranes are somwehat porous and retain water. PDMS is especially unsuitable for use at temperatures below 0 C because the formation of ice crystals increases porosity and introduces microshear...|$|R

5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an {{automobile}} maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in the car, with the auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a <b>pump,</b> <b>and</b> then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, {{so much so that}} the overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E
5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boiler– essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 Pounds per square inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with the boiler in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel pump unit built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> Lister deep well pump.|$|E

5|$|The {{identification}} of the ship led to significant public interest in the salvage operation, and caused a great demand for the objects which were brought up. Though many of the objects could not be properly conserved {{at the time and}} subsequently deteriorated, many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day. John Deane ceased working on the wreck in 1836, but returned in 1840 with new, more destructive methods. With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board he blasted his way into parts of the wreck. Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations, but {{there was no evidence that}} Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels. Deane reported retrieving a bilge <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> the lower part of the main mast, both of which would have been located inside the ship. The recovery of small wooden objects like longbows suggests that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point, though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader Margaret Rule. Newspaper reports on Deane's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was clinker built, but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature, an alternative explanation has been suggested: Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship, but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist. Despite the rough handling by Deane the Mary Rose escaped the wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent.|$|E

25|$|Depending on geology {{and soil}} type, <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> treat {{may be a}} good method to quickly reduce high {{concentrations}} of pollutants. It is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards, due to the equilibrium of absorption/desorption processes in the soil. However, <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> treat is typically not the best form of remediation. It is expensive to treat the groundwater, and typically is a very slow process to clean up a release with <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> treat. It is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further. Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction(DPE/MPE). Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound (especially petroleum) by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface, or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time (typically magnesium peroxide or calium oxy-hydroxide).|$|E
