40|$|Crushed {{aggregate}} {{obtained from}} certain ophite outcrops in Cantabria was tested with the Los Angeles and <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> <b>value</b> (<b>PSV)</b> procedures. Linear {{regression analysis was}} used to identify the pétrographie parameters that account for aggregate performance in these two tests. The most abundant and common minerals in the ophite were observed to condition such performance in the Los Angeles method. In PSV behaviour was determined by the existence or otherwise of a rough micro texture -the result of the existence of minerals with different hardness values-, which increases aggregate resistance to polishing action. A partir de la caracterización petrográfica de las ofitas de algunos afloramientos de Cantabria, se han identificado los parámetros petrográficos que explican, a través de modelos lineales de regresión, el comportamiento del árido de machaqueo obtenido de estas rocas frente a los ensayos que aumenta la resistencia al pulimento del árido...|$|E
40|$|Results of a European {{round-robin}} {{aiming to}} identify and quantify scattering sources impacting the <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> <b>value</b> (<b>PSV)</b> of aggregates, and to assess the reference PSV of Herrnholzer granite, are presented and discussed. This reference value corrected against quartz dolerite control stone is calculated as PSVHE ref = 56. 1 ± 0. 5. According to variance analysis calculations, PSV scattering sources breakdown into three main components which have been assessed, a random friction tester term and two biases caused by test specimen preparation and polishing machine. Further investigation carried out on machine parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that narrowing the tolerance on flour emery flow rate should mitigate the machine bias. The results also evidence a higher scattering for low PSV aggregates, and PCA shows that this relates to their higher sensitivity to wheel speed variability not {{accounted for by the}} PSV control stone correcting factor. Besides, the results suggest enlarging the validity range of residual friction measured on PSV control stone prescribed by European standard EN 1097 - 8 : 2009, and they raise issues relating to test specimen preparation. Eventually, results and suggestions of the present study will be implemented in the ongoing revision of EN 1097 - 8 : 2009...|$|E
40|$|The skid {{resistance}} performance of surface aggregates {{can be assessed}} in the laboratory by using a polishing device {{that is designed to}} simulate traffic polishing actions coupled with a {{skid resistance}} measuring device. The standard laboratory test has historically been the <b>Polished</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>Value</b> (<b>PSV)</b> test as specified in BS EN 1097 - 8 : 2009. However, as the technology has advanced and traffic volume and composition on our roads have changed, other devices and methodologies have been developed in an attempt to better assess the skid resistance performance of surface aggregates. This paper discusses the usage of two alternative laboratory tests, the Auckland Pavement Polishing Device (APPD) and the Wehner/Schulze (WS) devices, to assess the skid resistance performance of three different New Zealand Greywacke aggregates. The paper discusses the variations in APPD and its corresponding skid resistance measuring device, the Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT) and the effect of macrotexture in the APPD-DFT test. The results show that there is a good relationship between the APPD-DFT and the PSV tests, while there is no relationship between the WS and the PSV tests. However, the APPD and the WS tests correlate very well. There are only three Greywacke aggregates used in this research, and hence, no conclusive results can be drawn on the relationship between these laboratory tests as yet...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Effect of {{aeolian sand}} on the skid {{resistance}} of AC- 13 and SMA- 13 asphalt pavements was investigated by characterization of skid resistance value and structural {{depth of the}} asphalt mixture before and after accelerated wearing. The results indicate that when the aeolian sand cover is less than 1. 0 kg/m 2, the aeolian sand affects the skid resistance of AC- 13 and SMA- 13 asphalt pavements similarly. However, when the aeolian sand cover exceeds 1. 0 kg/m 2, the aeolian sand affects the skid resistance of AC- 13 asphalt pavement more significantly than that of SMA- 13 asphalt pavement. With the aeolian sand cover increasing from 1. 0 kg/m 2 to 1. 5 kg/m 2, the skid resistance value declines from 53 to 40 and the declining rate is up to 30 %. The <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> <b>value</b> testing of coarse aggregate before and after accelerated wearing shows that the asphalt mixture with the gradation of AC- 13 exhibits a bigger <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> <b>value</b> changing of coarse aggregate, which confirms that the aeolian sand affects the skid resistance of AC- 13 asphalt mixture more significantly.

40|$|The skid {{resistance}} of pavements tends to decrease over time, resulting in greater risks for drivers. Currently, {{skid resistance}} and macrotexture values {{can only be}} determined for existing pavements. It would {{be of interest to}} be able to predict the evolution of the skid resistance of an asphalt mixture before its installation as a highway wearing course. This paper summarizes the experience gained and the results obtained during the development of a test procedure which has been applied in the laboratory to measure the evolution of the skid resistance of hot mix asphalts through a modified version of an accelerated polishing machine which is normally used to determine the <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> <b>value</b> of aggregates...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a Louisiana pavement surface friction guideline that considers <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> <b>value</b> (<b>PSV)</b> and mixture type alike in terms of both micro- and macro- surface textures. The polishing and texture properties of aggregates were characterized using the British Pendulum, Micro-Deval and Aggregate Imaging System (AIMS). Asphalt mixture slabs were fabricated with different combinations of two aggregate sources (sandstone and limestone) and four mixture types and polished by a three-wheel accelerated polishing device developed by the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT). The surface frictional characteristics of each slab were measured by Dynamic Fiction tester (DFT) and Circular Texture Meter (CTM) at various pre-determined polishing cycles. In addition, an inventory dataset of field friction number (FN) measurements was obtained from the LADOTD’s Materials Laboratory and analyzed in this study to determine the effects of traffic loading, aggregate and mixture types on the measured FN values. The laboratory results indicated that the accelerated polishing device used in this study performed just as the expectation; i. e., as the polishing cycle increases, the measured frictional property of testing slab surface decreases. It was found that the DFT measurements were fairly sensitive to the coarse aggregate types (related to micro-texture) used in mix design, but were not very sensitive to different mix types or aggregate gradations (related to macrotexture) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{undertaken}} to help predict infield long-term skid resistance performance. The <b>Polished</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>Value</b> (<b>PSV)</b> test is the oldest and the most common test used worldwide to rank the skid resistance performance of road surfaces. Due to certain limitations of the PSV test, other laboratory test methodologies have been developed as potential alternatives. One of the limitations of the PSV test is that it only provides end of test results, whereas it is desirable to observe the skid resistance deterioration trend during the polishing process, in particular for research applications. This paper discusses the application of a mathematical model, originally developed for asphaltic concrete surfaces, to predict the skid resistance deterioration trend under polishing for a range of New Zealand chip seal aggregates. A laboratory skid resistance testing device, known as the Wehner/Schulze device, was used for this study since the model was originally derived based on test results obtained using this type of device. It was found that the model was capable of replicating the skid resistance deterioration trend under laboratory polishing of the chip seal aggregates used in this research. It was also found that the model coefficients were dependent on aggregate geological types, and thus suggested that a set of coefficients obtained for a specific aggregate source may be able to provide information on infield skid resistance performance of that specific aggregate type, if the model is found to be capable of replicating skid resistance deterioration trends in the field as well. As part of future research, the model will be calibrated against infield skid resistance...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the long term performance of the selected surface friction treatments, including high friction surface treatment (HFST) using calcined bauxite and steel slag, and conventional friction surfacing, in particular pavement preservation treatments such as chip seal, microsurfacing, ultrathin bonded wearing course (UBWC), and diamond grinding. This study also attempted to determine the correlation between vehicle crash and pavement surface friction, which {{makes it possible to}} quantitatively establish the so-called crash modification factors (CMFs) that are extremely useful in selecting a cost-effective solution to reduce wet pavement vehicle crashes. In-depth reviews were conducted to identify the aspects of the properties for aggregates used in HFST, including aggregate abrasion value (AAV), Los Angeles abrasion (LAA), Micro-Deval abrasion, and <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> <b>value</b> (<b>PSV).</b> Extensive laboratory testing was conducted to examine the LAA, Micro-Deval abrasion, and PSV, and to provide first-hand data on the calcined bauxite and steel slag that may be used for HFST and friction surfacing in Indiana. Laboratory accelerating polishing was carried out {{to evaluate the}} effect of aggregate gradation and identify the HFST systems with satisfactory friction performance with respect to surface macro-texture and friction. Test strips were installed in the pavement on a real-world road to further evaluate the friction performances of the promising HFST systems under the true traffic polishing and assess the potential effect of winter and snow plough. Pull-off testing was also conducted to examine the bonding between the proposed HFST systems and the substrate surface. Field friction test data was utilized to evaluate the long-term friction performances of pavement preservation treatments, including chip seal, microsurfacing, UBWC, and diamond grinding. Statewide vehicle crash data between 2010 and 2014 was examined to determine the crash statistics associated with pavement friction. The crash data was also matched to the annual pavement inventory friction data to quantify the probabilistic association between vehicle crash and pavement friction with respect to interstate, US, and state highways, respectively. Specification requirements were established for the properties of calcined bauxite and steel slag for HFST and friction surfacing with respect to LAA, Micro-Deval abrasion, PSV, Al 2 O 3 content, and fine aggregate angularity (FAA). Specification requirements were also developed for HFST aggregate gradation and surface friction performance. Regression models were developed for predicting the friction numbers of chip seal, microsurfacing, UBWC, and diamond grinding over their service lives. Regression models were also provided to quantify the effectiveness of friction surfacing for interstate, US, and state highways, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Air-cooled (AC) nickel slag is {{evaluated}} for highway construction applications as an aggregate in hot-mix asphalt (HMA). The AC nickel slag is a liquid coproduct of nickel production that is solidified under ambient conditions. The laboratory evaluation program, which {{was carried out}} to determine {{the characteristics of the}} AC nickel slag, included physical and mechanical properties testing, petrographic examinations, and HMA mixture designs. Accelerated laboratory testing was completed on the mixtures by using an asphalt pavement analyzer to assess their performance characteristics. Additional testing included autoclave disruption tests for free lime and free magnesia, chemical and mineralogical analyses, <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> <b>value,</b> and aggregate abrasion value. This study indicated that suitably processed nickel slag was environmentally, mineralogically, and physically stable.

40|$|Skid {{resistance}} {{is a condition}} parameter that characterizes the contribution that a road surface makes {{to the level of}} friction available at the contact patch between a road surface and vehicle tire during acceleration, breaking and cornering manoeuvres. The surface texture and the surface course properties affect the roughness (microtexture, macrotexture and megatexture) which is influenced by traffic, weather and the environment. Some statistics data indicate that the number of accidents increases by up to two folds during rainy conditions. The <b>PSV</b> <b>value</b> of the aggregates used is a significant but not the sole influencing factor. The <b>Polished</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>Value</b> is determined under standard laboratory conditions and indicates to which extent an aggregate is resistant to polishing under the action of traffic. Skid resistance changes over time. Typically it increases {{in the first two years}} following construction as the roadway is worn away by traffic and rough aggregate surfaces become exposed, and then decreases over the remaining pavement life as aggregates become more polished. In the present study, skid resistance and aggregate polishing value were conducted under varying bitumen content and using fillers materials like cement, fly ash. Texture depth is also a direct measure of area of contacts between tire and HMA surface so it also has the direct effect on pavement surface skidding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Research {{has clearly}} shown {{that as the}} skid {{resistance}} of a road surface decreases, the road-based transport crash rate increases. In recognizing the importance of providing safe pavement surfacings for travel during wet weather, most highway controlling authorities in developed countries have skid resistance standards. However, recent {{research has demonstrated that}} there is significant variation in performance between natural aggregates where supposedly high-quality surfacing aggregates (as measured by the <b>Polished</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>Value</b> Test) have not performed well or predictably over an economic asset life in areas of high demand for friction. A comparison is made between the performance of six natural aggregates (greywackes, felsic volcanic rocks and basalts) used in New Zealand as road surfacing dressing. The comparison includes surface friction test results of prepared samples that have undergone accelerated polishing using a new laboratory test method. The coefficient of friction is measured at various stages of polishing by the Dynamic Friction Tester. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs show the characteristics of the microtexture of the aggregate surface before and after accelerated polishing, correlating the degree of surface polishing to the measured skid resistance performance and relating this to the aggregate mineralogy, grain size, and degree of lithification and diagenesis. Wet pavement crashes continue to be a major concern o...|$|R
40|$|The {{waste of}} the {{production}} of steel are ordinarily used in asphalt concrete pavements. The by-product named slag, whose chemical properties are similar to effusive rocks, is transformed into course aggregates. It is used for bituminous surfacing as a valuable replacement to natural aggregates, which are becoming increasingly rare. Moreover, the wearing coarse made with this material maintain good values of micro-texture, even after {{the action of the}} traffic loads for a long time. This technique is used on the road network of Friuli Venezia Giulia since many years. The study has the main purpose to identify a decay curve (deterioration) of the indicators of friction with the number of passing accumulated of vehicles over the years. The indicator monitored is the micro-texture indirectly assessed by measures of BPN. The sections of the measures have been carefully chosen, so as to be homogeneous for the geometric characteristics of the axis, for organization of the cross section and type of the wearing course. The measures BPN regarding more points in the same section. In particular on the wheel paths and the shoulders not affected by the traffic.

40|$|The {{primary road}} surface {{characteristics}} that affect users are safety, noise and riding quality. Safety particularly relates to surface texture (macro texture), which infl u-ences water dispersal and {{ability of a}} tire to contact the road surface. This paper deals mainly with texture depth contribution to tire pavement contact. A slab mould was designed and built specifi cally of SMA to conduct skid and texture depth tests to simulate the actual fi eld behavior. A stepwise regression analysis was used, to indicate the separate and distinct effect of several aggregate factors such as angularity, type of aggregate, percent of asphalt voids in the mix, density, <b>Polished</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>Value,</b> Particle Index, Surface area, on the skid resistance of the experimental surface mixtures.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} investigate the properties of aggregate with a new cement coating applied, and to test the effect of including this aggregate in a bituminous road mixture. The investigation was divided into three main areas of study. They were, chemical and physical testing of the aggregate, and testing of a bituminous road mixture containing the modified aggregate, namely porous asphalt wearing course. Chemical testing involved a regime to show the affinity between coated and uncoated aggregates, and bitumen, in terms of adsorption, and desorption {{in the presence of}} water. Physical testing included all the common tests for demonstrating the advantageous properties of an aggregate. These tests included, the shear box test, the <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> <b>value</b> test, the aggregate crushing value test and tests for surface roughness. Porous asphalt was chosen as a suitable road material for testing the effects of the modified aggregate on a bituminous material, as it is a stone matrix dependant mixture and is currently enjoying increased acceptance Europe wide as a driver friendly, high quality surfacing material. Tests applied included the repeat load axial, and the repeat load indirect tensile tests. In order to undertake large parts of the testing program, much of the equipment was constructed by the researcher at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU). This included the shear box apparatus and the repeat load axial test apparatus. These were both designed to the relevant British standards and verified as being so. Observations made during the testing programme showed the coated aggregates displayed a useful improvement in their chemical and physical properties over uncoated aggregates in almost all the areas tested. Future recommendations include mass production prototyping so that the coated aggregate mixtures can be placed in road trial sections...|$|R
