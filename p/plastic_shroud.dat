5000|$|The 98 Custom Flatline barrel must be {{re-adjusted}} {{for accuracy}} whenever it is removed and reinstalled. Therefore, it's {{a good idea}} to [...] "mark" [...] where the barrel is aligned for reinstallment. The barrel is surrounded by a <b>plastic</b> <b>shroud</b> that hides the curved barrel and integrates a sight system replacing the marker sight, this is required as the barrel curves above the markers normal sight system. The shroud also have a picatinny rail for mounting accessories that attach onto a rail system.|$|E
5000|$|A {{crocodile}} clip (also alligator clip or spring clip) is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws {{which is used}} for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets {{its name from the}} resemblance of its jaws to that of an alligator's or crocodile's. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded clothespin, the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a spring to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4 mm female banana jack, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit. The clip is typically covered by a <b>plastic</b> <b>shroud</b> or [...] "boot" [...] to prevent accidental short-circuits.|$|E
50|$|For example, many modem, network, and TV cards {{accept this}} configuration. Due to their thinness, most Type II {{interface}} cards feature miniature interface connectors {{on the card}} connecting to a dongle, a short cable that adapts from the card's miniature connector to an external full-size connector. Some cards instead have a lump on the end with the connectors. This is more robust and convenient than a separate adapter but can block the other slot where slots are present in a pair. Some Type II cards, most notably network interface and modem cards, have a retractable jack, which can be pushed into the card and will pop out when needed, allowing insertion of a cable from above. When use of the card is no longer needed, the jack can be pushed back into the card and locked in place, protecting it from damage. Most network cards have their jack on one side, while most modems have their jack on the other side, allowing the use of {{both at the same}} time as they do not interfere with each other. Wireless Type II cards often had a <b>plastic</b> <b>shroud</b> that jutted out from the end of the card to house the antenna.|$|E
5000|$|The C20LET {{engine was}} {{introduced}} in 1992, and was fitted to the Opel/Vauxhall Vectra Turbo/Cavalier Turbo, Calibra Turbo, and the South African made Opel Astra 200t S. It {{is similar to the}} C20XE, apart from the primary addition of a KKK-16 turbocharger, forged Mahle pistons, Bosch Motronic M2.7 electronic engine control unit, and black <b>plastic</b> plenum/'top hat' <b>shroud</b> with a 'turbo' script. It produces a DIN rated output of , and generates 280 Nm of torque. Boost pressure is [...] continuous with a [...] overboost.|$|R
5000|$|Essentially a re-styled Triumph Bonneville, the [...] "West Coast" [...] styled TSX was {{distinguished}} by its lowered chassis and 16 in rear wheel {{with the engine}} off-set in the frame to accommodate this. Other changes, whilst unique to the model, were cosmetic including stepped seat, black finished engine with polished fins, re-styled passenger grabrail, shortened front and rear painted mudguards, the latter having a black plastic extension for the larger UK vehicle numberplate, chromed shorty megaphone exhausts with the crossover pipe hidden between them under the bike and flowing thru 1.75" [...] pipes, Morris alloy wheels (then made by Performance Machine) and 'retro' stick on graphics outlined in the usual gold hand pinstriping. Paioli rear suspension units, with <b>plastic</b> top <b>shrouds,</b> were sited at a more acute angle further back on the swinging arm to lower the seat height. A slightly lower rise and wider USA style handlebar was fitted and chromed Lucas turn indicators returned {{in place of the}} black plastic ULO items that had replaced them on other Triumph models from 1981. A chromed wire mounted Lucas headlamp with sealed beam was changed to the Lucas H4 early in the production run. A Brembo rear brake master cylinder was fitted in place of the usual Automotive Products (AP) Lockheed item which remained for the front, as well as supplying both calipers. Dual front discs were an option. Whilst the 1982-1983 brochure showed Goodyear Eagle tyres fitted, an Avon Roadrunner rear and Speedmaster front tyre went on production models, the tyres' lettering picked out in white. Although the German magazine Motorad road-tested a kick start-only version, the kickstart was an optional extra on the production TSX. The standard TSX engine was a T140ES (electric start) [...] with two 32-mm Bing carburettors and electronic ignition. The engine was offset to accommodate the fatter rear tyre within the frame which also necessitated a unique swingarm and abbreviated chromed chainguard. The engine also benefitted from an updated crank with more careful machining; the result being greatly reduced vibration. The TSX fuel tank was a unique design for the model having only one Paioli left hand petrol tap situated ahead to accommodate the larger Bing carburettors. This tank also had a centralised filler hole with optional locking cap and a balance pipe situated {{on the front of the}} tank's underside.|$|R

40|$|Nurses' {{experiences}} with post-mortem care and death were diverse and represented {{a confluence of}} factors. Nurses' personalities, religious beliefs, cultural value systems, customs, life experiences, and the unit's orientation all converged and influenced their attitudes toward death. Culture and the unit's orientation exerted the strongest influence on nurses' attitudes. Exposure to dying was the most influential factor in determining attitudes toward death and dying, with palliative care nurses being most comfortable in dealing with death. Cultural differences also emerged, with Canadian and Israeli nurses entertaining divergent attitudes toward death, spirituality and post-mortem care. Death was conceptualised by some nurses {{as the end of}} an organism, and by others as the beginning of another form of existence. Post-mortem care was reported as an emotionally demanding task, yet most Canadian nurses considered the experience rewarding. The wrapping of the body in a <b>plastic</b> <b>shroud</b> and the covering of the face was the aspect nurses disliked the most; they felt it was repugnant, dehumanising and disrespectful...|$|E
40|$|Stoats (Mustela erminea) {{and ship}} rats (Rattus rattus) in New Zealand are {{targeted}} by trapping to mitigate their predation on native wildlife. Internationally recognized guidelines {{for assessing the}} effectiveness and welfare performance of kill traps are supported by New Zealand legislation under the Animal Welfare Act 1999. The Victor® Easy Set® rat trap was tested and passed a similar standard for killing short-tailed weasels in Canada but failed for stoats when tested in New Zealand in 2002 (short-tailed weasels and stoats are the same species). We tested {{a modified version of}} the trap in 2011 - 12, modified by changing the treadle trigger to a pull trigger and adding a <b>plastic</b> <b>shroud</b> to direct and align approach by animals to the front of the trap. These traps, in vertical and horizontal sets, were tested with both stoats and ship rats. During each test the trap had to render 10 of 10 animals irreversibly unconscious within 3 minutes to meet approval requirements. The modified trap passed with both species in both trap sets. All stoats were struck across the cranium whereas rats were struck either on the cranium or neck. We recommend this trap design for use by community conservation groups for targeting stoats and ship rats in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{concerns}} {{the effect of}} the test configuration on the noise generated by axial flow fans employed for automotive cooling systems. During the development of a fan, a number of noise tests are usually taken on different configurations, whose characteristics depend on the design step. Often, significant discrepancies are observed between the results of different tests, resulting in difficulties in transferring and generalizing the measured SPL level spectra. Such differences regard both the broad band noise and the tonal one. In the present paper the effects of the following aspects are considered: the rotor balancing method, the geometrical tolerances, the rotor mounting system on simplified configurations (with and without downstream stator) and the production configuration (a stationary <b>plastic</b> <b>shroud)</b> without heat exchangers. The balancing method affects the high frequency part of the SPL spectrum, due to the broad band noise, while the mounting system may affect the OASPL and the low frequency part of the SPL spectrum, due to the tonal noise. The geometrical tolerances do not affect the generated noise. Nomenclature Dhub = rotor hub diameter Dtip = rotating shroud internal diameter f = frequency [Hz] OASPL = overall sound pressure level (linear, ref. 20 μPa) [dB] Q = volume flow rate SPL = sound pressure level (ref. 20 μPa) [dB] St = Strouhal number based on the rotational frequency zP = number of poles of the production electric motor zR = rotor blade number zS = stator vane number α = exponent in the scaling of the SPL with Ω Δp = static pressure rise (outlet static pressure minus the ambient pressure) Ω = rotational speed [r/min] I...|$|E
