5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|The lungs of {{lungfish}} {{are similar}} to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal septa. In the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> with the connecting duct curving around and above the esophagus. The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> as in other vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Another legend narrated {{is linked}} to the six Khmer bronze statues (three lionsâ€“with heads {{substituted}} later in Burmese style, a three-headed elephant known as Airavata, and two warriors in the form of Shiva), which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard. These statues were originally at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the ventral {{scales of}} the snake is an anal plate that protects the opening to the cloaca (a shared opening for waste and {{reproductive}} material to pass) on the underside near the tail.

5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend {{to the front and}} back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, the underwire of a girl's bra {{helped save}} her life when she was impaled on a railing and, {{according}} to hospital personnel, the underwire from her bra probably helped deflect the spike from her heart. There have been multiple incidents where bullets were deflected by the underwire of a woman's bra, either keeping her entirely from harm, or directing the bullet away from the heart to another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Since bubbles {{can form}} in or migrate to any <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> DCS can produce many symptoms, {{and its effects}} may vary from joint pain and rashes to {{paralysis}} and death.

5|$|The {{forewings}} of beetles are {{not used}} for flight, but form elytra which cover the hind <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and protect the hindwings. The elytra are usually hard shell-like structures which must be raised to allow the hind wings to move for flight. However, in the soldier beetles (Cantharidae), the elytra are soft, earning this family the name of leatherwings. Other soft wing beetles include the net-winged beetle Calopteron discrepans, which has brittle wings that rupture easily in order to release chemicals for defence.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal.
