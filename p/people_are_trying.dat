25|$|Kat visits Stacey for Christmas and {{discovers that}} Martin is not Arthur's father, urging Stacey {{to tell him}} the truth. As Stacey is about to do so, Kyle {{approaches}} her and formally introduces himself to her as her half-brother. After overhearing Kat talk to someone about a baby being stolen, Stacey fears for Arthur's safety and takes refuge in the church, where Dot Branning (June Brown), who has been teaching her about Christianity, finds her and tells her the story of the Massacre of the Innocents, causing Stacey to believe that Arthur is in danger. Believing <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to harm Arthur, Stacey unsuccessfully attempts to baptise Arthur through Dot's sink. She discovers that Charlie has died, so flees and meets Kyle, asking him to run away with her. Martin calls her, claiming that Kyle is not who he says he is and Stacey accuses Kyle of being the devil. She takes a cab and sees a vision of Charlie driving it, and he convinces her to return home to Walford. During a storm she goes to the roof of The Queen Victoria public house, saying that God is coming for Arthur. Martin finds her there and she tells him that Arthur was sent from God and now she is waiting for God to rescue them. Martin is forced to go along with this and convinces her to come home with him.|$|E

The {{production}} team attempted to find locations [...] "that people haven't already seen a hundred times in movies and on TV", aiming for the film to appear {{as if it could}} be taking place anywhere in America [...] "where <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to pursue the American dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss." [...] "Comnidyine" [...] was represented by an office building in Torrance, California, with the crew building the set on a vacant floor. For [...] "Pellitt Chemical", the production team found a [...] "perfect landscape of pipes and containers" [...] in Santa Fe Springs, surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility. To take advantage of the surrounding imagery, the warehouse required an extensive series of overhauls, including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new doorways to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of Sutherland's character. A T.G.I. Friday's in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, was used as a bar frequented by Nick, Dale, and Kurt, while the bar scene where they meet with Jones was staged in downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to get together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're going to survive it themselves. The one thing they have got to cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into something terrible, it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song coming out of that environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was just what the song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never bothered me, changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single.

These included voting cards contained in envelopes with the Catalan government's logo. The next day, the Civil Guard raided Generalitat offices and arrested fourteen senior officials from the Catalan government—most notably, these included , deputy to regional Vice-President Oriol Junqueras. This came after mayors from towns supporting the referendum were questioned in court by state prosecutors. Regional premier Carles Puigdemont condemned the actions as [...] "anti-democratic and totalitarian", accusing the Spanish government of 'de facto' imposing {{a state of emergency}} and of suspending Catalonia's autonomy after it took effective control over Catalan finances. Public protests occurred in Barcelona after news of the arrests emerged, with left-wing political party Podemos and Barcelona mayor Ada Colau joining the growing criticism of Mariano Rajoy's government crackdown on public servants, dubbing it as an [...] "authoritarian regression". The previous day, the Congress of Deputies had voted down a motion from Ciudadanos to support the Spanish government's response to the referendum, which was rejected by 166 votes to 158.
