5|$|The statue has {{required}} repair work {{on several occasions}} to fix damage and defects. Only {{a few months after}} it was installed, it was reported to be oscillating in strong gusts of wind. Marochetti <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> sound but promised to strengthen the legs if necessary. During the winter of 1908–09, frost damaged one of the forelegs of the horse part of the statue. It was found that between 60–80 leaks were letting water into the interior of the statue and causing further damage when it froze. It was also discovered that the statue had never been properly attached to the pedestal but was merely resting under its own weight on the two ends of its base. Repair work took place to remedy these problems.|$|E
25|$|The letter n {{in the end}} of the syllables is not <b>pronounced,</b> <b>it</b> only {{indicates}} the nasality of the preceding vowel.|$|E
25|$|Parma was in {{a hopeless}} {{situation}} - to cross the river was {{the only means of}} retreat; and although Mayenne, and the most experienced officers in the army, <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> impracticable, Parma resolved to attempt a retreat.|$|E

25|$|The Star of David {{is used in}} {{the seal}} and the emblem of the Theosophical Society (founded in 1875). Although it is more <b>pronounced,</b> <b>it</b> is used along with other {{religious}} symbols. These include the Swastika, the Ankh, the Aum, and the Ouroboros. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{subdivision}} of West Central German into {{a series}} of dialects, according to the differing extent of the phase 1 shifts, is particularly <b>pronounced.</b> <b>It</b> known as the Rhenish fan (German: Rheinischer Fächer, Dutch: Rijnlandse waaier) because on the map of dialect boundaries, the lines form a fan shape. Here, no fewer than eight isoglosses run roughly West to East and partially merge into a simpler system of boundaries in East Central German. The table on the right lists the isoglosses (bold) and the main resulting dialects (italics), arranged from north to south.|$|E
25|$|Technically, Dipag and Tulwanan {{were two}} {{different}} settlements {{at that time}} with the former composed of Boholano natives and the latter mostly of Subanen ancestry. When the friar returned to Dapitan, he identified {{the location of the}} larger Boholano settlement as Dipag but was not officially written. Frequent conversations by the Spaniards <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> in Spanish accent Dipolog which was eventually adopted by the natives. The final political survey surprisingly added the letter 'L' written on it after officially becoming a barrio of Dapitan. From that time Tulwanan's political identity ceased to exist.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} a sukkah {{can be no}} more than 20 cubits high. Rabbi Judah, however, {{declared}} taller sukkot valid. The Mishnah taught that a sukkah must be at least 10 handbreadths high, have three walls, and have more shade than sun. The House of Shammai declared invalid a sukkah made 30 days or more before the festival, but the House of Hillel <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> valid. The Mishnah taught that if one made the sukkah for the purpose of the festival, even {{at the beginning of the}} year, it is valid.|$|E
25|$|Mosby had {{his closest}} brush with death on December 21, 1864, near Rector's Crossroads in Virginia. While dining {{with a local}} family, Mosby was fired on through a window, and the ball entered his abdomen two inches below the navel. He managed to stagger {{into the bedroom and}} hide his coat, which had his only {{insignia}} of rank. The commander of the Union detachment, Maj. Douglas Frazar of the 13th New York Cavalry, entered the house and—not knowing Mosby's identity—inspected the wound and <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> mortal. Although left for dead, Mosby recovered and returned to the war effort once again two months later.|$|E
25|$|Rwandan coffee {{began to}} gain {{importance}} after international taste tests <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> {{among the best}} in the world, and the U.S. responded with a contribution of 8 million dollars. Rwanda now earns some revenue from coffee and tea export, although it has been difficult to compete with larger coffee-producing countries. The main source of revenue, however, is tourism, mainly mountain gorilla visitation. Their other parks, Nyungwe Forest (one of the last high-altitude tropical forests in the world) and Akagera National Park (a safari game park) have also become popular on the tourism circuit. The lakeside resorts of Gisenyi and Kibuye are also gaining ground.|$|E

2500|$|Tries {{were first}} {{described}} by René de la Briandais in 1959.

However, other authors <b>pronounce</b> <b>it</b> [...] (as [...] "try"), {{in an attempt to}} distinguish it verbally from [...] "tree".|$|R
25|$|The {{whole of}} the road which is now completed, and which {{is known as the}} No. 1 Section, is about {{a mile and a half}} in length. The other day, the Government inspector, Colonel Majendi, went over the line, and having <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> to be satisfactory, a {{certificate}} is expected to arrive in a day or two As this is the district from which most of the traffic is expected to come, cars, capable of carrying out-side as well as inside passengers will in all probability be used in the future, though at present the eight vehicles provided are for inside passengers only. The line is double all the way, and the traffic which is expected will render the running practically continuous. The fare will be twopence all the way.|$|E

500|$|The Queen Mother died in 2002. Three years later, Seidler {{returned}} to the story during a bout of creative work inspired by a recovery from cancer. His research, including a chance encounter with an uncle whom Logue had treated, indicated he used mechanical breathing exercises combined with psychological counselling to probe {{the underlying causes of}} the condition. Thus prepared, Seidler imagined the sessions. He showed the finished screenplay to his wife, who liked it, but <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> too [...] "seduced by cinematic technique". She suggested he rewrite it as a stage play to focus on the essential relationship between the King and Logue. After he had completed it, he sent it to a few friends who worked in theatre in London and New York for feedback.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} neologisms that {{originated}} on The Simpsons have entered popular vernacular. Mark Liberman, {{director of the}} Linguistic Data Consortium, remarked, [...] "The Simpsons has apparently taken over from Shakespeare and the Bible as our culture's greatest source of idioms, catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions." [...] The most famous catchphrase is Homer's annoyed grunt: [...] "D'oh!" [...] So ubiquitous is the expression {{that it is now}} listed in the Oxford English Dictionary, but without the apostrophe. Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from James Finlayson, an actor in many Laurel and Hardy comedies, who <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> in a more elongated and whining tone. The staff of The Simpsons told Castellaneta to shorten the noise, and it {{went on to become the}} well-known exclamation in the television series.|$|E
500|$|Designer Nomura {{said that}} he wanted Tidus' {{clothing}} and accessories to suggest {{a relationship with the}} sea. Tidus' clothing has a distinctive blue motif; his blitzball team logo, based on a fish hook, is an amalgam of the letters [...] "J" [...] and [...] "T" [...] (the first letters of Tidus' name and that of his father, Jecht). Because a player can change Tidus' name, the character is not referred to by name in audible dialogue; however, a character in Dream Zanarkand uses Tidus' name in a dialogue box. The only other in-game appearance of his name is [...] "Tidu" [...] in Spiran script on the nameplate of an Auroch locker in the Luca stadium. Before Final Fantasy Xs release, Tidus was known to the media as Tida. In early 2001, PlayOnline changed the character's name to [...] "Tidus". Because his name is never spoken in Final Fantasy X, its intended pronunciation has been debated. Interviews with James Arnold Taylor and spoken dialogue in the English versions of Dissidia Final Fantasy, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts (with cameo appearances by the character) indicate that it is pronounced [...] (...) in the English version of Kingdom Hearts II, Tidus' name is pronounced [...] (...) [...] According to Taylor, it was pronounced (...) during the localization of Final Fantasy X because the narrator of an early English trailer <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> that way.|$|E

500|$|The Elegance of the Hedgehog {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. In {{the earliest known}} review, for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Maurizio Bono writes that [...] "he formula that made {{more than half a}} million readers in France fall in love with [...] has, among other ingredients: intelligent humor, fine sentiments, an excellent literary and philosophical backdrop, taste that is sophisticated but substantial". French magazine Elle reviewer Natalie Aspesi <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> one of [...] "the most exhilarating and extraordinary novels in recent years". Aspesi, however, tagged the novel's title as [...] "most curious and least appealing". Praising the novel in his review for The Guardian, Ian Samson wrote that [...] "The Elegance of the Hedgehog aspires to be great and pretends to philosophy: it is, at least, charming." [...] In an earlier review in the same paper, Groskop opined that the novel is a [...] "profound but accessible book... which elegantly treads the line between literary and commercial fiction". She added that [...] "clever, informative and moving, it is essentially a crash course in philosophy interwoven with a platonic love story". A review in The Telegraph conjectured that [...] "f [...] a piece of furniture, it would be an Ikea bestseller: popular, but not likely to be passed down the generations". A review in The Times Literary Supplement went further, calling the book [...] "pretentious and cynical, with barely any story. It reads more like a tract than a novel, but lacks even a tract’s certainty of purpose. The characters are problematic: most are puppets, and those that aren’t are stereotypes".|$|E
500|$|In the 1938 season, {{his first}} as an amateur, Hammond scored 3,011 runs {{at an average}} of 75.27. During the season, he was elected to life {{membership}} of Gloucestershire and membership of the M.C.C., which barred professionals. He captained the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's—having previously led the Players, he is the only person to skipper both teams. Early in the season, he led England in a Test trial before, as expected, being given the role full-time against Australia. His leadership during the series, which was drawn 1–1, won him praise. He was criticised, however, for his handling of bowlers, specifically for not giving enough work to spinners Hedley Verity in the first Test or Doug Wright in the fourth. In the second Test, he scored 240, briefly a record for an England batsman playing at home, to rescue the side from a poor start. This innings was lauded by observers including Warner, Bradman and Cardus, and The Times correspondent <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> one of the best ever. [...] The match, like the first, was drawn and with the third Test completely washed out by rain, the crucial match proved to be the fourth. In a low-scoring game, Hammond scored 76, holding England's first innings together. In the second innings, however, he made a first-ball duck; an English batting collapse allowed Australia to win the match and retain the Ashes. England had some consolation with a massive victory in the final Test; following Hammond's instructions to be cautious, the side slowly amassed a record total of 903 for seven, with Hutton beating Hammond's Test record innings by scoring 364. Hammond scored 59, giving him 403 runs {{at an average of}} 67.16 in the series.|$|E
500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so <b>pronounced</b> <b>it</b> gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the parent of a child throwing a tantrum. People who have been in this business for a long time are watching what's happening, and they say there hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do everything in our power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've never seen this as far as availability for any show. It's never been that hard to get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E
