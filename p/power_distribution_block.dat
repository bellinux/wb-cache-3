The hardware simulation of the proposed concept is realized using the solar panel (12. 5 V, 180 mA), two relays SRD- 05 VDC-SL-C, buck (DC/DC YEC SD 200) and buck/boost (DC/DC Tusotek TS-IPS-VO 2) converters, and two small power banks (first one is to supply the consumption part simulated by Arduino Uno with LED, second one is to supply the smart <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>block).</b> The hardware was tested successfully in three regimes: the charge of battery by the solar panel, the power supply of the Arduino Uno board with LED using the power bank or solar panel.

40|$|Abstract — A {{two-phase}} <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> {{scheme for}} supporting quality-of-service (QoS) and best effort traffic is proposed. We first formulate the <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> for QoS traffic as an optimization problem {{so that the}} number of simultaneously transmitting connections is maximized. Optimum <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> is difficult to implement in practice due to both the computational complexity and the requirement for global information about the mobile station (MS) locations, connection channel conditions, and traffic load in the system. We then propose a heuristic scheme of <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> for soft handoff (SHO) connections. The full scheme includes an initial <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> (IPD) and a <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> adjustment (PDA). IPD allocates BS power resource based on the channel condition of each individual connection, while PDA further coordinates the <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> between neighboring base stations (BSs) in order to accommodate more connections. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme can achieve a capacity close to that of the optimum <b>power</b> <b>distribution,</b> while providing much higher transmission throughput for best effort data traffic. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme can be applied to existing SHO schemes for efficient BS power resource usage. The scheme does not require global information, and its implementation can be further simplified by performing IPD only with slight performance degradation.

Two types of interdigitated and paired <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids {{with multiple}} supply voltages and multiple grounds are presented.

Two proposed schemes, fully and pseudo-interdigitated power delivery, reduce power supply voltage drops as compared to conventional interdigitated <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> systems with dual supplies and a single ground by, on average, 15. 3 % and 0. 3 %, respectively. The performance of the proposed on-chip <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids is compared to a reference <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grid with a single supply and a single ground.

Each grid layer within a multilayer <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grid typically has significantly different electrical properties.
