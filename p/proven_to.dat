40|$|Abstract. A {{constructive}} {{proof of}} the Gödel-Rosser incompleteness theorem [9] has been completed using the Coq proof assistant. Some theory of classical first-order logic over an arbitrary language is formalized. A development of primitive recursive functions is given, and all primitive recursive functions are <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be representable in a weak axiom system. Formulas and proofs are encoded as natural numbers, and functions operating on these codes are <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be primitive recursive. The weak axiom system is <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be essentially incomplete. In particular, Peano arithmetic is <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be consistent in Coq’s type theory and therefore is incomplete. ...|$|R

5|$|Cetiosauriscus longus: In 1990, John Stanton McIntosh {{recombined}} Cetiosaurus longus as {{a species}} of Cetiosauriscus. This classification is not accepted and Cetiosauriscus longus is a junior objective synonym of Cetiosaurus longus because it cannot be <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> possess any characteristic autapomorphies of Cetiosauriscus. In 1993, Charig found the species to be a nomen dubium.|$|E

It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be unpopular.|$|E
