Introduction. A long-standing problem in fluid mechanics is understanding the transitions from laminar to turbulent flow. This problem has been studied in many specific cases. Plane Couette flow, the case of interest in this paper, is the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid between infinite <b>parallel</b> <b>shearing</b> plates. Experimentally, plane Couette flow sustains turbulence for large enough Reynolds number (Re ? Re t = 1440 Σ 40) (see [7]). For Reynolds numbers less than the transition number (Re !

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the Hadamard {{instability}} of the so-called μ(I) model of dense rapidly-sheared granular flow, as reported recently by Barker et al. (2015,this journal, 779, 794 - 818). The present paper presents a more comprehensive study of the linear stability of planar simple shearing and pure shearing flows, with account taken of convective Kelvin wave-vector stretching by the base flow. We provide a closed form solution for the linear stability problem and show that wave-vector stretching leads to asymptotic stabilization of the non-convective instability found by Barker et al. We also explore the stabilizing effects of higher velocity gradients achieved by an enhanced-continuum model based on a dissipative analog of the van der Waals-Cahn-Hilliard equation of equilibrium thermodynamics. This model involves a dissipative hyper-stress, as the analog of a special Korteweg stress, with surface viscosity representing the counterpart of elastic surface tension. Based on the enhanced continuum model, we also present a model of steady shear bands and their non-linear stability against <b>parallel</b> <b>shearing.</b> Finally, we propose a theoretical connection between the non-convective instability of Barker et al. {{and the loss of}} generalized ellipticity in the quasi-static field equations. Apart from the theoretical interest, the present work may suggest stratagems for the numerical simulation of continuum field equations involving the μ(I) rheology and variants thereof.

40|$|International audienceDetailed 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology on single {{grains of}} {{muscovite}} {{was performed in}} the Variscan Tanneron Massif (SE France) to determine the precise timing of the post-collisional exhumation processes. Thirty-two plateau ages, obtained on metamorphic and magmatic rocks sampled along an east–west transect through the massif, vary from 302 ± 2 to 321 ± 2 Ma, and reveal a heterogeneous exhumation of the lower crust that lasted about 20 Ma during late Carboniferous. In {{the eastern part of}} the massif, the closure of the K–Ar isotopic system is at 311 – 315 Ma, whereas in the middle part of the massif it closes earlier at 317 – 321 Ma. These cooling paths are likely to be the result of differential exhumation processes of distinct crustal blocks controlled by a major ductile fault, the La Moure fault that separates both domains. In the western part of the massif, the ages decrease from 318 to 303 Ma approaching the Rouet granite, which provides the youngest age at 303. 6 ± 1. 2 Ma. This age distribution can be explained by the occurrence of a thermal structure spatially associated to the magmatic complex. These ages argue in favour of a cooling of the magmatic body at around 15 Ma after the country rocks in the western Tanneron. The emplacement of the Rouet granite in the core of an antiform is responsible for recrystallization and post-isotopic closure disturbances of the K–Ar chronometer in the muscovite from the host rocks. These new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages clearly outline that at least two different processes may contribute to the exhumation of the lower crust in the later stage of collision. During the first stage between 320 and 310 Ma, the differential motion of tectonic blocks limited by ductile shear zones controls the post-collisional exhumation. This event could be related to orogen <b>parallel</b> <b>shearing</b> associated with crustal-scale strike-slip faults and regional folding. The final exhumation stages at around 300 Ma take place within the tectonic doming associated to magmatic intrusions in the core of antiformal structures.

In the nonrotating case, shear instability is possible only for convectively supercritical waves, with horizontal wavevector aligned parallel or nearly parallel to the plane of IGW propagation. Transverse convection, with wavevector aligned perpendicular to the plane of IGW propagation, displays faster growth than <b>parallel</b> <b>shear</b> or convective instability at any horizontal wavenumber. For intermediate R, eigenmodes in supercritical IGW are characterized at small horizontal wave-number k by a transverse mode of convective instability and a <b>parallel</b> mode of <b>shear</b> instability.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a fluid in a vertical tube, subjected to an oscillatory pressure gradient, is studied experimentally for both a Newtonian and a viscoelastic shear-thinning fluid. Particle image velocimetry {{is used to}} determine the two-dimensional velocity fields in the vertical plane of the tube axis, in a range of driving amplitudes from 0. 8 to 2. 5 mm and of driving frequencies from 2. 0 to 11. 5 Hz.

For the complex fluid, instead, the <b>parallel</b> <b>shear</b> flow regime exhibited at low amplitudes [Torralba, Phys. Rev.

Given that inertial effects remain negligible even at the hardest drivings (Re < 10 (- 1)), it is the complex rheology of the fluid that is responsible for the instabilities observed.

40|$|A reduced {{description}} of exact coherent {{structures in the}} transition regime of plane <b>parallel</b> <b>shear</b> flows is developed, based on the Reynolds number scaling of streamwise-averaged (mean) and streamwise-varying (fluctuation) velocities observed in numerical simulations. The resulting system is characterized by an effective unit Reynolds number mean equation coupled to linear equations for the fluctuations, regularized by formally higher-order diffusion. Stationary coherent states are computed by solving the resulting equations simultaneously using a robust numerical algorithm developed for this purpose. The algorithm determines self-consistently the amplitude of the fluctuations for which the associated mean flow is just such that the fluctuations neither grow nor decay.

Previous work based on asymptotic expansions and predicting supercritical bifurcation at Prandtl number Pr 1 for the parallel base flow is confirmed numerically and through fully nonlinear temporal simulations. When applied to the non-parallel Ekman flow, weakly {{nonlinear analysis}} and fully nonlinear calculations confirm {{that the nature of}} the bifurcation is dominantly controlled by Pr, although a sharp threshold at Pr D 1 is not found. In both flows the underlying physical mechanism is that the mean flow adjusts so as to induce a viscous (respectively diffusive) flux of momentum (respectively buoyancy) that balances the vertical flux induced by the developing instability, leading to a weakening of the mean shear and mean stratification. The competition between the former nonlinear feedback, which tends to be stabilizing, and the latter, which is destabilizing and strongly amplified as Pr increases, determines the supercritical or subcritical character of the bifurcation.
