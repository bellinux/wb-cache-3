2500|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen a new {{approach}} to jet packs where water is used as a high-density propulsion fluid. [...] This requires a very large mass of fluid that makes a self-contained jetpack infeasible. [...] Instead, this approach separates the engine, fuel and fluid supply from the pilot's flying apparatus, using a long flexible hose to feed the water to the jet nozzle pack attached to the pilot's body. [...] These inventions are known as [...] "hydro jet packs", and successful designs have used jetski technology as the powerplant operating in a body of water (an ocean, lake, or [...] pool) to provide the needed propulsion. Several hydro jet pack approaches have been successfully tested and put into <b>production.</b> <b>Flow</b> rate can be controlled by a throttle operator on the jetski, or by the pilot using a remote actuator.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, {{the results}} {{prove that the}} time of {{departure}} of the transport operations significantly affects the average travel speed and the CO 2 volume. 2 DC-consol shipments are less affected by traffic congestion because these transport operations are carried out during the nighttime. The CO 2 increase that is due to regular traffic congestion is about 50  % higher {{in the case of}} the <b>production</b> <b>flows</b> and the DC-direct shipments when compared to the DC-consol operations. This means that the amount of CO 2 of the distribution network may be reduced when transport operations are shifted to the nighttime hours. Whereas this measure is difficult to implement for the DC-direct shipments—these deliveries depend on the opening hours of the retailers—shifting (at least a share of) the <b>production</b> <b>flows</b> from the day- to the nighttime is less problematical.|$|R

40|$|Environmental impact {{assessments}} {{for companies}} and products {{are important to}} increase sales and reduce environmental impact. To support improvements and detailed analyses, researchers have extended the use of simulation of <b>production</b> <b>flows</b> to include sustainability performance indicators. The research cases performed until recently lack standardized methodology and thus have comparability issues and an in-crease number of common faults. By using a common methodology and gathering best practice, future cases can gain a lot. Especially noted by the authors is that the project startup phase is critical for success. This paper proposes a methodology to support the startup phases of simulation projects with sustainability aspects in <b>production</b> <b>flows.</b> The methodology is developed and applied in an automotive industry study presented in this paper. Using a rigid project startup, such as the proposed methodology, reduces itera-tions during modeling and data collection and decreases time spent on modeling. ...|$|R
