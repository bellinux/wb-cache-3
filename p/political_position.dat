5|$|During the Komnenian, or Comnenian, {{period from}} about 1081 to about 1185, the five {{emperors}} of the Komnenos dynasty (Alexios I, John II, Manuel I, Alexios II, and Andronikos I) {{presided over a}} sustained, though ultimately incomplete, restoration of the military, territorial, economic, and <b>political</b> <b>position</b> of the Byzantine Empire. Although the Seljuk Turks occupied the heartland of the Empire in Anatolia, most Byzantine military efforts during this period were directed against Western powers, particularly the Normans.|$|E

In cultural discourse, the magazine published disagreeing polemics over the proper balance of Westernization and tradition necessary for the country's development.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of Byzantine history, the period from about 1081 to about 1185 is often known as the Komnenian or Comnenian period, after the Komnenos dynasty. Together, the five Komnenian {{emperors}} (Alexios I, John II, Manuel I, Alexios II and Andronikos I) ruled for 104 years, presiding over a sustained, though ultimately incomplete, restoration of the military, territorial, economic and <b>political</b> <b>position</b> of the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|As a boy, Truman was {{interested}} in music, reading, war, and history, all encouraged by his mother, with whom he was very close. As president, he solicited {{political as well as}} personal advice from her. He rose at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied twice a week until he was fifteen. Truman worked as a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention at Convention Hall in Kansas City; his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first <b>political</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his <b>political</b> <b>position</b> at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E

5|$|In 1844 in Japan as the Tokugawa shogunate is in decline, Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu of Akashi rapes, tortures, and murders his {{citizens}} at will. He is shielded {{because the}} Shogun is his half-brother. Sir Doi Toshitsura, the Shogun's Justice, {{realizes that the}} situation will escalate after Naritsugu ascends to a higher <b>political</b> <b>position.</b> After a wronged party publicly commits seppuku {{as a way of}} showing disdain for Lord Naritsugu, SirDoi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shimada Shinzaemon, who served under the former shogun, and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, Naritsugu's loyal retainers, led by Hanbei, an old contemporary of Shinzaemon, learn of the plot by spying on Doi's meetings.|$|E
5|$|Kahin {{returned}} {{after the war}} to complete his M.A. from Stanford University, which he received in 1946. His thesis was titled The <b>Political</b> <b>Position</b> of the Chinese in Indonesia , describing the role of Chinese Indonesians in the new country. He continued to pursue of his interest in Southeast Asia, going to Indonesia in 1948 to conduct research during the Indonesian National Revolution.

His dissertation, titled Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia , is considered a classic on Indonesian history.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} he was sure that the Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new <b>political</b> <b>position</b> and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} from France, Edward found his <b>political</b> <b>position</b> greatly strengthened. After intense negotiation, the earls, {{including}} Lancaster and Warwick, came to a compromise in October 1313, fundamentally {{very similar to the}} draft agreement of the previous December. Edward's finances improved, thanks to parliament agreeing to the raising of taxes, a loan of 160,000 florins (£25,000) from the Pope, £33,000 that he borrowed from Philip, and further loans organised by Edward's new Italian banker, Antonio Pessagno. For {{the first time in his}} reign, Edward's government was well-funded.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of peace between Parthia and Rome ensued, with only the {{invasion}} of Alans into Parthia's eastern territories around 72AD mentioned by Roman historians. Whereas Augustus and Nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting Parthia, later Roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern Fertile Crescent, {{the heart of the}} Parthian Empire along the Tigris and Euphrates. The heightened aggression can be explained in part by Rome's military reforms. To match Parthia's strength in missile troops and mounted warriors, the Romans at first used foreign allies (especially Nabataeans), but later established a permanent auxilia force to complement their heavy legionary infantry. The Romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers (sagittarii) and even mail-armored cataphracts in their eastern provinces. Yet the Romans had no discernible grand strategy in dealing with Parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions. The primary motivations for war were the advancement of the personal glory and <b>political</b> <b>position</b> of the emperor, as well as defending Roman honor against perceived slights such as Parthian interference in the affairs of Rome's client states.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar assumed {{office as}} the Temenggong of Johor {{within three days}} of his father's demise. At {{the time of his}} succession, Johor was facing a {{political}} threat from the deposed Sultan, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah. The Sultan was pursuing his sovereignty claims over Johor and Pahang and aimed to overthrow the Sultan of Terengganu with the backing of Siam. Mahmud Muzaffar Shah established an alliance with Tun Ahmad, half-brother and rival of the Bendahara Tun Koris. The alliance caused Abu Bakar concern that the fall of Tun Koris in Pahang would threaten his own <b>political</b> <b>position</b> in Johor. Abu Bakar signed a treaty of friendship with Tun Koris in June 1862, and sent a small expeditionary force to Pahang to support Tun Koris when war broke out in August 1862.|$|E

Leslie insists she has not taken a <b>political</b> <b>position,</b> even after Marcia brings up the recent party at the Bulge. They take several callers, all of whom agree that Leslie should resign. Fed up, Leslie adamantly insists she will not resign, nor will she annul the penguin wedding. Later, she visits Ann and insists that Ann go on a date with Mark. The episode ends with Leslie driving the penguins from the Pawnee Zoo to a zoo in Iowa, where same-sex marriage is legal.|$|E
5|$|The only {{legitimate}} {{male child}} of PedroI to survive infancy, he was officially recognized as heir apparent to the Brazilian throne {{with the title}} Prince Imperial on 6 August 1826. Empress Maria Leopoldina died on 11 December 1826, {{a few days after}} a stillbirth, when Pedro was a year old. Two and a half years later, his father married Amélie of Leuchtenberg. Prince Pedro developed an affectionate relationship with her, whom he came to regard as his mother. PedroI's desire to restore his daughter MariaII to her Portuguese throne, which had been usurped by his brother MiguelI, as well as his declining <b>political</b> <b>position</b> at home led to his abrupt abdication on 7 April 1831. He and Amélie immediately departed for Europe, leaving behind the Prince Imperial, who became Emperor Dom PedroII.|$|E
5|$|The renewed {{blockade}} of Île de France was lifted in December 1795, and Elphinstone deployed {{most of his}} forces in the continued {{blockade of}} Colombo. In February a small squadron under Captain Alan Gardner attacked city and secured the total surrender of the remaining Batavian garrison on the island. In March word arrived at Madras of the Batavian attempt to recapture the Cape Colony and Elphinstone returned westwards with Monarch, followed by Stately, Echo and Rattlesnake. In the east, Rainier's force had some success, seizing the considerable clove stores at Amboyna on 16 February 1796 and the nutmeg and mace supplies of Banda Neira on 8 March. The value of these captures was significant: the captains involved each received £15,000. However, these successes were offset by the complicated <b>political</b> <b>position</b> Rainier discovered in the Dutch East Indies; he spent {{the entirety of the}} remainder of the year diffusing or defeating a series of uprisings by local rajahs and did not return to India until February 1797.|$|E
