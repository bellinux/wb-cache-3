40|$|On {{account of}} the tight {{requirement}} of the high-resolution, the Segmented <b>Primary</b> Optical <b>Telescope</b> (SPOT) becomes the mainstream. Obviously, {{the use of a}} strongly aspheric form creates several intractable problems in manufacturing and subsequent optical testing of aspheric off-axis segments having different forms, the task of controlling a large number of aspheric segments for on-orbit cophasing is formidable, so the prospect of assembling the primary mirror from small, low-cost identical spherical mirror segments is very attractive. This paper will discourse upon the demand of the SPOT and analyze the advantages of segmented spherical primary mirror relative to aspheric. Besides these, the author will design an optical systems under the properties (D= 1200 mm, MTF ≥ 0. 6), the optical designs use a full steerable, quasi-Cassegrain telescope in which the primary mirror uses spherical surface, then we will demonstrate its performance and prove the practicality of Spherical <b>Primary</b> Optical <b>Telescope.</b> Ultimately, we will introduce a multistage wavefront sensing and control strategy briefly for Diffraction-limited phasing...|$|R

Although this allows for the magnification and light gathering power of the telescope to be used, {{it is one of}} the most difficult astrophotography methods. This is because of the difficulties in centering and focusing sometimes very dim objects in the narrow field of view, contending with magnified vibration and tracking errors, and the added expense of equipment (such as sufficiently sturdy telescope mounts, camera mounts, camera couplers, off axis guiders, guide scopes, illuminated cross-hairs, or auto-guiders mounted on <b>primary</b> <b>telescope</b> or the guide-scope.)

5000|$|The Reflection Grating Arrays are {{attached}} {{to two of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>telescopes.</b> They allow approximately 50% of the incoming X-rays to pass unperturbed to the EPIC system, while redirecting the other 50% onto the Focal Plane Cameras. Each RGA was designed to contain 182 identical gratings, though a fabrication error left one with only 181. Because the telescope mirrors have already focused the X-rays to converge at the focal point, each grating has the same angle of incidence, and as with the Focal Plane Cameras, each grating array conforms to a Rowland circle. This configuration minimises focal aberrations. Each 10 xx 20 cm grating is composed of 1 mm thick silicon carbide substrate covered with a [...] gold film, and is supported by five beryllium stiffeners. The gratings contain a large number of grooves, which actually perform the X-ray deflection; each grating contains an average of 646 grooves per millimetre. The RGAs were built by Columbia University.|$|R

40|$|An {{optical system}} {{for use in}} a {{multispectral}} scanner of the type used in video imaging devices is disclosed. Electromagnetic radiation reflected by a rotating scan mirror is focused by a concave <b>primary</b> <b>telescope</b> mirror and collimated by a second concave mirror. The collimated beam is split by a dichroic filter which transmits radiant energy in the infrared spectrum and reflects visible and near infrared energy. The long wavelength beam is filtered and focused on an infrared detector positioned in a cryogenic environment. The short wavelength beam is dispersed by a pair of prisms, then projected on an array of detectors also mounted in a cryogenic environment and oriented at an angle relative to the optical path of the dispersed short wavelength beam...|$|E
40|$|A {{method that}} would notably include dynamic pupil masking has been {{proposed}} as an enhanced version of a prior method of phasing the segments of a <b>primary</b> <b>telescope</b> mirror. The method would apply, more specifically, to a <b>primary</b> <b>telescope</b> mirror that comprises multiple segments mounted on actuators {{that can be used}} to tilt the segments and translate them along the nominal optical axis to affect wavefront control in increments as fine as a fraction of a wavelength of light. An apparatus (see figure) for implementing the proposed method would be denoted a dispersed-fringe-sensor phasing camera system (DPCS). The prior method involves the use of a dispersed-fringe sensor (DFS). The prior method was reported as part of a more comprehensive method in Coarse Alignment of a Segmented Telescope Mirror (NPO- 20770), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 25, No. 4 (April 2001), page 15 a. The pertinent parts of the prior method are the following: The telescope would be aimed at a bright distant point source of light (e. g., a star) and form a broadband image on an imaging detector array placed at the telescope focal plane. The construction and use of a dispersed-fringe sensor would begin with insertion of a grism (a right-angle prism with a transmission grating on the hypotenuse face) into the optical path. With other segments tilted away from the investigating region of the detector, a dispersed-fringe image would be formed by use of a designated reference segment and a selected mirror segment. The modulation period and orientation of the fringe would be analyzed to determine the magnitude and sign of the piston error (displacement along the nominal optical axis) between the two segments. The error would be used to perform a coarse-phase piston adjustment of the affected mirror segment. This determination and removing of piston error is what is meant by phasing as used above. The procedure as described thus far would be repeated until all segments had been phased...|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{annoying}} {{problem is the}} huge thermal mass of the <b>primary,</b> the <b>telescope</b> as a whole, and the enormous dome. Thermal effects are so significant in the primary that it can tolerate only a 2 °C change per day and still retain a usable figure. If the temperatures of the primary and the outside air differ by even 10 degrees, observations become impossible. The large size of the dome itself means there are thermal gradients within it that compound these problems. Refrigeration within the dome offsets some of these issues.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermo-optical and vacuum-ultraviolet properties of thin silicon carbide (SiC) coatings on transparent substrates {{in view of}} their use for Solar Orbiter remote sensing VUV instrumentation. We have made experimental studies with thin SiC coatings on quartz plates to evaluate their reflective properties in the VUV spectral range between 58 nm and 123 nm. We discuss the results {{in relation to the}} visible and near infrared optical properties of the samples. A thin SiC coating of 10 nm thickness is shown to be a very promising compromise between high VUV reflectivity and low vis/IR absorption. The overall absorption of the solar spectrum by such a mirror is less than 8 %. This will be beneficial for instruments requiring a large aperture due to diffraction and radiometric limitation, in coping with the thermal heat load during the Solar Orbiter mission. As an example, we propose a design of the <b>primary</b> <b>telescope</b> mirror for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrome ter (EUS) ...|$|E

This software was originally intended for application to the James Webb Space Telescope, but is also applicable to other segmented-mirror telescopes. The software is capable of determining optical-wavefront information using, as input, a variable number of irradiance measurements collected in defocus planes about the best focal position. The software also uses input of the geometrical definition of the telescope exit pupil (otherwise denoted the pupil mask) to identify {{the locations of the}} segments of the <b>primary</b> <b>telescope</b> mirror. From the irradiance data and mask information, the software calculates an estimate of the optical wavefront (a measure of performance) of the telescope generally and across each primary mirror segment specifically. The software is capable of generating irradiance data, wavefront estimates, and basis functions for the full telescope and for each primary-mirror segment. Optionally, each of these pieces of information can be measured or computed outside of the software and incorporated during execution of the software...|$|E
