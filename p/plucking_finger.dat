The method {{is based on the}} analysis of multimodal data consisting of a combination of motion cap-ture, audio analysis and musical score. High speed video cameras based on marker identification are used to track the position of finger bones and articulations and audio is recorded with a transducer measuring vi-bration on the guitar body. The extracted parameters are divided into left hand controls, i. e. fingering (which string and fret is pressed with a left hand finger) and right hand controls, i. e. the plucked string, the <b>plucking</b> <b>finger</b> and the characteristics of the pluck (position, velocity and angles with respect to the string). Controls are estimated based on probability functions of low level features, namely, the plucking instants (i. e. note onsets), the pitch and the distances of the fingers (both hands) to strings and frets. Note onsets are detected via audio analysis, the pitch is extracted from the score and distances are computed from 3 D Euclidean Geometry. Results show that by combination of multimodal information, it is possible to estimate such a comprehensive set of con-trol features, with special high performance for the fingering and plucked string estimation. Regarding the <b>plucking</b> <b>finger</b> and the pluck character-istics, their accuracy gets lower but improvements are foreseen including a hand model and the use of high-speed cameras for calibration and evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Physically {{inspired}} {{sound synthesis}} techniques {{have been devised}} for several instruments including guitar. Less well studied are methods to model the interactions of the player with strings and of the strings with other mechanical parts of the instrument. In this paper, we present methods based on simple scattering junctions to be inserted at various points along a digital waveguide simulating transversal wave propagation along a string. These junctions, which are derived using a balanced perturbation method for displacement wave variables, connect the waveguide with the external stimuli provided by the player or with objects {{that are part of}} the instrument. A model for plucking is revisited and improved. New nonlinear structures for the accurate model of collisions are developed. The proposed junctions achieve realistic synthesis of the interaction of the <b>plucking</b> <b>finger</b> or pick with the string, of the interaction of the fingers on the neck-side hand with strings, such as in the production of harmonics, and of the strings themselves with frets or fingerboard in a fretless instrument.

40|$|The guitar is an {{instrument}} that gives the player great control over timbre. Different plucking techniques involve varying the finger position along the string, the inclination between the finger and the string, the inclination between the hand and the string {{and the degree of}} relaxation of the <b>plucking</b> <b>finger.</b> Guitarists perceive subtle variations of these parameters and they have developed a very rich vocabulary to describe the brightness, the colour, the shape and the texture of the sounds they produce on their instrument. Dark, bright, chocolatey, transparent, muddy, wooly, glassy, buttery, and metallic {{are just a few of}} those adjectives. The aim of this research is to conceive a computer tool producing the synthesis of the vocal imitation as well as the graphical representation of phonetic gestures underlying the description of the timbre of the classical guitar, as a function of the instrumental gesture parameters (mainly the plucking angle and distance from the bridge) and based on perceptual analogies between guitar and speech sounds. Similarly to the traditional teaching of tabla which uses onomatopeia to designate the different strokes, vocal imitation of guitar timbres could provide a common language to guitar performers, complementary to the mental imagery they commonly use to communicate about timbre, in a pedagogical context for example. 1. 1. Guitar timbre semantics 1. BACKGROUND The guitar is {{an instrument}} allowing the production of a vast palette of timbres. The performer can interact in complex ways with the sound production mechanism. The location of the plucking point Figure 1 : Plucking point at a distance p from the bridge and fingering point at distance l from the bridge on a guitar neck. has a major influence on timbre. Plucking a string close to the bridge produces a tone that is brighter and sharper, generally riche...|$|E

5000|$|Tirando is {{a method}} of {{plucking}} used in classical guitar and flamenco guitar. Tirando is Spanish for [...] "pulling" [...] (in English, it is also called a [...] "free stroke"). After <b>plucking,</b> the <b>finger</b> does not touch the string that is next lowest in pitch (physically higher) on the guitar, as it does with apoyando.|$|R
60|$|But Mother Gunga {{would not}} fight as Peroo desired. After the first {{down-stream}} plunge there came no more walls of water, but the river lifted herself bodily, as a snake when she drinks in mid-summer, <b>plucking</b> and <b>fingering</b> along the revetments, and banking {{up behind the}} piers till even Findlayson began to recalculate {{the strength of his}} work.|$|R

5000|$|For {{practice}} purposes, the use {{of preparation}} {{can be used to}} accentuate a staccato note: Here the finger is placed on the vibrating string to stop its sound, and only after a delay this <b>finger</b> <b>plucks</b> the string. <b>Finger</b> alterations that are commonly used are: i, m, i, m; [...] "p, m, p, m" [...] and [...] "i, a, i, a" [...] for faster progressions. The last two are used because they eliminate the friction of the two neighboring fingers' passing in fast progressions (as i and m tend to rub together in unpracticed musicians).|$|R
50|$|Tirando (also {{known as}} free-stroke) {{is where the}} {{plucking}} motion is made {{in such a manner}} that, after <b>plucking,</b> the <b>finger</b> stays in the air - it does therefore not land on an adjacent string. Apoyando (also known as the rest-stroke) is a plucking motion made in such a manner that after the desired string has been plucked, the fingertip rests on the next adjacent string.|$|R

5000|$|A spitzharfe (or arpanetta) is {{a musical}} string {{instrument}} popular in Italy and Germany {{in the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries. [...] Up to 90 centimetres tall, it is designed to be placed on a table, and consists of two sets of strings - steel strings to produce the melody and brass strings for the accompaniment. It is played by <b>plucking</b> with <b>fingers,</b> {{in a manner similar to}} the harp.|$|R

5000|$|Gut strings are {{nowadays}} mostly used by bassists {{who perform}} in baroque ensembles, rockabilly bands, traditional blues bands, and bluegrass bands. In some cases, the low E and A are wound in silver, {{to give them}} added mass. Gut strings provide the dark, [...] "thumpy" [...] sound heard on 1940s and 1950s recordings. The late Jeff Sarli, a blues upright bassist, said that, [...] "Starting in the 1950s, they began to reset the necks on basses for steel strings." [...] Rockabilly and bluegrass bassists also prefer gut because {{it is much easier}} to perform the [...] "slapping" [...] upright bass style (in which the strings are percussively slapped and clicked against the fingerboard) with gut strings than with steel strings, because gut does not hurt the <b>plucking</b> <b>fingers</b> as much. A less expensive alternative to gut strings is nylon strings; the higher strings are pure nylon, and the lower strings are nylon wrapped in wire, to add more mass to the string, slowing the vibration, and thus facilitating lower pitches. (For more information on slapping, see the sections below on Modern playing styles, Double bass in bluegrass music, Double bass in jazz, and Double bass in popular music).|$|R
5000|$|A {{version of}} the hyangbipa is also used that follow more closely to the {{original}} lines, not made like Chinese pipa, using silk strings and being <b>plucked</b> with bare <b>fingers</b> or with a stick. This is used for more traditional music and sanjo.|$|R

50|$|A {{large number}} of tunings are used; open tunings are common. Unlike most steel-string guitars, its strings are <b>plucked</b> with the <b>fingers</b> of the right hand {{similarly}} to the technique used for classical and flamenco guitars, {{rather than by the}} use of a plectrum.|$|R
5000|$|Ernst Zacharias {{created a}} series of {{electric}} lamellophones created in the 1960s for Hohner. These instruments {{were based on the}} reeds made by Hohner (already employed in accordions, concertinas, melodicas and harmonicas). These instruments were the Pianet (plucked by a foam pad), the Cembalet (plucked by a rubber pad) and the Guitaret (<b>plucked</b> by <b>fingers).</b> The idea of a struck reed tongue had been pioneered by the Alexandre brothers in their [...] "Orgues expressifs" [...] (harmoniums) in the 19th century, where they were called percussion stops.|$|R
5000|$|On bass guitar, {{slapping}} usually {{refers to}} a percussive playing technique most commonly used in funk, disco, soul, jazz, Latin, pop, and many other genres. The style sounds much more percussive than regular plucking of notes with the soft part of the <b>plucking</b> hands <b>fingers,</b> and is also usually louder (although on an electric instrument, the volume can be adjusted with the volume knob or through compression), brighter, and more distinct than {{the sound of a}} bass guitar played with the usual plucking or pick techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Jon Lord doubles {{the guitar}} part on a Hammond C3 organ played through a {{distorted}} Marshall amp, creating a tone {{very similar to}} that of the guitar.

50|$|Composed in November 1951 (first piece) and January 1952 (second piece). Both pastorales use chance {{operations}} applied using charts of layers, sounds, durations, etc. and the I Ching, {{similarly to}} Music of Changes. Because {{the number of}} layers was smaller than in the latter work (specifically, there are just two layers), the texture of Two Pastorales is thinner, with long silences between notes. Like in Music of Changes, the notation is proportional, one inch equals one quarter note. Extended techniques are used: strings are sometimes <b>plucked</b> by <b>fingers</b> or cymbal sticks, or muted by hand.|$|R
50|$|The tololoche is a {{traditional}} musical instrument from northern Mexico. It is similar but smaller than the European double bass, but still large enough to produce low/pitched sounds. It has three or four strings, and is <b>plucked</b> with the <b>fingers</b> (pizzicato). It is purely a folk instrument, and not used in classical music.|$|R
5000|$|At what {{position}} {{along the}} string the <b>finger</b> <b>plucks</b> the string (This is changed by guitarists throughout a song, {{since it is}} an effective way of changing the sound (timbre) from [...] "soft" [...] (dolce) plucking the string near its middle, to [...] "hard" [...] (ponticelo) plucking the string near its end).|$|R
50|$|In playing, {{the left}} hand holds the strings against frets on a fingerboard, while the right hand plucks the strings. When played in older styles of music where the {{instrument}} assumes {{the role of a}} bass, the strings are usually <b>plucked</b> with the <b>fingers.</b> In modern chordal and melodic styles, a pick is frequently used.|$|R
5000|$|At the twelve-minute mark, another brief interplay {{with the}} {{orchestra}} is immediately {{followed by the}} cadenza. Implementing all of the aforementioned techniques, as well as diminished arpeggios, the rapid-fire bowing of broken chords, and left-hand <b>finger</b> <b>plucking,</b> the soloist is finally joined {{by the rest of}} the [...] "band" [...] for a galloping climatic conclusion.|$|R
50|$|Arpeggiation {{is similar}} to the tremolo technique, except almost always the <b>fingers</b> <b>pluck</b> {{separate}} strings. Usually, the pattern of finger pluckings is such that it begins with the fingers resting on the strings as follows - thumb (p) on a bass-string and index (i), middle (m), third finger (a) each on one of the three treble strings respectively.|$|R
50|$|T The bamboo half-tube zither {{found among}} the Ifugao is called Tadcheng, Tedcheng, Gacheng, or Ayudding It has two to four strings which, {{depending}} on the style of playing, are <b>plucked</b> with the <b>fingers</b> or struck with small bamboo sticks. Boys and men play the tadcheng for entertainment, often tapping rhythms patterned after those played on the gongs.|$|R
50|$|After {{the number}} {{described}} above, {{a number of}} suffixes may be appended. An 8 indicates that the instrument has a keyboard attached, while a 9 indicates the instrument is mechanically driven. In addition to these, {{there are a number}} of suffixes unique to each of the top-level groups indicating details not considered crucial to the fundamental nature of the instrument. In the membranophone class, for instance, suffixes can indicate whether the skin of a drum is glued, nailed or tied to its body; in the chordophone class, suffixes can indicate whether the strings are <b>plucked</b> with <b>fingers</b> or plectrum, or played with a bow.|$|R
