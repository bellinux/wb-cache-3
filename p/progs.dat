5|$|Other enemies {{were created}} to add more variety. Large, indestructible Hulks, {{inspired}} by an enemy in Berzerk, were added to kill the humans on the stage. Though they cannot be destroyed, the developers decided to have the protagonist's projectiles slow the Hulk's movement {{as a way to}} help the player. Levitating Enforcers were added as enemies that could shoot back at the main character; Jarvis and DeMar liked the idea of a floating robot and felt {{it would be easier to}} animate. A projectile algorithm was devised for Enforcers to simulate enemy artificial intelligence. The developers felt a simple algorithm of shooting directly at the protagonist would be ineffective because the character's constant motion would always result in a miss. Random elements were added to make the projectile more unpredictable; the Enforcer aims at a random location in a ten pixel radius around the character, and random acceleration curves the trajectory. To further differentiate Enforcers, Jarvis devised the Spheroid enemy as a robot that continually generated Enforcers, rather than have them already on the screen like other enemies. Brains were conceived as robots that could capture humans and brainwash them into enemies called <b>Progs.</b> DeMar devised the final enemies as a way to further increase the game's difficulty; Tanks that fire projectiles which bounce around the screen, and Quarks as a tank-producing robot.|$|E
25|$|The Doomsday Scenario is the {{collective}} {{name of a}} series of Judge Dredd comic stories published in 2000 AD (<b>progs</b> 1141-1164) and the Judge Dredd Megazine (vol. 3 #52-59) in 1999. Written by John Wagner, it was the third such crossover story between those two publications, but was the first in which it was possible to read a complete and coherent tale by reading only those episodes which appeared in one comic or the other without having to buy both magazines. It was reprinted as two trade paperbacks, each collecting the episodes from one comic. When first published it was the longest Judge Dredd story arc ever told, at a total of 32 episodes and 279 pages, as well as several prequels and epilogues. The story tells of the Second Robot War in the year 2121, but its epilogues wrapped up two story arcs that had been developing for several years: former judge Galen DeMarco's unrequited love for Judge Dredd, and Dredd's bitter rivalry with Judge Edgar. The story is also notable for leading to the promotion of Judge Hershey, Dredd's sidekick and one of the strip's longest-running supporting characters, to the office of chief judge.|$|E

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} common and most {{aggressive}} malignant brain tumor. Despite optimal treatment and evolving standard of care, the median survival of patients diagnosed with GBM is only 12 - 15 months. In this study, we combined progesterone (<b>PROG)</b> and temozolomide (TMZ), a standard chemotherapeutic agent for human GBM, to test whether <b>PROG</b> enhances the antitumor effects of TMZ and reduces its side effects. Two WHO grade IV human GBM cells lines (U 87 MG and U 118 MG) and primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were repeatedly exposed to <b>PROG</b> and TMZ either alone or in combination for 3 and 6 days. Cell death was measured by MTT reduction assay. <b>PROG</b> and TMZ individually induced tumor cell death in a dose-dependent manner. <b>PROG</b> at high doses produced more cell death than TMZ alone. When combined, <b>PROG</b> enhanced the cell death-inducing effect of TMZ. In HDFs, <b>PROG</b> did not reduce viability even at the same high cytotoxic doses, but TMZ did so in a dose-dependent manner. In combination, <b>PROG</b> reduced TMZ toxicity in HDFs. <b>PROG</b> alone and in combination with TMZ suppressed the EGFR/PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and MGMT expression in U 87 MG cells, thus suppressing cell proliferation. <b>PROG</b> and TMZ individually reduced cell migration in U 87 MG cells but did so more effectively in combination. <b>PROG</b> enhances the cytotoxic effects of TMZ in GBM cells and reduces its toxic side effects in healthy primary cells...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: Breast cancer {{resistance}} protein (BCRP) plays {{a crucial}} role in multidrug resistance (MDR). Previous studies have shown that steroid hormones, like progesterone (<b>PROG),</b> regulate BCRP expression. The presence of a progesterone response element (PRE) in the BCRP promoter, suggests that <b>PROG</b> may regulate transcription of BCRP. Methods: To investigate the role of <b>PROG</b> in the regulation of BCRP expression, two constructs encoding full-length BCRP driven by either an endogenous PRE promoter or a constitutive CMV promoter, were transfected into T 47 D cells that express the progesterone receptor (PR) or into PR-negative MDA-MB- 231 cells. Results: After treatment with <b>PROG,</b> qPCR and Western blotting analyses indicated that BCRP mRNA and BCRP protein levels were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in PR-positive cells, but <b>PROG</b> had no significant effect on BCRP levels in the PR-negative cells. The effect observed in PR-positive cells was reversed by co-treatment with RU- 486, a specific <b>PROG</b> inhibitor. Cytometric analysis confirmed that BCRP-mediated drug efflux was inhibited and chemosensitivity to mitoxantrone was markedly increased by <b>PROG</b> treatment. Conclusion: These results suggest that <b>PROG</b> reverses BCRP-mediated MDR by down-regulating BCRP expression in breast cancer cells by affecting transcription from the PRE-containing BCRP promoter. Our studies suggest that breast cancer patients with BCRP-mediated MDR may be successfully treated with <b>PROG...</b>|$|R
