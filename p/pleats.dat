5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat <b>pleats</b> to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat <b>pleats</b> extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E
5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the <b>pleats</b> coming away from the shoulder, <b>pleats</b> {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the <b>pleats</b> turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of <b>pleats</b> is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman.

5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of beaked whale. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, {{but they all}} share a similar hunting style. They use a suction technique, aided {{by a pair of}} grooves on the {{underside}} of their head, not unlike the throat <b>pleats</b> on the rorquals, to feed.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat <b>pleats,</b> to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat <b>pleats</b> increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Rorquals use throat <b>pleats</b> {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
50|$|The depth is {{the part}} of the <b>pleat</b> which is folded under the {{overlying}} <b>pleat.</b> It depends solely {{on the size of the}} tartan sett even when <b>pleating</b> to the stripe, since the sett determines the spacing of the stripes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Pleated</b> {{membrane}} cartridge {{filters are}} used extensively throughout a typical bioprocess. They {{are exposed to}} a range of operating conditions and feedstocks. Discrepancies between the performance of the flat sheet membrane and <b>pleated</b> membrane have previously been identified, although little has been done to fully characterise the effects of <b>pleating.</b> As current scale-up techniques use the flat sheet membrane to predict the performance of the large-scale <b>pleated</b> cartridge, the discrepancy in performance between flat sheet and <b>pleated</b> cartridge leads to inaccuracy in scale-up. This inaccuracy is accounted for by over-sizing of the equipment. In turn this reduces the efficiency of the bioprocess and increases capital costs. At the present time no accurate and reliable scale-up methodology exists that accounts for the effects of <b>pleating.</b> A systematic investigation into the effect of <b>pleating</b> has been conducted. By varying the key <b>pleat</b> characteristics: <b>pleat</b> height, type and packing density, the impact upon cartridge performance of these characteristics has been determined. Using this knowledge, new scale-down cartridge filters have been developed, fabricated and tested. When faced with both clean water and a pepsin protein solution, performance was within 10...|$|R

5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat <b>pleats,</b> {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is {{currently}} admitted that for each filtration process using <b>pleated</b> filters, {{at least three}} steps can be distinguished: depth and surface filtration, which are common to flat filters, and surface reduction. This step is caused by inefficient filling of the <b>pleat</b> due to the filter geometry. For combustion aerosol, it has been proved that this third step strongly depends on the filtration velocity resulting in an increase of the resistance when air flow decreases. This observation leads one to think that Brownian diffusion, higher for low velocities, could influence the clogging dynamic of a <b>pleated</b> filter. In this article, a protocol derived from the dust cake preparation method published by Schmidt is developed. The {{aim of this study}} is to measure the aerosol penetration inside a filter media as well as in a <b>pleat</b> using a scanning electronic microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elementary detection. This method has also been extended to the study of <b>pleated</b> filters to measure the particle distribution inside the <b>pleat.</b> Filters were loaded with nanoparticles in order to evaluate the specificity of the diffusional regime on the clogging of <b>pleated</b> HEPA filters. For <b>pleated</b> filters, two filtration velocities were investigated: 2. 5 and 0. 2 cm/s...|$|R
50|$|In <b>pleating</b> to the sett, {{the fabric}} is folded {{so that the}} pattern of the sett is {{maintained}} and is repeated all around the kilt. This is done by taking up one full sett in each <b>pleat,</b> or two full setts if they are small. This causes the <b>pleated</b> sections to have the same pattern as the unpleated front.|$|R

40|$|In many cases, {{there is}} only limited space inside of the dust cartridge. To {{increase}} the filter surface area, the filter media are <b>pleated</b> to various extents to meet the filtration requirements. In many cases however, one can observe that a <b>pleated</b> medium exhibits a shorter lifetime than one would expect from the corresponding flat sheet media data. One {{of the reasons is}} that the changed flow resistivity of the folding region of the <b>pleat</b> has to be taken care of. The material in the inner part of the fold is compressed while the outer part is stretched. This change in the distribution of the material density directly influences the flow resistivity in the folding region. Eventually, the flow through the entire <b>pleat</b> and the distribution of deposited dirt will be affected, too: The fold ing region is less active than the straight part of the <b>pleat.</b> The aim of the study in this paper is to investigate these effects by analyzing the change of the flow resistance due to the folding of the medium.
