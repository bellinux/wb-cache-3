5|$|A right-arm fast bowler of express <b>pace,</b> Lindwall {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as the greatest <b>pace</b> bowler of his era and one of the finest of all time. Together with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed a new-ball pairing {{regarded as one of the}} greatest to have played cricket. Lindwall was known for his classical style, with a smooth and rhythmic run-up and textbook side-on bowling action, from which he generated his trademark outswinger which moved away late at high <b>pace.</b> Lindwall mixed his outswinger with a searing yorker, subtle changes of <b>pace</b> and an intimidating bouncer that skidded at the heads of opposing batsmen. Later in his career, Lindwall developed an inswinger, which together with his variety, <b>pace</b> and control made him the most feared paceman of his time. Lindwall was a fine all round cricketer; he was a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries at Test level and often improved Australia's position with his lower order batting. Lindwall's best known performance was his role in leading the Australian bowling during the 1948 tour of England under Don Bradman; the 1948 Australian team went through the tour undefeated and gained the sobriquet The Invincibles which saw it regarded as one of the finest teams in cricketing history. Lindwall's place in Australian cricket history saw him inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, Lindwall was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker <b>pace</b> than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in <b>pace</b> enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|As {{opportunities}} for slow bowling became infrequent, he contemplated retirement. Although he dismissed Cyril Washbrook {{in the first}} over of Victoria's match against Wally Hammond's touring England team of 1946–47, he was skeptical about his <b>pace</b> bowling. After that match {{he did not take}} a wicket for the next two months. It took further encouragement from Australian captain Don Bradman after he played against Bradman's South Australians. Bradman told Johnston that the selectors thought highly of his potential as a medium-fast bowler to reinforce the short bursts of <b>pace</b> spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and that <b>pace</b> bowlers were in short supply, whereas spinners were plentiful. In the same season, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson, Bruce Dooland and George Tribe had all played in Tests as specialist spinners. Johnston ended the season with only 12 wickets at 33.16 from six matches.|$|E

5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} {{use of his}} <b>pace</b> {{attack and}} fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high <b>pace</b> {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, <b>pace</b> bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E

40|$|A <b>pacing</b> system {{requiring}} only {{a single}} lead was used to establish atrial synchronised <b>pacing</b> in eight patients with complete atrioventricular block and cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction. Spontaneous atrial activity was sensed through electrodes positioned on the <b>pacing</b> lead and used to trigger ventricular demand <b>pacing.</b> A normal atrioventricular relation could be established {{in each of these}} critically ill patients without the complexity of inserting and finding a stable position for an additional atrial sensing lead. Atrial synchronised <b>pacing</b> at the spontaneous sinus rate had distinct haemodynamic advantages compared with conventional ventricular <b>pacing</b> at 100 beats/min. Mean cardiac output for the group was 3. 3 1 /min with atrial synchronised <b>pacing</b> compared with 2. 6 1 /min with conventional <b>pacing,</b> a significant difference of 27 %. Peak systolic pressure averaged respectively 91 and 73 mm Hg in the two <b>pacing</b> modes. With conventional ventricular <b>pacing</b> a pronounced phasic alteration in blood pressure was observed, dependent on the altering relation of the <b>paced</b> beats to spontaneous atrial activity. Atrial synchronised <b>pacing</b> abolished this effect and resulted in a stable blood pressure at or above the peak pressure achieved with conventional <b>pacing.</b> Atrial synchronised <b>pacing</b> with a single lead system can be established rapidly. This mode of <b>pacing</b> has appreciable and significant haemodynamic superiority over conventional ventricular <b>pacing</b> in patients with cardiogenic shock and atrioventricular block following acute myocardial infarction...|$|R

40|$|One hundred twenty-four {{patients}} with unipolar permanent pacemaker implantation (advanced atrioventricular block, 62 cases; sick sinus syndrome, 51 cases; and atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, 11 cases) were studied by 24 -hour Holter electrocardiography. Analysis of pacemaker function and arrhythmias with various <b>pacing</b> modes (VVI <b>pacing,</b> 70 cases; AAI <b>pacing,</b> 19 cases; and DDD <b>pacing,</b> 35 cases) and measurement of hemodynamics revealed the following. In all <b>pacing</b> modes, atrial contraction {{was observed in}} cases of advanced atrioventricular block. However, in the VVI <b>pacing</b> mode with sick sinus syndrome, atrial contraction was often lost. In sick sinus syndrome group Ⅲ, pacemaker non-mediated arrhythmias were often recorded. <b>Pacing</b> failure was not noted with any atrial or ventricular <b>pacing.</b> Undersensing was observed in 26 % of the AAI <b>pacing</b> group and 7 % of the VVI <b>pacing</b> group. Myopotential inhibition was observed in 11 - 24 % of all <b>pacing</b> modes, but only two patients complained of subjective symptoms. DDD <b>pacing</b> with atrial sensing yielded effective increase of heart rate, but caused pacemaker tachycardia and pacemaker mediated tachycardia. In making these diagnosis and managing of pacemaker mediated arrhythmias, 24 -hour Hotter recordings were the most effective. In comparison of hemodynamics in any <b>pacing</b> mode, physiological <b>pacing</b> was significantly different from VVI <b>pacing</b> as to blood pressure, left atrial pressure and cardiac index. Patients who require improvement of hemodynamics should be treated with physiological <b>pacing.</b> As for the optimal choice of <b>pacing</b> modes, {{patients with}} advanced atrioventricular block without underlying disease do not always require physiological <b>pacing.</b> However, the patients with sick sinus syndrome should receive physiological <b>pacing...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} effects of <b>pacing</b> modes on the {{interaction}} between the left ventricle and arterial system in humans. DESIGN [...] The slope of the end systolic pressure-volume relation (end systolic elastance), effective arterial elastance, the ratio of effective arterial elastance to end systolic elastance, and mechanical energy efficiency were compared under different <b>pacing</b> modes (atrial, atrioventricular, and ventricular). PATIENTS [...] Nine male patients with sick sinus syndrome who had cardiac catheterisation for diagnosis and to see whether they needed a pacemaker. INTERVENTIONS [...] A conductance catheter with tip-manometer was inserted into the left ventricle to obtain pressure-volume loops, and two <b>pacing</b> catheters were inserted into the right atrium and into the right ventricle respectively. RESULTS [...] End systolic elastance was lower in atrioventricular <b>pacing</b> than in atrial <b>pacing,</b> but effective arterial elastance was not significantly different. End systolic elastance was lower in ventricular <b>pacing</b> than in atrioventricular <b>pacing,</b> and effective arterial elastance was higher in ventricular <b>pacing</b> than in atrioventricular <b>pacing.</b> Consequently the ratio of effective arterial elastance to end systolic elastance was lowest in atrial <b>pacing</b> and highest in ventricular <b>pacing,</b> and mechanical energy efficiency was highest in atrial <b>pacing</b> and lowest in ventricular <b>pacing.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Atrial contraction and synchronous ventricular contraction independently optimise ventriculoarterial coupling in terms of a transfer of energy.

40|$|Background: Has been {{reported}} that patients exhibiting prolonged <b>paced</b> QRS duration {{tend to have more}} serious heart disease, and the <b>paced</b> QRS duration can be an effective indicator of impaired left ventricular function. However, the acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of <b>paced</b> QRS duration and <b>pacing</b> sites during right ventricular (RV) <b>pacing</b> remain unknown. Methods: A total of 14 patients who underwent electrophysiologic study for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were examined.

40|$|Emerging {{data from}} {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have shown}} that right ventricular (RV) apical <b>pacing</b> led to abnormalities of ventricular activation and contraction, and impairment of myocardial perfusion with adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling, which was associated with increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality. As a result, there is a growing interest in searching for methods to minimize unnecessary RV <b>pacing</b> and preserving normal ventricular activation with alternative ventricular <b>pacing</b> sites. The risk of developing heart failure (HF) after RV apical <b>pacing</b> depends on the interactions between patient-specific factors (baseline atrial rhythm, intrinsic atrioventricular and ventricular conduction, LV ejection fraction, and the presence of HF and myocardial infarction) and pacing-related factors (mode of <b>pacing,</b> site of ventricular <b>pacing,</b> <b>paced</b> QRS duration, and percentage and duration of <b>pacing).</b> In patients with intact atrioventricular conduction, atrial-based <b>pacing</b> should be used to avoid unnecessary ventricular <b>pacing.</b> In patients requiring ventricular <b>pacing,</b> the potential benefits of alternate ventricular <b>pacing</b> sites, such as RV or LV septa, or even biventricular <b>pacing</b> in different patient populations remain unclear and warrant further long-term prospective clinical trial evaluations especially in those patients who are at a higher risk of developing HF after RV apical <b>pacing.</b> © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

BackgroundAbrupt changes in ventricular cycle lengths (short-long-short, S-L-S) might initiate VT/VF. The S-L-S sequences might be passively permitted or actively facilitated by bradycardia <b>pacing.</b> MethodsInitiating sequences of 1, 356 VT/VF episodes in the PainFree Rx II (n = 634) and EnTrust Trial (n = 421) were analyzed with stored electrograms and by <b>pacing</b> mode (DDD/R, VVI/R, and Managed Ventricular <b>Pacing</b> [MVP]). Interactions between <b>pacing</b> and VT/VF initiation were classified as: non-pacing associated, <b>pacing</b> associated, <b>pacing</b> permitted, and <b>pacing</b> facilitated. ResultsNon-pacing associated (no <b>pacing,</b> no S-L-S) and <b>pacing</b> associated (ventricular <b>pacing</b> without S-L-S) onset accounted for 44. 0 % and 29. 8 % of all VT/VF, respectively. <b>Pacing</b> permitted (S-L-S sequences without ventricular <b>pacing)</b> episodes accounted for 6. 4 % (DDD/R), 20. 0 % (MVP), and 25. 6 % (VVI/R) of 1, 356 VT/VF episodes. <b>Pacing</b> facilitated onset (S-L-S sequences actively facilitated by ventricular <b>pacing</b> including the terminal beat after a pause) accounted for 8. 2 % (MVP), 9. 4 % (VVI/R), and 14. 8 % (DDD/R) of 1, 356 VT/VF episodes. <b>Pacing</b> facilitated S-L-S VT/VF occurred in 2. 6 % (MVP), 3. 3 % (VVI/R), and 5. 2 % (DDD/R) of patients with episodes and was the sole initiating sequence in approximately 1 % of patients.

40|$|AbstractAdverse {{hemodynamics}} {{of right}} ventricular (RV) <b>pacing</b> {{is a well-known}} fact.

As a consequence, investigators searched for alternate <b>pacing</b> sites with a more physiological activation pattern and better hemodynamics. Direct His bundle <b>pacing</b> and Para-Hisian <b>pacing</b> are the most physiological ventricular <b>pacing</b> sites. But, this is technically difficult.

The goal {{of this study was}} to determine whether Purkinje potential (PP) <b>pacing</b> could provide better hemodynamics in patients with left bundle branch block and heart failure than biventricular (BiV) <b>pacing.</b> Methods: Eleven patients with New York Heart Association functional class II or III heart failure despite optimal medical therapy were selected for this study. All patients underwent left- and right-sided cardiac catheterization for measurement of LV functional parameters in the control state during BiV and PP <b>pacing.</b> Results: Maximum dP/dt increased during BiV and PP <b>pacing</b> when compared with control measurements. This study compared parameters measured during BiV <b>pacing</b> with PP <b>pacing</b> and non-paced beats as the control state in each patient (717 ± 171  mmHg/s vs. 917 ± 191  mmHg/s, p< 0. 05; and 921 ± 199  mmHg/s, p< 0. 005); however, the difference between PP <b>pacing</b> and BiV <b>pacing</b> was not significant.
