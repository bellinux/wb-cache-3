5|$|The Roman Catholic Church's {{refusal to}} countenance {{occasional}} attendance at Protestant services, {{as well as}} the excommunication of Elizabeth by Pope Pius V in 1570, presented the choice to Roman Catholics more starkly. The arrival of the seminary priests, while it was a lifeline to many Roman Catholics, brought further trouble. Elizabeth's ministers took steps to stem the tide: fines for refusal to attend church were raised from 12d. <b>per</b> <b>service</b> to £20 a month, fifty times an artisan's wage; it was now treason to be absolved from schism and reconciled to Rome; the execution of priests began—the first in 1577, four in 1581, eleven in 1582, two in 1583, six in 1584, fifty-three by 1590, and seventy more between 1601 and 1608. It became treasonable for a Roman Catholic priest ordained abroad to enter the country. Because the papacy had called for the deposing of the Queen, the choice for moderate Roman Catholics lay between treason and damnation. The List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation was extensive.|$|E

30|$|Lastly, Laselva et al. [25] {{proposed}} a framework {{to assess the}} QoE built from an aggregation model using the network and service KPIs. The approach considered three network dimensions which are the subscribers from the QoE, the service and the network elements based on the KPIs. The device dimension was not considered {{and there was no}} splitting of KPIs <b>per</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R

25|$|The rails need to {{withstand}} enormous repulsive forces during shooting, and these forces {{will tend to}} push them apart {{and away from the}} projectile. As rail/projectile clearances increase, arcing develops, which causes rapid vaporization and extensive damage to the rail surfaces and the insulator surfaces. This limited some early research railguns to one shot <b>per</b> <b>service</b> interval.|$|E

25|$|The Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic's {{military}} Colours of the Argentine Army, Argentine Navy and Argentine Air Force are the Flag of Argentina as the National War Colour and the Unit Colour. The National War Colour is {{a variation}} of the Argentine national flag made for military use, while the Unit Colour differs <b>per</b> <b>service</b> arm and unit. The Army's older regiments tend to have their unit colour based on designs used before while the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers tend to have the Flag of the Army of the Andes as a second National War Colour.|$|E

25|$|KP's {{quality of}} care has been highly rated and {{attributed}} to {{a strong emphasis on}} preventive care, its doctors being salaried rather than paid <b>per</b> <b>service,</b> and an attempt to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay. However, Kaiser has had disputes with its employees' unions, repeatedly faced civil and criminal charges for falsification of records and patient dumping, faced action by regulators over the {{quality of care}} it provided, especially to patients with mental health issues, and has faced criticism from activists and action from regulators over the size of its cash reserves.|$|E
25|$|Singaporean {{military}} colours of the Singapore Armed Forces {{are divided}} today into Service State Colours and Unit Regimental Colours. Until 1997 {{there were also}} Service Regimental Colours and Unit State Colours. The State Colours {{are similar to the}} Flag of Singapore but differ <b>per</b> <b>service.</b> But Regimental Colours are different, and they differ per unit or service arm (save for the flags of the Air Force and Navy that show their respective service colours instead and some SAF service-wide commands like the Military Police). Their common design is that of the regimental or command arms at the centre of the colour used. Both are gold fringed and are brought out on major occasions only.|$|E
25|$|Philippine {{military}} colours are the Flag of the Philippines as the National Colour, the Organizational Colours, and the Unit Regimental Colour. The Flag of the Philippines is the National Colour of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, {{but unlike}} the US colour has no markings on the flag. The Organizational Colours are the flags of the AFP's four Major Service Commands while the Unit Regimental Colour differs <b>per</b> <b>service</b> arm and unit. Like the US, it also has 2nd order guidons for companies and troops, but these are also based on the Spanish military guidons and banners, not on the American ones, reflecting {{the long history of}} the military establishment here. These guidons are therefore not swallow tailed save for the PMA, the Philippine Army's Escort and Security Btn and some other units under the Philippine Army.|$|E

25|$|The tax was {{supported}} by environmental groups, student groups and nearly every local government. Opposition to the tax was headed by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation who drew the public's attention to purported misuse of funds by TransLink. A widely circulated statistic {{was the fact that}} TransLink had the highest cost per revenue passenger of the major Canadian transit agencies. Supporters countered with other analyses that showed TransLink to be ranked first by cost <b>per</b> <b>service</b> hour, service hours per $1 million and service hours per capita. The Yes campaign outspent the No campaign by $5.8 million to $40,000. Surveys conducted by Insights West showed the Yes side ahead in December 2014, but support dropped to 37 per cent the week before the ballots were mailed. In July 2015, the tax was rejected, with 62% of 700,000 voters in opposition and a majority opposed in 23 out of 25 voting regions.|$|E
25|$|In the California Healthcare Quality Report Card 2013 Edition, Kaiser Permanente's Northern California and Southern California regions, Kaiser {{received}} {{four out}} of four possible stars in Meeting National Standards of Care. Kaiser North and South also received {{three out of four}} stars in Members Rate Their HMO. KP's performance has been attributed to three practices: First, KP places a strong emphasis on preventive care, reducing costs later on. Second, its doctors are salaried rather than paid <b>per</b> <b>service,</b> which removes the main incentive for doctors to perform unnecessary procedures. Thirdly, KP attempts to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay and by shifting care to outpatient clinics. This practice results in lower costs per member, cost savings for KP and greater doctor attention to patients. A comparison to the UK's National Health Service found that patients spend 2–5 times as much time in NHS hospitals as compared to KP hospitals.|$|E
25|$|In the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela, {{aside from}} the Flag of Venezuela as the National Colour, there are also Organizational Colours {{for each of the}} 6 service {{branches}} and the Ministerial Colour of the Ministry of Defence and Unit Colours, which differ <b>per</b> <b>service</b> branch and arm. Every military unit from the Ministry of Defense down to all individual units have a stand of colours like in the United Kingdom, but differ from the battalion to the service and the national level. The national flag, until the 1940s, served also as the unit state colour {{in the same manner as}} the National Colour of the United States Army and the State/Sovereign's Colour in the Commonwealth of Nations, and was based on the national flag but with the unit inscription replacing the stars in the centre in white lettering. The Venezuelan National Militia is the only service branch that uses a battle colour, similar to the flag of the Cuban July 26 Movement: the colour is red and black with the service name on it in white, and a separate colour is used for the service headquarters at the Montana Barracks in Caracas. Starting from July 2013 onward it was granted permission to use a 4th colour for its battalions: red with the eyes of the late President Hugo Chávez and the inscription Chavez Vive (Chavez Lives On) below, topped with a scarlet star.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To-investigate time {{trends in}} service provision. DESIGN: Five {{cross-sectional}} surveys across a 20 -year period. SETTING: Australian private general practice PARTICIPANTS: A {{random sample of}} dentists. METHODS: Mailed questionnaires were collected in 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998 and 2003 (response rates 71 %- 76 %). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Services</b> <b>per</b> visit, annual <b>services</b> <b>per</b> dentist; annual <b>services</b> <b>per</b> patient. RESULTS: Total <b>services</b> <b>per</b> visit increased over the study period from 1. 78 to 2. 37 (Poisson regression; P< 0. 05). However the annual number of <b>services</b> provided <b>per</b> dentist did not vary significantly, reflecting a trend among dentists to supply fewer patient visits per year. The annual number of <b>services</b> provided <b>per</b> patient increased from 3. 47 to 5. 50 (OLS regression; P< 0. 05), reflecting both increased <b>service</b> rates <b>per</b> visit and increased numbers of visits by patients. Dentists provided less restorative, prosthodontic and extraction <b>services</b> <b>per</b> year, but more diagnostic, preventive, endodontic and crown and bridge services. The annual care received per patient also included more diagnostic, preventive, endodontic and crown and bridge services but differed from the dentist pattern through increased rates of restorative services over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The content of dentist workloads has changed to include less emphasis on removal and replacement of teeth and more effort on diagnosis and prevention aimed at retention of natural dentitions.

500|$|After leaving Geauga, Garfield {{worked for}} a year at various jobs, {{including}} teaching. Finding that some New Englanders worked their way through college, Garfield determined to do the same, and first sought a school that could prepare him for the entrance examinations. From 1851 to 1854, he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later named Hiram College) in Hiram, Ohio, a school run by the Disciples. While there, he was most interested {{in the study of}} Greek and Latin, but was inclined to learn about and discuss any new thing he encountered. Securing a position on entry as janitor, he was hired to teach while still a student. Lucretia Rudolph had also enrolled at the Institute, and Garfield wooed her while teaching her Greek. He developed a regular preaching circuit at neighboring churches, in some cases earning a gold dollar <b>per</b> <b>service.</b> By 1854, Garfield had learned all the Institute could teach him and was a full-time teacher. Garfield then enrolled at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, as a third-year student, given credit for two years' study at the Institute after passing a cursory examination. Garfield was impressed with the college president, Mark Hopkins, who had responded warmly to Garfield's letter inquiring about admission. He said of Hopkins, [...] "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log with a student on the other." [...] Hopkins later stated about Garfield in his student days, [...] "There was a large general capacity applicable to any subject. There was no pretense of genius, or alternation of spasmodic effort, but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions." [...] After his first term, Garfield was hired to teach penmanship to the students of nearby Pownal, Vermont, a post whose previous incumbent was Chester A. Arthur.|$|E
