5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic soil, {{with added}} peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it can be readily grown as a <b>pot</b> <b>plant.</b> Along {{with other members of}} the genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cultivars {{brought into}} {{cultivation}} in Australia {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century are perennials. 'Dargan Hill Monarch' was the first of these, and many more have followed. Profusely flowering, these grow in many colours including white, yellow, orange, bronze, pink, and red. Their commercial lifespans are generally around three years. Queensland-based company Aussie Winners has a range of compact plants ranging from orange to white known as Sundaze. Plants of this series usually have larger leaves. This range won the Gran premio d'oro at the Euroflora exposition in Geneva in 2001, for the best new plant series in the previous three years. 'Florabella Gold', a member of the Florabella series, won the award for best new <b>pot</b> <b>plant</b> (vegetative) in the Society of American Florists' competition of 1999. The Wallaby cultivars are range of taller forms with narrow leaves and white, yellow or pink flowers. Other commercial ranges include the Nullarbor series, and Queensland Federation daisies, including 'Wanetta Sunshine' and 'Golden Nuggets'.|$|E

40|$|Flowering or foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> are {{ornamental}} items usually {{grown in}} greenhouses under optimal growing conditions. Cultivation in protected environments allows for rapid growth and high quality characteristics. When plants reach the desired commercial size {{they can be}} transferred to hardening greenhouses or directly sent to the distribution chain. The growing and post-production conditions such as storage and transportation can have very deleterious effects on the ornamental quality of plants. The major post-production disorders are bud and flower abscission in flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> or leaf abscission or yellowing in foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> On the other hand, the ornamental quality of <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> is extremely important and depends on the number and colour of flowers or leaves, flower, leaf and plant longevity. The presence of flowers on flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> depends on flower longevity and turnover. The colour and size of leaves of foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> is linked to pre- and post-production environmental conditions. The post-production quality losses of flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> can be mainly ascribed to natural flower senescence. This phenomenon is highly regulated by plant hormones such as ethylene and abscisic acid, but the post-production environment can dramatically influence plant hormone equilibrium. Quality losses of foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> are mainly due to leaf senescence usually associated with inadequate acclimatization from the production area to the post-production chain...|$|R
30|$|Three clones ({{referred to}} as A, B and C) of grafted Pinus radiata, {{hereafter}} {{referred to as}} the <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> known to be susceptible to the pathogens Phytophthora kernoviae and P. pluvialis, were used in this investigation. The <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> supplied from the Radiata Pine Breeding Company Ltd. (Rotorua, New Zealand), were obtained in mid-autumn from the Scion nursery (Rotorua, New Zealand) and were equilibrated for two weeks in a controlled environment cabinet (20 / 15 °C, 70 % relative humidity, 12  h photoperiod, 500  μmol m- 2  sec- 1 light) prior to treatment application. All treatments were applied to one-year-old needles located on the main leader of the <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> There were three <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> of each clone for each treatment, such that all treatments were replicated three times, with three experimental units per clone (three clones x three <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> of each clone).|$|R
25|$|The second {{victim of}} the {{explosion}} was local principal Priya Kapoor (Menik Gooneratne). Although, Gooneratne's exit had been reported seven days before the storyline began, viewers were initially left guessing as to whether Priya or Sonya would die. Sonya sustained a serious head injury when she was thrown off her feet during the explosion. She {{was rushed to the}} hospital unconscious and with a swelling in the brain. Meanwhile, Priya was trapped inside the marquee when the explosion took place and was crushed by a heavy <b>pot</b> <b>plant</b> that fell on her abdomen. Like Sonya, she was also unconscious and had internal bleeding. However, Priya's condition deteriorated and eventually her life support was switched off.|$|E

Ajay finds Priya is unconscious; having been crushed by a heavy <b>pot</b> <b>plant</b> that has fallen on her abdomen. Karl has to {{resuscitate}} Priya, while Sonya and Rhys are taken to hospital. At the hospital, Rhys is checked over and Priya is brought in. Karl discreetly tells Rhys that she had to be resuscitated again in the ambulance. Rhys's mother comes to see him and he maintains that he is fine. Sonya has a bleed on the brain, but Toadie insists she will be okay. Ajay tries to get hold of Rani, but she ignores the calls. Kyle finds her and brings her to the hospital, where Ajay explains what happened. Rhys checks himself out of the hospital, against Karl's wishes. Rhys tells Kyle that he has decided to meet with his estranged father. As Kyle struggles with his ute's lock, he notices Rhys has collapsed. He calls out for help and Karl tries to revive Rhys, who has died from an undetected blood clot.|$|E
500|$|I.anemonifolius {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1791. Knight {{reported that it}} flowered and set seed there. With attractive foliage and prominently displayed flowers and cones, I.anemonifolius adapts readily to cultivation; plants can be grown in rock gardens or as borders, or as a <b>pot</b> <b>plant.</b> Garden plants can be variable, with either upright or spreading habits; and some maintaining a naturally compact habit without pruning. It grows readily in a sandy well-drained soil in a sunny or part-shaded position. The species is suited to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 11. It is hardy in frosts and dry spells, but produces more flowers with extra moisture. [...] It can be pruned heavily once established.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the demand for <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for interior decoration at various points of sale in Poznan. The results were based on questionnaires filled by clients of three retail sale points with pot plants: flower shop, horticultural centre and building material market in Poznan and its surroundings. Collected information was analysed for a frequency of purchases, amount of money spent on <b>pot</b> <b>plants,</b> place of purchases, occasions for which plant was bought, preferences of buyers and pattern of purchases. Customers purchase plants in various points of sale from 7 to 9 <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> per year, mostly in horticultural centres and in spring. Plants are used for interior decoration and are cultivated for many years, however cut flowers are more often chosen for a gift than <b>pot</b> <b>plants.</b> Whereas a significant part of building material market customers cultivate flowers <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a short time, and they buy <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a gift as often as cut flowers. Among plants with flowers Phalaenopsis and Anthurium are selected most frequently, and Zamioculcas and Yucca among plants with decorative foliage. While choosing plants, buyers are guided by the overall appearance and price. ...|$|R
40|$|Reducing indoor {{heat gain}} from the roof into the {{building}} means reducing the cooling energy consumption of air conditioning system hence increase indoor comfort. Apart from its high initial installation cost, green roof is proven {{to be the best}} way in dealing with the issue of indoor heat gain in a building thus contributes in reducing urban heat island effect. Green roof also called eco-roof or vegetated roof is described as a roof that is planted with specific vegetation above a waterproofing membrane. A study in Malaysia suggested that <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> as an alternative to more economic green roof and its potential in dealing with indoor heat gain needs further exploration. <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> are plants grown in containers or <b>pots</b> instead of <b>planting</b> them in the ground. This study investigated the potential of <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> as an affordable alternative tool to green roof application in reducing indoor temperature in tropical climate regions. Four similar test cells equipped with data acquisition system were built. Each top of the cell is treated with four different design variables; <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> vegetated, non-vegetated 150 mm depth soil layer and a bare top surface. Indoor peak heat value and lowest value were recorded and analyzed. At heat peak hour, <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> managed to reduce a daily average of 8. 7 % indoor heat gain whereas vegetation cell only managed to reduce an average of 7. 9 % indoor heat gain. <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> were also found to reduce a daily average of 35. 5 % of total heat transfer amount compared to 28. 5 % in vegetated cell. Based on these results <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> appear to offer an alternative strategy towards reducing indoor temperature. In conclusion, this study suggests that <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> could provide an affordable way especially to urban population in their strategy to deal with the high energy consumption for coolin...|$|R

500|$|The {{inconvenient}} siting {{of stations}} {{and the decline}} in hop-picking in the area all contributed to diminishing returns on the line by the late 1950s. Apart from the 16:25 daily working from Paddock Wood which was well patronised by children, few trains carried {{more than a dozen}} passengers. Passenger journeys were estimated in 1958 at around 170 per day, to which was added around 100 schoolchildren. Even the school traffic was lost once the local authority hired the services of Maidstone & District Motor Company. The line was unpopular with commuters due to the poor connections to and from London. Only the 07:34 service would ensure arrival at [...] before 10:00 with one change at Paddock Wood, the following train at 08.20 would only get the passenger to [...] at 10.15 after two changes. In the evening, the 16:32 departed too early for many commuters while the eleven-coach 18:18 [...] service was overcrowded and divided at Tonbridge where three coaches were detached for Ashford. Hawkhurst-bound passengers had to change at Paddock Wood and cross over to the bay platform for the branch service which arrived in Hawkhurst at 19:58. Locals preferred the direct bus services to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells over the indirect railway journey, as shown by the fact that no more than 250 return tickets were sold from Hawkhurst in the final years of the line. Only the line's expanding <b>pot</b> <b>plant</b> traffic justified its continuing existence.|$|E
