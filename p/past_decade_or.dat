5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} over the <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so shows that they teem {{with a wide variety}} of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.|$|E

500|$|The eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii) is {{a species}} of vesper bat. It {{can be found in}} Ontario and Quebec in Canada and in the Eastern United States. It is among the {{smallest}} bats in eastern North America and is known for its small feet and black face-mask. Until recently all North American small-footed Myotis were considered to be [...] "Myotis leibii". The western population is now considered to be a separate species, Myotis ciliolabrum. The Eastern small footed bat is rare throughout its range, although the species may be locally abundant where suitable habitat exists. Studies suggest white-nose syndrome has caused declines in their populations. However, most occurrences of this species have only been counted within the <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> two and are not revisited regularly, making their population status difficult to assess. Additionally, bat populations in the Eastern U.S. have typically been monitored using surveys conducted in caves and mines in the winter, but small-footed bats hibernate in places that make them unlikely to be encountered during these surveys. As a result, numbers of small-footed bats counted in winter tend to be low and relatively variable compared to other species of bats. Many biologists believe the species is stable, having declined little in recent times, but that it is vulnerable, especially in its cave hibernacula.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "traditional" [...] (masorti) is {{most common}} as a {{self-description}} among Israeli families of [...] "eastern" [...] origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, {{has nothing to}} do with the Conservative Judaism, which also names itself [...] "Masorti" [...] outside North America. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways [...] "secular" [...] and [...] "traditional" [...] are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term [...] "Orthodox" [...] is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the diaspora. What would be called [...] "Orthodox" [...] in the diaspora includes what is commonly called dati (religious) or haredi (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called [...] "Religious Zionism" [...] or the [...] "National Religious" [...] community, as well as what has become known over the <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so as haredi-leumi (nationalist haredi), or [...] "Hardal", which combines a largely haredi lifestyle with nationalist ideology.

The maintenance of is a responsibility shared between the government run DDF(District Development Fund under Ministry of Transport) and the rural district council. Both organisations are badly funded and managed. The latter relies on tax from farmers which is not enough and some farmers simply default on payment. Another element which is affecting Chitomborwizi is lack of funds. Farming is a business, time and again businesses need access to cheap/affordable capital to fund their business {{and this is not}} available to Chitomborwizi farmers. Farmers need to have boreholes so as to utilise their farms throughout the season and not rely on seasonal field crops only. Another problem facing farmers is skills shortage.|$|R
