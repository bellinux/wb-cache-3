5|$|A {{review in}} the The Moving Picture World said the comedy-drama as being <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> watch and full of action. However, {{the quality of the}} Princess films towards the end of its {{productions}} were not pleasing the audiences. The last Princess brand film, Just Kids would be released on April 9. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures {{to make them more}} <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner's colourisation facilities {{as a member of the}} Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising The Haunting. Wise was able to prevent the colourisation by pointing to his contract, which stated the picture could only be in black-and-white.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> the eye, as {{a scheme}} {{it is both}} out of {{proportion}} with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E

5|$|However, while <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> Riker's mind, {{the passionate}} dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds on the {{positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E

25|$|Making the new Taurus <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> {{the senses}} was a {{recurring}} theme throughout the third-generation Taurus' development. Ford's engineers specially tuned every panel and component, so that every sound that the Taurus made, from the doors closing to the engine running, was acoustically pleasing. Ford's trim designers specially selected {{every one of the}} Taurus' interior materials, so that every surface, as well as every button and control, was <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> the touch.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} must be aesthetically pleasing.

25|$|Sex {{therapists}} {{will sometimes}} recommend that female patients {{take time to}} masturbate to orgasm, for example to help improve sexual health and relationships, to help determine what is erotically <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> them, and because mutual masturbation can lead to more satisfying sexual relationships and added intimacy.|$|E

25|$|A common {{criticism}} of full cutoff lighting fixtures {{is that they}} are sometimes not as aesthetically <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> look at. This is most likely because historically {{there has not been a}} large market specifically for full cutoff fixtures, and because people typically like to see the source of illumination. Due to the specificity with their direction of light, full cutoff fixtures sometimes also require expertise to install for maximum effect.|$|E

25|$|A {{drive or}} desire can be {{described}} as a deficiency or need that activates behavior that is aimed at a goal or an incentive. These drives are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior. Basic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> others.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} {{stands on}} the west side of the Asian Highway, popularly known as the Dhaka-Aricha Road, and is 32 kilometres away from the capital. Spread over an area of 697.56 acres (2.8km²), the campus surrounded by the Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre (BPATC) on the south, and the Savar Cantonment on the northeast, on the north of which is the National Monument (Jatiyo Smriti Soudho) and a large dairy farm on the east. The topography of the land with its gentle rise and plains is <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> the eyes. The water features sprawled around the campus make an excellent habitat for the winter birds that flock in every year in the thousands and consequently, it is a site frequented by many bird watchers.|$|E
25|$|Even in the {{earliest}} times the chief qualifications demanded of the hazzan, in addition to knowledge of Biblical and liturgical literature {{as well as the}} prayer motifs (known as steiger), were a pleasant voice and an artistic delivery; for the sake of these, many faults were willingly overlooked. The hazzan was required to possess a pleasing appearance, to be married, and to have a flowing beard. Sometimes, according to Isaac of Vienna (13th century), a young hazzan having only a slight growth of beard was tolerated. Maimonides decided that the hazzan who recited the prayers on an ordinary Sabbath and on weekdays need not possess an appearance <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> everybody; he might even have a reputation not wholly spotless, provided he was living a life morally free from reproach {{at the time of his}} appointment.|$|E
25|$|James Hildreth {{scored a}} quick 46 off 26 {{deliveries}} at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres set a challenging target of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. No Glamorgan bowler really had {{control over the}} Somerset batsmen, and yet they lost their wickets. A highlight of the innings was the effort of Somerset's No. 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before part-timers Keith Parsons and Hildreth {{got the better of}} them and took wickets at a leisure - however, Alex Wharf hung in there with Michael Powell and carried the Dragons to 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the actual result, which of course was <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> the home side.|$|E
