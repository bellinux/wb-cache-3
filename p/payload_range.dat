5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more <b>payload,</b> <b>range,</b> and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E
5|$|As the USMC {{wanted a}} {{substantially}} improved Harrier without {{the development of}} a new engine, the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) in 1976. The United States Navy (USN), which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC, insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing. McDonnell Douglas modified two AV-8As with new wings, revised intakes, redesigned exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes. Designated YAV-8B, the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978, at the hands of Charles Plummer. The aircraft performed three vertical take-offs and hovered for seven minutes at Lambertâ€“St. Louis International Airport. The second aircraft followed on 19 February 1979, but crashed that November due to engine flameout; the pilot ejected safely. Flight testing of these modified AV-8s continued into 1979. The results showed greater than expected drag, hampering the aircraft's maximum speed. Further refinements to the aerodynamic profile yielded little improvement. Positive test results in other areas, including <b>payload,</b> <b>range,</b> and V/STOL performance, led to the award of a development contract in 1979. The contract stipulated a procurement of 12 aircraft initially, followed by a further 324.|$|E
500|$|The Hercules {{represented}} a huge {{improvement over the}} C-47 in <b>payload,</b> <b>range,</b> speed and manoeuvrability, as well as offering cabin pressurisation, short-takeoff-and-landing capability, and bulk loading and despatch via its rear cargo door. The Government expressed concern over the price, at one stage proposing the purchase of only three aircraft, but eventually the Air Force won approval for the twelve that it wanted. Described by the official history of the post-war RAAF as {{second only to the}} General Dynamics F-111C as the [...] "most significant" [...] acquisition by the Air Force, the Hercules gave the Australian military its first strategic airlift capability, which in years to come would provide a [...] "lifeline" [...] for deployments to Malaya, Vietnam, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Australia was the first country other than the United States to operate the Hercules. The RAAF's C-130As were also the last of this variant to be built.|$|E
50|$|The Eurostar E3000 {{satellite}} model {{currently available}} offers power <b>payload</b> <b>ranging</b> from 4 to 15 kW. Satellites launch mass usually ranges between 4,000 and 6,000 kg.|$|R
50|$|The Crafter Chassis and Double Cabs have <b>payloads</b> <b>ranging</b> from 1472 to 3026 kg, {{and come}} in Gross Vehicle Weights (GVW) of either 3.5 or 5.3 tonnes.|$|R
50|$|The Thrust-Augmented Thor (TAT) {{was used}} with the Agena upper stage, as was the Thrust-Augmented Long Tank Thor/Agena, capable of sending <b>payloads</b> <b>ranging</b> from 1400 to about 2800 pounds into 100 nmi km polar {{circular}} orbits.|$|R
500|$|The {{official}} {{history of}} the post-war Air Force described the Hercules as [...] "probably the biggest step-up in aircraft capabilities" [...] the RAAF ever received, considering it roughly four times {{as effective as the}} Dakota, taking into account the improvements in <b>payload,</b> <b>range,</b> and speed. When No.78 (Fighter) Wing and its two CAC Sabre squadrons deployed to RAAF Base Butterworth between October 1958 and February 1959, seven Dakotas were required to ferry the staff and equipment of No.3 Squadron from Australia to Malaya, compared to two Hercules for No.77 Squadron. In 1962, Air Movements and Training Flight (AMTF), previously under No.38 Squadron and responsible for developing and imparting new techniques in aerial transport, came directly under the control of No.86 Wing headquarters. That December, the Hercules carried troops into a combat zone for the first time, when one of No.36 Squadron's C-130s joined a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo {{at the beginning of the}} Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia; similar missions were undertaken for another five years.|$|E
500|$|No.36 Squadron {{handed over}} its six Dakotas to No.38 Squadron in July 1958, prior to re-equipping with the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. [...] It {{returned}} to Richmond in August, {{followed by the}} rest of No.86 Wing a month later. After conversion training of its personnel in the United States, No.36 Squadron became the first non-US operator of the Hercules in December 1958, when it began taking delivery of twelve C-130As; deliveries completed in March 1959. The official history of the post-war Air Force described the Hercules as [...] "probably the biggest step-up in aircraft capabilities" [...] the RAAF had ever received, considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota, taking into account the improvements in <b>payload,</b> <b>range,</b> and speed. In September 1960, No.36 Squadron began parachute trials on the Hercules. It made the Hercules' first troop-carrying flights into a combat zone in December 1962, joining a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo {{at the onset of the}} Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia; similar missions were undertaken over the next five years. The squadron was again awarded the Gloucester Cup in 1963.|$|E
500|$|On 20April 1954, No.86 Wing was {{transferred}} to RAAF Base Canberra to help satisfy the Federal government's VIP transport needs. There No.486 Squadron maintained two Convair Metropolitans, as well as Dakotas. The squadron returned to Richmond on 29August 1958 {{in anticipation of the}} entry into RAAF service of the Lockheed C-130A Hercules. The official history of the post-war Air Force described the Hercules as [...] "probably the biggest step-up in aircraft capabilities" [...] the RAAF had ever received, considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota, taking into account the improvements in <b>payload,</b> <b>range,</b> and speed. [...] The Hercules was also the first turboprop aircraft operated by the RAAF. The arrival of the C-130 meant that for a time No.486 Squadron was maintaining three types of transport aircraft: Hercules, Dakotas and Metropolitans. Heavier maintenance and upgrades to the Hercules were carried out by No.2 Aircraft Depot, also based at Richmond. The availability of Lockheed spare parts from the US caused problems for No.486 Squadron early in the C-130A's Australian service, grounding one aircraft for almost a year.|$|E

500|$|The RAAF's twelve C-130As {{were picked}} up by their newly trained Australian pilots from the Lockheed factory at Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia, and ferried to Australia in three groups between December 1958 and March 1959. No.36 Squadron, located at RAAF Base Richmond, became the first unit to operate the new aircraft. Almost {{immediately}} they established regular courier services within Australia and to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaya. These flights primarily involved transporting cargo, as Chief of the Air Staff Frederick Scherger directed in 1959 that the RAAF would continue to rely on chartered civil airliners to move military personnel {{on the grounds that}} these aircraft were better suited to the task and in wartime all the C-130s would be needed to supply troops near the front lines. In February 1960 a Hercules flew the RAAF's first AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles from the United States to Butterworth to equip the CAC Sabre fighters based there. Crew training was rigorous, and from mid-1960 involved the use of a simulator. Only seasoned transport pilots flew the Hercules in its early years of service, generally having undertaken a tour of duty with No.38 Squadron's Dakotas. The official history of the post-war Air Force described the Hercules as [...] "probably the biggest step-up in aircraft capabilities" [...] the RAAF had ever received, considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota, taking into account the improvements in <b>payload,</b> <b>range,</b> and speed.

The Hercules were the first turboprop aircraft operated by the RAAF. They were serviced by No.486 Maintenance Squadron, with deeper maintenance and upgrades carried out by No.2 Aircraft Depot (No.2 AD), both units being based at Richmond. The availability of spare parts from the US caused problems early on, grounding one C-130A for almost a year.|$|E

50|$|Both three- and four-engine {{variants}} {{would therefore}} have provided useful payload capacities (Saturn C-3) intermediate between the Saturn IB and Saturn V, and re-using Saturn V components would reduce costs and simplify ground operations compared to building {{an entirely new}} launcher in that <b>payload</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The series 30 and 40 {{were the}} longer-range [...] "international" [...] versions. The main visible {{difference}} between the models is that the series 10 has three sets of landing gear (one front and two main) while the series 30 and 40 have an additional centerline main gear. The center main two-wheel landing gear (which extends {{from the center of}} the fuselage) was added to distribute the extra weight and for additional braking. The series 30 had a typical load range of 6,220 mi (10,010 km) and a maximum <b>payload</b> <b>range</b> of 4,604 mi (7,410 km).

50|$|On 13 September 2016, ILS {{announced}} the Proton Medium and Proton Light variants {{designed to reduce}} the cost for launching medium and small commercial communications satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit. ILS officials said that Krunichev had been developing these for more than a year. The variants use a 2+1 stage architecture based on 3 stage Proton+Briz M, but dispensing with the 2nd stage and featuring minor lengthening of the other two stages. The Proton Light 1st stage uses 4 main engines and external tanks to the 6 used by Proton Medium and Proton-M. The cost was expected to be competitive with Ariane and SpaceX. The Proton Medium is to debut in 2018 and the Proton Light in 2019. They are expected to use Baikonur launch complex 81/24 and will require a new transporter-erector system and other ground infrastructure changes. The full-sized Proton-M can currently lift 6.3 Tonnes into a standard Geostationary Transfer Orbit; Proton Medium will be able to lift 5 tonnes into a similar GTO while Proton Light is capable of delivering 3.6 Tonnes. The 3-5 tonne <b>payload</b> <b>range</b> includes all-electric and hybrid satellites that use ion thrusters to slowly make their way into Geostationary Orbit. The new variants are expanding the Proton <b>payload</b> <b>range</b> to adequately compete with Falcon 9 expendable and recoverable options, or with Ariane 5 lower and upper berths.|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} set {{of operating}} cost relationships are presented for airship transports. The {{starting point for}} the development of the relationships is the direct operating cost formulae and the indirect operating cost categories commonly used for estimating costs of heavier than air commercial transports. Modifications are made to the relationships to account for the unique features of airships. To illustrate the cost estimating method, the operating costs of selected airship cargo transports are computed. Conventional fully buoyant and hybrid semi-buoyant systems are investigated for a variety of speeds, <b>payloads,</b> <b>ranges,</b> and altitudes.
