He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more <b>practical</b> <b>to</b> create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E

An editor for the libertarian monthly Reason also speculated about the usefulness of the detailed information to government investigators.

40|$|Fifty-one {{subjects}} with visual field defects {{were trained to}} use compensatory viewing strategies. The subjects were referred to the training program by an official driving examiner of the Dutch Central Bureau of Driving Licenses. Three training programs were compared: laboratory training, mobility training, and motor traffic training. Viewing behavior, visual attention, and <b>practical</b> fitness <b>to</b> drive were assessed before and after training. <b>Practical</b> fitness <b>to</b> drive was assessed on the road {{as well as in}} a driving simulator. It was observed that compensatory viewing behavior and <b>practical</b> fitness <b>to</b> drive could be improved by training. Subjects in the motor traffic training showed a small advantage with regard <b>to</b> <b>practical</b> fitness <b>to</b> drive, suggesting that training is task-specific and that generalization is limited. The effect of visual field defect on viewing behavior and <b>practical</b> fitness <b>to</b> drive was analyzed separately for {{subjects with}} central or peripheral visual field defects. It was observed that none of the outcome measures differed between the central and peripheral visual field defect groups. ...|$|R
5|$|Refusing to {{surrender}} until all options had been exhausted, Willoughby dispatched boats to Sirius, asking Pym if {{he believed it}} would be <b>practical</b> <b>to</b> send boats to tow Nereide out of range. Pym replied that with the boats engaged in attempting to tow Sirius and Magicienne off the reef {{it was not possible}} to deploy them under fire to tow Nereide. Pym also suggested that Willoughby disembark his men and set fire to his ship in the hope that the flames would spread to the French ships clustered on shore. Willoughby refused this suggestion as it was not <b>practical</b> <b>to</b> disembark the dozens of wounded men aboard Nereide in the growing darkness and refused to personally abandon his men when Pym ordered him to transfer to Sirius. At 11:00 pm, Willoughby ordered a boat to row to Bellone and notify the French commander that he had surrendered. However, Willoughby's boat had been holed by shot and was unable to make the short journey. The message was instead conveyed by French prisoners from Nereide who had dived overboard and reached the shore during the night. Recalling the false flags used on 20 August, Bouvet resolved to wait until morning before accepting the surrender.|$|E
5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel hair, angora, cashmere, and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and <b>practical</b> <b>to</b> the most elegant and expensive.|$|E
5|$|Thus, in the {{presence}} of the inhibitor, the enzyme's effective Km and Vmax become (α/α')Km and (1/α')Vmax, respectively. However, the modified Michaelis-Menten equation assumes that binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme has reached equilibrium, which may be a very slow process for inhibitors with sub-nanomolar dissociation constants. In these cases, it is usually more <b>practical</b> <b>to</b> treat the tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate Ki' kinetically if Ki is measured independently.|$|E

5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not <b>practical</b> <b>to</b> extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E
5|$|Elcor sat atop {{a bed of}} {{taconite}} {{consisting of}} a uniform mixture of about 30% iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore, {{a part of the}} Biwabik iron formation. The Biwabik iron formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era {{on the bottom of the}} Animikie Sea. This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range. Michigan's steel-blue high grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was soft brown hematite. There is iron in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are <b>practical</b> <b>to</b> mine.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 1943, Oliphant {{wrote to}} Appleton {{to say that}} he had been {{considering}} the problem of electromagnetic isotope separation, and believed that he had devised a better method than Lawrence's, one which would result in a five to tenfold improvement in efficiency, and make it more <b>practical</b> <b>to</b> use the process in Britain. His proposal was reviewed by Akers, Chadwick, Peierls and Simon, who agreed that it was sound. While the majority of scientific opinion in Britain favoured the gaseous diffusion method, there was still a possibility that electromagnetic separation might be useful as a final stage in the enrichment process, taking uranium that had already been enriched to 50 per cent by the gaseous process, and enriching it to pure uranium-235. Accordingly, Oliphant was released from the radar project to work on Tube Alloys, conducting experiments on his method at the University of Birmingham.|$|E

5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be <b>practical.</b> <b>To</b> ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E
5|$|In a 2003 article, Milner {{noted that}} the teeth of Baryonyx were {{very similar to those}} of the genus Suchosaurus and {{suggested}} that their remains represented the same animal. The type species of the genus, S. cultridens, was named in 1841 based on teeth from Tilgate Forest in Sussex; a second species, S. girardi, was named in 1897 based on jaw fragments and a tooth from Boca do Chapim. In 2007 Buffetaut considered the teeth of S. girardi very similar to those of Baryonyx (and S. cultridens) except for the stronger development of the crown ribs, suggesting that the remains belonged to the same genus. Buffetaut agreed with Milner that the teeth of S. cultridens were almost identical to those of B. walkeri, but with a ribbier surface. The former taxon might be a senior synonym of the latter (since it was published first), depending on whether the differences were within a taxon or between different ones. According to Buffetaut, since the holotype specimen of S. cultridens is one worn tooth and that of B. walkeri is a skeleton it would be more <b>practical</b> <b>to</b> retain the newer name. In 2011 Portuguese palaeontologist Octávio Mateus and colleagues agreed that Suchosaurus was closely related to Baryonyx, but considered both species in the former genus nomina dubia (dubious names) since their holotype specimens were not considered diagnostic (lacking distinguishing features) and could not be definitely equated with other taxa.|$|E
