5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E

5|$|News {{arrived from}} eastern Albania that the Ottomans had {{initiated}} massacres in the area. The pope was distressed by this {{and called on}} the Christian princes of Europe to aid Skanderbeg. Soon after, Mehmed's men marched into Albania. Unlike his father Murad II, Mehmed considered {{that the only way}} Albania could be conquered would be through isolating Krujë, the main Albanian fortress, by reducing Skanderbeg's manpower, supplies, and <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> backing. Afterwards, Krujë would be put under siege. The Ottoman campaign was thus sent in two directions: one through the Shkumbin River valley and another through the Black Drin River valley. Both fielded men in the frontier regions, right and left of both valleys, and would engage in massacring the local populations, raiding inhabited areas, and burning every village which offered resistance. The populations thus decided to flee into safe areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} was {{opposed by the}} governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth. Religious, legal, <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> objections were raised. As British monarch, Edward was the nominal head of the Church of England, which did not then allow divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still alive. For this reason, it was widely believed that Edward could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne. Simpson was perceived to be politically and socially unsuitable as a prospective queen consort because of her two failed marriages. It was widely assumed by the Establishment that she was driven by love of money or position rather than love for the King. Despite the opposition, Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her whether his governments approved or not.|$|E

25|$|It was {{alarming}} {{that in just}} a {{few months}} after the Sandinista revolution, Nicaragua received international acclaim for its rapid progress in the fields of literacy and health. It was alarming that a socialist-mixed-economy state could do in a few short months what the Somoza dynasty, a U.S. client state, could not do in 45 years! It was truly alarming that the Sandinistas were intent on providing the very services that establish a government's <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> legitimacy.|$|E
25|$|A {{deceased}} emperor held {{worthy of}} the honor could be voted a state divinity (divus, plural divi) by the Senate and elevated as such {{in an act of}} apotheosis. The granting of apotheosis served religious, <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> judgment on Imperial rulers and allowed living Emperors to associate themselves with a well-regarded lineage of Imperial divi from which unpopular or unworthy predecessors were excluded. This proved a useful instrument to Vespasian in his establishment of the Flavian Imperial Dynasty following the death of Nero and civil war, and to Septimius in his consolidation of the Severan dynasty after the assassination of Commodus. In the development of Imperial rule from Principate to Dominate, the role of the Senate was increasingly marginalised and military loyalty became the key to Imperial authority.|$|E

25|$|Churchill {{received}} him in trademark fashion: in bed, {{wearing an}} embroidered dressing gown, smoking a cigar. He, Joseph Stalin, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had discussed {{the matter of}} Yugoslavia at a recent conference in Teheran, and had decided to give all possible support to the Partisans. This was the turning point. The Chetniks were given a task (a bridge to blow up) and a deadline, to show whether they could still be effective allies; they failed this test and supplies were re-directed from them to the Partisans. The British government was left with the tricky <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> problem of King Peter and his royalist government in exile. But the main issues were air supplies and air support, and to help co-ordinate this, Maclean's mission was expanded. Some of the new officers included Andrew Maxwell of the Scots Guards, John Clarke of the 2nd Scots Guards, Geoffrey Kup, a gunnery expert, Hilary King, a signals officer, Johnny Tregida, and, for a time, Randolph Churchill. Some of these were SAS or otherwise known from the Western Desert Campaign the previous year.|$|E

500|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on <b>Political</b> <b>and</b> <b>Moral</b> Subjects (1792), {{written by}} the 18th-century British proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, {{is one of the}} {{earliest}} works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should have an education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be [...] "companions" [...] to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.|$|E

Here it is pertinent to note that {{it is very important to}} assess personality according to his deeds. Each person has the vision of the concept of " value", which is not formed by itself it is made on the basis of norms, concepts, moral relations, transmitted from generation to generation through the h istorical experience. Monitoring of normative behavior of personality is not a reckless submission standards, it examines the various forms of behavior within a framework. Personality does not simply follow moral standards; on the contrary, it is active an d inquisitive in mastering and applying them in practice...|$|R

500|$|Manstein's war memoir, Verlorene Siege (Lost Victories), was {{published}} in West Germany in 1955 and translated into English in 1958 for worldwide distribution. The book was a highly acclaimed best-seller, critical of Hitler and his leadership style. Historians such as Liddell Hart saw Manstein's emphasis on the purely military aspects of the war, while ignoring the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> aspects, {{as a way for}} him to absolve himself and the high command of any responsibility for the events of the Holocaust. His favourable [...] portrayal of himself influenced popular opinion; he became the centre of a military cult which cast him not only as one of Germany's greatest generals, but also one of the greatest in history. He {{has been described as a}} militärische Kult- und Leitfigur ("military cult figure and leading personality"), a general of legendary — almost mythical — ability, much honoured by both the public and historians. Biographers, including Benoît Lemay, feel that his narrow focus on military matters to the exclusion of moral issues cannot be considered ethical.|$|E
