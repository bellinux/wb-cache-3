5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Tissaphernes {{had arrived in}} the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, {{bringing}} gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape and resume command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
5|$|Boise State {{came into}} the game {{averaging}} 42.75points and 475.67yards per game, the fourth and twelfth highest totals in college football. Senior quarterback Taylor Tharp led the offense by more than 3,000yards and 28 touchdowns, headed into the 2007 Hawaii Bowl. On the ground, the Broncos were led by junior running back Ian Johnson, who had 17touchdowns and 1,030yards in the regular season. Wide receiver Jeremy Childs also was a potent threat on offense, averaging 87.08receiving yards per game, and backup running back D.J. Harper rushed for 41.44yards per game on average. Johnson and Childs both earned First Team All-WAC honors, and Tharp was named to Second Team All-WAC. Offensive tackle Ryan Clady was the team's only All-American, and <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a good job protecting Taylor Tharp on the offensive line.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{during the}} time when Chris and Stewie {{were lost in the}} woods, Chris {{promises}} to ask out Ellen, a school classmate with Down syndrome. After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on how to act through a prolonged musical number. During the date, Ellen turns out to be pushy and demanding, and the relationship quickly falls apart. Chris admits that he had bought into a stereotype of people with Down syndrome being different, and she breaks up with him. Stewie consoles Chris by congratulating him for demonstrating courage, in asking her out on a date, as he had <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

5|$|The scandal {{began as}} an {{operation}} to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything {{in their power to}} achieve the release of the hostages. Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista, or Contras, in Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seas}} off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous {{efforts to protect}} their captures; Corona was heavily on fire in {{consequence}} of her engagement with Active and the British prize crew fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the blazing mainmast collapsed. Problems were also experienced aboard Bellona, where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light the fuse. The officer <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their {{attention}} to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the fifteen-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of the Notre Dame de Paris. Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. The couple married in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the second ceremony, to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons were opposed to the king's marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England. Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Vigorous {{opposition}} to the occupation continued, nevertheless, and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President Warren G. Harding (1921–23), Wilson's successor, worked {{to put an end}} to the occupation, as he had <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> during his campaign. The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.|$|E
25|$|No further {{constitutional}} {{reform was}} proposed until Labour returned {{to power in}} a landslide electoral victory in 1997, when a second Scottish devolution referendum was held; as Labour's 1997 manifesto had <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Clear majorities expressed support for both a devolved Scottish Parliament and that Parliament having the power to vary the basic rate of income tax. The Scotland Act 1998 established the new Scottish Parliament, first elected on Thursday 6 May 1999, with power to legislate on unreserved matters within Scotland.|$|E
25|$|After {{his failure}} to win the Italian {{championship}} with Fiorentina, Batistuta started considering a transfer to a bigger team. In {{an effort to keep}} Batistuta, Fiorentina hired Giovanni Trapattoni as coach and <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything to win the Scudetto. After an excellent start to the season, Batistuta suffered an injury that kept him out of action for more than a month. Losing momentum, Fiorentina lost the lead and finished the season in third place, although the result enabled them to participate in the Champions League the following season.|$|E

25|$|Most executions {{worldwide}} {{take place}} in Asia. China is the world's most active death penalty country. North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong-un constantly uses capital punishment against his opponents. In Islamic countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, the numbers of executions are also very high. Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan belong to the few industrialized countries that have the death penalty (South Korea has a moratorium). In 2017 Mongolia repealed the death penalty, but some countries are seeing {{a return to the}} practice; in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte wants to restore executions, and Turkish President Recep Erdogan has <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so after the 2017 constitutional referendum. India executes criminals only in extreme cases. Only 26 executions have taken place in India since 1991.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 1862, in a {{rowing boat}} {{travelling}} on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow {{for a picnic}} outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story. As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole. The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Mr. Dodgson {{to write it down}} for her. He <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.|$|E

Her draught at full load exceeded the contract specification by , meaning that either her specialized hull form could not be fully utilized in icebreaking or the coal capacity would have to be reduced, affecting her range and endurance. However, the shipyard <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything it could to reduce the draught of the vessel to an acceptable level and Murtaja, the largest and most powerful European icebreaker at that time, was delivered to the owner on 30 March 1890. She left the shipyard on the following day and headed to Helsinki, where she was welcomed by a large cheering crowd on 2 April 1890.|$|E

25|$|There was no written {{agreement}} governing {{the terms of}} the partnership, and Brayne and Burbage soon fell out. Brayne, who was now childless, failed to revise his will to leave his interest in the Theatre to James Burbage's children, as he had <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and Burbage failed to grant Brayne a half interest in the 21-year ground lease which he had signed with Giles Allen on 13 April 1576, and kept it solely in his own name. On 9 August 1577 an assignment of lease was drawn up, and on 22 May 1578 Burbage signed a bond in the amount of £400 requiring him to assign a half interest in the ground lease to Brayne, but this was never done. Brayne accused Burbage of double-dealing, and in the following month the partners submitted their dispute to arbitration by two friends, in the course of which Burbage struck Brayne and they fell to fisticuffs. On 12 July 1578 the arbitrators submitted the articles containing their decision, and both Burbage and Brayne signed bonds in the amount of £200 as a guarantee of performance.|$|E
25|$|Information on the {{fourteen}} most prominent Class A war criminals, {{which included the}} prime ministers and top generals from the war era, was forwarded to the shrine in 1966, and the shrine passed a resolution to enshrine these individuals in 1970. The timing for their enshrinement was left to the discretion of head priest Fujimaro Tsukuba, who delayed the enshrinement through his death in March 1978. His successor Nagayoshi Matsudaira, who rejected the Tokyo war crimes tribunal's verdicts, enshrined the Class A war criminals in a secret ceremony in 1978. Emperor Hirohito, who visited the shrine as recently as 1975, was privately displeased with the action, and subsequently refused to visit the shrine. The details of the enshrinement of war criminals eventually became public in 1979, but there was minimal controversy about the issue for several years. No Emperor of Japan has visited Yasukuni since 1975, although the Emperor and Empress still continue to attend the National Memorial Service for War Dead annually. The head-priest Junna Nakata at Honzen-ji Temple (of the Shingon sect Daigo-ha) requested the pontiff Pope Paul VI to say a Mass for the repose of {{the souls of the}} 1,618 men condemned as Class A, B and C war criminals, and he <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. In 1980, Pope John Paul II complied, and a mass was held in St. Peter's Basilica for the 1,618 war criminals.|$|E
500|$|He {{commanded}} the company's 1st Battery at Fleurbaix, Messines {{and on the}} Somme until 5 August, when he was wounded in a duel with a German officer at Pozières. He and a German officer—who was leading an attack against Cherry's position—were exchanging shots from neighbouring shell-holes. Eventually, they both rose, firing simultaneously. The German officer hit Cherry in the neck but was mortally wounded by Cherry in return. Cherry approached the dying man, who pulled a package of letters from his pocket, and asked Cherry to have them censored and posted. Cherry <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so and the German handed over the letters, with the words; [...] "And so it ends". He died shortly afterwards.

500|$|Sheppard and Lapsley's {{activities}} in Africa were enabled {{by the very}} man whose atrocities Sheppard would later attempt to expose. The pair traveled to London in 1890 {{en route to the}} Congo; while there, Lapsley met General Henry Shelton Sanford, an American ally of King Leopold II and friend of a friend of Lapsley's father. Sanford <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "everything in his power" [...] to help the pair, even arranging an audience with King Leopold when Lapsley visited him in Belgium. Neither the secular Sanford nor the Catholic Leopold were interested in the Presbyterians' work; the latter was eager to have them make inroads into his newly acquired territory, both {{to begin the process of}} [...] "civilizing" [...] the natives and to legitimize his rule. The missionaries were, however, oblivious of Leopold's true motives.|$|E

William {{had made}} known earlier that a military intervention, {{for which he}} had been assembling forces, would be conditional on such an invitation. At first, William was still reluctant; possibly he was jealous of his wife's position as the heiress to the English Crown and feared she would become more powerful than he was. According to Gilbert Burnet, however, Mary convinced her husband that she did not care for political power, and told him [...] "she would be no more but his wife, and that she would do all that lay in her power to make him King for life". She would, she assured him, always obey her husband as she had <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in her marriage vows.|$|E
500|$|On August 26, George H. W. Bush toured devastated {{areas of}} Louisiana with Governor Edwin Edwards.

After his visit to Louisiana, President Bush declared only Terrebonne Parish as a disaster area, but later included 34 other parishes under this declaration. FEMA initially opened five field offices throughout Louisiana. These centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid. After Franklin mayor Sam Jones and Congressman Billy Tauzin criticized FEMA for failing to open a field office in Franklin, FEMA <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.
