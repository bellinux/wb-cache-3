Past researches in show that by adopting information systems we can increase firm performance. Results discovered that by adopting accounting information system there is significant improvement in performance. Accounting information system (AIS) is a superior system that focuses on user-orientation. Core objective of AIS is to collect and record data and information that is concerned to events that can economically impact upon firms. It processes information and communicate this useful information to internal and external stakeholders. This study intends to find the effects of Accounting Information system (AIS) on profitability of Pakistani firms.

40|$|International audienceManufacturing {{units in}} so called high-cost {{countries}} are struggling under fierce competition {{on the global}} market. In order to survive, the factory needs to generate profit to its owners. Profitability can be reached {{in many different ways}} apart from only lowering the employees' salaries. It can be improved through increased profit margins (sales in relation to costs) or with an increased capital turnover rate. Finding ways to free capacity and to improve flexibility in order to increase sales is often more interesting to the manufacturing companies than cutting the direct salary costs. A model for analysing profitability of a manufacturing unit is proposed. It is found on a production system analysis and combines in-depth production engineering analysis with economical accounting analysis of the factory. The manual work tasks are of special interest and the productivity of selected bottleneck work areas are analysed thoroughly. The model is intended for use by two industrial analysts during a one-week study. Simulation of different improvement scenarios is carried out and presented to the factory management {{at the end of the}} <b>profitability</b> <b>study.</b> A software implementation is required in order to generate the model, collect data, and make simulation within the intended time.

We test the relationship of hybrid seed use with six indicators of economic well-being. After using the control function/instrumental variables approach to test for the endogeneity of hybrid seed use, we estimate correlated random effects (CRE) fractional response, CRE Tobit, and fixed effects models with a panel of nationally representative data collected in 2002 / 3 and 2006 / 7. Findings suggest that use of maize hybrids is associated with higher values of household income, assets, farm and processing equipment, and livestock, and less deprivation compared to other farmers in nearby villages. 1...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays mining {{prosperity}} depends {{largely on}} the stability of underground structures. It is then necessary to know {{the configuration of the}} deposits. Which means analyze and understand the behavior of enclosing land during Operation Ore. The Geotechnical study is based on the behavioral aspects of rheological and mechanical response of the rock mass Mine Draa Sfar, the digging of galleries and various infrastructures works necessary for mining. Thus, the comparison between usual failure criteria and geo-mechanical characterization of the rock matrix focused on the peculiarity of the facies of the mine that are attacked by the schistosity and other structural deformations. Thus, we first conducted a sizing of major operating structures according to Long Holes method. It is, in fact, operating rooms. Then, it was verified the stability of proposed designs for different infrastructure galleries. Then it was important to consider support systems for mining these components. Therefore, we must return to examine the stability of blocks generated by the joints families found after a statistical statement processing discontinuity plans on ground.

40|$|Publisher横浜Student final reports Group 13 As GPS {{embedded}} smart {{phones are}} becoming increasingly available, many location-based services are penetrating the market. Furthermore, the ubiquitous nature of social networks is allowing for a collective power to transform the way we make decisions. Their combination {{in the form of}} Mobile Location Based Social Network Services is, not surprisingly, proving to be the new killer business that combines both physical and virtual spaces in a real-time user environment. In this report, we dive into this market to identify the role that a service based on a seamless indoor and outdoor positioning technology called IMES (Indoor Messaging System) could play in this market. What we find is that the value of accurate indoor positioning technology lies not just in the extension of existing services to an indoor environment, but it also allows one to attain categorically different information from the behavioral patterns of people. Having information on both indoor and outdoor location makes it possible to build a mapping and profile of someone's lifestyle. Creating the possibility to provide people with more personalized information both in a non-commercial and commercial fashion. We therefore present the business concept of the 'first', lifestyle enhancing, location-based social network service. Having performed research on the market of location-based services, (growing at 50 % year-over-year, to a worth of $ 13. 4 Billion in 2014 worldwide and $ 1. 7 Billion in just Japan, that's a 142 Billion Japanese Yen) analyzed the opportunities within this market, (competitors are quickly entering and while not much can be said about their staying power they have yet to find the power of seamless indoor-outdoor positioning systems) found untapped market trends, (consumers want personalized information, to be aware of their choices and be able to make better choices, but cannot yet by most location-based services [...] . we designed the business concept.) and calculated net present value in a <b>profitability</b> <b>study,</b> (showing a profitable base case for development and implementation of our business concept) we arrived at the following recommendation. Dive even deeper into this emerging market of (mobile) location-based services and by the use of the methods presented throughout this report finalize this concept to an implementation ready business plan.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} air route profitability in the European Union and the cooperating countries of Norway and Switzerland. Building {{on the assumption that}} only profitable routes are served, I develop a set of probit models that specify route service as a function of route characteristics, airline networks' attributes, airline partnerships and competition. Estimation results show that route profitability increases with population size and decreases with flight distance and the time efficiency of car travel relative to air travel. An airline's airport presence, that is, its share of airport operations, exerts a significant, positive effect on its route profitability, and so does airport presence of its group or allied partners. Competitive effects are asymmetric across airline business types. This paper's contribution to existing airline-route <b>profitability</b> <b>studies</b> lies in accounting for airline cooperation, controlling for an alternative mode of transport, and using EU data for estimation...|$|R
