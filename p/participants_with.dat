5|$|After the Series, Ruth and {{teammates}} Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy {{participated in a}} barnstorming tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from replicating the Series and undermining its value. Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined them their 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the rule was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series <b>participants,</b> <b>with</b> Landis's permission required.|$|E
5|$|Luis Gómez, an El Pais writer, {{believed}} that the route was designed to benefit the Italian <b>participants,</b> <b>with</b> there being three individual time trials, the team time trial being flat, and most stages being primarily flat.

La Stampas Gian Paolo Ormezzano thought overall easiness of the course — the few mountains and summit finishes — added some mystery as to who could win.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} Egyptians, {{all of whom}} qualified {{through the}} B standard, competed in field events. Omar Ahmed El Ghazaly, in the discus, was the most experienced of the quartet, with senior international medals going back to bronze at the 2002 African Championships in Athletics, in addition to past Olympic appearances in 2004 and 2008. In London he finished 26th among 41 <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> a best throw of 60.26 meters. Ihab Abdelrahman, in the javelin throw, had missed the 2008 Summer Olympics, despite having been a silver medalist at the 2007 Pan Arab Games, but had won the event at the 2010 African Championships and the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London he placed 28th out of 44 competitors with a best throw of 77.35 meters. Mostafa Al-Gamel, in the hammer throw, was the gold medalist from the 2011 All-African Games and a silver medalist from the 2008 African Championships and the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London he was 27th among 41 <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> a best throw of 71.36 meters. Mohamed Fathalla Difallah, who had come in fourth at the 2011 All-Africa Games, was 37th out of 41 competitors in the qualifying round of the long jump in London, with a distance of 7.08 meters, and did not advance to the final.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards prices when they were secretly manipulated to match subjects’ birthday dates, thus resulting in a higher chance of purchase. However a second study using birth year as price did not lead to the same result. A study of the liking of products found that <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> high self-esteem liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} if a <b>participant</b> <b>with</b> cerebral palsy displays a deficit in movement planning for simple pointing and gesture {{actions that are}} required to interact with a touchscreen. We performed a repeated measures case study <b>with</b> one <b>participant</b> <b>with</b> CP, and one typically developed (TD) participant. Measurements of the relative timing of eye and hand movements were made {{to see how they}} vary when participants have the opportunity to preplan a movement (by knowing where a target will appear), and to see if they were repeatable. As expected, the typically developed participant changed their coordination patterns when they could preplan a movement. This did not occur for the <b>participant</b> <b>with</b> cerebral palsy and suggests he has a reduced ability to preplan movements, or at least a preference to avoid doing so. This implies gesture based interaction to imagined targets could be less accessible to people with cerebral palsy. Visual affordances may help overcome this potential barrier. The relative timing of movements varied from session to session for the <b>participant</b> <b>with</b> CP, but not the TD participant...|$|R

She finished last with a time of 13.28seconds. Nicaraguan runner Jessica Aguilera placed ahead of Kwalea (13.15seconds), while Andorra's Montserrat Pujol ranked ahead of Aguilera (12.73seconds).

In 1966 the El Salvador football team took part in the Central American and Caribbean Games for the sixth time in a competition that took place in Puerto Rico. The national team participated alongside seven other teams, finishing in fourth place. In 1968 El Salvador qualified for the Olympic Games for the first time. They lost 4–0 to Hungary, 3–1 to Israel, and tied 1–1 with Ghana. The coach by this time was Rigoberto Guzmán.|$|E
