50|$|The Barbed <b>Wire</b> <b>Patent</b> Case, 143 U.S. 275 was a {{significant}} patent dispute in 1892 between plaintiff Joseph Glidden and the USPTO regarding the right of barbed wire. Lucian Smith was the original inventor in 1867 and held patent rights for it, with Glidden making changes to it in 1874 that he believed were novelty enough to merit a new invention and thus new patent.|$|R
5000|$|In 1916 {{while at}} Bell Telephone Laboratories, he co-created with Herman Affel, {{the first modern}} coaxial cable, which {{paved the way for}} television. The cable {{advanced}} long distance telephone service, making it possible to carry thousands of simultaneous phone calls on long distance circuits. In 1924, he invented the radio altimeter.

25|$|Barbed wire {{is a type}} of fencing wire {{constructed}} with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strands. It is used to construct inexpensive fences and is used atop walls surrounding secured property. It is also a major feature of the fortifications in trench warfare. A person or animal trying to pass through or over barbed wire will suffer discomfort and possibly injury. Barbed wire fencing requires only fence posts, wire, and fixing devices such as staples. On June 25, 1867, Lucien B. Smith of Kent, Ohio, <b>patented</b> barbed <b>wire.</b> Shortly thereafter, several other inventors, such as Joseph F. Glidden of DeKalb, Illinois, patented inventions for similar products, but Smith patented his first, allowing him to claim that he invented barbed wire.|$|R
5|$|The Joseph F. Glidden House {{is located}} in the United States in the DeKalb County, Illinois city of DeKalb. It was the home to the famed {{inventor}} of barbed wire Joseph Glidden. The barn, still located on the property near several commercial buildings, is said to be where Glidden perfected his improved version of barbed wire which would eventually transform him into a successful entrepreneur. The Glidden House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The home was designed by another barbed <b>wire</b> <b>patent</b> holder in DeKalb, Jacob Haish.|$|R
50|$|Heselden {{grew up in}} the Halton Moor {{district}} of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. At the age of 15, Heselden left Osmondthorpe Secondary Modern School to work as a labourer and then at collieries in Temple Newsam and Lofthouse. He lost his job in the wave of redundancies that followed the 1984-85 miners' strike and spent his redundancy money on renting a workshop and, at first, setting up a sandblasting business. He then worked on developing and <b>patenting</b> a collapsible <b>wire</b> mesh and fabric container, now called Hesco bastion, to be used for building flood management and to limit erosion.|$|R
5000|$|Cottancin {{did not use}} heavy bars within thin {{layers of}} concrete, but {{dissipated}} force by using wire meshes and nets distributed throughout the material.His 1889 <b>patent</b> was for <b>wire</b> mesh embedded in 50 mm concrete slabs, supported by [...] "spinal stiffeners", or triangulated ribs.With his iron or steel trellises he could make plane or curved shapes. The structures that employed his designs typically have plate-like arches and struts. Cottancin also experimented with hollow masonry laced with wires and filled with cement. The bricks have the same compression strength as the cement, while the wires resist extension. Using bricks avoids the need to build and remove forms for the cement.|$|R
50|$|Isaac L. Ellwood came {{onto the}} scene after Texas was ravaged by terrible drought and blizzards during the late 1880s. Ellwood was {{co-owner}} of the barbed <b>wire</b> <b>patent</b> with Joseph Glidden. Ellwood bought the Spade Ranch from Evans and Warner during this time; along with his purchase came the ranch's unique brand and 800 head of cattle. Ellwood then purchased the sprawling Renderbrook Ranch from the Snyders and began to stock it with Spade cattle. In 1889, Ellwood acquired the 128,000-acre (518-km²) north pasture of the Snyder Brothers ranch and renamed it Spade Ranch, so the second Spade Ranch was born. Ellwood registered the ranch's distinctive brand in Mitchell County in 1889 and Hale and Lubbock Counties in 1891.|$|R
40|$|Pulsed Arrested Spark Discharge (PASD) is a Sandia National Laboratories <b>Patented,</b> {{non-destructive}} <b>wiring</b> {{system diagnostic}} {{that has been}} developed to detect defects in aging wiring systems in the commercial aircraft fleet. PASD was previously demonstrated on relatively controlled geometry wiring such as coaxial cables and shielded twisted-pair wiring through {{a contract with the}} U. S. navy and is discussed in a Sandia National Laboratories report, SAND 2001 - 3225 ''Pulsed Arrested Spark Discharge (PASD) Diagnostic Technique for the Location of Defects in Aging Wiring Systems''. This report describes an expansion of earlier work by applying the PASD technique to unshielded twisted-pair and discrete wire configurations commonly found in commercial aircraft. This wiring is characterized by higher impedances as well as relatively non-uniform impedance profiles that {{have been found to be}} challenging for existing aircraft wiring diagnostics. Under a three year contract let by the Federal Aviation Administration, Interagency Agreement DTFA- 03 - 00 X 90019, this technology was further developed for application on aging commercial aircraft wiring systems. This report describes results of the FAA program with discussion of previous work conducted under U. S. Department of Defense funding...|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} {{engineers}} (S. E. Bramer, Jacob Roth, F. R. S. Kaplan, Simon Loeb and William Smith, Sr.) in the Pittsburgh industrial town of Rankin, Pennsylvania first created a permanent metallurgical bond between copper and steel in 1915. This bond originally was made under a molten weld process. Their product, a CCS <b>wire</b> <b>patented</b> under {{the brand name}} Copperweld, was soon adopted {{as an alternative to}} solid copper wire in many conductor applications, particularly those where copper would be too ductile or would not offer the breaking strength of steel. The original use, however, was for watch springs: the copper cladding prevented corrosion. The company was founded as the Copper-Clad Steel Company, but in 1924, changed its name to the Copperweld Steel Company.|$|R
50|$|He created {{barbed wire}} {{by using a}} coffee mill to create the barbs. Joseph placed the barbs along a wire and then twisted another wire around it to keep the barbs in place. He {{received}} the <b>patent</b> for barbed <b>wire</b> in 1874 and was quickly embroiled in a legal battle over whether he actually invented it. He eventually won and created the Barb Fence Company in DeKalb, Illinois, making him extremely rich. By {{the time of his}} death in 1906, he was one of the richest men in America. The Dun & Bradstreet Collection, 1840-1895, MSS 791, LXIII, 130, Baker Library, Harvard, recorded his assets at one million dollars. This included the Glidden House Hotel; the DeKalb Chronicle; 3,000 acres (12 km²) of farm land in Illinois; 35,000 acres (1,360 km²) in Texas; and the Glidden Felt Pad Industry.|$|R
40|$|Ultrahigh-carbon steels (UHCSS) {{can achieve}} very high {{strengths}} in wire or rod form. These high strengths {{result from the}} mechanical work introduced during wire and rod processing. These strengths have been observed to increase with carbon content. In wire form, tensile strengths approaching 6000 MPa are predicted for UHCS containing 1. 8 %C. In this paper, we will discuss the influence of processing (including rapid transformation during <b>wire</b> <b>patenting)</b> and micros ct- ure on the mechanical behavior of UHCS wire. The tensile properties of as- extruded rods are described {{as a function of}} extrusion temperature and composition. For spheroidized steels, yield and ultimate tensile strength are a function of grain size, interparticle spacing and particle size. For pearlitic steels, yield and ultimate strength were found to be functions of colony size, carbide size and plate spacing and orientation. Alloying additions (such as C, Cr, Si, Al and Co) can influence the effect of processing on these microstructural features. For spheroidized steels, fracture was found to be a function of the size of coarse carbides and of composition...|$|R
50|$|When engaged, an {{automatic}} wire stripper first simultaneously grips the wire in {{one side and}} in the other side closes its shaped blades cutting the insulation around the conductor. After the sides have completed their strokes {{the two sides of the}} mechanism spread apart to push the cut tube of insulation from the end of the conductor. To use it, one simply places the wire in the jaws at the cutting slot matching the size of the conductor and squeezes the handles together. This device allows even a novice to strip most wires very quickly. The automatic wire stripper's cutter must be short, because it causes the jaws to twist, as described by Wood in the 1943 <b>patent.</b> All <b>wire</b> strippers are inherently limited to those wire sizes the cutting jaw notches will accommodate. An automatic wire stripper's short cutter limits it to fewer notches and a smaller range of wire sizes than most other types of wire strippers. The accuracy of the cutting blade opening determines the smallest conductor that can be reliably stripped. If the cutter opening is to small it will impinge on the conductor causing excess friction and more tension than the wire can withstand. If the cutter opening is too large the tension required to tear the remaining annulus of uncut insulation may be greater than the wire can withstand. Some models have an adjustable grip tension, to adjust the clamping force of the gripping jaw. The knob below the jaw on the yellow automatic strippers in the image below is a grip tension adjustment. Although in principle applicable to wire of any size, automatic wire strippers that are widely available have cutters that can accommodate conductors in a range of sizes no larger than 8 AWG nor smaller than 26 AWG, but not the entire range.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{electric}} utilities built by Thomas Edison {{in the early}} 1880s ran on direct current (DC) at 110 V, {{considered to be a}} [...] "safe" [...] voltage for consumers. Alternating current systems that started appearing mid decade used a high distribution voltage but stepped that down via transformers to the same 110 volt customer utilization voltage that Edison used. In 1883 Edison <b>patented</b> a three <b>wire</b> distribution system to allow DC generation plants to serve a wider radius of customers to save on copper costs. By connecting two groups of 110 volt lamps in series, more load could be served by the same size conductors run with 220 volts between them; a neutral conductor carried any imbalance of current between the two sub-circuits. AC circuits adopted the same form, allowing lamps to be run at around 120 volts and major appliances to be connected to 240 volts. Today, virtually all American homes and businesses have access to 120 and 240 volts at 60 hertz. Both voltages are available on the three wires (two [...] "hot" [...] legs and one [...] "neutral" [...] leg).|$|R
50|$|The Ford GT {{version of}} the 5.4 L is a highly {{specialized}} {{version of the}} Modular engine. It is an all-aluminum, dry-sump 5.4 L 4-valve DOHC with a Lysholm screw-type supercharger and showcases numerous technological features, such as dual fuel injectors per cylinder and oil squirters for the piston skirts, not found in other Ford Modular engines of the time. The GT 5.4 L benefits from an improved version of the high-flow 2000 Cobra R cylinder head and unique high-lift camshafts. The GT is rated at 550 hp (410 kW) and 500 lb·ft (678 N·m).The Shelby GT500 uses a 4-valve DOHC 5.4 L with an Eaton M122H Roots type supercharger and air-to-liquid intercooler. The GT500 5.4 L shares its high-flow cylinder head castings with the Ford GT, with only minor machining differences, and shares camshafts with the 2003 - 2004 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra; which have less lift and duration than the Ford GT camshafts. The 2007-2010 GT500 engine used an iron engine block, while the 2011 GT500 5.4 L receives a new aluminum engine block, with Ford's first production application of their <b>patented</b> Plasma Transferred <b>Wire</b> Arc (PTWA) cylinder coating, {{eliminating the need for}} pressed in cylinder liners. The PTWA spray apparatus was co-developed by Ford and Flame-Spray Industries of Long Island, New York, for which they received the 2009 IPO National Inventors of the Year Award. The 2011 GT500 engine weighs 102 lb. less than the previous iron-block version, {{thanks in part to the}} lack of cast iron cylinder liners. All of the 5.4 L 4-valve engines destined for use in SVT vehicles, such as the Ford GT and Shelby GT500, have been hand-built by technicians at Ford's Romeo, Michigan plant.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{music in}} Long Island {{includes}} indie music which has rapidly grown in popularity, particularly in Suffolk County where the local emo and hardcore punk scene continues to grow. It has been felt nationally by the moderate success of local bands such as The Dawning, Enraged, Glassjaw, Head Automatica, Silent Majority, Rory Lowe Band, Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, Straylight Run, The Movielife, Nightmare of You, I Am the Avalanche, From Autumn to Ashes, and Edison Glass. Many churches and synagogues, {{as well as}} VFW Halls and community centers constantly house underground shows, affording cheap entertainment and an underlying sense of [...] "scene community". Pop punk bands also have an impressive following, with bands like <b>Patent</b> Pending and <b>Wired.</b> It is a self-serving [...] "business", so to speak, and most bands that are known on the island spill over into adjoining regions such as New Jersey and Connecticut. Bands Envy On The Coast, Stereo Skyline, Greyscale and Bayside also hail from Long Island.
