They argue that whereas some states have become demonstrably more democratic and have moved in the space of fifteen years from the periphery to the centre of European politics, in others the political and economic climates seem hardly to be better, and their societies no more free, than in the final years of the Cold War. Assessing <b>progress</b> <b>towards</b> <b>democracy</b> in the former Eastern Bloc - or the lack of it - requires a qualitative examination of post-communist polities.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the contemporary treatment of difference as "diversity" and explores its articulation through planning. The utility {{of this approach}} to difference {{is set in the}} urban context to illuminate the role of diversity as a strategic asset in the local consolidation of global economic processes. The qualitative research reported here is a study of the City of Toronto's recently developed diversity initiative as expressed in the recommendations of the Task Force on Community Access and Equity. An evaluation of the efficacy of the City's Action Plan is provided with special focus on the main feature of the Plan, the city wide Community Advisory Committees. Their general role in facilitating inclusion and their specific impact on the planning function is considered. Assessment of the Plan finds it consistent with the dominant treatment of difference as "diversity" reflective of the competitive, corporatized city in which it has been developed, offering minimal opportunity to open political space for marginalized groups. The advisory committee approach to community participation can not only be seen as having limited impact, but also as containing and/or fracturing resistance. However, the contribution of such state-sponsored planning for inclusion is clear when it is set against the broader constellation of action in the social justice movement. The Plan's potential lies in the possibility of iterative developments pressed by forces inside as well as outside of the bureaucracy. The conclusions suggest that such initiatives are one aspect of multifaceted, cross-sectoral <b>progress</b> <b>towards</b> radical <b>democracy...</b>|$|R

He has continued {{to speak out against}} what he sees as the inordinate influence of the Military in Fijian politics. He attributes this, in part, to its role in United Nations peacekeeping operations, which, he says, have put the Fijian Military in a mediating role abroad and whetted their appetite for an interventionist role at home. In 2012, in the leadup to the general elections scheduled for 2014, the first since the 2006 coup, he expressed scepticism about whether the Military would allow the vote to be free and fair.

40|$|Australia's Federal Labor Government {{was elected}} in 1983 on a social {{democratic}} platform, promising Swedish and West German style social and industrial reforms. New relations developed between government and unions in which the latter became an increasingly powerful participant in neo-corporatist arrangements. Through reform of the national retirement income regime, unions gained new power together with some control of large occupational superannuation funds, occasioning {{a major shift in}} the ownership of capital in Australia. These are unique developments in this country's history with far-reaching political, economic and social consequences. Empirical research undertaken during the progress of these changes, and the researcher's own professional involvement in the field, provide the basis for this first detailed sociological analysis of both the social forces and political dimensions involved, and of the resultant re-alignments of social power and political authority in contemporary Australian society. Three propositions were explored  direct union participation in public policy-making benefits the wage-dependent; union participation in neo-corporatist arrangements socialises the processes of national economic planning and public policy-making; incorporation of unions in neo-corporatist arrangements demobilises the unions and their members. The main findings do not support any simplistic or optimistic view of these developments. While unions were the instigators of these policy changes, the dynamic processes of strategic neo-corporatist policy formation, political and industrial expediency, enduring economic vulnerability and a new political rationality intervened to produce policy patterns and institutional arrangements that diminished the benefits of these changes for the wage-dependent. There has been no socialisation of the processes of national economic planning or policy-making. Rather, Australias emerging neocorporatist arrangements are unrepresentative, undemocratic, and biased towards the interests of capital, particularly finance capital. Class mobilisation, direct industrial action, demands for job protection, industrial democracy and radical social change have all become marginal issues for the unions. Moreover, union leaders' commitment to electoral and economic priorities have increased their alienation from their members, and the general lack of participatory democracy in neo-corporatist arrangements has further demobilised unions and their members alike. Even so, a 'window of opportunity' can still be identified that may yet permit <b>progress</b> <b>towards</b> economic <b>democracy...</b>|$|R

Amid growing tensions between the European Union (EU) and Russia, the fate of countries in the common neighbourhood and their <b>progress</b> <b>towards</b> <b>democracy</b> are increasingly at stake.

By focusing on the cases of Armenia and Moldova, EU democracy promotion is analysed in light of the triangular relationship between the countries under scrutiny, the EU and Russia. It argues that domestic conditions and external pressures, linked through the filter of problems of ‘stateness’, are both crucial and mutually reinforcing for democratisation. The paper shows that Russia can undermine EU democracy promotion {{to the extent that it}} strengthens the aversion of domestic political forces to democracy-oriented reforms...|$|E
