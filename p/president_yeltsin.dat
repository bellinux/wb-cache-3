5|$|In October 1992, Hans Ephraimson-Abt led a {{delegation}} of families and U.S. State Department officials to Moscow {{at the invitation of}} <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin.</b> During a state ceremony at St. Catherine's Hall in the Kremlin, the KAL family delegation was handed a portfolio containing partial transcripts of the KAL007 cockpit voice recorder, translated into Russian, and documents of the Politburo pertaining to the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|In April 1991 Vladimir Bukovsky visited Moscow for {{the first}} time since his {{deportation}} fifteen years before. In the run-up to the 1991 presidential election Boris Yeltsin's campaign team included Bukovsky on their list of potential vice-presidential running-mates. In the end, army officer Alexander Rutskoy, a veteran of the 1979–1989 war in Afghanistan and Hero of the Soviet Union was selected. On 5 December 1991 both of Bukovsky's Soviet-era convictions were annulled by a decree of the RSFSR Supreme Court. The following year <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> formally restored Bukovsky's Russian citizenship: he had never been deprived of his Soviet citizenship, despite deportation from the country.|$|E
5|$|In November 1992, <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> {{handed the}} two {{recorder}} containers to Korean President Roh Tae-Woo, {{but not the}} tapes themselves. The following month, the ICAO voted to reopen the KAL007 investigation {{in order to take}} the newly released information into account. The tapes were handed to ICAO in Paris on January 8, 1993. Also handed over at the same time were tapes of the ground to air communications of the Soviet military. The tapes were transcribed by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) in Paris in the presence of representatives from Japan, The Russian Federation, South Korea, and the United States.|$|E

25|$|Few of {{the reforms}} planned in the early 1990s eventuated, for three reasons: Firstly, there was an absence of firm {{civilian}} political guidance, with <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> primarily interested in ensuring that the Armed Forces were controllable and loyal, rather than reformed.|$|E
25|$|Communists and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia {{staged a}} {{nationwide}} strike on 7 October 1998 {{and called on}} <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> to resign. On 9 October 1998, Russia, which was also suffering from a poor harvest, appealed for international humanitarian aid, including food.|$|E
25|$|The Ground Forces reluctantly became {{involved}} in the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993 after <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> issued an unconstitutional decree dissolving the Parliament, following the Parliament's resistance to Yeltsin's consolidation of power and his neo-liberal reforms. A group of deputies, including Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, barricaded themselves inside the Parliament building. While giving public support to the President, the Armed Forces, led by General Grachev, tried to remain neutral, following the wishes of the officer corps.|$|E

25|$|Although Lebed was {{compared}} by some Western and Russian analysts to Augusto Pinochet and Napoleon Bonaparte, {{he was considered}} to the most popular candidate for the presidential election of 2000 during the second term of <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin.</b> After getting elected as governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai in 1998, however, he decided to stay in that position and did not run for president, despite calls {{for him to do}} so. General Lebed held the position until his death in the 2002 helicopter crash.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} at least four major false alarms, the most recent in 1995, that {{resulted}} in the activation of nuclear attack early warning protocols. They include the accidental loading of a training tape into the American early-warning computers; a computer chip failure that appeared to show a random number of attacking missiles; a rare alignment of the Sun, the U.S. missile fields and a Soviet early-warning satellite that caused it to confuse high-altitude clouds with missile launches; the launch of a Norwegian research rocket resulted in <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> activating his nuclear briefcase for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitutional}} crisis of 1993 {{was a political}} stand-off between the Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament that was resolved by using military force. The relations {{between the president and}} the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The {{constitutional crisis}} reached a tipping point on September21, 1993, when <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the Congress of People's Deputies and its Supreme Soviet), although the president did not have the power to dissolve the parliament according to the constitution. Yeltsin used the results of the referendum of April 1993 to justify his actions. In response, the parliament declared that the president's decision was null and void, impeached Yeltsin and proclaimed vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy to be acting president.|$|E

25|$|The ninth congress, {{which opened}} on March26, {{began with an}} {{extraordinary}} session of the Congress of People's Deputies taking up discussions of emergency measures to defend the constitution, including impeachment of <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin.</b> Yeltsin conceded {{that he had made}} mistakes and reached out to swing voters in parliament. Yeltsin narrowly survived an impeachment vote on March28, votes for impeachment falling 72 short of the 689 votes needed for a 2/3 majority. The similar proposal to dismiss Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet was defeated by a wider margin (339 in favour of the motion), though 614 deputies had initially been in favour of including the re-election of the chairman in the agenda, a tell-tale sign of the weakness of Khasbulatov's own positions (517 votes for would have sufficed to dismiss the speaker).|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 1999, <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> {{unexpectedly}} resigned, {{handing the}} post to the recently appointed Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, who then won the 2000 presidential election. Putin suppressed the Chechen insurgency although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the Northern Caucasus. High {{oil prices and}} the initially weak currency followed by increasing domestic demand, consumption, and investments has helped the economy grow for nine straight years, improving {{the standard of living}} and increasing Russia's influence on the world stage. However, since the World economic crisis of 2008 and a subsequent drop in oil prices, Russia's economy has stagnated and poverty has again started to rise. While many reforms made during the Putin presidency have been generally criticized by Western nations as undemocratic, Putin's leadership over the return of order, stability, and progress has won him widespread admiration in Russia.|$|E
25|$|There was {{an urgent}} need for a law to clearly define the powers of each federal subject. Such a law was passed on 31 March 1992, when Yeltsin and Ruslan Khasbulatov, then {{chairman}} of the Russian Supreme Soviet and an ethnic Chechen himself, signed the Federation Treaty bilaterally with 86 out of 88 federal subjects. In almost all cases, demands for greater autonomy or independence were satisfied by concessions of regional autonomy and tax privileges. The treaty outlined three basic types of federal subjects and the powers that were reserved for local and federal government. The only federal subjects that did not sign the treaty were Chechnya and Tatarstan. Eventually, {{in the spring of}} 1994, <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> signed a special political accord with Mintimer Shaeymiev, the president of Tatarstan, granting many of its demands for greater autonomy for the republic within Russia; thus, Chechnya remained the only federal subject that did not sign the treaty. Neither Yeltsin nor the Chechen government attempted any serious negotiations and the situation deteriorated into a full-scale conflict.|$|E

[...] Admitting publicly that bribery was usual business practice in Russia, Mr. Pacolli confirmed in early December 1999 that he had guaranteed five credit cards for Mr Yeltsin's wife, Naina, and two daughters, Tatyana and Yelena. <b>President</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> resigned {{a few weeks later}} in late December 1999 appointing Vladimir Putin to be his successor.

2500|$|Apart from {{assuming}} {{control of}} {{the bulk of the}} former Soviet Internal Troops and the KGB Border Troops, seemingly the only independent defence move the new Russian government made before March 1992 involved announcing the establishment of a National Guard. Until 1995, it was planned to form at least 11 brigades numbering 3,000 to 5,000 each, with a total of no more than 100,000. National Guard military units were to be deployed in 10 regions, including in Moscow (three brigades), Leningrad (two brigades), {{and a number of other}} important cities and regions. By the end of September 1991 in Moscow the National Guard was about 15,000 strong, mostly consisting of former Soviet Armed Forces servicemen.
