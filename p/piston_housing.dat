The impact is modelled using a mass-spring system, where the force of impact is obtained for a given impact velocity, system mass and pre-calculated “spring” constants for the impacting bodies. In order to determine the importance of the presence of the hydraulic fluid, the compressibility of the molten metal, and the leakage past the screw tip, we will assume that the deformation of the <b>piston</b> and <b>housing</b> can be ignored. However, in order to make quantitative predictions of the impact forces, it is necessary to include the effects due to the compressibility of the machine parts.

50|$|The FAL {{operates}} {{by means}} of a gas-operated action very {{similar to that of the}} Russian SVT-40. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded <b>piston</b> <b>housed</b> above the barrel, and the locking mechanism is what is known as a tilting breechblock. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy receiver much like the bolts of the Russian SKS carbine and French MAS-49 series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of rifle grenades and manual operation. The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed stock versions of the FAL, the recoil spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.|$|R
50|$|An Inductive pump is a magnetically {{regulated}} {{positive displacement}} pump used to pump liquids and gases. It is capable of handling many corrosive chemicals as well as solvents and gases. It {{is characterized by a}} single piston that reciprocates within a magnetic field and therefore doesn’t require a dynamic seal to link the piston to an outside mechanical power source. Check valves are placed {{at both ends of the}} <b>piston</b> <b>housing</b> allowing the simultaneous suctioning and pumping that reverses with each stroke. This is known to reduce pulsations especially at higher flow rates. The piston and housing are constructed of materials that are inert to many liquids and gasses. Because the piston and housing are non-plastic materials the positive displacement chamber does not change in dimension from flexing and distortion thus allowing inductive pumps to remain very accurate with no significant changes over time. Inductive pumps are extremely accurate as each stroke contains the same volume created by a solid piston inside a solid chamber. The number of strokes can be counted or timed to determine the total volume delivered. They can be used in sterile and controlled environments as they will not leak to the outside of the housing even if the piston has experienced wear.|$|E

40|$|An auto-adjusting {{pin tool}} for {{friction}} stir welding is presented wherein the pin tool automatically adjusts for welding materials of varying thicknesses, and the pin can be incrementally withdrawn from the workpieces thus eliminating any crater or keyhole in the weld. The inventive apparatus is comprised of a welding head housing a motor connected to a controller instrument package and an arbor supported by bearings. The arbor forms an interior cylinder and is encircled by a stationary slip ring though which are ported hydraulic passageways into the interior cylinder of the arbor such that a <b>piston</b> <b>housed</b> therein may be moved axially. Coupled to the piston is a pin tool which is treaded on its lower end and which is moveably seated in, and extending through, a shoulder housing having concave lower face. When welding, the rotating treaded end of the pin enters and stirs the workpieces while the lower face of the shoulder housing compacts the workpieces. As the welding head traverses the shoulder housing the controller senses any rising pressure on the lower face of the shoulder housing and withdraws the arbor to keep the pressure constant. At the same time, the piston moves towards the workpieces thus extending the pin further from the shoulder. This keeps the pin at a proper depth in the workpieces regardless of their thicknesses.

40|$|Advances {{in modern}} engine {{development}} {{are becoming more}} and more challenging. The intense increase of thermal and mechanical loads as a result of higher power density requires perfecting the function of all engine components especially with regard to emission and friction reduction. In particular, piston rings pack represent one of the most important cause of mechanical friction loss in internal combustion engine [1], and inadequate ring-liner lubrication leads to high fuel/oil consumption and increased engine emissions with dramatic impact over the entire system efficiency. A desirable piston ring-pack set has to provide efficient sealing performance with both the cylinder wall in a radial direction and the top or bottom sides of the piston ring housing in an axial direction, leading to minimal gas blow-by, oil consumption and friction loss. Moreover piston ring other requirement are low friction, low wear and good resistance against mechanical/thermal fatigue. This is a challenging task due to the nature of the phenomena and interactions associated with piston rings. For example, increasing the installed ring tension, which is a method to control oil consumption, also tends to increase ring friction. Hence, any attempt to optimize ring-pack performance output parameters requires a good understanding of the dynamics of all the involved components. Different key elements have to be considered: the ring shape in its free state (namely free shape), the ring crossing-section geometry and the contact surface profile, which play important roles in determining the ring behavior. In order to achieve sealing, the piston rings are first held against the cylinder liner in its front face by their tension after being installed into the cylinder bore. The contact pressure on the cylinder wall is achieved by the inherent spring force of the ring in conjunction with the gas pressure behind the ring. During different engine operating conditions, the piston rings experience dynamically changing forces and axial as well as radial movements of the rings can occur. The contact on the side of the <b>piston</b> <b>housing</b> is achieved by the axial forces acting on the ring. The axial forces are composed of the gas pressure above and under the ring, the mass forces (inertia), and the friction forces. These forces change their direction during the cycle, and, as a result, the piston ring moves from one side of the groove to the other during the engine cycle. This is known as ring fluttering when the axial movement becomes excessive. This behavior open an additional gas flow path: gas can flow around the inner diameter of the ring which results in very high engine blow-by loss. In addition the ring pack design should also consider other factors, including gas blowback and, as said before, ring pack friction. The blowback is the reverse process of blowby and is highly related to engine emission and oil consumption while ring friction can cause severe ring and cylinder wall wear, which results in the ring losing its sealing capability. These factors are related to the ring circumferential pressure distribution, which is defined by the ring free shape and the ring cross section geometry. The understanding of the piston ring behavior is an hard challenge for automotive engineer. Firstly, in 1936 Castleman [2] investigated and proposed the concept of hydrodynamic lubrication for the piston ring. Thereafter, more and more research has been done in this field. Dowson et al. [3] predicted the behavior of a piston ring using the EHL theory. Sun [4] conducted his study for ring-bore conformability, in which the ring was modeled as a curved beam under in-plane loads. Liu and Tian [5, 6] developed an FEA tool for piston ring design. Ejakov et al. [7] modeled ring twist behavior predicting ring axial, radial displacements, bending and twisting angles along the ring periphery over an engine cycle. In this contributions a complete 3 D model of the piston ring is proposed, and the influence of an important parameter like the twist angle of the piston ring section on both ring-liner and ring-piston groove interaction is investigated...|$|E

In {{order to}} {{understand}} the true impact the automobile has had on our society, we would have to go back in time over one hundred years. A time without the simplicity of hopping into a vehicle to take us anywhere we want to go is almost unfathomable to many Americans. But for the early automotive engineers, the tremendous advancements in automotive technology would be even more surprising. In the last 50 years, cars have learned to think, adjust, and even protect. But this is {{just the tip of the}} iceberg. High performance is now the catch phrase. The vast majority of people want a vehicle that will get them from point A to point B as easily as possible, but also put a little smile on their faces. Often times, the smile is created by a quick punch of the accelerator and accompanied by a feeling of immense power and control. The auto manufacturers are well aware of this, and to achieve it, they design faster, lighter, and more efficient engines to do the job. But exactly it is known, what happens inside an engine, and what are the risks involved in designing the strongest engine on the block. Nowadays the main problems in the field of development and improvement of motor-vehicle and tractor engines are concerned with wider use of diesel engines, reducing fuel consumption and weight per horsepower of the engines and cutting down the costs of their production and service. The engine-pollution control, as well as the engine-noise control in service have been raised to a new level. Far more emphasis is given to the use of computers in designing and testing engines. Ways have been outlined to utilize computers directly in the construction of engines primarily in the construction of diesel engines. The challenge of these problems requires deep knowledge of the theory, construction and design of internal combustion engines on the part of specialists concerned with the production and service of the motor vehicle and tractor engines. In this project, one component of an engine in particular, the connecting rod, will be analyzed. Being one of the most integral parts in an engine’s design, the connecting rod must be able to withstand tremendous loads and transmit a great deal of power. It is no surprise that a failure in a connecting rod can be one of the most costly and damaging failures in an engine. But simply saying that isn’t enough to fully understand the dynamics of the situation. This work presents a three-dimensional finite element analysis, which describes the behaviour of a connecting rod under gas pressure. The connecting rod is moving in a complex environment during engin operation. The pushing force takes into account the most important load. Also there is pulling force that effects the connecting rod because of the interia loads of piston and piston elemens (pin, ring etc.). Pushing force reaches it’s maximum limits by gas pressure, pulling force reaches it’ s maximum limits at maximum speed. The response of the simulated model by critical loads makes it possible to know and to analyse the operating forces, the corresponding maximum gaz pressure and the interia load. A connecting rod is the most common part in converting linear motion to rotating motion and combustion engines in daily life. Today, the automotive industry needed less toleranced, less mass and more stable, more economic motor parts because of the less space and high torque ratings with the speedly growing technology. The most known part in a combustion engine which comes face to face with quickly changing forces is a connecting rod. Tensions and compressions couses seriously deformations and fatigue on connecting rods that works in high velocity and torque. This article includes general properties about the connecting rod, research about forces upon crank angle with corresponding to its working dependencies in a structural mentality, study on the stress analysis upon to this forces gained from calculatinos and optimization with the data that gained from the analysis. Displacement, velocity and acceleration of the system is calculated corresponding with connecting rod’s known parameters with using Mathcad and MS Excel programs. The crank angle found which crank-slider mechanism has maximum F force with calculated data. Firstly, crank-slider mechanism is designed in numerical model. After that, three of connecting rod designed as a three-dimensional model in Solidworks program corresponding with desing fundamentals of a connecting rod and affect of made designs. Stress analysis applied on this three connecting rods with using calculated forces in FEM (finite element method). A model designed as a crank-slider mechanism for this analysis. Pin of <b>piston,</b> <b>housing</b> and crank pin is created for this crank-slider mechanism. Stress analysis applied with calculated F force correponding the crank angle. In this study, temperature and operating conditions are not cared, additionally it is accepted that a homogen force is applied on the system. The connecting rod must be of a certain weight because it has an effect on the engine. It if the rod is light, then the engine will be able to move faster and accelerate more quickly. But weight is not the only important thing; the connection rod must be light and strong at the same time. It should be strong enough to resist all forces produced by the engine, as well as the powerful force that the piston creates when it is moving to the dead center. If the connection rod is weak, that force made by the piston can break it in half or pull it out from its place. After all, the most sucessfull connecting rod design selected and made optimization with weight decreasing and supporting of weak points on it. By the way, an optimized connecting rod created with design from the beginning, develop of numerical equations corresponding with calculating it’s working loads. Due to its large volume production, it is only logical that optimization of the connecting rod for its weight or volume will result in large-scale savings. It can also achieve the objective of reducing the weight of the engine component, thus reducing inertia loads, reducing engine weight and improving engine performance and fuel economy. For conclusion, the connecting rod can be designed and optimized under a load range comprising tensile load corresponding to 360 o crank angle at the maximum engine speed as one extreme load, and compressive load corresponding to the peak gas pressure as the other extreme load.

40|$|A {{parts of}} the {{contemporary}} rotary compressors are supported as by revolving crankshaft (rotor, roller, etc.), so by the housing (stator, pump, suction accumulator, etc.). Such dual supporting structure complicates assembly of a compressor due to the necessity of precision axial and radial positioning of the pump parts, motor rotor and stator. Developed novel rotary compressor provides a unitary assembly, in which a rotor of the driver -external rotor electric motor, is integrated with concentrically situated pump and rotatably arranged on stationary crankshaft. Stationary crankshaft is fixedly connected to the hermetic housing and supports as the fixed to it motor stator, so the rotor block and the piston block revolving around it. The single structure supporting the motor stator, the rotor block, the <b>piston</b> block and <b>housing</b> simplifies compressor assembly, and allows precision, reliable setting of the parts due to the common single reference - axial line. The piston block and the rotor block have only one line rolling contact, where tangential velocities of blocks are unidirectional and equal in magnitude. It means that the sliding frictional losses at the line contact are minimal. The frictional losses between the rotor blocks radial surfaces and facing surfaces of the piston block heads are also minimal due to the low relative rubbing speed between synchronously revolving in one direction contacting surfaces. Suction system of the novel rotary compressor excluded direct delivery of the refrigerant to the suction chamber by positioning a suction input cavity and a motor cavity in between the suction intake located {{at the top of}} the housing and suction port inlet {{at the top of the}} motor cavity. The arrangement of a refrigerant delivery eliminates external accumulator, increases the liquid refrigerant storage capacity and provides cooling of the compressor motor during and after its duty cycle. The vapor will be delivered substantially free of liquid refrigerant into the suction chamber under higher pressure (supercharged) due to the action of the impeller positioned in the motor cavity. The rotation of the piston block is due to the distributed forces which have been transmitted from an external rotor of the motor through the direct, no sliding line contact between both blocks and through a mechanical link – vane, which is rigidly fixed in the piston block wall. Another advantage of the novel rotary compressor is that the discharge gas will be tangentially ejected in form of one or more high-speed jets in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation. It creates a reaction forces acting in the direction of rotation and added to the forces revolving the piston block. The design modifications described above, employment of an external rotor motor as a driver, elimination of the roller, reciprocating movement of the vane, vane spring, and external accumulator, utilization of new developed tubular discharge valve improve performance of novel rotary compressor, make it compact, (smaller package space), reliable, and reduce manufacturing cost. *) Dreiman N.
