5|$|In June 2011—six {{years after}} Natalee's disappearance—Dave Holloway filed a {{petition}} with the Alabama courts seeking {{to have his}} daughter declared legally dead. The papers were served on Beth Twitty, his former wife, who announced her intention to oppose the petition. A hearing was held on September 23, 2011, at which time Probate Judge Alan King ruled that Dave Holloway had met the requirements for a legal <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> On January 12, 2012, a second hearing was held, after which Judge King signed the order declaring Natalee Holloway to be dead.|$|E
5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|As Lucan's {{bankruptcy}} proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors {{were informed}} that the missing earl had unsecured debts of £45,000 and preferential liabilities for £1,326. His assets were estimated at £22,632. The family silver was sold in March 1976 for around £30,000. His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan family trust {{in the years immediately}} following his disappearance. His family was granted probate over his estate in 1999, but no death certificate was issued, and his heir, George Bingham, Lord Bingham, was refused permission to take his father's title and seat in the House of Lords. Following the passage of the <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>Death</b> Act 2013, Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead, which proved successful in a High Court hearing at the Rolls Building on 3 February 2016. He therefore inherited his father's title, becoming the 8th Earl of Lucan.|$|E

Section 304B IPC along with Section 113B of the Evidence Act have enabled the conviction of many who were not caught by the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Section 113A of the Evidence Act provides a similar <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> abetment of suicide (which is an offense under Section 306 IPC), in case <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> a married woman within a period of seven years of her marriage.|$|R
40|$|Este trabajo estudia las cuestiones de competencia {{judicial}} internacional, derecho aplicable y reconocimiento de decisiones que plantean los supuestos de ausencia y declaración de fallecimiento vinculados con varios ordenamientos jurídicos. Como presupuesto, incluye un análisis sobre los diversos modelos de regulación de la ausencia y declaración de fallecimiento en el panorama comparado. [...] The Private International Law {{questions raised}} by the disappearance of persons are diverse and complex. This complexity {{is partly due to}} the different methods used by the various legal orders to regulate these factual situations. Spanish law is a typical representative of the so-called mixed systems, which includes both declaration of absence and declaration <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> As regards jurisdiction issues, a number of significant legal systems show a trend to admit flexible bases of competence. Such an approach is helpful to guarantee the fulfilment of the protective nature of these proceedings. In Spain the terms of Article 22. 3 LOPJ (which includes only the last domicile of the absent person as basis of competence) make necessary an interpretation providing a widening of the circumstances in what is appropriate for our courts to intervene (as they do in practice). Concerning choice of law the idea of applying the lex causae –the legal order which governs the relationship (marriage, succession…) affected by the disappearance- seems only reasonable in those legal systems based on judicial <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> without generally binding effect (as is typical of the common law countries). In Spanish law, according to article 9. 1 C. c., the basic criterion is that absence and declaration <b>of</b> <b>death</b> questions are governed by the law of the nationality of the absentee {{at the time of the}} disappearance. However, the distinction between procedure (governed by the lex fori) and substance raises here special difficulties. As far as recognition of foreign decisions in Spain is concerned, it is generally accepted that exequatur is not required due to the non-contentious nature of these proceedings. However, opinions vary regarding the conditions which these foreign decisions must fulfil. Finally the lack of effect of substantive res judicata which is proper of the non-contentious decisions for protective assistance and the possibility of revoking these decisions bring up special questions for discussion. ...|$|R

40|$|This article’s primary {{aim is to}} {{highlight}} the essentially critical potential <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, {{as well as the}} need for this critical potential to be duly recognized.

As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R
