5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled backwards {{into the}} Woodley Park station, hitting an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. The rear car (1077) was telescoped by the first car of the standing train (4018). No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backwards into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E

5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> an interest in the night sky.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> died.|$|E

25|$|Artifacts {{have been}} found in both North and South America which have been dated to 14,000 years ago, and {{accordingly}} humans have been proposed to have reached Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America by this time.

In the Middle Ages it was called Beverstane, and in medieval times the site was known as Beverstone. Another early name for this site was Bureston, derived from the large number of blue stones found here.|$|R
25|$|She {{also had}} a talent for photography: she left an {{intriguing}} photographic archive from the years she spent living in Moscow during the 1930s and 40s. The archive is the more remarkable because it concerns a time and places where, for both economic and political reasons, very few <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had access to photographic equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{first is}} a direct phonetic {{evolution}} of the PIE text. It {{does not take into}} account various idiomatic and grammatical shifts that occurred over the period. For example, the original text uses the imperfect tense, which disappeared in Proto-Germanic. The second version takes these differences into account, and is therefore closer to the language the Germanic <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> actually spoken.|$|E
25|$|A primary {{motivation}} for this clause was {{to validate the}} equality provisions contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which guaranteed that all <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> rights equal to those of all citizens. As a whole, the Fourteenth Amendment marked a large shift in American constitutionalism, by applying substantially more constitutional restrictions against the states than had applied before the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians say that this confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question. Instead of {{trying to find out}} why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> met at that particular place on that particular day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting to have taken place would have been to fake his death.|$|E
25|$|These toilets {{were only}} {{used by the}} {{affluent}} classes; most <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> squatted over old pots set into the ground or used open pits. The people of the Harappan civilization in Pakistan and northwestern India had primitive water-cleaning toilets that used flowing water in each house that were linked with drains covered with burnt clay bricks. The flowing water removed the human waste. The Indus Valley civilisation had a rudimentary network of sewers built under grid pattern streets.|$|E

It represents what early <b>peoples</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> worn, i.e. a steers's head as a hat, with the hide hanging down the back to protect the neck from the sun, and overall {{as a way to}} instill fear in the enemy.|$|R

25|$|African {{countries}} {{suffer from}} communication difficulties caused by language diversity.

Out of the most diverse 25 countries according to this index, 18 (72%) are African. This includes 12 countries for which Greenberg's diversity index exceeds 0.9, meaning that a pair of randomly selected people will have less than 10% chance of having the same mother tongue. However, the primary language of government, political debate, academic discourse, and administration is often {{the language of the}} former colonial powers; English, French, or Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a series}} of vignettes recounting a social {{occasion}} during which someone said something that should not have been said, or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is to identify what was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> felt in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well.|$|E
