40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for designing axial-flow compressor blading from blade elements defined on cones which {{pass through the}} blade-edge streamline locations. Each blade-element centerline is composed of two segments which are tangent to each other. The centerline and surfaces of each segment have constant change of angle with path distance. The stacking line for the blade elements can be leaned in both the axial and tangential directions. The output of the computer program gives coordinates for fabrication and properties for aeroelastic analysis for <b>planar</b> <b>blade</b> sections. These coordinates and properties are obtained by interpolation across conical blade elements. The program is structured to be coupled with an aerodynamic design program...|$|E
40|$|Road {{surface quality}} is very {{sensitive}} to the mechanical properties of an underground structure and particularly to its water content. Depth sounding using boreholes is generally used for geotechnical testing and particularly oven dried measurements. In parallel, electromagnetic measurements based on a cross-hole radar to perform zero-offset profiling are proposed in this paper. Thus, two specific large band dipole geometries, a 3 D folded dipole and a <b>planar</b> <b>blade</b> dipole {{have been designed to}} work in the frequency band [0. 5; 1. 5] GHz in order to estimate the vertical water content of a multi-layered clay sand embankment test site. The design of both antenna geometries and their integration in a transmission link considering a cross-hole radar with a separation distance less than 1 m, has been performed using the finite difference time-domain (FDTD) commercial software EMPIRE®. The picking of the time arrivals has allowed to estimate the real permittivity and the volumetric moisture content using Malicki’s relation. The comparison of measurement and simulation results has allowed to highlight the contrasts of real permittivities induced by the volumetric water content and the embankment compaction level. Moreover, in this study the dissipative properties in the soil have been evaluated as they represent complementary depth properties closely linked to the accuracy of the first arrivals picking used for the permittivity estimation. The intrinsic attenuation evaluation is based on a straight analysis in the frequency domain of successive transmission coefficients using the centroid frequency downshift method. Afterwards the electrical conductivity profile has been recovered using a full-wave FDTD analysis and a comparison between measurement and simulation data...|$|E

40|$|The rolA gene of the TL-DNA of Agrobacterium rhizogenes Ri-plasmid plays a {{major role}} in {{establishing}} the hairy root syndrome in transgenic plants. Transgenic tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L.) expressing constitutively the rolA gene under the transcriptional control of the 35 S RNA promoter show pronounced phenotypical alterations. P 35 S-rolA transgenic tobacco plants are characterized by stunted growth, dark green wrinkled leaves with an altered length-to-width ratio, condensed influorescences, retarded onset of flowering, a reduced number of flowers and shortened styles. To investigate whether the pleiotropic alterations of growth and development are linked to an altered hormonal status we have compared the immunoreactive content of indole- 3 -acetic acid, cytokinins, abscisic acid, gibberellin and the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) of seedlings and different tissues of P 35 S-rolA transgenic plants, transgenic plants expressing the rolA gene under control of its own phloem-specific promoter and wild-type plants. Multiple tissue-specific alterations of phytohormone concentrations are the consequence of rolA gene activity. Changes of phytohormonal content can explain part of the rolA-induced phenotypic alterations. Most strikingly, in young and fully developed leaves of rolA and P 35 S-rolA transgenic clones a 40 - 60 % reduction of immunoreactive gibberellin A 1 was found, as compared to wild-type leaves. Treatment of wild-type tobacco plants with inhibitors of gibberellin biosynthesis phenotypic alterations similar to those of rolA transgenic plants. This suggests that the reduction of gibberellic acid content is indirectly but causally involved in rolA-induced alterations of stem elongation and <b>planar</b> leaf <b>blade</b> growth...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by the industrially {{important}} {{processes of}} blade coating and cavity filling of liquid crystalline materials, we consider steady, two-dimensional shear-driven (Couette) and pressure-driven (plane Poiseuille) flow of {{a thin film}} of a nematic liquid crystal in the slowly varying channel formed between a fixed blade of prescribed shape and a <b>planar</b> substrate. Specifically, <b>blade</b> coating motivates the study of shear-driven flow due to {{the motion of the}} substrate parallel to itself with constant velocity, while cavity filling motivates the study of pressure-driven flow due to an imposed pressure drop. We use a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to analyse the Ericksen [...] Leslie equations governing the fluid velocity and pressure and the director orientation in cases when both the aspect ratio of the channel and the distortion of the director field are small. We demonstrate a variety of flow and director-orientation patterns occurring in different parameter regimes. In the limit of weak flow effects flow alignment does not occur and the appropriate solution of the governing equations is found explicitly. In the limit of strong flow effects flow alignment occurs and orientational boundary layers exist near the substrate and near the blade, and in addition, an orientational internal layer may also exist within which the director orientation changes from +theta_ 0 to -theta_ 0 where theta_ 0 is the flow-alignment angle...|$|R
