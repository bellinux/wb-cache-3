5|$|The Anti-Hindi {{imposition}} agitations of Tamil Nadu were {{a series}} of agitations {{that happened in the}} Indian state of Tamil Nadu (formerly Madras State and part of Madras Presidency) during both <b>pre-</b> and post-Independence periods. The agitations involved several mass protests, riots, student and political movements in Tamil Nadu concerning the official status of Hindi in the state.|$|E
5|$|Aayirathil Oruvan languished in {{development}} hell due to slow {{progress of the}} shoot and the extensive <b>pre-</b> and post-production works, evading release dates ranging one year. Shooting began in July 2007, and took place in various locations with 2,000 extras in areas including Chalakudy, Kerala and Jaisalmer, Rajasthan amongst other regions throughout India. Uncut, the film runs for over 220 minutes, but the theatrical release was heavily cut at 183 minutes. The film released coinciding with the festival of Thai Pongal on 14 January 2010, with a Telugu dubbing version, titled Yuganikki Okkadu, following six weeks later. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews whilst proceeding to become a successful venture commercially.|$|E
5|$|Filming for series two again {{took place}} in Kent and France. The {{production}} filmed for 85 days in Kent between April and July 2015, with a further 50 days in the county for <b>pre-</b> and post-production, spending an estimated £1.5 million. The Kent filming locations included Eurotunnel, Folkestone Harbour, Discovery Park, Deal (including the Pier), Folkestone, Dover (including the Port and Dover Castle), Westwood Industrial Estate Margate, Ramsgate, The Barn in Upstreet, St Martin’s Hospital, and Knowlton Court.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the <b>pre-</b> and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E
5|$|Postan {{argued that}} {{demography}} {{was the principal}} driving force in the medieval English economy. In a distinctly Malthusian fashion, Postan proposed that the English agrarian economy saw little technical development during the period and by the early 14th century was unable to support the growing population, leading to inevitable famines and economic depression as the population came back into balance with land resources. Postan began the trend towards stressing continuities between the <b>pre-</b> and post-invasion economies, aided by fresh evidence emerging {{from the use of}} archaeological techniques to understand the medieval economy from the 1950s onwards.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{also holds}} various {{artefacts}} which belonged to journalists from <b>pre-</b> and post-independence Indonesia. This includes an Underwood typewriter which {{once belonged to}} Bakrie Soeriatmadja, a vocal journalist for the Bandung-based Sipatahoenan; a shirt in which Hendro Subroto was shot while covering the Indonesian occupation of East Timor in 1975; parachuting equipment used by Trisnojuwono in covering the solar eclipse of 11 June 1983; and a camera used by Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin, a journalist for the Yogyakarta-based Bernas who was killed after covering a corruption scandal in 1995. More artefacts, from journalists such as Mochtar Lubis, were still being acquired as of October 2013.|$|E

25|$|The {{severity}} of predation rates also varies between <b>pre-</b> and post-dispersal predation. Although {{both types of}} predation can be extremely high, studies simultaneously evaluating both <b>pre-</b> and post-dispersal seed predation suggest that the latter is often more severe than the former. However, seeds already dispersed and not consumed {{have a chance to}} germinate, and seeds consumed could die regardless of predation due to constraints imposed by unsuitable germination sites. On the other hand, all non-dispersed seeds predated would be no more than a waste of energy by the parent plant. Therefore, the demographic impacts of pre-dispersal predation on plant populations are likely to be stronger than the impacts of post-dispersal predation.|$|E

25|$|The tail of Dreadnoughtus schrani {{has several}} {{characteristic}} features {{included in the}} diagnosis of the species. The first vertebra of the tail has a ridge on its ventral surface called a keel. In the first third of the tail, the bases of the neural spines are extensively subdivided into cavities caused by contact with air sacs (part of the dinosaur’s respiratory system). In addition, the anterior and posterior boundaries of these neural spines have distinct ridges (<b>pre-</b> and postspinal laminae) connecting them to the <b>pre-</b> and postzygapophyses (the articulation points of the neural arches). In the middle of its tail, the vertebrae have a triangular process that extends over the centrum towards each preceding vertebra.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} famine deaths during Great Leap Forward has been {{estimated}} by different methods. Banister, Coale, and Ashton et al. compare age cohorts from the 1953, 1964, and 1982 censuses, yearly birth and death records, and results of the 1982 1:1000 fertility survey. From these they calculate excess deaths above a death rate interpolated between <b>pre-</b> and post-Leap death rates. All involve corrections for perceived errors inherent in the different data sets. Peng uses reported deaths from the vital statistics of 14 provinces, adjusts 10 percent for under reporting, and expands the result to cover all of China assuming similar mortality rates in the other provinces. He uses 1956/57 death rates as the baseline death rate rather than an interpolation between <b>pre-</b> and post-GLF death rates.|$|E
25|$|Sex {{selection}} is {{the attempt to}} control the sex of offspring to achieve a desired sex. It can be accomplished in several ways, both <b>pre-</b> and post-implantation of an embryo, {{as well as at}} birth. Pre-implantation techniques include PGD, but also sperm sorting.|$|E

25|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, on 8 of the 10 key {{economic}} variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the <b>pre-</b> and post-Reagan years. Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was lower during period than in both the <b>pre-</b> and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.|$|E
