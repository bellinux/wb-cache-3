30|$|This {{research}} used effective {{techniques to}} identify {{the differences in the}} zinc stearate layer before and after a white spirit wash, as a conventional treatment, and an APP treatment, as an innovative technique, as applied to a TPU <b>powder</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Using an EDX investigation, it was possible to verify a reduction of the zinc species in the layer around the TPU particles, without compromising the blocking characteristics of the TPU adhesive following treatment, as the treatments essentially only affected the zinc stearate layer. Particle size investigations with optical microscopy, Beckman Coulter and SEM indicated that the zinc stearate layer is small in comparison to the TPU particle size. Therefore, the treatments acted only on the layer containing the zinc stearate lubricant. The crystallinity test showed a higher value for the TPU adhesive powder after both the white spirit wash and plasma treatments, which was attributed to an increase in the hard segments, which are responsible for the best cohesion and, thus, better peel resistance values.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Recurrent aphthous {{stomatitis}} (RAS) is {{a painful}} ulcerative oral disease {{with a general}} population prevalence exceeding 20 %. The etiology of RAS remains largely unknown, however, nutritional deficiency, autoimmunity, psychological stress, and, recently, oxidative stress have been implicated. The pain associated with RAS may be very severe and disabling, hence, treatment is centered on the control of pain and acceleration of healing. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a potent antioxidant with anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and antimicrobial properties. It is available as a safe dietary supplement, and has been successfully used as adjuvant/treatment of inflammatory conditions including ulcerative lesions. The Hypothesis: Using NAC {{as a candidate for}} treatment and/or prevention of RAS and aphthous-like ulcers is hypothesized here. We propose to use NAC systemically or topically in the form of <b>powder,</b> paste, <b>adhesive</b> tablets, or mouthwash to treat active RAS or for prophylaxis in cases with frequent attacks.

Secondary transfer of <b>adhesive</b> <b>powders</b> to conspecifics during social interactions has been reported; however, this transfer relies on insects leaving the source of powder and continuing normal behavior when contaminated. We examined the ability of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae), to fly and mate after being contaminated with one of two adhesive powders: an electrostatic wax powder, Entostat, and a proprietary metallic powder, Entomag. During continuous observations for 1 h in a flight tunnel, male C. capitata made significantly more flights than females. Treating C. capitata with either powder significantly suppressed the flight activity of male C. capitata compared with untreated controls, whereas powder treatment had a negligible effect on female flight activity. Within 1 h, male C. capitata treated with Entomag recovered normal flight activity, but Entostat-treated males were not fully recovered. Virgin male C. capitata treated with either Entostat or Entomag were able to mate with virgin female C. capitata, but the onset of mating was delayed compared with control C. capitata by ? 1 h.

In the present study, the fluidization quality of the C powder was investigated. The powders used in the experiments were alumina, aluminum hydrate and sodium carbonate, and the average diameter of them was below 15 μm. It was found from the relationship between gas velocity and fluidization behavior that the fluidization quality of the C powder was strongly influenced by the bulk density of powder. Low density powder tended to agglomerate, and high density powder tended to cause gas channeling. It is known that the maximum extent of the expansion of the emulsion phase increases with decreasing particle diameter for the A powder.
