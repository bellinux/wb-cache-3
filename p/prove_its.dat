5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to <b>prove</b> <b>its</b> true nature.|$|E

5|$|The {{detention}} {{order on the}} ITAK leaders was lifted in October 1961. As a compromise the Bandaranaike government proposed the District Councils Bill to devolve powers to districts but following protests from Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists dropped the bill in June 1964. In 1964, as ITAK started preparing for a second civil disobedience campaign, the government started collapsing. As several SLFP MPs defected to the opposition, the government sough ITAK's support but ITAK chose instead to support the opposition and on 3 December 1964 the government was unable to <b>prove</b> <b>its</b> majority in parliament, precipitating an election.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the steady}} {{taxation}} of Edward III's reign, parliament – {{and in particular}} the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to be just, the king had to <b>prove</b> <b>its</b> necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present petitions for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{of her career}} was spent at Cambridge's Molteno Institute for Parasite Biology, where she returned in 1929. Her work there was an extension of her research with Dobell, as she studied nuclear division in parasitic flagellates and amoebae of diverse species, including both vertebrates and invertebrates. She isolated one type of protozoan, aerotolerant anaerobes, from the digestive tract of Haemopis sanguisuga during this period. Bishop also discovered a new species, Pseudotrichomonas keilini, which she named to acknowledge her colleague David Keilin, {{as well as the}} parasite's resemblance to the genus Trichomonas. Her research at Manchester with H.P. Baynon concerned the identification, isolation, and study of the turkey blackhead parasite (Histomonas meleagridis); this study pioneered a technique for isolating and growing parasites from lesions on the liver. Bishop and Baynon were the first scientists to isolate Histomonas and then <b>prove</b> <b>its</b> role in blackhead. Bishop's expertise with parasitic protozoa translated into her best-known work, a comprehensive study of the malaria parasite (Plasmodium) and potential chemotherapies for the disease.|$|E

25|$|Penrose's {{argument}} {{stemmed from}} Gödel's incompleteness theorems. In Penrose's first book on consciousness, The Emperor's New Mind (1989), {{he argued that}} while a formal system cannot <b>prove</b> <b>its</b> own consistency, Gödel’s unprovable results are provable by human mathematicians. He took this disparity to mean that human mathematicians are not formal proof systems and are not running a computable algorithm. According to Bringsjorg and Xiao, {{this line of reasoning}} is based on fallacious equivocation on the meaning of computation.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the company}} {{wanted to be}} sure that Greenside Mine {{contained}} sufficient reserves of ore to enable the large-scale mining operation which would make it profitable. They proposed taking a two-year option on the mine, during which they would refurbish the property and <b>prove</b> <b>its</b> resources, paying the landowners a dead rent of £90 per year. Many terms of the old leases they rejected as inappropriate to a large, modern mining company. They proposed a fixed royalty payment of 1/40th (5%) {{of the value of the}} lead concentrates, arguing that if the mine was worked on a large enough scale, these royalties would be quite satisfactory to the landowners.|$|E

25|$|In Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2007), Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside}} a trial judge's {{decision}} as he held that the judge had descended into the arena and joined in the fray. This {{was evident in the}} manner the trial judge had questioned the witnesses. There were excessive questions by the judge, especially some in the nature of a cross-examination. The conclusions formed by the judge also arose out of the line of questioning that she herself had adopted. The High Court also mentioned that it was the duty of the Prosecution to bring out the evidence to <b>prove</b> <b>its</b> case and not the judge's duty to do so, even if it was an attempt to make up for any shortfall in the conduct of the case by the prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these tactics, the 1920 version of the California Alien Land Law included more stringent rules designed {{to put a stop}} to such circumvention. Among other changes, it introduced a provision that would prove to be crucial in the Oyama case – namely, it stated that if a person purchased land in another person’s name, it would be presumed that this was done with intent to bypass the Alien Land Law. This was a significant shift in the rules regarding burden of proof in state escheat cases involving land. Whereas before the State would have to <b>prove</b> <b>its</b> case, this was no longer the situation – it was now incumbent upon the defendant to prove that the purchased land was a bona fide gift rather than an attempt at getting around the land ownership restrictions.|$|E
25|$|In February 2002, the Professional Football League ceased {{operations}} {{after failing}} to <b>prove</b> <b>its</b> self-sustainability {{during the first three}} seasons and a decision from its owner and founder, Jack Warner, to withdraw funding for the league. Early results of the Professional Football League suggested an improvement in player development with several domestic professionals named to starting roles in the national team. In addition, clubs also benefited as their players secured transfers to prominent leagues in Europe, including Defence Force winger Carlos Edwards to Wrexham of the Football League for ₤250,000 in 2000. As a result, club owners agreed a month later to develop a new professional league that would operate rather as a corporation, known as the T Pro League Limited, owned by the member clubs. Thus, the TT Pro League was formed as a limited company and continuation of the Professional Football League.|$|E
