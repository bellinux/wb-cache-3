40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study investigates how design {{strategies}} in three recent intensive care units in Sweden impact patients, families, and staff. The area of focus is the <b>patient</b> <b>room</b> "module," usually {{consisting of a}} pair of <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> and a joint location for monitoring and documentation. BACKGROUND: Many countries are expanding their number of intensive care beds and are also in the process of incorporating evidence-based design strategies such as single-bed <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> and access to daylight and nature. This situation provides a significant opportunity to review and learn from facilities leading the way in these areas. METHODS: Three intensive care units completed since 2010 were evaluated in relation to a combination of criteria. Methods included plan drawing analysis, staff questionnaires (n = 72), staff interviews (n = 9), and systematic observation (6 hours). RESULTS: In some <b>patient</b> <b>rooms,</b> access to daylight and/or outdoor views was excellent, while in other rooms such access was hindered by frosted glass or adjacent bushes or buildings. Single-bed rooms gave family members improved privacy and greater ability to stay in the <b>patient</b> <b>room.</b> Some <b>patient</b> <b>room</b> modules provided efficient patient observation and staff collaboration, but more noise and reduced patient privacy. Other modules provided a calm <b>patient</b> <b>room</b> environment, but caused some staff to feel isolated and have difficulty in getting assistance. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of the three projects reveals variation in whether design strategies successfully achieve their desired outcomes. Varying designs of the <b>patient</b> <b>room</b> module affect users in unique ways and must balance privacy, visibility, quietness, and staff access to assistance...|$|R

A perspective randomized design with pre-post measures Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) was conducted to test whether the hospital?s Healing Garden had an effect on the stress levels of parents of pediatric hospital patients. Participants were asked to sit and relax in the Healing Garden for ten-minutes. Two differing interior spaces, one with views to nature and one without views to nature, were tested as comparisons. Data was collected in the form of surveys and behavioral observation. Results indicate that the Healing Garden reduced the stress of parents at a greater rate than the two interior spaces included in the study. However, the two interior spaces did not differ in their stress reducing effects despite one having views to nature. Comments from parents indicated a slight stress relieving effect by simply leaving their <b>patient?s</b> <b>room.</b> These research findings should be used to encourage parents and other adult family members to use the hospital?s gardens to reduce stress felt from their patient?s medical treatment.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Hand hygiene {{is a major}} {{means for}} {{preventing}} healthcare-associated infections. One critical point in understanding poor compliance {{is the lack of}} relevant markers used to monitor practices systematically. Methods: This study analysed hand hygiene compliance and associated factors with a radiofrequency-identification-based real-time continuous automated monitoring system in an infectious diseasewardwith 17 single bedrooms. Healthcareworkers (HCWs) were trackedwhile performing routine care over 171 days. Amulti-levelmulti-variate logisticsmodelwas used for data analysis. The main outcome measures were hand disinfection before entering the bedroom (outside use) and before entering the patient care zone, defined as the zone surrounding the patient's bed (inside/bedside use). Variables analysed included HCWs' characteristics and behaviour, <b>patients,</b> <b>room</b> layouts, path chains and duration of HCWs' paths. Findings: In total, 4629 paths with initial hand hygiene opportunities when entering the patient care zone were selected, of which 763 (16. 5 %), 285 (6. 1 %) and 3581 (77. 4 %) were associated with outside use, inside/bedside use and no use, respectively. Hand hygiene is caregiver-dependent. The shorter the duration of the HCW's path, the worse the bedside hand hygiene. Bedside hand hygiene is improved when one or two extra HCWs are present in the room. Interpretation: Hand hygiene compliance at the bedside, as analysed using the continuous monitoring system, depended upon the HCW's occupation and personal behaviour, number of HCWs, time spent in the room and (potentially) dispenser location. Meal tray distribution was a possible factor in the case of failure to disinfect hands. (C) 2017 The Healthcare Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Hydroxyethyl {{starches}} (HES) markedly suppress neutrophil influx by decreasing pulmonary capillary permeability and facilitating tissue oxygenation by improving microcirculation. It was hypothesized that in hypoxemic femur injury patients undergoing operative stabilization, HES administration will prevent the deterioration of respiratory variables and facilitates recovery. This prospective, double-blind, randomized preliminary study, enrolled twenty posttraumatic hypoxemic <b>patients</b> (<b>room</b> air PaO 2 5) scheduled for femur fracture stabilization under general anesthesia. Patients were allocated to receive either; 6 % HES 130 / 0. 42, 15 mL/kg or 0. 9 % normal saline (NS) to maintain their central venous pressure (CVP) 12 + 2 mm Hg. Blood was transfused according to the maximum allowable blood loss and by serial hematocrit estimations. Perioperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), physiological variables, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2), arterial blood gas (ABG), SS and P/F ratios were recorded until recovery. The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood / fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO 2 /FiO 2) improved from a preoperative value of 273. 33 ± 13. 05 to 435. 70 in the 6 % Hydroxyethyl starch group (HES) and from 275. 24 ± 15. 34 to 302. 25 ± 70. 35 in the NS group over a period of six days (P values = 0. 970, 0. 791, 0. 345, 0. 226, 0. 855, 0. 083, 0. 221).

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: This project {{contains}} three aims. The aim-A is {{to develop}} the video acquisition system, to obtain a high-quality data set of video images of demented elderly labelled with respect to discomfort. Aim-B {{is to develop}} the digital discomfort label tool to label the recorded images with respect to discomfort and calculates the discomfort score immediately after an assessment session. The last aim, Aim-C, is to show the first results {{on the use of}} the digital discomfort label tool. Introduction: By a continuing aging population there is an extensive increase of people suffering from dementia. Elderly suffering from severe dementia have limited abilities to communicate and are often unable to call for help if they feel uncomfortable. Therefore an important and underestimated aspect in this group of patients is discomfort. Because the observation of facial expression can be considered as an accurate indicator to assess discomfort in demented elderly we will focus on these facial expressions to estimate the level of discomfort in these patients. The ultimate goal is to developed a system which can determine discomfort in the facial expressions of these elderly and alarm a care-giver if appropriate. Materials and Methods: For aim-A the technical requirements for the video acquisition system are defined in order to get high quality video images (uncompressed colour images with a resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels and taken by a speed of 30 frames per second) based on the input of two cameras placed at both sides of the bed. The esthetical requirements for the video acquisition system are defined in order to get a system which not disturb the natural look of the <b>patients</b> <b>room</b> to much and is easily manageable by no technical staff. For aim-B the proposed discomfort scales to quantify discomfort in demented elderly are originally performed on paper and are long and not very user-friendly. Therefore a digital discomfort label tool is developed which is a intuitive graphical software representation of these discomfort scales. For aim-C six patients were observed sequentially. A patient was observed for 14 consecutive days. Over this period 6 random days were selected to perform discomfort assessment sessions. During a selected day, 6 sessions will be performed at predefined situations. These situations are: before/while/after care, before/after changing the patients position, and at relaxation. The observed patients are demented elderly suffering from severe dementia of the Alzheimer type. The inclusion criteria are defined by the “Global Deterioration Scale” (GDS) level 7. Using the Functional Assesment STaging (FAST) the patients can be situated between 7 b – 7 f which means they have lost all intelligible vocabulary, they are non-ambulatory, they are unable to sit up independently, they are unable to smile, and they are unable to hold up their head. Results: For aim-A, the acquisition system is based on a personal computer system (a Dell Dimension 9200 Core 2 Duo E 6300 1. 86 GHz) extended with PCI FireWire cards to connect the cameras and a RAID- 0 configuration of three hard disks to be able the store about 60 Mb/second recording data (from the two cameras together). The chosen cameras are the AVT Guppy F- 080 C of Allied Vision Technologies GMBH which are very compact (48, 2 mm x 30 mm x 30 mm (L x W x H) without lens) colour camera. For aim-B the digital discomfort label tool is implemented on a Fujitsu Siemens Lifebook T 4215 tablet pc which provides an intuitive graphical user interface to the nurse or pain expert which allows to perform all required operations. After the assessment session is performed, the software will calculate immediately the discomfort scores for each of the used scales and shows this on the screen. The use of the digital discomfort label tool allows to identifying discomfort indicators not only based on their occurrence but also the timing of this indicator is taken into account. For aim-C the digital discomfort labelling tool provides the caregivers already a better insight in the discomfort experience of their patients. This tool already has lead the caregivers to decided to adapt the discomfort treatment in one out of six patients observed. This early detection was already considered as an added value of the digital discomfort label tool. Conclusions: A video acquisition system, to obtain a high-quality data set of video images of demented elderly labelled with respect to discomfort is build. Furthermore a digital discomfort label tool is developed which can not only calculate the discomfort score but also include timing information of discomfort indicators. This is applied on six patients suffering from severe dementia and lead the caregivers already to decided to adapt the discomfort treatment of one of the observed patient. This early detection was already considered as an added value of the digital discomfort label tool and is an indication for the need of a simple and objective way of monitoring discomfort. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of indoor environmental conditions, human occupancy, and operational characteristics of buildings influence human comfort and indoor environmental quality, including the survival and progression of microbial communities. A suite of continuous, long-term environmental and operational parameters were measured in ten <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> and two nurse stations {{in a new}} hospital building in Chicago, IL to characterize the indoor environment in which microbial samples were taken for the Hospital Microbiome Project. Measurements included environmental conditions (indoor dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, humidity ratio, and illuminance) in the <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> and nurse stations; differential pressure between the <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> and hallways; surrogate measures for human occupancy and activity in the <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> using both indoor air CO 2 concentrations and infrared doorway beam-break counters; and outdoor air fractions in the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems serving the sampled spaces. Measurements were made at 5 -minute intervals over consecutive days for nearly one year, providing a total of ∼ 8 × 106 data points. Indoor temperature, illuminance, and human occupancy/activity were all weakly correlated between rooms, while relative humidity, humidity ratio, and outdoor air fractions showed strong temporal (seasonal) patterns and strong spatial correlations between rooms. Differential pressure measurements confirmed that all <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> were operated at neutral pressure. The <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> averaged about 100 combined entrances and exits per day, which suggests they were relatively lightly occupied compared to higher traffic environments (e. g., retail buildings) and more similar to lower traffic office environments.

40|$|This study investigates how indoor {{daylight}} environments affect patient Average Length of Stay (ALOS), by evaluating {{and analyzing}} daylight levels in <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> {{in comparison to}} their ALOS. The patient ALOS data were taken at one general hospital in Inchon, Korea {{and the other in}} Bryan, Texas, U. S. A.; physical, environmental and daylighting conditions were assessed at each building site. The gathered data were analyzed using SPSS statistical package to determine the trends in patients?????? length of stay in hospital wards with 95 % and 90 % statistical significances. The data were categorized based on the orientation of a <b>patient</b> <b>room</b> and were compared between different orientations and types of <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> in the same ward of each hospital. Selected hospital wards were classified based on their orientations and types of <b>patient</b> <b>rooms.</b> The other variables considered in the study were: the differences in daylighting environments (illuminance, luminance ration, daylight factor, diversity and uniformity of illuminance), and physical environment properties of the <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> of each hospital, and how these affected patient ALOS in both locations (Inchon and Bryan). To analyze the daylighting environment, on-site measurements, RADIANCE simulations and physical scale model measurements were conducted. This study also investigated patients?????? feelings and opinions, and their preferences in daylighting environments with the questionnaire survey. Through this study, three hypotheses were tested and was evidence for the following conclusions. First, there may be a positive relationship between indoor daylight environments and ALOS. Second, seasonal weather differences cause different indoor daylighting levels and may influence the length of patient hospitalization. Third, overall patient satisfaction and reactions to <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> may be related with indoor daylight environments. More controllable shading devices, naturally lighted indoor environments, and glare prevention create positive outcomes for patient ALOS and visual comfort. To increase the validity and confidence about the positive effects of daylight on human physiological conditions, further studies are necessary which provide more samples, facilities and other variables. This study was created as a basis for the development of recommendations for designing <b>patient</b> <b>rooms</b> in healthcare facilities and, as a result, should be used to achieve more effective healing environments...|$|R
