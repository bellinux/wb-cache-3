40|$|A {{number of}} series of <b>poly(acrylic</b> <b>acids)</b> (PAA) of differing end-groups and {{molecular}} mass {{were used to}} study the inhibition of calcium oxalate crystallization. The effects of the end-group on crystal speciation and morphology were significant and dramatic, with hexyl-isobutyrate end groups giving preferential formation of calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) rather than the more stable calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), while both more hydrophobic end-groups and less-hydrophobic end groups led predominantly to formation of the least thermodynamically stable form of calcium oxalate, calcium oxalate trihydrate. Conversely, molecular mass had little impact on calcium oxalate speciation or crystal morphology. It is probable that the observed effects {{are related to the}} rate of desorption of the PAA moiety from the crystal (lite) surfaces and that the results point to a major role for end-group as well as molecular mass in controlling desorption rate...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} series of <b>poly(acrylic</b> <b>acids)</b> (PAA) of differing end-groups and {{molecular}} weights prepared using atom transfer radical polymerization {{were used as}} inhibitors for the crystallization of calcium oxalate at 23 and 80 °C. As measured by turbidimetry and conductivity and as expected from previous reports, all PAA series were most effective for inhibition of crystallization at molecular weights of 1500 – 4000. However, the extent of inhibition was in general strongly dependent on the hydrophobicity and molecular weight of the end-group. These results may be explicable in terms of adsorption/desorption of PAA to growth sites on crystallites. The overall effectiveness of the series didn't follow a simple trend with end-group hydrophobicity, suggesting self-assembly behavior or a balance between adsorption and desorption rates to crystallite surfaces may be critical in the mechanism of inhibition of calcium oxalate crystallization...|$|R

50|$|Bonding {{agents are}} often methacrylates with some {{volatile}} carrier and solvent like acetone. They may also contain diluent monomers. For proper bonding of resin composite restorations, dentin should be conditioned with <b>polyacrylic</b> <b>acids</b> {{to remove the}} smear layer, created during mechanical treatment with dental bore, and expose some of the collagen network or organic matrix of dentin. Adhesive resin should create the so-called hybrid layer (consisting of a collagen network exposed by etching and embedded in adhesive resin). This layer is an interface between dentin and adhesive resin and the final quality of dental restoration depends greatly on its properties. Modern dental bonding systems come as a “three-step system”, where the etchant, primer, and adhesive are applied sequentially; as a “two-step system”, where the etchant and the primer are combined for simultaneous application; and as a “one-step system”, where all the components should be premixed and applied in a single application (so-called seventh generation of bonding agents).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} a {{polymeric}} counterion on the thermotropic behavior of sonicated vesicles formed by complex salts in aqueous solution and with decanol (C 10 OH) and tetradecanol (C 14 OH) was investigated. The complex salts were prepared with dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB) and <b>polyacrylic</b> <b>acids</b> (PAA, containing 30 or 6000 repeating units), being referred to as DODAPA 30 and DODAPA 6000. Vesicles containing polymeric counterions presented higher contents of multilamellar vesicles that were dependent on the complex salt concentration and on the counterion chain length. For comparison, studies were performed with DODAAc, with the counterion acetate, resulting {{in the formation of}} mostly unilamellar vesicles, as expected due greater dissociation, leading to greater electrical repulsion between bilayers. Mixtures of these complex salts and DODAX (where X=acetate or bromide) were also investigated with respect to their vesicles thermotropic behavior and size.

40|$|Water {{solutions}} of eye drops {{belong to}} the most often used ophthalmic drugs. Such solutions are applied to the cornea or into the conjunctiva sack {{in the amount of}} 1 ñ 2 drops, twice to four times a day. Because of the lacrimal system dynamics, eye drops are easily washed away with lacrimal fluid and removed from the eye. Therefore, the time of the direct contact of the fluid with the eye surface is short, and the amount of the drug absorbed constitu-tes only a part of the recommended dose. Hence, preparations of this form require often reapplication if the therapy is to be successful. Prolongation of the time when the therapeutic substance remains in the application spot can be achieved by applying higher viscosity systems, which enable longer contact with the eye surface and thus increased bioavailability of the drug. The most often used substances improving viscosity of eye drops preparations are: methylcellulose 500 ñ 4000 mPs, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxy-ethylcellulose (1 a), sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol (1 b) and <b>polyacrylic</b> <b>acids</b> (Carbo...|$|R

30|$|Pretreatment of {{feed water}} to improve {{membrane}} flux during filtration of agriculture field water containing substituted phenyl urea pesticide diuron has been reported. Laboratory-made reverse osmosis membrane {{was used for}} filtration. Preliminary experiments were conducted with model solution containing natural organic matter extracted from commercial humic acids, divalent ions Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +. Membrane fouling was characterized by pure water flux decline, change in membrane hydrophilicity and infrared spectroscopy. Natural organic matter present in field water causes severe membrane fouling. The presence of divalent cations further aggravated fouling. Use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic <b>acid</b> (EDTA) and <b>polyacrylic</b> <b>acids</b> (PAA) in feed resulted in the decrease in membrane fouling. Pretreatment of field water is a must if it is contaminated with micro-organism having membrane fouling potential. Feed water pretreatment and use of PAA restricted membrane fouling to 16  % after 60  h of filtration. Membrane permeate flux decline was maximum at the first 12  h and thereafter remained steady at around 45 – 46  lm− 2 h− 1 {{till the end of}} 60  h. Diuron rejection remained consistently greater than 93  % throughout the experiment. Diuron rejection was found to be unaffected by membrane fouling.|$|R
40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{structural}} compactness of depletion-induced particle flocs {{with respect to}} the molecular weight of nonadsorbing polymer flocculants. Small-angle static light scattering was used to monitor the structural characteristics of the flocs, which were formed by the addition of nonadsorbing <b>poly(acrylic</b> <b>acids)</b> to a stable colloidal polystyrene latex dispersion. It was found that the floc mass fractal dimension, considered to be a measure of structural compactness, was dependent upon both the molecular weight and the concentration of the polyacid. In particular, reducing the molecular weight of the polymer at a fixed polyacid concentration resulted in higher mass fractal dimensions, despite the highly polydisperse nature of the polymer samples. This structural behavior was attributed to the lower particle sticking efficiencies upon collision. This reduced sticking ability {{is the result of the}} shallowing in the secondary potential energy well with decreasing polymer chain length, which was directly supported by atomic force microscopy data. Our results suggest that the formation of a shallower attraction well with a lower molecular weight nonadsorbing polymer is the result of the insufficiency of the increased osmotic pressure to counter-balance the short-ranged nature of the depletion interaction...|$|R

40|$|The shape {{changes of}} sodium oxalate (NaCO) {{crystals}} {{in the presence}} of <b>polyacrylic</b> <b>acids</b> (PAA) with different molecular weights (1800, 5100, 450 000, 1 250 000 g/mol) and propionic acid (74 g/mol) was investigated in a highly alkaline solution (5 M NaOH). Over the entire concentration range tested (0 - 100 mg/L), propionic acid had no influence on NaCO shape, indicating that the number of carboxylate functional groups is not the vital factor for NaCO shape control, despite playing a role in the adsorption. In contrast, with increasing PAA concentrations, NaCO crystals were significantly modified through distinct shape changes proceeding through a coexisting family of rods, bundles, flower-like structures, irregular spherulites, and eventually spherulites. PAA anions with medium molecular weights (1800, 5100 g/mol) were the most effective in promoting the spherulitic shape. Thus, the mechanisms of NaCO shape changes can be attributed to PAA adsorption on NaCO surfaces and their subsequent incorporation into the NaCO crystal matrix. PAA adsorption is responsible for the inhibition of step train growth on prismatic { 110 } and { 200 } faces and nuclei propagation on their top { 001 } faces. PAA incorporation can lead to multistep-branching growth based on a noncrystallographic crystal branching model...|$|R

The formation of the complexes was characterized using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), cryogenic Transmission Electronic Microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Except at very high molar masses, we find that flexible anionic PAA and PSS lead to co-assembly of proteins with single polyanion chains into nanorods, with a packing factor as expected on the basis of charge stochiometry. Only for very long PAA templates (8 × 105 Da) we find evidence for heterogeneous complexes with thin and thick sections. For the very stiff xanthan chains, we find that its stiffness precludes co-assembly with the artificial viral capsid proteins into condensed and regular nanorods.
