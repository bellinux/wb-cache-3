5|$|An {{antibody}} can be PEGylated (attached to {{molecules of}} <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> {{to slow down}} its degradation by enzymes and to decrease its immunogenicity; this is shown by the word pegol as in alacizumab pegol.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum can {{be grown}} in large pots or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are {{suitable}} for hanging baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried flowers are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in glycerol or <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> also lengthens lifespan.|$|E

40|$|A soil {{bacterium}} {{capable of}} using oligo- and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> and ether alcohols as sole sources of carbon for aerobic growth was isolated. The effects of substituent groups {{added to the}} ether bonds on the acceptability of the compounds as substrates were studied. Mechanisms for the incorporation of two-carbon compounds were demonstrated by the observation that acetate, glyoxylate, ethylene glycol, {{and a number of}} the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates served as growth substrates in minimal media. The rate of oxidation of the short-chained ethylene glycols by adapted resting cells varied directly with increasing numbers of two-carbon units in the chains from one to four. The amount of oxygen consumed per carbon atom of oligo- and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> was 100 % of theoretical, but only 67 % of theoretical for ethylene glycol. Resting cells oxidized oligo- and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> with 2 to 600 two-carbon units in the chains. Longer chained <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> (up to 6, 000) were oxidized at a very slow rate by these cells. Dehydrogenation of triethylene glycol by adapted cells was observed, coupling the reaction with methylene blue reduction...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|In {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and cellular biology {{it is often}} desirable to artificially induce fusion. The addition of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with myeloma cells. The resulting “hybridoma” from this combination expresses a desired antibody {{as determined by the}} B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the melanoma component. Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.|$|E
5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such as the temperature and heating rate).|$|E
40|$|Four {{derivatives}} of 4 -isobutylphenyl- 2 -propionic acid (Ibuprofen), {{in which}} the drug was bound by ester linkages to <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>glycols)</b> (PEG 2000 -I), monomethoxy <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>glycols)</b> (PEG 1900 -I), poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidinone) (PVPI) and poly(N-acryloyl morpholine) (PACM-I), all having approximatively the same {{number average molecular weight}} (M̄(n) 2000), were prepared and tested for their pharmacokinetic properties after oral administration. It was found that the two end-hydroxylated amphiphilic oligomers of polyvinylic structure, PACM and PVP, whose physico-chemical properties are comparable to those of PEGs especially as regards solvent affinity, have in principle a similar potential as promoieties for preparing oligomeric prodrugs...|$|R

The results {{were compared with}} those obtained on two recently introduced gel filtration media (Superdex 75 prep grade and Superdex 200 prep grade); nonspecific adsorptions were observed for the latter.

Multiple conductance levels have been observed with several toxins, suggesting that the channels result from the multimeric assembly of a variable number of toxin molecules. To test this possibility, the size of the channels formed by Cry 1 C was estimated with the non-electrolyte exclusion technique and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> of various molecular weights. In symmetrical 300 mM KCl solutions, Cry 1 C induced channel activity with 15 distinct conductance levels ranging from 21 to 246 pS and distributed in two main conductance populations. Both the smallest and largest conductance levels and the mean conductance values of both populations were systematically reduced in the presence of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> with hydrated radii of up to 1. 05 nm, indicating that these solutes can penetrate the pores formed by the toxin. Larger <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> had little effect on the conductance levels, indicating that they were excluded from the pores.

5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E

Its major uses are to treat ingestion of sustained release drugs, toxins not absorbed by activated charcoal (e.g., lithium, iron), and for removal of ingested drug packets (body packing/smuggling).|$|E

The plots of the adiabatic compressibility versus the mole fraction of PEG-s and EG display two characteristic points at low concentrations: the intersection of the isotherms and their minimum. Such relations between adiabatic compressibility, concentration and temperature are usually attributed to the formation of pseudo-stable molecular structures. To formulate a model of local structures present in the investigated molecular systems it is indispensable to get an insight into hydration of molecules and the formation of hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the attention was focused particularly on these problems...|$|R
