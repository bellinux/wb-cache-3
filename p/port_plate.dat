This study revealed that existing theoretical models, {{which are based on}} the effects of,fiuid compliance within the cylinder, are highly inaccurate a f high speeds or high loads. Fluid momentum at the point of port opening was found to be of considerable importance and an improved digital computer model was developed as an aid to pump design.

Cavitation within the cylinder bore was predicted at both high speed and high load conditions; this was conjirmed experimentally.

40|$|The {{flow control}} of {{hydraulic}} transformers {{is a great}} challenge. To meet this challenge, {{a new kind of}} hydraulic transformer, variable hydraulic transformer (VHT), is proposed in this work. This paper focuses on the power characteristics of the newly proposed VHT, including instantaneous power, average power, power pulsation, and efficiency. In the analyses, the concepts of efficiency, input power, output power, starting angle, and ceasing angle are defined or redefined. To investigate the power characteristics, their models are derived by considering the governing factors such as the control angle of the swash plate and the structure of the <b>port</b> <b>plate.</b> This work highlights that the load flow can be adjusted by adjusting the control angle of the swash plate, and the power characteristics at the B-port produce a remarkable change. In addition, the VHT has a starting angle and a ceasing angle, and these two angles can be adjusted by the influencing factors. The results reveal that the power pulsation and the jump points of the instantaneous power are the primary causes of a less smooth work. Then, it is shown that the control angle of the <b>port</b> <b>plate,</b> the control angle of the swash plate, and the pressures at the ports are the three key elements for a stable operation. The results also reveal that the adjustment of the influencing factors can improve the efficiency...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the dominant leakage characteristics of an axial piston pump. Results have been obtained from a combination of analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimental work, and have added to existing knowledge in this field. The measurement of slipper leakage within an axial piston pump is impossible due to additional leakage from the pistons and between the cylinder barrel and <b>port</b> <b>plate.</b> It may only be determined by analysis and this aspect has been studied via a new CFD simulation. Further progress has been made experimentally on slipper leakage. A new test apparatus was designed and developed by the author and comparisons have been made with parallel analytical work. Previous research in this area has concentrated on single-landed slippers and leakage rates from such slippers have been examined, however only under static conditions. The work in this thesis is the first to consolidate experimental studies on multiple-land slippers, and the first to measure slipper leakage under dynamic conditions. These results have been compared with both CFD simulations and a new theoretical study undertaken in parallel with this work. The new test apparatus allowed measurement of both leakage and groove pressure under a range of operating conditions. It was established that the presence of a groove reduces the restoring moment produced, and hence enables the slipper to operate with an appropriate angle of tilt, thus permitting hydrodynamic lift to more readily exist. However, this occurs at a cost of increased leakage. In addition to the experimental work on slippers, the time-varying pressures within selected cylinders of an axial piston pump were measured. In parallel, a fully dynamic CFD model of a pump was produced. This model included all leakage paths from the pump. It was discovered that the <b>port</b> <b>plate</b> leakage dominated the overall leakage, with slipper leakage still being significant, but with piston leakage insignificant. This model was also used to predict the flow and pressure ripple from the pump and the predictions were compared with experimental measurements.

Also a simulation model of the hydraulic pump is established under the circumstance of SimulationX software, considering the characteristics of the movement of an individual piston, the oil compressibility, and the flow distribution area changed with the rotation angle. The key data of the pump is defined by means of digital simulation. In particular, an analysis is made on the dimension of the unloading groove of the <b>port</b> <b>plate</b> and the characteristics of the flow pulse of the pump. Furthermore, an experimental model pump is manufactured, the basic performances of the pump is tested on the experimental platform at various rotatory speeds such as pressure, flow and noise, in the end the accuracy of the principle is verified...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{mathematical}} model is developed in order to describe {{the dynamics of the}} variable geometric volume swash plate axial piston pumps with the conical cylinder blocks and the integrated control unit. Using the validated model, an analytical study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the <b>port</b> <b>plate</b> configuration on pump performance. Simulation of the change in the cylinder pressure and pump flow rate, in a systematic sequential procedure, led to an improved geometry for the suction and delivery silencing grooves on the valve plate. Cavitaion in the cylinder and pump noise were also reduced with the improved geometry. Force and vibration analysis of the pumping mechanism were carried out. This analysis presents some design recommendations regarding the moments acting on the swash plate, dynamic loads acting on the drive shaft bearings and the advantages and the limitations of using the conical arrangement of the pistons. Pump performance is simulated using a conventional PD controller with double negative feedback loop to control the swash plate swiveling angle, as currently used in practical applications. An introductory study of implementing other control schemes is conducted. A fuzzy controller is proposed to replace the PD controller in a double feedback control loop in order to improve the robustness of the control action. A single feedback control loop is proposed to replace the double control loop in order to suppress the steady state vibration of the swash plate. The control schemes were prototyped using specially developed real-time control techniques on a personal computer. The experimental setup is also used to verify the analytical findings of the pump performance with the newly proposed control schemes...|$|E
40|$|Swash plate {{pumps are}} widely used to drive {{hydraulic}} systems, especially because they offer high specific power. In order to improve their performance and make them more reliable, {{it is necessary to}} reduce the flow fluctuations, incorporate a control system that is more responsive, and minimize vibration levels. Furthermore, the flow should be controlled according to load requirements and pipe response at the design level. Moreover, {{there is a need to}} monitor the health of the system by analysing its vibration signatures. A novel <b>port</b> <b>plate</b> design is used with a pair of deep silencing grooves on the edges of delivery and suction ports, which reduces the flow fluctuations and improves the pump output. In addition to the load information, the pipe dynamics are also used as a control input. Hence, pipe instabilities with different boundary conditions are studied, where simple, accurate and comprehensive expressions to describe the pipe instabilities are produced, solved, and plotted. In swash plate pumps, the control unit changes the pump output according to the load requirements. The current pump design is equipped with a double negative feedback strategy. The inner loop controls the spool position, and the outer loop controls the swash plate angle. Since this design has a high rise time, it was suggested to equip the pump with a single feedback PD controller. Although this reduced the rise time, it introduced high levels of vibration. The present research proposes a new control strategy with a single feedback PID controller that minimizes vibration levels. Results are obtained experimentally. The control strategy is generalized to control the pump flow according to load requirements and pipe vibration levels. A compensation factor is introduced to moderate the negative impact of the pipe vibrations, and to generate a new set value for the inclination angle. For timely detection of faults, the application of wavelet analysis to detect different defects is examined. Some defects are produced, such as pipe flutter, pump dynamic instability, and voltage unbalance in the driving electric motor. Continuous wavelet and discrete wavelet analyses are used to analyze the vibration signature by using Debauches' mother wavelet. The data is collected experimentally. The results show that wavelet analysis is very efficient at identifying defects in the pipe or pump. The results are discussed and appropriate conclusions are drawn based on the present research. Suggestions for future extensions of the research are propose...|$|E

40|$|It is {{possible}} to design cylindrical helical gearing profiles such that an externally lobed inner gear rotates inside an internally lobed outer gear while maintaining continuous lines of contact between the gears. The continuous contact between {{the inner and outer}} rotors (analogous to the main and gate rotors in a conventional screw machine) creates a series of separate working chambers. In this type of machine the rotors have parallel axes of rotation, and if both rotors are free to rotate about their own axes, these axes can be fixed in space. The use of <b>ported</b> end <b>plates</b> is proposed to control the period during which fluid is allowed to enter or leave the working chambers of the internally geared screw machine. As with conventional screw machines, these internally geared rotors can then be used to achieve compression or expansion of a trapped mass of fluid, and the machine geometry can be designed in order to optimise performance for particular applications. This paper describes the geometrical analysis of some simple rotor profiles and explores the effect on rotor torques for particular applications of this novel screw configuration...|$|R
