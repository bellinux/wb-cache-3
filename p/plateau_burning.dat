40|$|The <b>plateau</b> <b>burning</b> {{behavior}} of composite solid propellants consisting of ammonium perchlorate (AP) and hydrocarbon (HC) binder with a bimodal AP parti-cle size distribution (coarse and fine) is examined. The focus is the weak pressure {{dependence of the}} propellant burn rate (i. e., a plateau) in an intermediate range of about 2. 7 - 6. 9 MPa (~ 400 - 1000 psi). The relationship between the appearance of this mid-pressure plateau for a composite propellant and self-extinction during the burning of the corresponding fine AP/binder matrix (i. e., the propellant formulation without the coarse AP particles) is experimentally examined through the study of a compositional array of propellants, sandwiches (two-dimensional propellants) and matrixes. The burn...|$|E
40|$|Several Fox 7 based {{propellant}} formulations {{were studied}} {{in order to}} obtain a minimum or reduced smoke composite propellant with inherent IM-properties. Two polymer binder systems are examined: the high energy GAP and a low energy poly-urethane binder containing a large fraction of high energetic plasticizers. Variation of the AP level in the Fox 7 /GAP propellants gives burn rates of between 10 and 20 mm/s with low pressure exponents. Crawford as well motor-firings of Fox 7 /AP/GAP formulations indicated a surprising <b>plateau</b> <b>burning</b> behaviour between 7 and 12 MPa, very similar to Double-Base propellants. Chemical stability and sensitivity data demonstrated acceptable values. Fox 7 /PU compositions with nitro plasticizers exhibit the best thermal stability within ARC measurements. Shock sensitivity test results correspond to values with a 1. 3 hazard classification. The conclusion is that Fox 7 /GAP propellants are suitable for the rocket propulsion of projectiles in shoulder lau nched weapons, although the mechanical properties may need further improvement...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} decomposition and burning behaviours of polyurethane foams experimentally and compares the experimental results obtained with the numerical {{results from the}} pyrolysis model of Fire Dynamics Simulator, Version 5 (FDS 5). Based on the comparison of model and experimental heat release rates, {{the accuracy of the}} pyrolysis model is quantified. In total, this research tested seven polyurethane foams consisting of three non-fire retardant (NFR) and four fire retardant (FR) foams. According to the simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis (SDT) experiments, the decomposition behaviour of polyurethane foams under nitrogen environment is represented by two pyrolysis reactions. The first reaction consists of foam decomposition into melts and gases while the second reaction consists of the decomposition of the remaining melts into gases. The kinetic properties which govern the rate of decomposition are the activation energy (E), pre-exponential factor (A), reaction order (n) and heat of reaction (Δhr). Using graphical techniques, E, A and n of the first and second reactions are determined from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results. Through analysing the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, Δhr is determined from the changes in heat flow and sample mass. The thermophysical properties govern the heat transfer through material and these are the thermal conductivity (λ) and specific heat (cp) which are measured experimentally at ambient temperature through the Hot Disk method. Through the Sample Feeding Vertical Cone, the decomposition and melting behaviours of polyurethane foams in a vertical orientation are investigated and the foams tested can be categorised into those which produce melts only after ignition and those which produce melts and char after ignition. The 1 -dimensional burning behaviour of foams is obtained from the cone calorimeter experiments. The NFR foams show a change from <b>plateau</b> <b>burning</b> behaviour at low heat flux to two stage burning behaviour at high heat flux while the FR foams consistently show two stage burning behaviour. The combustion property governs the amount of heat released when fuel combusts and this is the effective heat of combustion (Δhc,eff) which is determined from the heat released and mass consumed in the cone experiment. The 1 -dimensional burning behaviour is simulated using the pyrolysis model of FDS 5 and two different modelling approaches are considered. The direct method uses the material properties determined experimentally as FDS 5 inputs while the refined method uses the genetic algorithm of Gpyro to refine the kinetic properties which are later used as FDS 5 inputs. The heat release rate of the model and experiment are compared through linear regression analysis which quantifies the accuracy of both methods. The accuracy is defined as the percentage of data points within the boundary of acceptance which is bounded by 25 % of the greatest experimental heat release rate. This assessment method places greater emphasis on the accuracy of developed burning phases and lesser emphasis on the accuracy of initial growth and final decay. The accuracy of the direct method is found to be 56 % while the refined method with estimated kinetic properties achieves a higher accuracy of 75 %. The 2 -dimensional burning behaviours are investigated in the foam slab experiments for two different slab thicknesses, 120 and 100 mm. The opposed-flow spread of 120 mm slab is more intense and rapid while for the 100 mm slab, the flame spread is less intense and slow. FDS 5 is used to simulate the experimental results but when the material properties either developed experimentally or refined by Gpyro are used as inputs, the model fails to produce flame spread. This is because FDS 5 does not yet have the features which address the dynamics of foam melting and the reactive nature of the flame. In order to produce flame spread in the model, E of the reactions have been reduced to increase the decomposition rate...|$|E

40|$|Composite {{propellants}} {{are composed}} of a solid oxidizer that is mixed into a hydrocarbon binder that when polymerized results in a solid mass capable of selfsustained combustion after ignition. <b>Plateau</b> propellants exhibit <b>burning</b> rate curves that do not follow the typical linear relationship between burning rate and pressure when plotted on a log-log scale, {{and because of this}} deviation their burning behavior is classified as anomalous burning. It is not unusual for solid-particle additives to be added to propellants in order to enhance burning rate or other properties. However, the effect of nano-size solid additives in these propellants is not fully understood or agreed upon within the research community. The current project set out to explore what possible variables were creating this result and to explore new additives. This thesis contains a literature review chronicling the last half-century of research to better understand the mechanisms that govern anomalous burning and to shed light on current research into plateau and related propellants. In addition to the review, a series of experiments investigating the use of nanoscale TiO 2 -based additives in AP-HTPB composite propellants was performed. The baseline propellant consisted of either 70 % or 80 % monomodal AP (223 ?m) and 30 % or 20 % binder composed of IPDI-cured HTPB with Tepanol. Propellants? burning rates were tested using a strand bomb between 500 and 2500 psi (34. 0 - 170. 1 atm). Analysis of the burning rate data shows that the crystal phase and synthesis method of the TiO 2 additive are influential to plateau tailoring and to the apparent effectiveness of the additive in altering the burning rate of the composite propellant. Some of the discrepancy in the literature regarding the effectiveness of TiO 2 as a tailoring additive may be due to differences in how the additive was produced. Doping the TiO 2 with small amounts of metallic elements (Al, Fe, or Gd) showed additional effects on the burning rate that depend on the doping material and the amount of the dopant...|$|R
40|$|The current MK 66 2. 75 inch Rocket Motor double-base {{propellant}} contains the lead-based ballistic modifier LC- 12 - 15 {{to achieve the}} desired <b>plateau</b> and mesa <b>burning</b> rate characteristics. The use of lead compounds poses {{a concern for the}} environment and for personal safety due to the metal's toxic nature when introduced into the atmosphere by propellant manufacture, rocket motor firing, and disposal. Copper beta-resorcylate (copper 2, 4 -di-hydroxy-benzoate) was successfully used in propellant as a simple modifier in the mid 1970 's. This and other compounds have also been mixed with lead salts to obtain more beneficial ballistic results. Synthesized complexes of lead and copper compounds soon replaced the mixtures. The complexes incorporate the lead, copper lack of organic liquids, which allows for easier propellant processing. About ten years ago, the Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), initiated an effort to develop a lead-free propellant for use in missile systems. Several lead-free propellant candidate formulations were developed. About five years ago, NSWC, in conjunction with Alliant Techsystems, Radford Army Ammunition Plant, continued ballistic modifier investigations. A four component ballistic modifier system without lead for {{double-base propellant}}s that provide adequate plateau and mesa burn rate characteristics was developed and patented. The ballistic modifier's system contains bismuth subsalicylate, 1. 5 percent; copper salicylate, 1. 0 percent, copper stannate, 0. 77 percent; and carbon black, 0. 1 percent. Action time and impulse data obtained through multiple static firings indicate that the new lead-free double-base propellant, while not a match for NOSIH-AA- 2, will be a very suitable replacement in the 2. 75 inch Rocket Motor. Accelerated aging of the double-base propellant containing the lead-free ballistic modifier showed that it had a much higher rate of stabilizer depletion than the AA- 2. A comprehensive study showed that an increased rate of stabilizer depletion occurred in propellants containing monobasic copper salicylate. The study also showed that propellants containing a mixture of bismuth subsalicylate and copper salicylate, had only about one-half the stabilizer depletion rate than those with copper salicylate alone. The copper salicylate catalyzes the decomposition of nitroglycerin, which triggers a chain of events leading to the increased rate of stabilizer depletion. A program has been initiated to coat the ballistic modifier, thus isolating it from the nitroglycerin...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} of {{hydroxylammonium nitrate}} (HAN) are promising as possible replacements for hydrazine as liquid rocket propellants. HAN-based propellants offer lower toxicity, higher density, and possibly higher specific impulse compared to hydrazine, but {{further research is}} needed to fully understand the combustion of HAN mixtures and to implement them in actual applications. The thesis presented here studies the combustion of HAN mixtures in a constant volume strand-burner over a pressure range between 3 and 20 MPa. A solution of 82. 4 wt% HAN in water was used as a baseline from which other solutions were created. Silica and titania nanoparticles were added separately at concentrations of 1 wt% and 3 wt% in the baseline solution based on previous studies that have shown their effects on burning rates of other types of liquid propellants. A 14. 9 -wt% methanol mixture was examined based on previous studies that showed methanol?s effectiveness as a reducing agent in HAN-based propellants. A combination of 14. 9 wt% methanol and 1 wt% silica was also studied. The preparation of these formulations is discussed in detail. Two different methods to measure the burning rates of HAN-based propellants were used in this study. First, a peak-pressure method used the point of highest pressure in the pressure trace to mark the end of the sample combustion. This method has been used successfully with other liquid and solid propellants, but for HAN-based propellants it showed large discrepancies in burning rates when compared to similar formulations studied by other research groups. An inflection-point method was developed using the results of high-speed video to identify an inflection in the pressure trace as the end of visual burning. This method was applied retroactively to burns that were initially measured with the peak-pressure method. The peak-pressure method shows an increase in burning rates with the addition of the nanoparticle additives, especially at lower pressures. This method also shows very complex pressure-dependent burning regimes for mixtures containing methanol. The baseline solution with only added methanol increased burning rates at low pressures and a <b>plateau</b> of increased <b>burning</b> rates between 11 and 19 MPa. On the other hand, the methanol solution with the addition of silica has burning rates more similar to the baseline. As expected, the inflection-point method produces much higher burning rates compared to the peak-pressure method for HAN-based propellant mixtures. The results are in better agreement with similar formulations studied by other groups, although it is unclear whether the resulting burning rate best represents the entire burning of the HAN-based mixture. The inflection-point method shows almost no effect of nanoparticle additives on the burning rates of the baseline HAN mixture. Also, the inflection-point method produces burning rates for the methanol mixtures that are lower than the baseline across most of the tested pressure range. The methanol mixtures also maintain the pressure-dependent burning regimes found with the peak-pressure method...|$|R
