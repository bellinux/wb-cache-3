They also agreed, in <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new project, that the United States would be heavily involved in the Mir programme as part of an international project known as the Shuttle–Mir Programme. The project, sometimes called [...] "Phase One", was intended to allow the United States to learn from Russian experience in long-duration spaceflight and to foster a spirit of cooperation between the two nations and their space agencies, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos). The project prepared the way for further cooperative space ventures, specifically, [...] "Phase Two" [...] of the joint project, the construction of the International Space Station (ISS). The programme was announced in 1993; the first mission started in 1994, and the project continued until its scheduled completion in 1998. Eleven Space Shuttle missions, a joint Soyuz flight, and almost 1000 cumulative days in space for US astronauts occurred over the course of seven long-duration expeditions.|$|E

2500|$|Alter {{translated}} [...] to {{call for}} “an indigo twist” on the Israelites' garments. Alter explained that the dye was not derived from a plant, as is indigo, but from a substance secreted by the murex, harvested {{off the coast of}} Phoenicia. The extraction and <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> dye were labor-intensive and thus quite costly. It was used for royal garments in many places in the Mediterranean region, and in Israel it was also used for priestly garments and for the cloth furnishings of the Tabernacle. Alter argued that the indigo twist betokened the idea that Israel should become (in the words of [...] ) a “kingdom of priests and a holy nation” and perhaps also that, as the covenanted people, metaphorically God's firstborn, {{the nation as a whole}} had royal status.|$|E
2500|$|Truman {{was less}} than enthused about the large defense cost {{projections}} for NSC-68 {{and its implications for}} existing domestic budgetary spending priorities, and initially sent it back without comment to its authors for further analysis. [...] Although Truman took no immediate formal action on NSC 68, the paper gained considerable support when the North Koreans attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950. Johnson's obstinate attitude toward the State Department role in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> paper adversely affected his relations with both Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Truman. Although Johnson publicly professed belief that [...] "the advance guard in the campaign for peace that America wages today must be the State Department," [...] his disagreements with Acheson and his restrictions on DoD contacts with the State Department persisted until the realities of the Korean War caused his fall from favor with the White House.|$|E

Similarly, Professor Nili Fox of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion wrote that it is no accident that the violet-blue wool cord that [...] required be attached to the fringes is identical to the cord that hangs from the priest’s headdress in [...] Fox argued that the tzitzit on the Israelites’ garments identified them as being holy to God and symbolically connected them to the priests. [...] Thereby, the Israelites pledged their loyalty to God as well as to the priests who oversaw the laws. And similarly, Terence Fretheim, Professor Emeritus at Luther Seminary, argued that tassels, worn by royalty in the ancient Near East, were to be attached to each corner of everyone’s garments, with a blue(-purple) cord on each, as a public sign of Israel’s status as a holy people and a reminder of what that entailed.|$|E

40|$|The acid phosphatases of rat liver mitochondrial-lysosomal {{fractions}} {{have been}} examined by quantitative and electrophoretic means. Disruption of mitochondrial-lysosomal material by freeze-thawing, sonication, or by blendor treatment released approximately 55. 0 to 65. 0 per cent of the total acid phosphatase activity of the fraction into the unsedimentable phase. Electrophoretic <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> material showed a single acid phosphatase-active site. Treatment of mitochondrial-lysosomal fractions with 5. 0 per cent Triton X- 100 released 98. 0 per cent of the total acid phosphatase activity of the fraction into the unsedimentable phase. Electrophoretic <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> material showed two major sites of acid phosphatase activity. One of these was identical to that resolved following physical disruption. The other site was characteristically seen only after treatment with Triton X- 100. This acid phosphatase was also released by treatment with digitonin but to a lesser extent. Quantitative and electrophoretic examination indicated that both components of acid phosphatase were concentrated in the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction. Physical separation of the acid phosphatase released by detergent treatment from the acid phosphatase released by physical disruption was achieved. It was concluded that two categories of acid phosphatase may reside in lysosomal particles. These phosphatases differ {{in the nature of}} their binding to lysosomal structure as well as in their electrophoretic properties...|$|R
