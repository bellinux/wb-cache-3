40|$|Graduation date: 1972 This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether individual students at the eleventh grade level who were graded on a <b>pass-fail</b> basis in United States History would show any difference in academic achievement from those of a similar group marked by the traditional ABCD-F letter-grade method. In addition, the study was to investigate the effect, if any, of the <b>pass-fail</b> marking system on the study habits, study attitudes, and the over-all study orientation of the same students as compared with those being evaluated by the letter-grade system. Specific hypotheses to be examined were: 1. There is no difference between the experimental and control groups in the academic achievement of the United States History students as measured by the Crary American History Test. 2. There is no difference between the experimental and control groups in academic behavior (study habits) of the United States History students as measured by the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes. 3. There is no difference between the experimental and control groups in the study attitudes of the United States History students as measured by the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes. 4. There is no difference between the experimental and control groups in over-all study orientation of the United States History students as measured by the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes. A review of the literature reveals considerable dissatisfaction with the traditional ABCD-F letter-grade marking system widely used in the secondary schools of the United States. The <b>pass-fail</b> concept appears to have merit as a more flexible system, and its use on the secondary level in increasing. The sample consisted of six eleventh grade required United States History classes at Rex Putnam High School, Milwaukie, Oregon. One hundred and two individuals participated in the experimental groups. They received a <b>pass-fail</b> mark on all routine class work as well as grade card reports throughout the academic year. Data were obtained for 96 experimental subjects. One hundred and five individuals participated in the control group. They were exposed to the traditional ABCD-F letter-grade marking system throughout the academic year. Complete data were obtained for 99 control subjects. Statistical treatment was applied to the data for 195 subjects. The Crary American History Test and the Survey of Study Habits and. Attitudes were administered to subjects prior {{to the beginning of the}} research and at the conclusion of the project. An analysis of the post-test score gains revealed no differences between the means of the experimental and control groups as tested by t at the. 05 level of significance on all four measures; hence, all four hypotheses were supported in that subjects exposed to the <b>pass-fail</b> system showed no difference in academic achievement, study habits, study attitudes, and study orientation from those treated by the traditional ABCD-F letter-grade marking system. Recommendations for further research in secondary marking systems include: 1. The merits and demerits of innovative grading practices as compared with traditional marking systems. 2.

40|$|Speed debug is a {{critical}} part of microprocessor diagnosis and debug. During this stage, the test engineer must determine and increase the maximum speed at which the processor can run reliably. One of the difficulties of this stage is that the <b>pass-fail</b> boundary, in practice, is not abrupt, but rather encompasses a non-deterministic region of behavior. Accurately modeling this non-deterministic region is particularly important since it directly influences the amount of time needed for speed debug. Current chip debug efforts often rely on the use of brute force techniques to deduce the shape of the <b>pass-fail</b> boundary region. More specifically, speed debug (i. e., the process of finding and fixing critical paths that prevent a chip from running at a higher frequency) requires a thorough understanding of the width and shape of the <b>pass-fail</b> boundary region where the chip’s behavior is nondeterministic. In this paper, we propose a statistical method based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) techniques to infer the underlying shape of the non-deterministic region.

This study aims to assess the reliability of BRM when the <b>pass-fail</b> standard in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was calculated by averaging the BRM standards obtained for each station separately. Materials and Methods: In nine stations of the OSCE with direct observation the examiners gave each student a checklist score and a global score. Using a linear regression model for each station, we calculated the checklist score cut-off on the regression equation for the global scale cut-off set at 2. The OSCE <b>pass-fail</b> standard was defined as the average of all station′s standard. To determine the reliability, the root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated. The R 2 coefficient and the inter-grade discrimination were calculated to assess the quality of OSCE. Results: The mean total test score was 60. 78. The OSCE <b>pass-fail</b> standard and its RMSE were 47. 37 and 0. 55, respectively. The R 2 coefficients ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 79.

40|$|ABSTRACT. TWO {{approaches}} are described for the simultaneous determination of pass-ing scores for subtests when the passing {{score for the}} total test is known. The minimax approach seeks subtest passing scores {{in such a way}} that there is maximum agreement between <b>pass-fail</b> classifications based on each subtest and <b>pass-fail</b> decisions based on the entire test. The Rasch procedure seeks subtest passing scores that occupy approx-imately the same place on the ability scale with the total test passing score. In the context of a basic skills assessment program, the two approaches yield essentially the same set of passing scores. In state-wide or district-wide testing programs such as the South Carolina Basic Skills Assessment Program (BSAP) designed for instructional purposes, test results should be reported with as much detail as possible. For example, when a test is comprised of several subtests, each measuring a separate in-structional objective, an overall description of a student's achievement on the total test is used to determine if the student has adequately mastered the instructional unit covered by the test.
