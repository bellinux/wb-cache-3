40|$|In recent years, a {{great deal}} of {{interest}} has been oriented towards hydraulic systems which are energy efficient, responsive (tracking), and accurate. The traditional approach to achieving responsive and accurate positioning performance is to use a servo valve actuator and position and/or velocity feedback. An alternate positioning system is an electrohydraulic actuation system (EHA), in which the fluid from the hydraulic motor is directed back to the inlet of the pump. Changing the swashplate angle or varying the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> <b>shaft</b> speed varies the flow to the hydraulic actuator (linear or rotary) which in turn is used to control the positioning or speed of the load. Because there are no major losses associated with throttling of the fluid, power losses are minimized. In earlier EHA systems, the actuator was limited to that of a rotary system because of the requirement for symmetry in the flow to and from the motor. Recent design changes to linear single rod actuators have expanded the EHA applications to linear positioning. In addition, a specially designed EHA linear actuator system was shown to be able to position a load to 200 nanometers. However, the ability to track a desired input path was not extensively studied and as such, algorithms to control this high precision EHA system were required; hence this was the motivation for this study. The main objective of the thesis was to develop high performance control schemes for (1) a valve controlled hydraulic positioning control system (HPCS) and (2) a specific precision positioning EHA system and verify their position tracking performance. Control methods that were applied to HPCSs in the past decade were comprehensively reviewed in this dissertation. Many successful control algorithms have been developed for hydraulic transmission systems, however, certain problems such as slip-stick friction, uncertainty and nonlinearity in hydraulic actuators, pumps and valves are not fully addressed. Three control algorithms are considered in this study: (1) H 2 -optimal control, (2) Hâˆž PI plus feedforward control, and (3) robust sliding mode control. The design processes of these three algorithms were based on discrete-time system models. The first two algorithms were based on linear models of the systems while the third applied nonlinear actuator friction in the system model. These three different control algorithms are developed and implemented using simulations and experiments; in addition, their control performance in terms of position tracking and bandwidth performance are examined...|$|E

40|$|Marine {{propulsion}} {{plants can}} experience large power fluctuations during tight manoeuvres. During these critical situations, dramatic increases of shaft torque are possible, {{up to and}} over 100 % of the steady values in straight course. In {{the case of a}} twin-screw ship turning circle, the two shaft lines dynamics can be completely different in terms of required power and torque. This phenomenon, if not correctly considered, is potentially dangerous, especially for propulsion plants with two shaft lines powered via a unique reduction gear, which can be subject to significant unbalances. The paper presents a simulation approach able to represent the dynamics of a twin-screw ship propulsion plant in these critical working conditions. The numerical model includes the ship manoeuvrability and the dynamic behaviour of <b>prime</b> <b>movers,</b> <b>shaft</b> lines, propellers and propulsion control system. Numerical results obtained have been compared to full-scale measurements in order to validate the proposed simulation approach...|$|R
50|$|In the {{traditional}} azimuth thrusters such as Z-drive and L-drive thrusters, the propeller {{is driven by}} an electric motor or a diesel engine inside the ship's hull. The propeller is coupled to the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> with <b>shafts</b> and bevel gears that allow rotating the propeller about a vertical axis. This type of propulsion system {{has a long tradition}} throughout the 1990s and today such propulsion units are produced by a number of companies around the world.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{gearboxes}} {{are used}} to increase torque while reducing {{the speed of a}} <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> output <b>shaft</b> (e.g. a motor crankshaft). This means that the output shaft of a gearbox rotates at a slower rate than the input shaft, and this reduction in speed produces a mechanical advantage, increasing torque. A gearbox can be set up to do the opposite and provide an increase in shaft speed with a reduction of torque. Some of the simplest gearboxes merely change the physical rotational direction of power transmission.|$|R
40|$|Use of {{electronic}} control onboard to handle complex and powerful propulsion systems has constantly increased; this, in turn, may influence ship behaviour during manoeuvres. As {{it is well}} known during manoeuvre of a twin-propeller vessel, like turning circle or zig-zag manoeuvres, significant unbalances on the shaft lines, in terms of torque and thrust loads, are experienced. As regards the propulsion and the control system design point of view, this aspect has {{to be taken into account}} together with the general increase of the shaft torque with the respect to the steady state value. To prevent possible problems, the control system must be properly set, through dedicated control functions, to maintain the shaft torque or the engine torque below the allowed levels, to reach and maintain the wanted rotational shaft lines regime, etc. In present paper, a comprehensive approach to simulate the interaction between the ship propulsion system and manoeuvrability, during transients and off design conditions, is presented. The behaviour of the ship is simulated by means of a numerical model, developed by the authors, which includes the ship dynamics (3 D. O. F. model), the propulsion plant dynamics (i. e. <b>prime</b> <b>movers,</b> <b>shaft</b> lines, propellers, etc.) and the control system dynamics. This model has been calibrated by means of an extensive free running model campaign, simulating the manoeuvres in model scale, carried out with simplified control schemes. At the end of this paper some simulation results are shown in order to better understand the effects of the propulsion control settings on the expected dynamic behaviour of the ship at full scale...|$|R

5000|$|A speed {{reference}} as {{percentage of}} actual speed {{is set in}} this mode. As the generator is loaded from no load to full load, the actual speed of the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> tends to decrease.

Because the actual <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> speed is fixed by the grid, this difference in speed reference and actual speed of the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> is used to increase the flow of working fluid (fuel, steam, etc.) to the <b>prime</b> <b>mover,</b> and hence power output is increased.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{the design of}} a {{toroidal}} <b>prime</b> <b>mover.</b> The primary design tool is a MATLAB program based on a standing wave analysis of thermoacoustics. A conventional <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> that has been well studied, was used for validating the program. DeltaE, a program developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for designing thermoacoustic engines, was also used as an auxiliary tool for validation test purposes. The validation suggested that the MATLAB program models the onset conditions of a conventional <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> with fair accuracy. The program was then applied to a toroidal <b>prime</b> <b>mover.</b> A series of analyses were conducted on a toroidal <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> to determine the influence of <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> circumference, stack length, and duct radius. The final design calls for a 150 cm circumference, 2. 54 cm duct radius, and 1. 9 cm stack length.

Fourteen infants were assessed at 4 and 6 months during reaching in supine and supported sitting. Kinematics and EMG-activity of deltoid, pectoralis major, biceps (BB) and triceps brachii were recorded. Kinematic analysis focused on number of movement units (MUs) and transport MU (MU with longest duration). <b>Prime</b> <b>mover</b> use was variable, but at 6 months a dominance of BB emerged in both testing conditions. Kinematics were also variable, but with increasing age the number of MU decreased and the relative proportion of the transport MU increased. BB as <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> at 6 months was related to a larger transport MU. Conclusion: Between 4 and 6 months BB <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> dominance emerges which is related to relatively efficient reaching characteristics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
