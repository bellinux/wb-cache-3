5|$|Film star Bruce Cabot, {{who played}} the part of Bert Saxby, died the {{following}} year; Diamonds {{turned out to be}} his final film role. Jimmy Dean was cast as Willard Whyte after Saltzman saw a presentation of him. Dean was very worried about playing a Howard Hughes <b>pastiche,</b> because he was an employee of Hughes at the Desert Inn.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman. It was {{originally}} planned that series four would {{conclude with a}} Christmas special. It {{would have been a}} <b>pastiche</b> of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, with Sarah Jane being shown Christmas past, present and future by a guide. Tom Baker was considered at one point for the role of the guide.|$|E
5|$|Fatale, the superhero narrator. A rookie hero {{recruited}} by the New Champions, she is a cyborg, the result of experimental surgery following a near-fatal accident in São Paulo. She eventually discovers that the corporation responsible for creating and maintaining her cybernetic parts were a cover for one of Doctor Impossible's schemes. For a time she worked National Security Agency missions. She is a <b>pastiche</b> of Cyborg and Tomorrow Woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the scene is a <b>pastiche</b> of the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, and it possibly also borrows from Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, {{who had lived in}} England and whose work Hogarth admired. An earlier source of inspiration may have been a woodcut in the 1495 Fasciculo di medicina by Johannes de Ketham which, although simpler, has many of the same elements, including the seated president flanked by two windows.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{draws on}} various Romantic literary traditions, {{such as the}} comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, and the Byronic hero. The novel's language is a <b>pastiche</b> of 19th-century writing styles, {{such as those of}} Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Clarke describes the supernatural with careful detail. She supplements the text with almost 200 footnotes, outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, she {{published}} {{a collection of}} her short stories, The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories (2006). Both Clarke's novel and her short stories are set in a magical England and written in a <b>pastiche</b> of the styles of 19th-century writers such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. While Strange focuses {{on the relationship of}} two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham {{moved on}} to other projects. In the 1760s, he was {{approached}} by his most illustrious patron, the Duke of York (brother of King George III), to design one of the greatest mansions in Pall Mall, namely York House. The rectangular mansion that Brettingham designed was built in the Palladian style on two principal floors, with the state rooms as at Norfolk House, arranged in a circuit around the central staircase hall. The house was a mere <b>pastiche</b> of Norfolk House, but for Brettingham it had the kudos of a royal occupant.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by Croatian writer Darko Macan, {{the series}} was then taken over by Brian Azzarello, once again hired {{on the strength of}} his own series for Vertigo, 100 Bullets. Azzarello's run is one large meta-story, that follows John Constantine on a trip across America, starting with his incarceration in prison, then variously uncovering a pornography ring, catching a serial killer, taking on a Neo Nazi group before finally dealing with the architect of his incarceration, Stanley W. Manor, a thinly-veiled <b>pastiche</b> of Batman. Brian Azzarello did return for one of the five stories in issue #250.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, a Sullivan <b>pastiche</b> score (with some Offenbach added), {{arranged}} by Timothy Henty, {{was first used}} with Gilbert's libretto adapted by Anthony Baker, at the Normansfield Theatre in Teddington, Middlesex, England, the first professional British production since 1872. This was performed several times subsequently, including at the 2014 International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival. Also in 2008, an original score by Thomas Z. Shepard was first performed in concert by the Blue Hill Troupe in New York City and was finally given a fully staged amateur production in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Other {{works that}} {{followed}} continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard's surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed {{his first major}} liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which {{has become the most}} frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was <b>pastiche</b> 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and {{it was not until the}} 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.|$|E
5|$|Some {{sources have}} {{suggested}} that the opera was performed in Dublin in March or April 1711, though according to Dean and Knapp there is no record of such an occasion. In November 1715 a version mainly in German was performed in Hamburg. This production, based on a translation by the playwright Barthold Feind, proved to be very popular and was revived in the city on numerous occasions during the 1720s. A <b>pastiche</b> of the opera, with additional numbers by Leonardo Leo, was presented by Leo at the Royal Court in Naples in 1718, with Nicolini singing his original role.|$|E
5|$|The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories, {{published}} in October 2006, {{is a collection}} of eight short stories by Susanna Clarke and illustrated by Charles Vess. The stories, which are sophisticated fairy tales, focus on the power of women and are set in the same alternate history as Clarke's debut novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell (2004), in which magic has returned to England. The stories are written in a <b>pastiche</b> of 18th- and 19th-century styles and their tone is macabre as well as satirical. The volume was generally well received, though some critics compared it unfavorably to Jonathan Strange.|$|E
5|$|The filmmaker Derek Jarman {{adapted the}} Marlowe play into a film in 1991, {{creating}} a postmodern <b>pastiche</b> of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies. In Jarman's version, Edward finally escapes captivity, following the {{tradition in the}} Fieschi letter. Edward's current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting appearance in Mel Gibson's 1995 film Braveheart, where he is portrayed as weak and implicitly homosexual, wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup, shunning the company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with the Scots. The film received extensive criticism, both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the video}} shows various shots at Waterloo Station, as the chorus starts. In slow motion, {{the camera pans}} across the WHSmith shop on the station {{concourse}} as the duo walk past. It cuts to a brief shot of a No. 42 red double-decker bus, showing the destination as Aldgate, also advertising the stage-show Evita, then black and white shots of the Tower Bridge, Westminster and the Westminster Palace Clock Tower from the sky. The duo poses on the South Bank of the River Thames in a <b>pastiche</b> of a postcard image, with the Houses of Parliament as a background.|$|E
5|$|Western RPGs changed {{following}} this period. Non-player characters were given more dialogue, as in Baldur's Gate, party sizes became smaller, as in Fallout, and combat became faster, as in Diablo. Games became more accessible. Their feel became more cinematic rather than novelistic, and {{they focused on}} a single player-made character who progressed through the game as the player's sole avatar. Video games became darker and more thematically consistent. Designers abandoned or reconciled some of the eccentric elements and <b>pastiche</b> of the 8-bit and 16-bit titles. Diablo, for instance, displayed a consistent Gothic style throughout the series, and the Elder Scrolls series downplayed its cat- and lizard-people {{in favor of the}} more recognizable Dark Elves and Nords.|$|E
5|$|Converts were {{provided}} with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets. The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a <b>pastiche</b> or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>pastiche</b> {{of science}} fiction used as a backdrop, Red Dwarf is {{primarily}} a character-driven comedy, with science fiction elements used as complementary plot devices. In the early episodes, a recurring source of comedy was the Odd Couple-style {{relationship between the two}} central characters of the show, who have an intense dislike for each other yet are trapped together deep in space. The main characters are Dave Lister, the last known human alive, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of Lister's dead bunkmate. The other regular characters are Cat, a lifeform which evolved from the descendants of Lister's pregnant pet cat Frankenstein; Holly, Red Dwarf's computer (Series I-V, briefly in the final episode of VII, VIII); Kryten, a service mechanoid (Series II-present); and Kristine Kochanski, an alternative-reality version of Lister's long-lost love (Series VII-VIII).|$|E
5|$|Queer as Folk 2 was {{broadcast}} in February 2000 and {{was driven by}} the plot element of Vince's half-sister's wedding. The specials place emphasis on Vince and Stuart's relationship, and ends with their departure for another gay scene in a <b>pastiche</b> of Grease, as Nathan took the role {{as the leader of}} the Manchester scene's next generation. On the heels of the special, Davies pitched the spin-off Misfits, a late-night soap opera set in a boarding house owned by Vince's mother, Hazel, and The Second Coming, a series that depicted the Second Coming of Christ in contemporary Manchester. Misfits was rejected in December 2000 and The Second Coming was initially approved by Channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel. Instead of contesting the cancellation of The Second Coming, he left Channel 4 and vowed to not work with them again.|$|E
5|$|A <b>pastiche</b> of {{following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E
25|$|Fredric Jameson {{suggests}} postmodern works abjure {{any claim}} to spontaneity and directness of expression, making use instead of <b>pastiche</b> and discontinuity. Against this definition, Art and Language's Charles Harrison and Paul Wood maintained <b>pastiche</b> and discontinuity are endemic to modernist art, and are deployed effectively by modern {{artists such as}} Manet and Picasso.|$|E
25|$|This {{novel was}} {{published}} after but takes place before Meyer's third Holmes <b>pastiche,</b> The West End Horror.|$|E
25|$|Psychoville, a 2009 BBC2 comedy series. Episode four of {{the series}} is a {{deliberate}} two-take <b>pastiche</b> of Rope.|$|E
25|$|The Electric Picture Palace cinema {{was opened}} in 2002, a <b>pastiche</b> of the {{original}} 1912 cinema that stood nearby in York Road.|$|E

25|$|Image Comics {{character}} Supreme, {{originally a}} violent, egotistical <b>pastiche</b> of Superman, later retooled by Alan Moore to more closely resemble Silver Age Superman.|$|E
25|$|Malibu Comics {{characters}} Prime (though {{more closely}} based on Captain Marvel) and Powerhouse, an unhinged <b>pastiche</b> of Superman {{with a similar}} origin story.|$|E

25|$|The Has-Beano – a <b>pastiche</b> of The Beano used to satirise The Spectator and Boris Johnson (who {{features}} {{as the lead}} character, Boris the Menace).|$|E
25|$|After Le Grand Macabre, Ligeti would {{abandon the}} use of <b>pastiche,</b> but would {{increasingly}} incorporate consonant harmonies (even major and minor triads) into his work, albeit not in a diatonic context.|$|E
25|$|The {{authors also}} wrote the 1996 <b>pastiche</b> {{compilation}} Farewell, My Dummy, which featured bridge novellas, each one parodies a different author in turn: Jeffrey Archer, Jane Austen, Raymond Chandler, Arthur Conan Doyle and Victor Mollo.|$|E
25|$|Tolkien's Red Book, <b>pastiche</b> of {{scholarship}} though it is, functions {{as such a}} medieval 'spurious source', but the 'authority' it imparts is by an appeal not to the tried-and-true but to the modern mystique of 'scholarly research'.|$|E
25|$|The {{photograph}} was subsequently re-created in 2009 by John and Yoko's son Sean Lennon, posing {{with his girlfriend}} Charlotte Kemp Muhl, with male/female roles reversed (Sean clothed, Kemp naked), and by Henry Bond and Sam Taylor-Wood in their YBA <b>pastiche</b> October 26, 1993.|$|E

25|$|The Ambassador (1984) starred Robert Mitchum. King Solomon's Mines (1985) was an Indian Jones-style <b>pastiche</b> shot in Zimbabwe with Richard Chamberlain and {{reasonably}} successful {{at the box}} office. After Murphy's Law (1986) with Bronson tried another Indiana Jones-type tale with Chuck Norris, Firewalker (1986).|$|E
