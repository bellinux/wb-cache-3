5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} three months in those with proximal DVT <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients {{should have at least}} three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of bleeding. In that case, three months is sufficient. Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate, and suggested {{for three months}} of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.|$|E
5|$|About 25 {{people were}} arrested {{in the first few}} days, {{including}} 196 workers; several hundred others were arrested in the following weeks. Stanisław Hejmowski, the lawyer who defended them, was later repressed for his statement that the government's actions had led to the death of innocent civilians. The government failed in its attempts to coerce the detainees into stating that they were <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> foreign (Western) secret services; nonetheless, this became the official line of the government for years to come.|$|E
5|$|Numerous smaller strikes {{occurred}} in the Congo later in the war, though not on the same scale as in 1941. In 1944 strikes broke out in Katanga and Kasaï, <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> the conscription of workers for the mines and deteriorating working conditions. In 1945, riots and strikes occurred among the black dockworkers in {{the port city of}} Matadi.|$|E

5|$|On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson {{walked into}} the National Gallery and {{attacked}} Velázquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1991, as the {{independence}} declaration moratorium expired, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia.

5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such as deep vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E

5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E

5|$|Roman troops, however, {{penetrated}} {{far into}} the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, {{there is a greater}} density of Roman marching camps in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe, as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area. The Antonine Wall was occupied again for a brief period after 197. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, claiming to be <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> the belligerence of the Maeatae, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy. Severus invaded Caledonia with an army perhaps over 40,000 strong.|$|E
5|$|Two {{thirds of}} people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} have experienced an infection {{before the onset of}} the condition. Most commonly these are episodes of gastroenteritis or a respiratory tract infection. In many cases, the exact nature of the infection can be confirmed. Approximately 30% of cases are <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> Campylobacter jejuni bacteria, which cause diarrhea. A further 10% are attributable to cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5). Despite this, only very few people with Campylobacter or CMV infections develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (0.25–0.65 per 1000 and 0.6–2.2 per 1000 episodes, respectively). The strain of Campylobacter involved may determine the risk of GBS; different forms of the bacteria have different lipopolysaccharides on their surface, and some may induce illness (see below) while others will not.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Uprising, the Prussians rose {{a number}} of times against the Knights, but these uprisings were much smaller in scale and posed no real danger to the Teutonic Knights, who could {{concentrate}} on further conquests. The number of uprisings is variously considered to be two or three.. They were suppressed within a year or two and showed exhaustion and division of the Prussian tribes. The third uprising in 1276 was <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians, who successfully raided Teutonic lands. The next year he, with help from the Lithuanians, led 4,000 men into the Culmerland (Chełmno Land). The uprising failed to spread after Theodoric, vogt of Sambia, convinced the Sambians not to join the insurrection; Natangians and Warmians had also accepted baptism and promised their loyalty to the Knights. The Pogesanians alone continued the fight and were crushed. Survivors with their Bartian chief escaped to Hrodna in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania where they joined some of the Bartians, Skalvians, and all of the Nadruvians, who fled there after the Great Uprising.|$|E

5|$|Although the Byzantine–Bulgarian {{conflict}} {{that began in}} 913 was <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> the Byzantines, it was the Bulgarian monarch Simeon I (r. 893–927) who was seeking pretext to wage war and fulfil his ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself and to assume the throne of Constantinople. Unable to confront the Bulgarians, the Byzantines reluctantly recognized Simeon I as Emperor of Bulgaria (in Bulgarian, Tsar) as early as July 913 but the decision was revoked after a palace coup in Constantinople in 914. Three years later, in 917, the main Byzantine forces were routed in the Battle of Achelous and the Bulgarians took the military initiative. In the four year that followed they launched a number of successful campaigns, reaching the walls of Constantinople and the Isthmus of Corinth.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} {{among the}} Christians of Neapolis decreased, {{tensions between the}} Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became {{the site of a}} deadly encounter between the two groups, <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in one of}} Eorzea's {{three main}} states, the player {{character}} awakes to the Echo, a power granting them {{the ability to see}} the past. The Adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within the nations <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> the Garlean pretense, led by the Garlean Legatus Gaius Van Baelsar, and the Beastmen's attempts to summon their Primals and their consequent hoarding of crystal supplies. Eventually, a greater threat is {{brought to the attention of}} the nations by the Sharlayan scholar Louisoix Leveilleur: another Garlean Legatus named Nael Van Darnus is using arcane magic and technology to summon Dalamud, the planet's second moon, down on Eorzea to purge the Beastmen and Primals. With the aid of Garlean defector Cid nan Garlond, the Adventurers discover that Nael has set up a beacon for summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of Castrum Novum. While each nation makes individual attempts to storm the fortress, they are repelled. Faced with this, their leaders form a pact and unite the nations under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance.|$|E

5|$|However, Russell also {{received}} negative attention. Constantly <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter {{told him to}} take matters into his own hands, so after the next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls. With his teammates, Russell had a cordial relationship, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year: many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell also had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved. On the other hand, despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred of women {{on the part of}} the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most of his}} noble relatives, John {{opposed the}} tyrannical regime of Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1182–85), and {{had been forced to}} sign written pledge of loyalty to the emperor. Nevertheless, on 11 September 1185, when his nephew Isaac Angelos killed Andronikos I's chief henchman, Stephen Hagiochristophorites, and sought {{sanctuary}} in the Hagia Sophia cathedral, John and his eldest son Isaac rushed to his side, fearing the Emperor's retribution. By the next day, a popular uprising <b>provoked</b> <b>by</b> Isaac Angelos' act of defiance had brought down the regime of Andronikos I, but Isaac Angelos hesitated to be crowned emperor. According to Niketas Choniates and Theodore Skoutariotes, John then bared his own head and offered his own bald head to be crowned, but the assembled people violently opposed this, refusing to be ruled by a man so old after the equally elderly Andronikos I, and Isaac Angelos was crowned.|$|E
