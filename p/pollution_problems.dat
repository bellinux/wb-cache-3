5|$|During {{the early}} 1900s and 1910s, St. Louis began a {{building}} program that created parks and playgrounds in several deteriorating residential neighborhoods. Parks Commissioner (and former professional tennis player) Dwight F. Davis continued {{the development of}} recreational facilities during the early 1910s by expanding tennis facilities and building a public 18-hole golf course in northwest Forest Park. The St. Louis Zoo was constructed in Forest Park in the early 1910s {{under the leadership of}} Mayor Henry Kiel. Since the 1890s, St. Louis had attempted to control its air <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> with little success, but damage to buildings and flora made the issue more visible during the 1920s. Problems came to a head with the 1939 St. Louis smog, which blackened the sky and lasted for three weeks. A ban on burning low-quality coal solved the problem in December 1939, and the addition of natural gas for heating assisted homeowners in making the transition to cleaner fuels by the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, France can obtain significant emission benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants; California, where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial emission benefits. The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural gas plants dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, emission benefits in Germany, China, India, and the central regions of the United States are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from coal. However these countries and regions might still obtain some air quality benefits by reducing local air pollution in urban areas. Cities with chronic air <b>pollution</b> <b>problems,</b> such as Los Angeles, México City, Santiago, Chile, São Paulo, Beijing, Bangkok and Kathmandu may also gain local clean air benefits by shifting the harmful emission to electric generation plants located outside the cities. Nevertheless, {{the location of the}} plants is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global.|$|E
25|$|Air <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> {{were also}} {{addressed}} in the refurbishment program. When the buses were first acquired, {{none of them had}} catalytic converters installed. Now, they have been installed, reducing emission of polluting exhaust gases and particulates by 50%.|$|E

25|$|North Korean beers {{have low}} hop content due to taste preferences. North Korean breweries have an {{abundance}} of fresh water. Due to the underdevelopment of North Korea's industries, there are no <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> with the water. Other ingredients are imported.|$|E
25|$|Logan International Airport {{offers a}} 30-minute cell phone waiting lot {{area at the}} {{intersection}} of Hotel Drive and Service Road, which is complimentary and five minutes from all terminals by car. This convenience service exists to reduce congestion and <b>pollution</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E
25|$|POTWs with {{combined}} sewers {{are required to}} comply with the national Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy, published by EPA in 1994. The policy requires municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate overflow-related <b>pollution</b> <b>problems.</b> About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40 million people.|$|E

25|$|The autocratic {{government}} that ruled Mexico City since the Revolution was tolerated, {{mostly because of}} the continued economic expansion since World War II. This was the case even though this government could not handle the population and <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> adequately. Nevertheless, discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the massacre of {{an unknown number of}} protesting students in Tlatelolco.|$|E
25|$|Indoor air {{pollution}} and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report. According to the 2014 World Health Organization report, {{air pollution}} in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide, an estimate roughly echoed by one from the International Energy Agency.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, both Blumenthal and Governor John G. Rowland {{petition}}ed the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to address interstate air <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> created from Midwest and southeastern sources. The petition was filed {{in accordance with}} Section126 of the Clean Air Act, which allows a United States state to request pollution reductions from out-of-state sources that contribute significantly to its air quality problems.|$|E

25|$|Industry also causes <b>pollution</b> <b>problems.</b> A major {{offender}} is {{the production}} of nonferrous metals. One of Tajikistan's leading industrial sites, the aluminum plant at Tursunzoda (formerly known as Regar), west of Dushanbe near the border with Uzbekistan, generates large amounts of toxic waste gases that have been blamed for {{a sharp increase in}} the number of birth defects among people who live within range of its emissions.|$|E
25|$|The oxides of {{nitrogen}} are a natural product of the burning of gas in air and are produced in large quantities by gas-fired furnaces. Some factories in cities with particular air <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> will mitigate this by using liquid oxygen, however the logic of this given the cost in carbon of (1) not using regenerators and (2) having to liquefy and transport oxygen is highly questionable.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater {{pollution}} is a worldwide issue. A {{study of the}} groundwater quality of the principal aquifers of the United States conducted between 1991 and 2004, showed that 23% of domestic wells had contaminants at levels greater than human-health benchmarks. Another study suggested that the major groundwater <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> in Africa, considering the order of importance are: (1) nitrate pollution, (2) pathogenic agents, (3) organic pollution, (4) salinization, and (5) acid mine drainage.|$|E

50|$|Under Chen Liangyu's {{leadership}} {{pollution in}} the Suzhou River, which had long plagued Shanghai, came under management. The Suzhou River water <b>pollution</b> <b>problem</b> was greatly reduced. Additionally the landscape around the Suzhou River underwent massive changes.|$|R
25|$|The {{city also}} has the third-highest {{concentration}} of airborne particulate matter among large European cities, {{both in terms of}} average annual level and days of exceeding the European Union PM10 limit of 50 micrograms per cubic meter, according to a 2007 study supported by several environmental groups. Due to its lingering air <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> and associated health problems, in 2007, and for a trial period, the city banned 170,000 older cars and motorcycles that do not pass strict environmental emission standards.|$|E
25|$|Athens {{is built}} around a number of hills. Lycabettus {{is one of the}} tallest hills of the city proper and {{provides}} a view of the entire Attica Basin. The geomorphology of Athens is deemed {{to be one of the}} most complex in the world because its mountains cause a temperature inversion phenomenon which, along with the Greek Government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> the city has faced. This issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and Mexico City also suffer from similar geomorphology inversion problems.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic is {{comparatively}} clean, {{although there}} are certain ecologically difficult localized <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> that present {{a serious threat to}} people's health living around these pollution sources. Due to the prevailing worldwide sea and air currents, the Arctic area is the fallout region for long-range transport pollutants, and in some places the concentrations exceed the levels of densely populated urban areas. An example of this is the phenomenon of Arctic haze, which is commonly blamed on long-range pollutants. Another example is with the bioaccumulation of PCB's (polychlorinated biphenyls) in Arctic wildlife and people.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pollution</b> <b>problems</b> in {{the borough}} {{stem from the}} {{urbanization}} of the area. Traffic congestion {{is a serious problem}} and parking space is severely lacking. Much of the pollution in the borough comes from fixed sources along Avenida Tláhuac. Canal and lake waters have moderate problems with pollution in the way of garbage and the infestation of non-native water lily plants. The borough generates 356 tons of trash per day, 3.12% of what is produced in the Federal District. There are thirty areas where there is illegal house building, mostly near the Sierra de Santa Catarina and around San Juan Ixtayopan and La Conchita.|$|E
25|$|While still {{considered}} one of the most polluted places on the planet, the valley's air <b>pollution</b> <b>problems</b> are not as bad as they were several decades ago. One major problem that was brought under control was the lead contamination in the air with the introduction of unleaded gasoline. Two other contaminants that have been brought under control are carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The contamination problems that remain are primarily with ozone and fine particles (soot) (between 2.5micrometers and 10micrometers). Thirty to fifty percent of the time, Mexico City's levels of fine particles of ten micrometers, the most dangerous, exceed levels recommended by the World Health Organization.|$|E
25|$|The {{canyon and}} {{national}} park {{is the second}} most important tourist site in Chiapas, drawing mostly Mexican visitors who see the canyon from boats which embark on the river from Chiapa de Corzo. The park borders Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the state’s largest city, which has caused problems with human encroachment and settlement on park land. More importantly, the urban areas and logging industries upstream from the canyon have caused serious <b>pollution</b> <b>problems,</b> with up to 5000 tons of solid waste extracted from the Grijalva River each year. This waste tends to build up in the canyon because of its narrowness, the convergence of water flows and the presence of the Chicoasén Dam.|$|E
