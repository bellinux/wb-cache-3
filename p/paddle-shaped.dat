5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, <b>paddle-shaped</b> rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the snake}} is subcylindrical, and is taller than it is wide. It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The tail of the snake is <b>paddle-shaped</b> and adapted to swimming.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is {{a species of}} longtailed carpet shark, family Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, tropical waters off Australia and New Guinea (and possibly elsewhere). The common name of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each pectoral fin, which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1m (3.3ft) long, the {{epaulette shark}} has a slender body with a short head and broad, <b>paddle-shaped</b> paired fins. The caudal peduncle (to which the tail fin is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are light brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.|$|E
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its <b>paddle-shaped</b> pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
25|$|Like the capybara, {{the beaver}} is semiaquatic. The beaver has many traits suited to this lifestyle. It has a large, flat, <b>paddle-shaped</b> tail and large, webbed hind feet. The unwebbed front paws are smaller, with claws. The eyes {{are covered by}} a nictitating {{membrane}} which allows the beaver to see under water. The nostrils and ears are sealed while submerged. A thick layer of fat under its skin insulates the beaver from its coldwater environment.|$|E
25|$|Totem poles can {{symbolize the}} {{characters}} and events in mythology, or convey the experiences of recent ancestors and living people. Some of these characters may appear as stylistic representations of objects in nature, while others are more realistically carved. Pole carvings may include animals, fish, plants, insects, and humans, or they may represent supernatural beings such as the Thunderbird. Some symbolize beings that can transform themselves into another form, appearing as combinations of animals or part-animal/part-human forms. Consistent use of a specific character over time, with some slight variations in carving style, helped develop similarities among these shared symbols that allowed people to recognize one from another. For example, the raven is symbolized by a long, straight beak, while the eagle's beak is curved, and a beaver is depicted with two large front teeth, {{a piece of wood}} held in his front paws, and a <b>paddle-shaped</b> tail.|$|E
500|$|Neural spines {{from the}} [...] dorsal {{vertebra}} to the foremost tail vertebrae also were strongly elongated, but different in structure, forming a single row of <b>paddle-shaped</b> projections. According to Bailey, these projections resembled those of modern humped ungulates {{such as the}} bison, indicating {{the presence of a}} fleshy hump above the hips. Bailey suggested similar humps for other dinosaurs with strongly elongated neural spines, such as Spinosaurus and Ouranosaurus.|$|E
500|$|Cetaceans are {{characterized}} by a [...] body, <b>paddle-shaped</b> front limbs and vestigial hind limbs. Their tails have been flattened into flukes to aid propulsion. They have lungs, and must surface regularly to breathe air through blowholes (modified nostrils) situated {{on the top of}} the cranium. The cetaceans are included in the order Cetartiodactyla with the Artiodactyla (the even-toed ungulates). Previously, they were placed within their own order, Cetacea, now an infraorder. They are divided into two subgroups, the Odontoceti (the toothed whales, including dolphins and porpoises) and the Mysticeti (the baleen whales), formerly suborders but now considered parvorders or unranked taxa. There are 89 living species of cetaceans (including the functionally extinct Chinese river dolphin). [...] In addition, numerous species of extinct cetaceans have been documented, but they are not listed here. This list contains only the known, extant cetacean species including several recently defined species.|$|E
500|$|The most {{striking}} {{features of the}} skeleton were the extremely tall, upwardly projecting neural spines on the neck and anterior dorsal vertebrae. The neural spines were bifurcated along their entire length, forming a double row. They were circular in cross section and tapered towards their tips. The tallest spines could {{be found on the}} middle part of the neck, where they reached [...] on the 8th cervical. On the neck, they were bowed backwards, projecting above the adjacent vertebra. The last two dorsal vertebrae, the hip and foremost tail, also had elongated spines; these were not bifurcated but flared into a <b>paddle-shaped</b> upper end. The pelvic region was relatively wide, judging from the long, laterally projecting transverse processes of the sacral vertebrae. The forelimbs were somewhat shorter than the hindlimbs, as in related sauropods. Most of the hand and foot bones were not preserved, but Amargasaurus probably possessed five digits each as in all sauropods.|$|E
500|$|The tail fluke of a dugong is notched {{and similar}} to those of dolphins, whereas the tail fluke of {{manatees}} is <b>paddle-shaped.</b> The fluke is raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward, or twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing. Unlike manatees, the dugong lacks nails on its flippers, which are only 15% of a dugong's body length. Manatees generally glide at speeds of , but can reach speeds of [...] in short bursts. The body is [...] to prevent drag in the water. Like cetaceans, the hind limbs are internal and vestigial. The snout is angled downwards to aid in bottom-feeding. Sirenians typically make two to three minute dives, but manatees can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes while resting and dugongs up to six minutes. They may stand on their tail to hold their head above water.|$|E
500|$|The American {{paddlefish}} (Polyodon spathula) is {{a species}} of basal ray-finned fish closely related to sturgeons in the order Acipenseriformes. Fossil records of paddlefish date back over 300million years, nearly 50million years before dinosaurs first appeared. [...] American paddlefish are smooth-skinned freshwater fish commonly called paddlefish, but are {{also referred to as}} Mississippi paddlefish, spoon-billed cats, or spoonbills. [...] They are one of only two extant species in the paddlefish family, Polyodontidae. The other is the critically endangered Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius) endemic to the Yangtze River basin in China. [...] American paddlefish are often referred to as primitive fish, or relict species because they retain some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors, including a skeleton that is almost entirely cartilaginous, a <b>paddle-shaped</b> rostrum (snout) that extends nearly one-third their body length, and a heterocercal tail or caudal fin, much like that of sharks. American paddlefish are a highly derived fish because they have evolved with adaptations such as filter feeding. [...] Their rostrum and cranium are covered {{with tens of thousands of}} sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton, which is their primary food source.|$|E
2500|$|Living in a {{terrestrial}} environment, woodlice breathe through trachea-like lungs {{in their}} <b>paddle-shaped</b> hind legs (pleopods), called pleopodal lungs. Woodlice need moisture because they rapidly lose water by excretion and through their cuticle, {{and so are}} usually found in damp, dark places, such as under rocks and logs, although one species, Hemilepistus reaumuri, inhabits [...] "the driest habitat conquered by any species of crustacean". They are usually nocturnal and are detritivores, feeding mostly on dead plant matter.|$|E
2500|$|The daggernose shark (Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus) is {{a little-known}} species of requiem shark, {{in the family}} Carcharhinidae, and the only extant member of its genus. It inhabits shallow {{tropical}} waters off northeastern South America, from Trinidad to northern Brazil, favoring muddy habitats such as mangroves, estuaries, and river mouths, though it is intolerant of fresh water. A relatively small shark typically reaching [...] in length, the daggernose shark is unmistakable for its elongated, flattened, and pointed snout, tiny eyes, and large <b>paddle-shaped</b> pectoral fins.|$|E
2500|$|It is very {{important}} that wila is properly cleaned. [...] It should first be picked through by hand to remove twigs, dirt, other lichens, sap, and other contaminants. [...] Then it is usually soaked several hours to overnight in water, often in running water. [...] It is sometimes worked with hands, or pounded with a <b>paddle-shaped</b> tool while being soaked. [...] This process of cleaning the wila is called kálka in the Secwepemc language, and likely helps to remove the toxin vulpinic acid, which is slightly water-soluble.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} northern Aché ritual was the club-fight. These events were organized by [...] "big men" [...] and took place once {{every year or}} two. Several bands would converge on a single camping area. Those who invited the others would prepare a cleared area in which to do ritual combat. Men prepared long hardwood clubs with sharpened edges (<b>paddle-shaped),</b> and decorated themselves with charcoal (mixed with honey and saliva) and vulture down. Although club fights consisted of hosting and invited teams of men, after the fighting began all men were free to choose opponents from either group. Men faced off and took turns swinging at each other's heads. Some men were hit directly {{on the top of}} the head and sustained fractured skulls, that later healed, but with tell-tale signs of combat. Other men dodged the clubs, but might be hit on the arms or shoulders. [...] Some men died in almost every large clubfighting event. Sometimes clubfighting would also emerge spontaneously within a small residential band, when one man was caught having sexual relations with another man's wife. These types of duels were never lethal. In all clubfights, some bystanders (including women) would rush in and try to hamper or disarm men who were in combat with their father, sons or brothers.|$|E
2500|$|Manatees have {{a mass of}} , {{and mean}} length of , with maxima of [...] and [...] seen (the females tend to be larger and heavier). When born, baby {{manatees}} have an average mass of [...] They have a large, flexible, prehensile upper lip. They use the lip to gather food and eat, as well as using it for social interactions and communications. Manatees have shorter snouts than their fellow sirenians, the dugongs. Their small, widely spaced eyes have eyelids that close in a circular manner. The adults have no incisor or canine teeth, just a set of cheek teeth, which are not clearly differentiated into molars and premolars. [...] These teeth are repeatedly replaced throughout life, with new teeth growing at the rear as older teeth fall out from farther forward in the mouth. [...] This process is known as polyphyodonty and amongst the other mammals, only occurs in the kangaroo and elephant. At any given time, a manatee typically has {{no more than six}} teeth in each jaw of its mouth. Its tail is <b>paddle-shaped,</b> and is the clearest visible difference between manatees and dugongs; a dugong tail is fluked, similar in shape to a that of a whale. [...] Females have two teats, one under each flipper, a characteristic that was used to make early links between the manatee and elephants.|$|E
60|$|Section 2. Comparing {{the general}} build, of a dog-fish {{with that of}} a rabbit, we notice the absence of a {{distinct}} neck, and the general conical form; the presence of a large tail, as considerable, at first, in diameter as the hind portion of the body, and of the first importance in progression, in which function the four <b>paddle-shaped</b> limbs, the lateral fins, simply co-operate with the median fin along the back for the purpose of steering; and, {{as a consequence of the}} size of the tail, we note also the ventral position of the apertures of the body. The anus, and urinary and genital ducts unite in one common chamber, the cloaca. Behind the head, and in front of the fore fin (pectoral fin), are five gill slits (g.s.) leading from the pharynx to the exterior. Just behind the eye is a smaller and more dorsal opening of the same kind, the spiracle (sp.). On the under side of the head, in front of the mouth, is the nasal aperture (olf.), the opening of the nasal sac, which, unlike the corresponding organ of the air-frequenting vertebrata, has no internal narial opening. There is, however, a groove running from olf. to the corner of the mouth, and this, closing, in the vertebrate types that live in air and are exposed to incessant evaporation of their lubricating secretions, constitutes the primitive nasal passage. The limbs are undifferentiated into upper, lower, and digital portions, and are simply jointed, flattened expansions.|$|E
