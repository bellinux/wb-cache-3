5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can {{decompress}} using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E

5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes {{the danger of the}} streets and puts it in a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into the danger of the streets.|$|E
5|$|Marvel One-Shots are {{a series}} of direct-to-video short films {{produced}} by Marvel Studios, set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), released from 2011 to 2014. They are included as special features in the MCU films' Blu-ray and digital distribution releases, but are not included in the DVD releases. Each of the films, which range from 4 to 15 minutes, are designed to be a self-contained story that <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. Two of the shorts have been the inspiration for television series set in the MCU.|$|E
5|$|Stable is {{the current}} release and targets stable and well-tested {{software}} needs.

It is updated only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated. This branch has an optional backports service that <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> recent versions of some software. Stables CDs and DVDs {{can be found in the}} Debian website.|$|E

5|$|Two of {{the largest}} public radio networks, Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and Public Radio International (PRI), are based in the state. MPR has the largest {{audience}} of any regional public radio network in the nation, broadcasting on 37 radio stations. PRI weekly <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> than 400 hours of programming to almost 800 affiliates. The state's oldest radio station, KUOM-AM, was launched in 1922 and is among the 10-oldest radio stations in the United States. The University of Minnesota-owned station {{is still on the}} air, and since 1993 broadcasts a college rock format.|$|E
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E

5|$|DST has mixed {{effects on}} health. In {{societies}} with fixed work schedules it <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; {{whether this is}} beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions. DST shifts are associated with higher rates of ischemic stroke {{in the first two}} days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 is a sunlike {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Cygnus that has a mass of 0.95 (± 0.1) Msun and a radius of 1.1 (± 0.1) Rsun. In other words, Kepler-11 is approximately 5% less massive and 10% wider than the Sun. The star's metallicity is 0 (± 0.1), meaning {{that the level of}} iron (and, presumably, other elements) in the star is almost {{the same as that of}} the Sun. Metallicity plays an important role in planetary systems, and stars with higher metallicity are more likely to have planets detected around them. This may be because the higher metallicity <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> material with which to quickly build planets into gas giants or because the higher metallicity increases planet migration towards the host star, making the planet easier to detect. The star has five other known planets in orbit: Kepler-11c, Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, Kepler-11f, and Kepler-11g. The first five planets in the system are all able to fit within the orbit of planet Mercury, while Kepler-11g orbits further out.|$|E
5|$|Located {{directly}} {{south of}} the main campus is Central Florida Research Park, which is the seventh largest research park {{in the nation and}} the largest in Florida, housing over 116 corporations. The park <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> than 10,000 jobs to over 500 students and thousands of alumni. Main Campus is one of the safest branches nationally in comparison of all branches in the US. The percent of crimes in Main Campus decreased from 0.12% (in 2010) to 0.07% (in 2014) crimes per year. The most often crimes detected on Main Campus were burglary, motor vehicle theft, and aggravated assault.|$|E

5|$|The East Riding is characterised {{by a high}} {{employment}} rate and a relatively low unemployment level. The overall un{{employment rate}} is 4.3%, which is 1.2 percentage points lower than the national average. However, there are unemployment hotspots in Bridlington, Goole and Withernsea. Unemployment levels tend to fluctuate {{over the course of}} the year with lower levels during the summer months due to increased employment in the tourism and food production sectors. A major year-round employer in the East Riding is the Defence School of Transport at RAF Leconfield, which trains 14,000 personnel from the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines each year and <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> than 1,000 civilian jobs.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{for this}} period in Kentish history include the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in 731 by Bede, a Northumbrian monk. Bede was {{interested}} primarily in England's Christianization. Since Æthelberht {{was the first}} Anglo-Saxon king to convert to Christianity, Bede <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> substantial information about him than about any earlier king. One of Bede's correspondents was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine's) in Canterbury. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals assembled c. 890 {{in the kingdom of}} Wessex, mentions several events in Kent during Æthelberht's reign. Further mention of events in Kent occurs in the late sixth century history of the Franks by Gregory of Tours. This is the earliest surviving source to mention any Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Some of Pope Gregory the Great's letters concern the mission of St. Augustine to Kent in 597; these letters also mention the state of Kent and its relationships with neighbours. Other sources include regnal lists of the kings of Kent and early charters (land grants by kings to their followers or to the church). Although no originals survive from Æthelberht's reign, later copies exist. A law code from Æthelberht's reign also survives.|$|E
