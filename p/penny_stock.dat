40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{determinants}} of expected returns on the listed <b>penny</b> <b>stocks</b> from two perspectives. Traditionally financial economics literature {{has been devoted to}} study the macro and micro determinants of expected returns on stocks (Subrahmanyam, 2010). Very few research has been carried out on <b>penny</b> <b>stocks</b> (Liu, Rhee, & Zhang, 2011; Nofsinger & Verma, 2014). Our study is an effort to contribute more empirical evidence on <b>penny</b> <b>stocks</b> in the emerging market context. We see the return dynamics of <b>penny</b> <b>stocks</b> from corporate governance perspective. Issues such as shareholding patters are considered to be of much significance when it comes to understand the price movements. Using cross-sectional data on 167 <b>penny</b> <b>stocks</b> listed in the National Stock Exchange of India, we show that (i) Returns of portfolio of lower market-cap <b>penny</b> <b>stocks</b> are significantly different(higher) than that of higher market-cap <b>penny</b> <b>stocks.</b> (ii) Returns of portfolio lower P/E stocks are significantly different (higher) than that of higher P/E stocks. Similarly, returns of portfolio of lower P/B stocks are significantly different (higher) than that of higher P/B stocks, and returns of portfolio of lower priced <b>penny</b> <b>stocks</b> are significantly different(higher) than that of higher priced <b>penny</b> <b>stocks.</b> (iii) Trading volume differences due to alphabetism are insignificant. (iv) Differences in returns of portfolios based on beta and shareholding patterns are insignificant. Comment: 20 pages, 2 figures, 4 table...|$|R

25|$|Income Tax Authorities in India in 2006 {{unearthed}} the 1.6million dollar <b>penny</b> <b>stock</b> scam in Bangalore. The scam is {{the fallout}} of nationwide income tax raids {{on the premises}} of businessmen in April 2006, suspecting large scale money laundering and tax evasion through ramping up shares of small firms. Around 25 premises were raided in Mumbai and 10 in Bangalore. After the raids, the Additional Commissioner set up a team and investigated this scam. They pursued the investigations and issued orders on December 31, 2008 that {{are said to have}} national ramifications. The team found that the traders had ramped up penny stocks to launder money an organised crime and a serious economic offence that has misused provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India and Registrar of Co-operatives. This route is chosen to use capital gains tax and legalise the unaccounted money. On April 28, the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Ministry of Finance billed the case as the best investigation and assessment order of the year.

2500|$|One {{method of}} {{regulating}} and restricting pump-and-dump manipulators is {{to target the}} category of stocks most often associated with this scheme. To that end, penny stocks have {{been the target of}} heightened enforcement efforts. In the United States, regulators have defined a <b>penny</b> <b>stock</b> as a security that must meet a number of specific standards. The criteria include price, market capitalization, and minimum shareholder equity. Securities traded on a national stock exchange, regardless of price, are exempt from regulatory designation as a <b>penny</b> <b>stock,</b> since it is thought that exchange-traded securities are less vulnerable to manipulation. Therefore, CitiGroup (NYSE:C) and other NYSE listed securities which traded below $1.00 during the market downturn of 2008–2009, while properly regarded as [...] "low priced" [...] securities, were not technically [...] "penny stocks". Although <b>penny</b> <b>stock</b> trading in the United States is now primarily controlled through rules and regulations enforced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the genesis of this control is found in State securities law. The State of Georgia was the first state to codify a comprehensive <b>penny</b> <b>stock</b> securities law. Secretary of State Max Cleland, whose office enforced State securities laws was a principal proponent of the legislation. Representative Chesley V. Morton, the only stockbroker in the Georgia General Assembly at the time, was principal sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives. Georgia's <b>penny</b> <b>stock</b> law was subsequently challenged in court. However, the law was eventually upheld in U.S. District Court, and the statute became the template for laws enacted in other states.

2500|$|The {{expanding}} {{use of the}} Internet {{and personal}} communication devices has made <b>penny</b> <b>stock</b> scams easier to perpetrate. Though not a scam per se, one notable example is rapper 50 Cent's use of Twitter to cause {{the price of a}} <b>penny</b> <b>stock</b> (HNHI) to increase dramatically. 50 Cent had previously bought 30million shares of the company, and as a result made $8.7million in profit. Another example of an activity that skirts the borderline between legitimate promotion and hype is the case of LEXG. Described (but perhaps overstated) as [...] "the biggest stock promotion of all time", Lithium Exploration Group's market capitalization soared to over $350million, after an extensive direct mail campaign. The promotion drew upon the legitimate growth in production and use of lithium, while touting Lithium Exploration Groups position within that sector. According to the company's December 31, 2010 form 10-Q (filed within months of the direct mail promotion), LEXG was a lithium company without assets. Its revenues and assets at that time were zero. Subsequently, the company did acquire lithium production/exploration properties, and addressed concerns raised in the press.|$|E
2500|$|Many penny stocks, {{particularly}} those that sell for fractions of a cent, are thinly traded. They can become the target of stock promoters and manipulators. These manipulators first purchase large quantities of stock, then artificially inflate the share price through false and misleading positive statements. This {{is referred to as}} a pump and dump scheme. The pump and dump is a form of microcap stock fraud. In more sophisticated versions of the fraud, individuals or organizations buy millions of shares, then use newsletter websites, chat rooms, stock message boards, press releases, or e-mail blasts to drive up interest in the stock. Very often, the perpetrator will claim to have [...] "inside" [...] information about impending news to persuade the unwitting investor to quickly buy the shares. When buying pressure pushes the share price up, the rise in price entices more people to believe the hype and to buy shares as well. Eventually the manipulators doing the [...] "pumping" [...] end up [...] "dumping" [...] when they sell their holdings. The expanding use of the Internet and personal communication devices has made <b>penny</b> <b>stock</b> scams easier to perpetrate.
