2500|$|The yellow shovelnose stingaree has an oval {{pectoral}} fin disc slightly wider than long, with the anterior margins weakly convex and converging at an obtuse angle on a fairly elongated, fleshy snout. The {{tip of the}} snout does not <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the disc. The eyes are medium-sized, well-spaced, and slightly elevated. The spiracles behind the eyes are comma-shaped, with the [...] "tail" [...] curving beneath {{to the level of the}} mid-eye; the posterior margins of the spiracles are angular. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a prominent lobe. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin that overhangs the small mouth. The lower jaw conceals the upper jaw and bears a prominent, corrugated patch of papillae (nipple-like structures). The small teeth have oval to diamond-shaped bases and are arranged in a quincunx pattern; the crowns range from pointed near the middle of the jaws to blunt at the sides. There are 1920 upper and 2223 lower tooth rows. The floor of the mouth bears eight or more papillae. The five pairs of gill slits are S-shaped.|$|E
50|$|Tailpipes: Tailpipes are {{not allowed}} to <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the car's body however tailpipes that are built {{into the side of the}} vehicle are allowed.|$|E
5000|$|Other: Pencil {{lead and}} other {{graphite}} foreign bodies, once {{lodged in the}} cutaneous layer of the skin can cause permanent pigment tattooing if not removed immediately. Metallic bodies range from BB pellets to grenade shrapnel. Smaller objects can be removed without much difficulty if {{the depth of the}} wound remains superficial, but if the wound does not <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the subcutaneous layers of the skin, and remains inert, the object can actually remain in place. In larger objects, fragments that remain superficial in one’s body may be removed without much trouble, but if wounds <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the subcutaneous layers of the skin and even into the muscular area or near vital organs, such objects must be left alone until immediate medical attention is sought.|$|E

50|$|In visual {{appearance}} the Class 10E can {{be distinguished}} from the later model Class 10E2 by the roof ends and the sills. The Class 10E has riffled roof ends {{and parts of the}} sill <b>protrude</b> slightly <b>past</b> the bottom edge of the body sides. The Class 10E2 has smooth unriffled roof ends and no part of the sill <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> the bottom edge of the body sides.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the bulb}} <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> {{the leading edge}} of the keel, it is called a [...] "T-bulb". It offers better {{performance}} (like required for racing), but is prone to hook into flotsam (like kelp or discarded fishing nets).|$|R
50|$|Flowers {{have five}} sepals, five petals fused into a narrow, funnel-shaped, corolla tube. Its five stamens {{alternate}} with the lobes of the corolla. Flowers {{occur in a}} cluster {{at the end of}} the stems. The outside of the corolla is pale pink to tan, and the inside is pink to bright red, with stamens of unequal length that barely <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the corolla.|$|E
5000|$|Vortex generators, tiny {{strips of}} metal or plastic placed {{on top of}} the wing near the leading edge that <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the {{boundary}} layer into the free stream. As the name implies, they energize the boundary layer by mixing free stream airflow with boundary layer flow thereby creating vortices, this increases the momentum in the boundary layer. By increasing the momentum of the boundary layer, airflow separation and the resulting stall may be delayed.|$|E
50|$|A gun mantlet is an {{armour plate}} or shield {{attached}} to an armoured fighting vehicle's gun, protecting the opening {{through which the}} weapon's barrel projects from the hull or turret armour and, in many cases, ensuring the vulnerable warhead of a loaded shell does not <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the vehicle's armour. On many tanks during World War II, the gun mantlet covered both the main gun and any coaxial armament, and had the thickest armour on the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Since {{only a short}} {{portion of}} the reed <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> the pirouette, the player has only limited contact with the reed, and {{therefore}} limited control of dynamics. The shawm’s conical bore and flaring bell, combined with the style of playing dictated {{by the use of}} a pirouette, gives the instrument a piercing, trumpet-like sound, well-suited for out-of-doors performance.|$|R
2500|$|P. orchidioides {{was first}} {{described}} by French-Swiss botanist Alphonse Louis Pierre Pyramus de Candolle in 1844 based on collections by G. Andrieux (130). [...] De Candolle, in subdividing the genus Pinguicula, included the {{species in the}} newly created section Orcheosanthus along with other species with purple, deeply bilabiate corollas with 5 sub-equal lobes, a short floral tube, and a large spur not <b>protruding</b> <b>past</b> this tube.|$|R
5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{is made up}} almost {{completely}} by the nasal bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid. In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape in cross section. The crest <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> {{the edge of the}} skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen it. At the end of the crest is a swelling of the nasal, which is often termed differently.|$|R
5000|$|Proper fitting {{ammunition}} can be reloaded from [...]32-20 Winchester brass {{by using}} the Lee Nagant die set. This allows the reloaders to work up a load that fits their needs and is specific for the Nagant. While this eliminates the bulged/split/stuck cases experienced when using [...]32 S&W and [...]32 H&R, the gas seal that made the Nagant famous will still not fully function, due to the [...]32-20 not being long enough to <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the cylinder like the original Nagant ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|Note that {{cartridges}} {{loaded with}} wadcutter target bullets and cartridges for the 7.62×38mmR Nagant M1895 revolver can {{be mistaken for}} blanks because the bullet does not <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> {{the mouth of the}} cartridge casing. Shotshell cartridges known as [...] "snake shot" [...] or [...] "rat-shot" [...] used in rifles or handguns for pest control often have the shot charge sealed with cardboard or plastic wads or the ends may be crimped or folded {{in a manner similar to}} that of blank cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]32-20 {{has been}} used to create usable {{ammunition}} for the Nagant M1895. This is accomplished by removing [...]01" [...] from the rim thickness and sizing the case in a specific reloading die (Lee Nagant 3 die set). the ammunition produced is functional and easy to reload; however, [...]32-20 brass does not provide a gas seal as it is not long enough to <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the Nagant cylinder. It {{can also be used to}} create 8mm French Ordnance ammunition for use in the Modèle 1892 revolver.|$|E
50|$|A paracentric key is {{designed}} to open a paracentric lock. It is distinguishable by the contorted shape of its blade, which <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> the centre vertical line of the key barrel. Instead of the wards on the outer face of the lock simply protruding {{into the shape of}} the key along the spine, the wards protrude into the shape of the key along the entire width of the key, including {{along the length of the}} teeth.|$|R

50|$|The black {{swallower}} {{is a small}} fish, with {{a maximum}} known length of 25 cm. The body is elongated and compressed, without scales, and is a uniform brownish-black in color. Its head is long, with a blunt snout, moderately sized eyes, and a large mouth. The lower jaw <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> the upper; both jaws are lined with a single row of sharp, depressible teeth, which interlock when the mouth is closed. The first three teeth in each jaw are enlarged into canines.|$|R
50|$|Despite Ford's engines {{being well}} {{regarded}} for their ease of service, the Endura-E {{has a very}} awkward placing for its oil filter, {{at the back of}} the engine and facing from left to right rather than pointing downwards or out, this being a leftover from the original Kent which was normally mounted longitudinally for rear-wheel drive. This mounting position makes it very difficult to access from underneath the car (without a mechanic's ramp), and despite being very short, the can-type oil filter still manages to <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the tip of the adjacent starter motor, meaning it is very difficult to remove using chain-type grips.|$|E
50|$|The gyne for A. longipennis has a {{total length}} of 8.8 mm, {{with only one}} segment to the petiole, while the first segment of the gaster is not {{constricted}} as Heer originally reported. There are three sets of paired spines, on the propodium, the pronotum and the petiole respectively. The head has antennae with elongated scapes that <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the rear margin of the head capsule and have flagellomeres which are longer than wide. The margins of the compound eyes are rounded and lacking occipital angles. The forewings are elongated and narrowed, with a closed 3r cell, while both the rm and mcu cells are possibly absent.|$|E
5000|$|... "Overbite" [...] {{may also}} be used {{commonly}} to refer to Class II malocclusion or retrognathia, though this usage can be considered incorrect. This is where the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar is situated anterior to the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar; in other words, the mandible (lower jaw) appears too far behind the maxilla. A person presenting with Class II malocclusion may exhibit excessive overbite as well, or may have the opposite problem, which {{is referred to as}} openbite (or apertognathia). In the case of apertognathia, the teeth do not overlap enough or at all. The upper teeth <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the lower teeth.|$|E
50|$|Navels {{with the}} {{umbilical}} tip <b>protruding</b> <b>past</b> the umbilical skin ("outies") are often mistaken for umbilical hernias, {{which are a}} completely different shape. Treatment for cosmetic purposes is not necessary, unless there are health concerns such as incarceration. Umbilical hernias are rare. With a study involving Africans 92% of children had protrusions, 49% of adults, and 90% of pregnant women. However, a much smaller amount: only 23% of children, 8% of adults, and 15% of pregnant women actually suffered from hernias.|$|R
50|$|The {{top of the}} erect stem is {{occupied}} by the inflorescence, which bears hanging buds above open flowers. The pink or red-purple sepals remain fused as the petals spread and emerge {{from one side of}} the bud. The petals are up to 2.5 centimeters long and pink to lavender to magenta, sometimes flecked with red. Each petal has a two-lobed tip. There are 8 stamens, some with large lavender anthers and some with smaller, paler anthers. The stigma <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> the stamens.|$|R
50|$|The longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae) is a {{freshwater}} minnow {{native to}} North America. Rhinicthys means snout fish (reference {{to the long}} snout) and catarace means of the cataract (first taken from Niagara Falls). Longnose dace are small, typically less than 100 mm and characterized by their fleshy snout that <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> the mouth. They are well adapted for living {{on the bottom of}} fast-flowing streams among stones. Longnose dace eat algae and aquatic insects and are important forage minnows for larger predatory fish.|$|R
50|$|The cocking piece {{doubles as}} a safety and is {{attached}} {{at the rear of}} the bolt sleeve assembly and secures the firing pin. When the cocking piece ending in a cocking ring is pulled rearward and turned horizontal, the cocking piece sear can be placed in a recessed safety slot in the bolt plug. This slot is shorter than the firing slot so the firing pin cannot <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the face of the bolt cylinder. Any contact with the cartridge primer is thus prevented. The safe mode also prevents the action from being cycled hence preventing the bolt from accidental opening. The operating ring is quite large, making it easy to operate with gloves. When the operating ring is in the vertical position and pulled back by cycling the action or cocking it by hand the action is ready to fire.|$|E
50|$|Gray's {{beaked whale}} {{is a fairly}} slender member of the genus. The melon on the whale bulges towards the {{blowhole}} and slopes down towards the beak. The beak itself is very long and pointed for a beaked whale, and has a relatively straight mouth line. In both sexes there are 17-22 rows of small teeth located towards {{the back of the}} mouth, which barely <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the gum. In males, there are two small, triangular teeth present halfway down the mouth. The overall coloration is dark on top and light below, and both sexes have a white beak. Females are lighter on top and have additional white marking near the genitals. Adult males often carry linear scars that probably result from fighting, and both males and females may display circular scars from cookiecutter shark bites. M. grayi are 5.5 to 6.0 m long and weigh around 1100 kg. They are believed to be around 2.4 m long when born.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{identified}} {{from a single}} brownish-black worker with flat laying setae along the body and sparser semi-erect setae that are longer than the flat setae. The semi-erect setae are not seen in B. meieri B. similis or B. wunderlichi, distinguishing B. electrina from workers of the other species. With an approximate total length of 3.49 mm, B. electrina workers are the largest for any Bradoponera species. The ridges running from the eyes are smaller than seen in other species, {{and they do not}} cover the antennae bases. The eyes themselves are small with not much convexity and the ommatidia are separated from each other by hairs. The antennae are not as robust as other species, with scapes that <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the rear borders of the eyes. The mesosoma is slightly shorter than the head length, with a distinct suture line at the pronotum. The petiole node is scale shaped and nearly four times wider than long, double that of other Bradoponera species.|$|E
50|$|In {{double sided}} locks {{the centre of}} the key shaft is solid and <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> the end of the bit which slots into a hole on the {{opposite}} side of the lock. Double sided ward locks nearly always have perfectly symmetrical bits. For single sided locks a cylindrical post is typically located in the center of the lock. Its purpose is to provide a point of leverage for rotating the key, and to help correctly align the key with the wards. The key has a corresponding hole which fits over the post.|$|R
50|$|The spinecheek goby {{grows to}} a maximum length of 10 cm. It has an elongated, {{laterally}} compressed body. The mouth is slanted downwards, with the lower jaw <b>protruding</b> <b>past</b> the upper jaw. Teeth are present in both rows in multiple rows, with the teeth in the outermost row enlarged. Its lower jaw also contains a pair of curved canines. The eye is wider in diameter than the blunt snout. An open pore is present just behind the eye. Its head does not possess scales. Scales on the body are ctenoid.|$|R
500|$|In 1844 a French-Swiss {{botanist}} by {{the name}} of Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle (who created the first Code of Botanical Nomenclature) proposed a division of the genus into three sections based on floral morphology. He placed in the section Orcheosanthus those species with purple, deeply bilabiate corollas with 5 sub-equal lobes, a short floral tube, and a large spur not <b>protruding</b> <b>past</b> this tube. He included four species in this section, all of them from Mexico: P. oblongiloba, P. orchidioides, P. caudata and P. moranensis. [...] He excluded P. macrophylla H.B.K. {{on the grounds that it}} was a [...] "dubious species".|$|R
5000|$|The single {{white or}} pink flower is borne on a spike up to 150 mm high. The [...] sepal is erect, linear in shape, 7-12 mm long, 1-2 mm wide with a pointed end. The [...] sepals and petals are usually 6-12 mm long, about 2 mm wide, with their outer {{surfaces}} densely {{covered with a}} band of short, reddish-brown glandular hairs. The labellum is egg-shaped, about 6 mm long and wide, white or pinkish with three lobes and prominent red stripes. The mid-lobe is small and pointed with small teeth on the edge and several rows of yellow-tipped calli in the centre. The [...] lobes are prominent, broad and <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the mid-lobe. The column is 5-7 mm long, curves inwards and has narrow wings. Flowering occurs in September and October and {{is followed by a}} non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. It is similar to Caladenia carnea but is distinguished from it by its single flower, earlier flowering period and red stripes on the labellum and column.|$|E
5000|$|The yellow shovelnose stingaree has an oval {{pectoral}} fin disc slightly wider than long, with the anterior margins weakly convex and converging at an obtuse angle on a fairly elongated, fleshy snout.

The small teeth have oval to diamond-shaped bases and are arranged in a quincunx pattern; the crowns range from pointed near the middle of the jaws to blunt at the sides. There are 19 - 20 upper and 22 - 23 lower tooth rows. The floor of the mouth bears eight or more papillae. The five pairs of gill slits are S-shaped.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{most of the}} bullheads (and even {{flathead}} catfish), it has a squared tail fin, {{which is}} strikingly different from the forked tail of channel and blue catfish. It is a bottom-rover fish, meaning it is well-adapted for bottom living. It is typically dorsoventrally flattened, and has a slightly humped back. [...] Its color depends on the area where it is taken, but it generally is darker than brown or yellow bullheads. It can be distinguished from a flathead in that the black bullhead's lower lip does not <b>protrude</b> <b>past</b> the upper lip. Distinguishing it from the brown bullhead {{is a bit more}} difficult, depending on the area where it is caught, but a distinguishing detail between the two includes a nearly smooth pectoral spine on the black bullhead with the brown being strongly barbed. The anal fin also has a gray base, and the tail also has a pale bar. Also, the brown bullhead generally has 21 to 24 soft rays through its anal fin as opposed to the black bullhead's 17 to 21. The brown bullhead is also typically mottled brown and green on top instead of the darker black. Both the black and brown bullheads can easily be distinguished from the yellow bullhead as the yellow bullhead has white barbels under its mouth.|$|E
500|$|Another re-engined {{version of}} the MiG-9 was the I-320 (izdeliye FN). It had an {{imported}} Rolls-Royce Nene I centrifugal-flow turbojet rated at [...] and the armament was rearranged yet again in another attempt to eliminate the gas ingestion problem. The N-37 cannon {{was moved to the}} underside of the fuselage and the NS-23 guns were moved to each side of the fuselage as in the I-305, although none of the gun barrels <b>protruded</b> <b>past</b> the lips of the air intakes. Construction began in late 1947, but it was never completed as the MiG-15 prototype used the same engine and had a higher performance.|$|R
50|$|Oplopomus are {{characterized}} by elongated bodies and compressed heads. They possess 24 to 30 ctenoid scales on the body, becoming cycloid on the nape before disappearing just behind the eyes. Their snouts are short and rounded, shorter than {{the diameter of the}} eyes. The lower jaw <b>protrudes</b> <b>past</b> the upper jaw, with a pair of canine teeth on each side. The dorsal fins are separate with six rays on the first. The ventral fins are joined by a bridge of skin (a frenum). The caudal fins are rounded. They can grow to a maximum length of 10 cm.|$|R
