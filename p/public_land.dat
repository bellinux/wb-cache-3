40|$|The vast swathes of <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> in {{the western}} U. S. have long been {{connected}} with both the culture and daily {{lives of the people}} that live near them. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the relationship that individuals have with <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> and how that relationship relates to their opinions about the federal agencies (specifically the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management) that oversee those <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> This is done through the use of the effective bond attachment to <b>public</b> <b>lands,</b> which is the degree to which individuals feel connected to <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> through both the opportunities they provide to enjoy their desired lifestyle, functional connections, and the ways in which personal identity is tied to those lands, emotional connections. Assessing this bond is done through analysis and interpretation of selected data from the 2007 <b>Public</b> <b>Lands</b> and Utah Communities survey, which looked at a variety of connections Utah residents have to the state’s many <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> This study utilizes a novel statistical method known as the “inverted-R analysis,” which groups respondents based on answers to a variety of attitudinal measures, to develop three distinct typologies of attachment to <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> Analysis of differences between the groups of respondents that expressed different types of attachment revealed no correlation between attachment to <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> and opinions about land managers. All respondents expressed generally negative sentiment towards both Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land managers. However, respondents who expressed a stronger attachment to <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> also demonstrated higher levels of interaction with <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> Additionally, functional and emotional connections to <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> were shown to operate as two separate parts of attachment to <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> This reinforces the modeling of the conceptualization attachment to <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> after the related concept, place attachment. This study demonstrated both the strong connections individuals in Utah have with <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> and the strong opinions held about the agencies that manage those lands...|$|R

5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply.

50|$|A largely missing picture until recently, was {{the fate}} of <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> (kokugaryo) during the Muromachi period, {{and the role of}} the shugo lords in their {{encroachment}} on them. <b>Public</b> <b>lands</b> (kokugaryo) during the Heian period were distinguished from private lands of the estates (shōen), because the latter were immune from state taxation. Before the rise of private estates, the only kind of <b>lands</b> were <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> maintained under the old civil administration. With the rise of private estates called shōen, during the Heian period, <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> by no means disappeared: in details, the <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> differed very little from private estates. Both were owned by absentee proprietors. They differed only in terms of administration: private estates were directly managed by noble officials, whereas, <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> were managed by the civil governors (kokuga or kokushi) on behalf of the former.|$|R
5|$|The {{traffic routing}} {{was not only}} {{influenced}} by {{the location of the}} already existing stations the line was supposed to connect, but also by land availability in the city centre. One of the original drafts, which called for building the line along Leipziger Straße, had to be scrapped because of overly high land prices. The moat of the 17th century Berlin Fortress was filled up between Hackescher Markt and Jannowitzbrücke stations and, since it was <b>public</b> <b>land,</b> was used for building the railway line.

5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of <b>public</b> <b>land.</b> He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of <b>public</b> <b>land,</b> as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E
