50|$|A {{less common}} variant of pectus carinatum is <b>pectus</b> <b>arcuatum</b> (also called type 2 pectus excavatum, chondromanubrial {{deformity}} or Currarino-Silverman syndrome or pouter pigeon deformity), which produces a manubrial and upper sternal protrusion, particularly {{also at the}} sternal angle. <b>Pectus</b> <b>arcuatum</b> is often confused {{with a combination of}} pectus carinatum and pectus excavatum, but in <b>pectus</b> <b>arcuatum</b> the visual appearance is characterized by a protrusion of the costal cartilages and there is no depression of the sternum.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>arcuatum</b> {{is a rare}} complex {{chest wall}} deformity. A 31 -year-old female {{presented}} with a severely protruding upper sternum combined with a concave lower sternum. We planned a modified Ravitch-type operation. Through vertical mid-sternal incision, chondrectomies were performed from the second to fifth costal cartilages, saving the perichondrium. Horizontal osteotomy was performed in a wedge shape on the most protruding point, and followed by an additional partial osteotomy at the most concaved point. The harvested wedge-shape bone fragments were minced and re-implanted to the latter osteotomy site. The osteotomized sternum was fixed with multiple wirings. With chondrosternoplasty, a complex chest wall deformity can be corrected successfully...|$|E
