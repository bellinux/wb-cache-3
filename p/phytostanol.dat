40|$|Plant sterols are {{structurally}} {{related to}} cholesterol {{and can be}} divided into phytosterols and <b>phytostanols,</b> <b>phytostanols</b> being the saturated form of the phytosterols. Scientific studies indicate that consumption of 1. 5 - 3 g of plant sterols per day can significantly reduce the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals if consumed as part of a healthy diet. To take advantage of the cholesterol-lowering effect, an increasing number of food products with added plant sterols or plant sterol esters have become available on the EU market. Unfortunately, the consumption of high doses of plant sterols can also significantly reduce the blood levels of carotenoids. As a prudent precaution it has thus been suggested that intakes of plant sterols should not exceed 3 g per day. Regular consumers of products with added plant sterols have been estimated to constitute about 10 - 15 % of the population. In general there seems so far to be little over-consumption of food products with added plant sterols, rather the average consumer exposure to plant sterols is on the low side of what is considered an effective dose.

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are Currently the most effective LDL-C-lowering drugs. However, a substantial number of patients do not reach treatment targets with statins. Therefore, an unmet medical need exists for lipid-lowering drugs with novel mechanisms of action to reach the recommended cholesterol target levels, either by monotherapy or combination therapy. Upregulation of the LDL receptor with squalene synthase inhibitors has shown promising results in animal Studies but the clinical development of the lead compound lapaquistat (TAK- 475) has recently been discontinued.

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine, in the absence of excess dietary salt, the individual effects of excess accumulation of dietary phytosterols and phytostanols on blood pressure in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) inbred rats that have a mutation in the Abcg 5 gene and thus over absorb phytosterols and phytostanols. Methods Thirty 35 -day old male WKY inbred rats (10 /group) were fed a control diet or a diet containing phytosterols or phytostanols (2. 0 g/kg diet) for 5 weeks. The sterol composition of the diets, plasma and tissues were analysed by gas chromatography. Blood pressure was measured by the tail cuff method. mRNA levels of several renal blood pressure regulatory genes were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Results Compared to the control diet, the phytosterol diet resulted in 3 - to 4 -fold increases in the levels of phytosterols in plasma, red blood cells, liver, aorta and kidney of WKY inbred rats (P 9 -fold) the levels of phytostanols in plasma, red blood cells, liver, aorta and kidney of these rats (P P P P P angiotensinogen mRNA levels of these rats. Conclusion These data suggest that excessive accumulation of dietary phytosterols and phytostanols in plasma and tissues may contribute to the increased blood pressure in WKY inbred rats in the absence of excess dietary salt. Therefore, even though phytosterols and phytostanols lower cholesterol levels, prospective clinical studies testing the net beneficial effects of dietary phytosterols and phytostanols on cardiovascular events for subgroups of individuals that have an increased incorporation of these substances are needed. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of phytosterols and phytostanols added to foods and food supplements to obtain significant non-pharmacologic serum and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction is well documented. Irrespective of age, gender, ethnic background, body weight, background diet, or {{the cause of}} hypercholesterolemia and, even added to statin treatment, phytosterols and phytostanols at 2 g/day significantly lower LDL cholesterol concentration by 8 %- 10 %. They do not affect the concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein (a) or serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. In some studies, phytosterols and phytostanols have modestly reduced serum triglyceride levels especially in subjects with slightly increased baseline concentrations. Phytosterols and phytostanols lower LDL cholesterol by displacing cholesterol from mixed micelles in the small intestine so that cholesterol absorption is partially inhibited. Cholesterol absorption and synthesis have been carefully evaluated during phytosterol and <b>phytostanol</b> supplementation. However, only a few lipoprotein kinetic studies have been performed, and they revealed that LDL apoprotein B- 100 transport rate was reduced. LDL particle size was unchanged, but small dense LDL cholesterol concentration was reduced. In subjects with metabolic syndrome and moderate hypertriglyceridemia, phytostanols reduced not only non- high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration but also serum triglycerides by 27 %, and reduced the large and medium size very low density lipoprotein particle concentrations. In the few postprandial studies, the postprandial lipoproteins were reduced, but detailed studies with apoprotein B- 48 are lacking. In conclusion, more kinetic studies are required to obtain a more complete understanding of the fasting and postprandial lipoprotein metabolism caused by phytosterols and phytostanols.

To {{provide insight into the}} mechanism of this response, we examined the in vivo effects of a high fat diet supplemented with ascorbic acid (AA) in the presence and absence of unesterified phytosterols (PS), and set out to establish whether the supplements have a synergistic effect in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Our data indicate that HF diet supplementation with a combination of 1 % w/w phytosterol and 1 % w/w ascorbic acid results in reduced mass accumulation, with mean differences in absolute mass between PSAA and HF control of 10. 05 %; and differences in mass accumulation of 21. 6 % (i. e. the PSAA group gained on average 21 % less mass each week from weeks 7 - 12 than the HF control group). In our previous study, the absolute mass difference between the 2 % DAPP and HF control was 41 %, while the mean difference in mass accumulation between the two groups for weeks 7 - 12 was 67. 9 %.

These data suggest that the supplements are synergistic with respect to mass accumulation, and the esterification of the compounds further potentiates the response.

The objective {{of the present study}} was to validate a simpler singleisotope method for determining cholesterol absorption against PDSIRM by using data from two previous studies. Enrichments of carbon- 13 (93 C) and deuterium in red blood cells were analyzed by using differential isotope ratio MS. The area under the curve of 93 C-enrichment in the plasma free-cholesterol pool was found to be significantly correlated with cholesterol absorption measured by using PDSIRM for study 1 (r = 0. 85, P < 0. 0001) and study 2 (r = 0. 81, P < 0. 0001). Average 93 C-enrichment correlated with the area under the curve of 93 C-enrichment in the plasma free cholesterol for both study 1 (r = 0. 98, P < 0. 0001) and study 2 (r = 1. 00, P < 0. 0001). Study 1 examined the efficacy and mechanisms of unesterified plant sterols and stanols on lipid profiles in hypercholesterolemic men and women, while study 2 investigated the effects of phytosterol vs. <b>phytostanol</b> esters on plasma lipid levels and cholesterol kinetics in hyperlipidemic men. Experimental approaches to determine cholesterol absorption were identical between the two studies. Consequently, in both studies, correlations (r = 0. 88, P < 0. 0001 for study 1, and r = 0. 82, P < 0. 0001 for study 2) were found between the average 93 C-enrichment of plasma free cholesterol and cholesterol absorption measured by PDSIRM.

Occurrence of stanols was confirmed by a combination of silver nitrate impregnated thin-layer chromatography and capillary column gas-liquid chromatography. Commercial oils from vegetable origin (corn, rice bran, safflower, rape seed, soy bean and coconut) contained various amounts of stanols. Stanols were also detected in margarines, both ordinary and so-called soft types. Hydrogenation under the condition widely applied for the commercial hardening processes resulted in a gradual decomposition of sterols. When completely hydrogenated, there was a marked degradation of sterols and considerable parts of the remaining unsaponifiable fraction were stanols. The data are of indicative of concomitant hydrogenation of double bonds in the sterol ring even under the condition not favorable for the saturation of sterols.

Here, an update of the scientific evidence is reviewed to evaluate plant PAP-enriched foods impact on plasma fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoid levels, and to discuss potential implications in terms of cardiovascular risk. Based on 49 human interventional and 3 bioavailability studies, results showed that regular consumption, particularly over the long term, of foods fortified with PAP as recommended in labelling does not significantly impact plasma vitamins A, D and K concentration.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of our {{research}} was to describe cultural, socioeconomic and nutritional determinants associated with functional food consumption. METHODS: Cross-sectional design in 5000 military men. Using mailed questionnaires, the functional food consumption frequency was recorded. RESULTS: Margarines fortified with phytosterols or <b>phytostanols</b> were used {{on a daily basis}} by 26. 3 % of the responders. Only 4. 7 % took a daily portion of probiotics, whereas 14. 0 % consumed one or more portions of nuts a week. One man out of three consumed one cup of tea daily, whereas 10. 2 % consumed one glass of red wine daily. Three or more portions of fruit a day were consumed by 19. 1 %, and two or more portions of vegetables a day by 26. 6 %. Only 12. 3 % consumed a portion of fatty fish weekly. After adjustment for age, body mass index, physical activity, use of vitamin supplements, smoking, marital status, cultural background, educational and income level, the daily consumption of fortified margarines increased with age. The consumption of fermented dairy products increased with physical activity and with the use of vitamin supplements. The consumption of fortified margarines, nuts, tea and fatty fish was strongly influenced by cultural background, with higher consumptions for Flemish-speaking men compared with French-speaking persons. Daily consumption of red wine was higher in French-speaking men and in higher educated men. Finally, functional food consumption was associated with a healthy dietary pattern.

40|$|Phytosterols (PS) and {{the related}} <b>phytostanols</b> are {{bioactive}} compounds of many foodstuffs, especially in food items of plant origin, such as vegetable oils, cereal grains, nuts and seeds. PS {{are known to have}} several bioactive properties with various implications on human health, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic activities and cholesterol lowering capacity. Analytical methods are critical elements for the correct and accurate determination of PS. A review of the last three decades, based on compilation of the available information on the different steps (extraction, saponification, derivatization and chromatographic method) of PS determination was performed. The preparation samples for PS analyses should take into account the nature of matrix, its physical sate, among others. Most of the times, ethanolic or methanolic potassium hydroxide are the selected reagents for the saponification, which can be performed at room temperature or with heating. For derivatization, N,O-Bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1 % of trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) or N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) are the most used reagents. Capillary gas-chromatography (GC), with flame ionization detector (FID) or mass spectrometry (MS), proved to be simple and accurate to perform analytical determinations on this group of compounds. However, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with different detection systems has also been used. Analysis of PS are best carried out using 30 m x 0. 25 mm i. d. x 0. 25 µm film thickness, flexible, fused capillary columns coated with 5 % phenyl and 95 % methyl siloxane, because it has a high thermal stability and provides better resolution of peaks.
