We select all persons aged 15 to 20  years—for simplicity, referring to this group as “adolescents”—living {{with at least one}} parent, where “parent” means the parental figure of the household in which the adolescent (or young adult) resides, and may refer to a natural, adoptive, step, or foster parent or a parent’s de facto partner. We then retain <b>person-year</b> observations relating only to the adolescent’s first father and/or first mother identified in the data, which results in the omission of fewer than 50 <b>person-year</b> observations. We again restrict the sample to persons (i.e., “adolescents”) who completed the SCQ, resulting in the exclusion of a further 1446 <b>person-year</b> observations (11.8 %).

Firstly, the burden of disease due to premature death was estimated by using YLLs (years life lost due to premature death) measurement developed by the global burden of disease study group. Secondly, for the calculation of the YLD (years lived with disability), the following parameters were estimated in the formula; incidence rate, case fatality rate and disability weight of major cancers. Thirdly, we estimated DALY of major cancers by adding YLLs and YLDs. The burden of major cancers for male per 100, 000 population was attributed mainly to liver cancer (528. 8 <b>person-year),</b> stomach cancer (451. 4 <b>person-year),</b> and lung cancer (374. 9 personyear). The burden of major cancers for female per 100, 000 population was attributed mainly to liver cancer (140. 0 <b>person-year),</b> stomach cancer (259. 7 personyear), and lung cancer (125. 2 <b>person-year).</b> Each of these cancers {{was responsible for the}} loss of over 100 <b>person-year</b> per 100, 000 population based on our DALY measurement.

5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States.

PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed.

40|$|This paper reports {{trends in}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) incidence among street-recruited injection drug users (IDUs) in San Francisco, California, from 1987 through 1998, estimated using a sensitive/less sensitive enzyme immunoassay testing strategy. IDUs were enrolled in 23 semiannual cross-sections from three community sites. For identification of recent infections, less sensitive enzyme immunoassay testing was performed on stored specimens that had previously tested positive for HIV antibodies. Annualized incidence rates were calculated and logistic regression models were fitted for assessment of risk factors for recent HIV infection. Among 8, 065 susceptible IDUs, 34 had recent infections, for an incidence rate of 1. 2 % (95 % confidence interval: 0. 7, 2. 0) per <b>person-year.</b> This rate declined from 2. 7 % in 1987 / 1988 to approximately 1 % per <b>person-year</b> between 1989 and 1998.
