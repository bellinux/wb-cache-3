25|$|The large {{capacitance}} {{per unit}} volume of electrolytic capacitors make them valuable in relatively high-current and low-frequency electrical circuits, e.g. in power supply filters for decoupling unwanted AC components from DC <b>power</b> <b>connections</b> or as coupling capacitors in audio amplifiers, for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals and storing {{large amounts of}} energy. The relatively high capacitance value of an electrolytic capacitor combined with the very low ESR of the polymer electrolyte of polymer capacitors, especially in SMD styles, makes them a competitor to MLC chip capacitors in personal computer power supplies.|$|E

25|$|Information {{provided}} to the IAEA indicated that storage pool temperatures at both Units 5 and 6 remained steady around 60–68°C between 19:00 JST 14 March and 21:00 JST 18 March, though rising slowly. On 18 March reactor water levels remained around 2 m above the top of fuel rods. It was confirmed that panels {{had been removed from}} the roofs of Units 5 and 6 to allow any hydrogen gas to escape. At 04:22 on 19 March, the second unit of emergency generator A for Unit 6 was restarted which allowed operation of pump C of the residual heat removal system (RHR) in Unit 5 to cool the spent fuel storage pool and reactor core alternately. Later in the day, Pump B in Unit 6 was also restarted to allow cooling of the spent fuel pool and reactor core there. Crews had installed temporary submersible seawater pumps and hoses to supply cooling water to the residual heat removal system heat exchangers as the main seawater pumps were heavily damaged by the tsunami. Additionally, as there was heavy damage to electrical equipment in the basements from flooding, temporary <b>power</b> <b>connections</b> had to be made to the residual heat removal system main loop pumps. Temperature at Unit 5 pool decreased to 48°C on 19 March 18:00 JST, and 37°C on 20 March when Unit 6 pool temperature had fallen to 41°C. On 20 March, NISA announced that both reactors had been returned to a condition of cold shutdown.|$|E
2500|$|It is safest (for both multimeter, circuit under test, and the operator) to {{disconnect}} a component from its circuit, and almost always, to remove {{power from the}} device being investigated. [...] Removing all <b>power</b> <b>connections</b> from a piece of mains powered equipment before testing (and ensuring that all large capacitance devices are discharged safely) is the safest choice. [...] Leaving equipment attached to the mains supply while making measurements should be only a very carefully considered alternative choice. [...] Amongst other issues, there are interactions between the ground arrangements for wall powered test equipment, and the device under test, which are unsafe, and can damage test equipment and the device under test. This is especially so {{when there is a}} fault, suspected or not, in any of the interconnected devices. Battery powered test equipment may be the safest choice in such situations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} domestic {{plug and}} socket {{is believed to be}} that patented by T.T. Smith in 1883. [...] This was shortly followed by patents from WB Sayers and G Hookham; these early designs had rectangular plugs with contact plates on either side. In 1885, two-pin plug designs appeared and in 1889 there were two-pin plugs and sockets in the GEC catalogue. [...] The 1893 GEC Catalogue included 3 sizes of what was described as Double plug Sockets with capacities described not in amps, but as 1 to 5 lights, 5 to 10 lights and 10 to 20 lights. [...] These were clearly recognisable as two-pin plugs and sockets, but with no indication as to pin size or spacing, they were sold as pairs. [...] The same catalogue included lampholder plugs for both BC and ES lampholders (capacity unspecified), and also a type of two-pole concentric {{plug and socket}} (similar to a very large versions of the concentric connectors used for laptop PC <b>power</b> <b>connections)</b> in the 1 to 5 lights and 5 to 10 lights capacities. [...] Crompton and Company introduced the first two-pin socket with protective shutters in 1893, the Edison Swan Company was also manufacturing two-pin plug and sockets in the 1890s.|$|E

40|$|Shore <b>power</b> <b>connection,</b> a {{practice}} whereby shore-side electrical power is provided to vessels at berth in a port, {{is set to}} play a major role in shaping the future energy requirements of the commercial shipping industry. Short circuit level compatibility of systems is a problem when a ship power system is connected to a shore electrical distribution system. A method that is able to evaluate the shore-side and ship-side impedances and determine the prospective short circuit current level is essential. This paper aims at presenting a methodology for calculating the short circuit current in the shore <b>power</b> <b>connection</b> system. Two analysis models: IEC std. 61363 - 1 and IEC std. 60909 - 0 combined with IEC std. 60909 - 0 are developed and used in this paper for short circuit current analysis. Performance of the proposed method is validated by short circuit current calculation results gathered from several visiting ship scenarios in a practical shore <b>power</b> <b>connection</b> system. The proposed method can provide engineers with useful information about the prospective magnitude of short circuit currents, as well as on the effect of shore supply on ship power system, to assist them in ensuring short circuit level compatibility and allowing the selection and setting of protective devices...|$|R
