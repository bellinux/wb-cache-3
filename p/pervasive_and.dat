5|$|Butch {{women were}} not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were <b>pervasive</b> <b>and</b> not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further {{identified}} {{members of a group}} that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are <b>pervasive</b> <b>and</b> include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E

5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are <b>pervasive</b> <b>and</b> {{represent}} the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.|$|E

25|$|Semiotics {{of culture}} is a {{research}} field within semiotics that attempts to define culture from semiotic perspective and {{as a type of}} human symbolic activity, creation of signs and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a system of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as semiotics of culture and language. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as <b>pervasive</b> <b>and</b> thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.|$|E

25|$|Connerly's {{opposition}} {{to affirmative action}} has generated both opposition and support. Connerly believes affirmative action {{is a form of}} racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is <b>pervasive</b> <b>and</b> powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} of the society into castes and communities was conspicuously absent and practices of untouchability and exclusiveness were unknown. There was dignity of labour accorded to all work {{and no one was}} looked down upon due to their work or occupation. A striking feature of the social life of the Cheras in the Sangam age is the high status accorded to women. Women enjoyed freedom of movement as well as the right to full education. Child marriage was unknown in the early Sangam era and adult marriage was the general rule. The practice of 'bride-price', where the groom would pay the girl's parents, appears to be prevalent in the time. Women were free to follow any occupation though most of them were involved in weaving or the sale of goods. A martial spirit was <b>pervasive</b> <b>and</b> women even went to the battlefield along with the men, largely playing a key role in keeping up the morale of the fighting forces.|$|E

25|$|The {{discrimination}} {{enforced by}} the hukou system became particularly onerous in the 1980s after {{hundreds of millions of}} migrant workers were forced out of state corporations, co-operatives and other institutions. Attempts by workers classified as rural to move to urban centers were tightly controlled by the Chinese bureaucracy, which enforced its control by denying access to essential goods and services such as grain rations, housing, and health care, and by regularly closing down migrant workers' private schools. The hukou system also enforced pass laws similar to those in South Africa. Rural workers required six passes to work in provinces other than their own, and periodic police raids rounded up those without permits, placed them in detention centers, and deported them. As in South Africa, the restrictions placed on the mobility of migrant workers were <b>pervasive,</b> <b>and</b> transient workers were forced to live a precarious existence in company dormitories or shanty towns, suffering abusive consequences. Anita Chan comments further that China's household registration and temporary residence permit system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in apartheid South Africa, which were designed to regulate the supply of cheap labor.|$|E
500|$|When The Motion Picture was announced, many {{synthesizer}} artists submitted demo {{tapes to}} Paramount. Ramsay and Wise consulted {{and decided that}} the film should have a unique audio style; they were particularly concerned with avoiding sounds that had become <b>pervasive</b> <b>and</b> clichéd due to repetitious use in other science fiction movies. Events such as Enterprise bridge viewscreen activation were kept silent {{to provide a more}} comfortable atmosphere. In contrast, almost every action on the Klingon bridge made noise to reflect the aliens' harsh aesthetic. While much of the effects were created using digital synthesizers, acoustic recordings were used as well. The wormhole's sucking sounds were created by slowing down and reversing old Paramount stock footage of a cowboy fight, while the warp acceleration [...] "stretch" [...] sound was built on a slowed-down cymbal crash. The crew encountered difficulty in transferring the [...] tapes used for creating the sounds to the 35mm film used for the final prints; while the film was to be released with Dolby sound, Serafine found it was easier to mix the sounds without regard to format and add the specific format after, during the later transfer to 35mm.|$|E
500|$|A {{common law}} rule from Great Britain permits {{searches}} incident to an arrest without a warrant. This rule {{has been applied}} in American law, and has a lengthy common law history. The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that [...] "both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply", when [...] "there is no possibility" [...] that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence. In Trupiano v. United States (1948), the Supreme Court held that [...] "a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been {{considered to be a}} strictly limited right. It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation {{at the time of the}} arrest. But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest." [...] In United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), the Court reversed Trupiano, holding instead that the officers' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest. Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the [...] "immediate control" [...] of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not define the term. In deciding Chimel v. California (1969), the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence. However, in Riley v. California (2014), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee's cellular phone. The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to [...] "modern cellphones, which are now such a <b>pervasive</b> <b>and</b> insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy," [...] and noted that US citizens' cellphones today typically contain [...] "a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives — from the mundane to the intimate." ...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. (Auditing) 2009, SAICA {{released}} its Competency Framework. The Competency Framework detailed specific competencies {{to be achieved}} at entry point into the profession, but placed specific emphasis on <b>pervasive</b> qualities <b>and</b> skills. The competencies in the Competency Framework now form the foundation of SAICA’s qualification model, which will be assessed in the revised Part I and Part II in 2013 and 2014 respectively. As a consequence, SAICA-accredited academic providers are now being tasked to deliver not only specific competencies, but also <b>pervasive</b> qualities <b>and</b> skills. No research had been conducted on the views of individual academics at SAICA-accredited academic programmes on the delivery methods that result in the acquisition/development and assessment of SAICA’s <b>pervasive</b> qualities <b>and</b> skills, {{as well as on}} the challenges related to the delivery of these competencies. Thus, there was significant pressure on academic providers to respond to SAICA’s requirements in the Competency Framework, and, in the context of this dissertation, to respond vis-à-vis <b>pervasive</b> qualities <b>and</b> skills. The research problem was addressed by following a two-pronged approach, which firstly entailed conducting an extensive literature review and then performing empirical work. The literature review identified delivery methods that are recognized by IFAC, applied by CAGE member bodies’ and used in the accounting profession to equip candidates with <b>pervasive</b> qualities <b>and</b> skills. The empirical work solicited the views of individual academics at SAICA’s accredited academic programmes on delivery methods that may be applied in the transfer of <b>pervasive</b> qualities <b>and</b> skills, and on the challenges associated with this debate. This study found that an array of delivery methods must be used in the delivery of competencies, and formulated 19 acquisition/development and 17 assessment methods that may be applied by academic providers in addressing SAICA’s <b>pervasive</b> qualities <b>and</b> skills, and by HODS in drafting policies that address these competencies. In addition, this dissertation highlighted the inconsistencies between academics providing instruction on the undergraduate programme and their honours counterparts. It was emphasized that competence is a continual process, and that the onus to deliver all SAICA’s competencies rests with the academic providers during their education programmes. Furthermore, the research findings make a significant contribution to the existing body of knowledge on <b>pervasive</b> qualities <b>and</b> skills...|$|R
