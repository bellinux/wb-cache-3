25|$|The first Harley-Davidson {{motorcycles}} were {{powered by}} single-cylinder IOE engines with the inlet valve operated by engine vacuum. Singles {{of this type}} continued to be made until 1913, when a <b>pushrod</b> and rocker system was used to operate the overhead inlet valve on the single, a similar system having been used on their V-twins since 1911. Single-cylinder motorcycle engines were discontinued in 1918.|$|E

25|$|By 1990, it {{was decided}} that the new technologically {{advanced}} car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3L <b>pushrod</b> V6. The 3.3L engine's 60° block was bored out to 3.5L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with SOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5L V6.|$|E
25|$|A diving {{regulator}} {{suitable for}} cold-water is used. All regulators have {{a risk of}} freezing and free flowing, but some models fare better than others. Environmentally sealed regulators avoid contact between the surrounding water and the moving parts of the first stage by isolating them in an antifreeze fluid (e.g. Poseidon) or by siting the moving parts behind a diaphragm and transmitting the pressure through a <b>pushrod</b> (e.g. Apeks).|$|E
25|$|All cars must be front-engined and rear-wheel drive. All cars use a 5.0-litre, {{naturally}} aspirated V8-engine with electronic fuel injection, {{capable of producing}} between 460 and 485 kW (620–650 bhp). Manufacturers are free to choose between using an engine based on one from their own line up or a generic engine provided by V8 Supercars. Both Ford and Holden use US-based racing engines with <b>pushrod</b> actuated valves and two valves per cylinder. Mercedes, Nissan and Volvo use modified versions of their own engines, with hydraulic-lift valves and four valves per cylinder. All engines are electronically limited to 7,500 rpm and have a compression ratio of 10:1.|$|E

25|$|Power {{comes from}} {{overhead}} valve (two per cylinder), <b>pushrod,</b> naturally aspirated, carbureted 358 cubic inch (5.86 L) V8 engines, producing anywhere from 850 to 875 horsepower. The minimum base weight (including driver and driver gear) for all cars is 2,780 pounds. Fuel cell capacity is 33 U.S. gallons. Current rules {{allow for the}} use of leaded gasoline, whereas all other classes must use unleaded gas. The use of Nitrous Oxide (or other similar compounds or systems), fuel additives, and/or fuel cooling, as well as supercharging or turbocharging is strictly prohibited in all classes. Automatic transmissions are prohibited, and manual transmissions must have no more than 5 forward speeds, and a functional reverse speed.|$|E
25|$|The BGP 001 was {{designed}} throughout 2008 and 2009 by Honda and then Brawn after the change over. It {{was designed}} by Loïc Bigois, in similar respects {{to all the other}} cars on the grid with a moulded carbon fibre and honeycomb composite monocoque and a front and rear wishbone and <b>pushrod</b> activated suspension system. Remarkably, it was revealed that the modifications made to the car to accommodate its Mercedes engine saw six inches removed from the rear end, severely compromising the car's center of gravity {{and by the time the}} team realized how much the car's balance had changed, there was no time to commission a new design. Ross Brawn also admitted that there were fundamental problems with the car, stating that it was too heavy, and that some of the parts were not good for the car.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{retaining}} {{the dimensions of}} the Titan TD7 and Tiger TS11, the 1945 Titan PD1 and Tiger PS1 were entirely new designs featuring a new E181 7.4-litre engine with <b>pushrod</b> valve operation and a brand new four-speed constant mesh gearbox. The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later rebodying them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with left-hand drive, the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all left-hand drive Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for driving control position.|$|E

500|$|Moments {{after his}} spin, Hill {{was interviewed by}} the BBC, {{revealing}} that his spin was due to a gearbox problem; the Williams car losing second gear before apparently seizing completely. Hill {{also said that he}} was [...] "very, very disappointed" [...] with the result, and that [...] "we could have beaten him [...] today". Further post-race analysis conducted by the Williams team, however, found that the problem was actually a broken left-rear suspension <b>pushrod.</b>|$|E

The low compression ratio meant the engine could consume inexpensive and commonly available low octane fuel, as well as minimizing the effort to kick start the engine, making the extra weight and expense of an electric starter an unnecessary creature comfort. Though {{some of the many}} Super Cub variations came with both kick and electric start, the majority sold well without it. Even the latest 2011 model year Japanese domestic market (JDM) Super Cub 50 and Super Cub 110 versions, with modern technology and conveniences like fuel injection and a fuel gauge, were not offered with an electric start option.|$|E

50|$|The sidevalve's poppet valves {{are usually}} sited {{on one side}} of the {{cylinder}}(s). A recess in the cylinder head creates a corridor connecting the valves and the combustion chamber. The valve gear comprises a camshaft which operates the valves via simple tappets, most commonly without any further valvetrain components (such as <b>pushrods,</b> rocker arms, overhead valves or overhead camshafts). Indian, however, employs both rocker arms and <b>pushrods</b> to transmit motion from the cam lobes to the valve stems.|$|R
2500|$|In 1994, Al Unser, Jr. won the Indianapolis 500 with a Penske-Mercedes IndyCar. Mercedes-Benz which, {{realizing that}} a {{loophole}} {{in the rules}} for production-based engines would include any <b>pushrod</b> engine, built a very unusual purpose-built <b>pushrod</b> engine with a significant power advantage. This was done knowing that the [...] "forgotten" [...] loophole would be closed immediately after they took advantage of it, and so the engine would in fact be usable only for this single race.|$|E
2500|$|The HKS 700E has dual {{capacitor}} discharge ignition, dual carburetors and electric start. [...] The engine is mainly air-cooled, but with oil-cooled cylinder heads. The OHV <b>pushrod</b> engine has four valves per cylinder, and nickel-ceramic coated cylinder bores. Lubrication is dry sump, with a trochoid pump.|$|E
2500|$|The glider had a wire-braced, wooden, two part, three spar wing {{with the}} first spar forming the leading edge and the second the axis of rotation. [...] The wings had {{constant}} chord out to angled tips and a thick (16.7%) section. Like the tail surfaces, they were fabric covered. Each leading edge was linked by a short forward extension of the control column by a vertical, outward leaning <b>pushrod</b> providing rotations of up to ±10°.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{air-cooled}} ohv BMW boxer motorcycle engines {{had long}} <b>pushrods</b> {{and a single}} centrally-mounted camshaft; but the post-1992 BMW R259 [...] "Oilhead" [...] boxer engines had a camshaft in each cylinder head, located between the combustion chamber and the rocker arms. The <b>pushrods</b> were very short, allowing higher rpm and more power. For instance, the BMW R1100S (which had a R259 engine) could achieve an output of [...] at 8,400 rpm, with no risk of valve bounce.

A Clubsport R8 was also available, with greater equipment (e.g. leather seats and extra instrument gauses) and revised wheels design and upgraded braking system.|$|E
2500|$|Notable {{technology}} {{includes a}} pure carbon fiber monocoque and subframe, dry sump lubrication and inboard suspension. [...] ATR Composites Group of Italy produced and assembled the carbon fiber monocoque and subframe. At speeds above seventy mph, the Carrera GT raises its rear wing into the airstream to reduce lift. The {{size of its}} radiator is about five times that of a 911 Turbo. Both its front and rear suspensions comprise <b>pushrod</b> actuated shock absorbers and dampers with anti-roll bars.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at {{the small}} Turinese firm SIATA (Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie), Aldo Farinelli began {{developing}} a small <b>pushrod</b> engine for mounting on bicycles. Barely {{a month after the}} official liberation of Italy in 1944, SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine, called the [...] "Cucciolo" [...] (Italian for [...] "puppy," [...] in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound) to the public. The first Cucciolos were available alone, to be mounted on standard bicycles, by the buyer; however, businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity, and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale.|$|E
50|$|The C-type is an {{overhead}} valve, water-cooled design, with a 5-bearing crankshaft, a chain driven, side-positioned camshaft operating the valves via <b>pushrods</b> and rockers, and an aluminum cylinder head.|$|R
50|$|With {{overhead}} camshafts, the valvetrain will be {{shorter and}} lighter, as no <b>pushrods</b> are required. Some overhead camshaft designs still have rocker arms; this facilitates adjustment of mechanical clearances.|$|R
50|$|Bristol {{produced}} a straight-six until 1961, {{based on a}} BMW design, that was also used by many small automakers such as AC Cars and Frazer Nash. The Bristol engine had a distinctive valvegear arrangement. The hemispherical combustion chambers meant that the inlet and exhaust valves had to be mounted on separate rocker shafts, giving the engine the appearance of having double overhead camshafts. In fact the engine used {{a variation on the}} overhead valve layout, with a camshaft mounted in the engine block driving the inlet rocker arms via traditional vertical <b>pushrods.</b> The inlet rocker shaft had additional cams which drove horizontal <b>pushrods</b> acting on the exhaust rockers on the opposite shaft. The result was an engine with very efficient gas flow due to the placement of the valves and the shape of the combustion chamber but the numerous interfaces between cams, <b>pushrods,</b> rockers and valves required dedicated maintenance to maintain and a lot of noise when the clearances were allowed to be become excessive.|$|R
