Born to a {{merchant}} family in the town Udatadi (or Udugani) in the Shivamogga district, and possibly married against her wishes to a feudal chief called Kausika, she renounced worldly pleasures, opting {{for a life of}} devotion and asceticism.

5|$|The Amorites in Qatna spoke {{their own}} language, but kings communicated with their {{counterparts}} using Akkadian, {{which was the}} language of writing in the city. Qatna's Akkadian became heavily influenced by Hurrian in the 15th and 14th centuries BC; Richter argued that a special AkkadianHurrian hybrid dialect developed in Qatna. Texts from Qatna exhibit many Hurrian elements, proving that Hurrian was <b>prominent</b> <b>among</b> scribes, but its predominance as a spoken language {{by the general public}} cannot be determined.|$|E
5|$|The Caged Lion (1870) by Charlotte Mary Yonge. The novel {{depicts the}} captivity of James I in the Kingdom of England, {{with the main}} events taking place in 1421–1422. A {{friendly}} relationship with Henry V of England is prominently featured. Catherine of Valois and Richard Whittington are the most <b>prominent</b> <b>among</b> the secondary characters.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly <b>prominent</b> <b>among</b> males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E

He was consecrated at Canterbury on 22December by Archbishop Thomas Becket. Becket had been <b>prominent</b> <b>among</b> those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that Becket urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. There {{is some evidence that}} Pope Alexander III had a hand in Robert's election, as Becket in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester that they both owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was {{the music}} of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy {{slightly}} since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued {{for more than ten}} years. In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was <b>prominent</b> <b>among</b> those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.|$|E

5|$|Chhinnamasta {{is often}} named as the fifth or sixth Mahavidya (Mahavidyas are {{a group of}} ten fearsome goddesses from the Hindu escoetric {{tradition}} of Tantra), with hymns identifying her as a fierce aspect of Devi, the Hindu Mother goddess. Kinsley says that three Mahavidyas– Kali, Tara, and Chhinnamasta– are <b>prominent</b> <b>among</b> Mahavidya depictions and lists, but that Chhinnamasta barely has an independent existence outside the group. The Guhyatiguhya-Tantra (c. 9th century) equates the god Vishnu's ten avatars with the ten Mahavidyas; the man-lion avatar Narasimha is described to have arisen from Chhinnamasta. A similar list in Mundamala Tantra (pre-16th century) equates Chhinnamasta with the avatar Parshurama.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hinde opposed slavery. Although their parents owned slaves, {{he and his}} {{siblings}} repudiated slavery on religious grounds. Hinde's opposition increased and eventually he and other friends became outspoken critics of the institution in Kentucky, where slavery was commonplace {{in the middle and}} western parts of the state. In the Great Awakening, Methodists were <b>prominent</b> <b>among</b> those who opposed slavery, although they also converted slaves and welcomed them into congregations. In Kentucky Hinde joined other Methodist ministers in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1410s several Fellows of Oriel {{took part in}} the {{disturbances}} accompanying Archbishop Arundel's attempt to stamp out Lollardy in the University; the Lollard belief that religious power and authority came through piety and not through the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, John Wycliffe, had been head of Balliol. Disregarding the Provost's authority, Oriel's Fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor's servants when they attacked his house, and were <b>prominent</b> <b>among</b> the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were serious about living the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially <b>prominent</b> <b>among</b> the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a priest was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E
