50|$|Research done on mice {{in early}} 2009 {{has shown that}} when the neuregulin-1\ErbB <b>post-synaptic</b> <b>receptor</b> genes are deleted, the {{dendritic}} spines of glutamate neurons initially grow, but break down during later development.

This parallels the time delay for symptoms setting in with schizophrenic humans who usually appear to show normal development until early adulthood.|$|E
50|$|The {{probability}} of glutamate making {{contact with a}} <b>post-synaptic</b> AMPA <b>receptor</b> {{is proportional to the}} concentration of both trans-membrane glutamate and <b>post-synaptic</b> AMPA <b>receptors.</b> When glutamate and <b>post-synaptic</b> AMPA <b>receptors</b> interact, the <b>post-synaptic</b> cell experiences a temporary depolarizing current, known as an EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential). Spatial and temporal accumulation of EPSPs at the post-synaptic neuron increases the likelihood of the neuron firing an action potential. Therefore, the concentrations of extra-cellular glutamate (and other cations) and the quantity of <b>post-synaptic</b> AMPA <b>receptors</b> are directly correlated to a neurons' action potential firing rate. Some theories suggest each neuron uses calcium-dependent cellular sensors to detect their own action potential firing rate. These sensors also formulate input for cell-specific homeostatic plasticity regulation systems. In synaptic scaling, neurons use this information to determine a scale factor. Each neuron subsequently uses the scaling factor to globally scale (either up-regulate or down-regulate) the quantity of transmembrane AMPA <b>receptors</b> at all <b>post-synaptic</b> sites.|$|R
50|$|Many {{molecules}} {{have been}} implicated in synaptic plasticity. Notably, AMPA and NMDA receptors are key molecules in mechanisms of long and short-term potentiation between neurons. NMDA receptors can detect local activity due to activation and therefore modify signaling in the post-synaptic cell. The increased activity and coordination between pre- and <b>post-synaptic</b> <b>receptors</b> leads to more permanent changes and therefore result in plasticity. Hebb’s postulate addresses this fact by stating that synaptic terminals are strengthened by correlated activity and will therefore sprout new branches. However, terminals that experience weakened and minimal activity will eventually lose their synaptic connection and deteriorate.|$|R

In an attempt to simulate the physicochemical conditions of the synaptic cleft, 15 N-labelled enkephalin has been studied in polyacrylamide gels swollen by different aqueous solutions in the temperature range 273 – 293 K.

50|$|Palinopsia {{can occur}} from {{posterior}} visual pathway (post-geniculate) deafferentation, which causes homonymous visual field deficits. This mechanism {{is thought to}} be similar to the deafferentation hyperexcitability seen in visual release hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome), which are distinguished from palinopsia by whether the formed image or scene previously occurred. It is hypothesized that deafferentation hyperexcitability is the cause of neuropathic pain. Molecular changes from deafferentation include an increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicles and heightened <b>post-synaptic</b> <b>receptor</b> sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, {{amphetamine}} {{enters the}} presynaptic neuron directly through the neuronal membrane or through monoamine transporters, competing for reuptake with neurotransmitters. Once inside, it binds to TAAR1 or enters synaptic vesicles through VMAT2. When amphetamine binds to TAAR1, it reduces <b>post-synaptic</b> <b>receptor</b> firing rate and triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling, resulting in transporter phosphorylation. Phosphorylated transporters then either operate in reverse or withdraw into the presynaptic neuron and cease transport. When amphetamine enters the synaptic vesicles through VMAT2, monoamines are {{released into the}} cytosol.|$|E

This theory supports the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. Another study in 2009 by Simon Fraser University researchers identifies a link between autism and schizophrenia: [...] "The SFU group found that variations in four sets of genes are related to both autism and schizophrenia.

50|$|Agmatine {{has been}} {{discussed}} as a putative neurotransmitter. It is synthesized in the brain, stored in synaptic vesicles, accumulated by uptake, released by membrane depolarization, and inactivated by agmatinase. Agmatine binds to α2-adrenergic receptor and imidazoline receptor binding sites, and blocks NMDA receptors and other cation ligand-gated channels.

5000|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} cannabinoid receptor stimulation on neurotransmitter release have caused this {{system to be}} connected to various forms of depressant plasticity. A recent study conducted with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis found that the endurance of the depressant effects was mediated by two different signaling pathways based on the type of receptor activated. 2-AG was found to act on presynaptic CB1 receptors to mediate retrograde short-term depression (STD) following activation of L-type calcium currents, while anandamide was synthesized after mGluR5 activation and triggered autocrine signalling onto postsynapic TRPV1 receptors that induced long-term depression (LTD). Similar <b>post-synaptic</b> <b>receptor</b> dependencies were found in the striatum, but here both effects relied on presynaptic CB1 receptors.

40|$|CBA/CaJ is a mouse {{strain that}} has no known genetic {{mutations}} affecting the inner ear, thereby serving as a control model for auditory and vestibular aging. C 57 BL/ 6 J and CE/J mouse strains carry the genetic mutation Cdh 23753 A (Ahl), which results in early-onset, age-related hearing loss. CBA/CaJ and CE/J mice both exhibit an age-related decline in gravity receptor function, with function declining at a considerably faster rate in the CE/J strain than in the CBA/CaJ strain. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice exhibit minimal declines in gravity receptor function with age. The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize the effect of age on three structures within the utricle of the inner ear; hair cells, synaptic ribbons, and <b>post-synaptic</b> <b>receptor</b> sites - all of which are critical to sensory transduction, and compare structural aging with gravity receptor functional data across the lifespan. Utricles were dissected, stained with CtBP 2 (marker for hair cell nuclei and synaptic ribbons) and Shank 1 a (marker for <b>post-synaptic</b> <b>receptor</b> sites), and imaged using confocal microscopy. Structures were quantified and averaged over four distinct areas of the utricle at several age points across the lifespan. For the CBA/CaJ strain, the number of hair cells and CtBP 2 per hair cell declined by the oldest age group while Shank 1 a and synaptic colocalization counts per hair cell remained relatively stable across the lifespan. All structures measured for the C 57 BL/ 6 J and CE/J strains were maintained with age. When compared with aging gravity receptor functional data, structural results for the CBA/CaJ and C 57 BL/ 6 J strains were relatively consistent with their corresponding function. Maintenance of structural elements as observed for CE/J mice is disparate from severe age-related gravity receptor dysfunction observed for this strain. Overall, results suggest that presynaptic elements may play a role in normal age-related gravity receptor dysfunction while the presence of Ahl does not appear to result in a significant loss of vestibular structure with age. Additional influences must be responsible for age-related declines in gravity receptor function observed in the CE/J strain.   Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that critical molecules in neurotrophic signaling cascades are long-term targets for currently available monoaminergic antidepressants. As chronic and severe mood disorders are characterized by impairments in neuronal resilience, pharmacological strategies that subserve a neuroprotective function might alter disorder pathophysiology and modify disease progression.

40|$|Short-term {{synaptic}} plasticity may dramatically influence neuronal information transfer, yet {{the underlying mechanisms}} remain incompletely understood. In autapses (self-synapses) formed by cultured hippocampal neurons, short-term synaptic depression (STD) had several unusual features. (1) Reduction of neurotransmitter release probability with Cd 2 �, a blocker of voltage-gated calcium channels, did not change depression. (2) Lowering [Ca 2 �] o and/or raising [Mg 2 �] o {{had little effect on}} STD in cells with strong baseline depression, but in cells with more modest baseline depression, it reduced the depression.

These findings were inconsistent with release-dependent mechanisms, such as vesicle depletion, <b>post-synaptic</b> <b>receptor</b> desensitization, and autoreceptor inhibition. Instead, other results suggested that changes in action potentials (APs) contributed to depression. The somatic APs declined in amplitude with repetitive stimulation, and modest reduction of AP amplitudes with tetrodotoxin inhibited EPSCs. Notably, tetrodotoxin also increased depression.
