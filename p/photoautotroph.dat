25|$|The {{presence}} of oxygen on Earth from its first production by cyanobacteria to the GOE and through today has drastically impacted {{the course of}} evolution of life and planet. It may have triggered the formation of oxidized minerals and the disappearance of oxidizable minerals like pyrite from ancient stream beds. The {{presence of}} banded-iron formations (BIFs) have been interpreted as a clue for the rise of oxygen since small amounts of oxygen could have reacted with reduced ferrous iron (Fe(II)) in the oceans, resulting in the deposition of sediments containing Fe(III) oxide in places like Western Australia. However, any oxidizing environment, including that provided by microbes such as the iron-oxidizing <b>photoautotroph</b> Rhodopseudomonas palustris, can trigger iron oxide formation and thus BIF deposition. Other mechanisms include oxidation by UV light. Indeed, BIFs occur across large swaths of Earth’s history and may not correlate with only one event.|$|E

Chlorophyll z can also be found in very small quantities in the green sulfur bacteria, an anaerobic <b>photoautotroph.</b> These organisms use bacteriochlorophyll and some chlorophyll a but do not produce oxygen.

50|$|Dmitri {{thought that}} the primary {{production}} {{can be broken down}} into gross and net primary production. Gross primary production {{is a measure of the}} energy that a <b>photoautotroph</b> harvests from the sun. Take, for example, a blade of grass that takes in x Joules of energy from the sun. The fraction of that energy that is converted into glucose reflects the gross productivity of the blade of grass. The energy remaining after respiration is considered the net primary production. In general, gross production refers to the energy contained within an organism before respiration and net production the energy after respiration. The terms can be used to describe energy transfer in both autotrophs and heterotrophs.|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} shows that microbial arsenic metabolism probably extends {{back to the}} anoxic primordial Earth. As(+5) produced by anoxygenic photosynthesis might have created niches for primordial Earth's first As(+5)-respiring prokaryotes. In microbial biofilms growing on the rock surfaces of anoxic brine pools fed by hot springs containing arsenite and sulfide at high concentrations, light-dependent oxidation of arsenite (+3) to arsenate (+5) was discovered occurring under anoxic conditions. A pure culture of a photosynthetic bacterium grew as a <b>photoautotroph</b> when As(+3) {{was used as the}} sole photosynthetic electron donor. The strain contained genes supposedly encoding a As(+5) reductase. However, no detectable homologs of the As(+3) oxidase genes of aerobic chemolithotrophs, suggesting a reverse functionality for the reductase.|$|E

50|$|Autotrophs can be <b>photoautotrophs</b> or chemoautotrophs. Phototrophs use {{light as}} an energy source, while chemotrophs use {{electron}} donors {{as a source}} of energy, whether from organic or inorganic sources; however in the case of autotrophs, these electron donors come from inorganic chemical sources. Such chemotrophs are lithotrophs. Lithotrophs use inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, ammonium and ferrous iron, as reducing agents for biosynthesis and chemical energy storage. <b>Photoautotrophs</b> and lithoautotrophs use a portion of the ATP produced during photosynthesis or the oxidation of inorganic compounds to reduce NADP+ to NADPH to form organic compounds.|$|R

50|$|Cyanobacteria {{found in}} {{sedimentary}} rocks {{shows that the}} bacteria started life on Earth during the Pre-Cambrian age. Fossilized cyanobacteria are commonly found in rocks that date back to Mesoproterozoic. Cyanobacteria are <b>photoautotroph</b> in nature; meaning they convert carbon dioxide and absorbed sunlight into food and energy via photosynthesis. They are also able to fix atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into the biologically-usable form (Paerl, Pinkney and Steppe, 2000). This gives them competitive advantage over other organisms that may be limited by the shortage of biologically available nitrogen. The cyanobacteria colonies contain two types of cells, the regular cells with chlorophyll carrying out the photosynthesis, and heterocysts which fix nitrogen. Heterocysts have thick walls and lack chlorophyll, both of which limits the exposure of heterocysts to oxygen which presence inhibits nitrogen fixation. For the same reason nitrogen fixation may be limited to night time when with the shutdown of photosynthesis in the photosynthetic cells, oxygen is no longer produced and therefore does not interfere with nitrogen fixation.|$|E
5000|$|A {{classic example}} of co-{{evolution}} is the evolution of oxygen-producing photosynthetic cyanobacteria which oxygenated Earth's Archean atmosphere. The ancestors of cyanobacteria began using water as an electron source to harness {{the energy of the}} sun and expelling oxygen before or during the early Paleoproterozoic. During this time, around 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago, geologic data suggests that atmospheric oxygen began to rise in what is termed the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE). It is unclear for how long cyanobacteria had been doing oxygenic photosynthesis before the GOE. Some evidence suggests there were geochemical [...] "buffers" [...] or sinks suppressing the rise of oxygen such as volcanism though cyanobacteria may have been around producing it before the GOE. Other evidence indicates that the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis was coincident with the GOE.The presence of oxygen on Earth from its first production by cyanobacteria to the GOE and through today has drastically impacted the course of evolution of life and planet. It may have triggered the formation of oxidized minerals and the disappearance of oxidizable minerals like pyrite from ancient stream beds.

30|$|Due to the {{inability}} to tolerate the high salinity (Tonk et al. 2007), the freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis species in the colony {{was replaced by the}} euryhaline cyanobacterium S. sp.

The replacement of <b>photoautotroph</b> in the micro-community has the following advantages: (i) S. sp. PCC 7002 is naturally transformable, making easier molecular genetic operation (Stevens and Porter 1980; Frigaard et al. 2004); (ii) The doubling time for the species is comparably short under optimal conditions (Ludwig and Bryant 2012); Based on these superior characteristics, the coculture system established here provides a useful model to study the microbial interaction between cyanobacteria and bacteria, and the mechanisms for mediating the high salinity in a cooperated way.

40|$|Life {{has evolved}} to exploit aquatic and {{terrestrial}} environments, but these present very different {{challenges and opportunities}} for <b>photoautotrophs.</b> This paper outlines how the physical and chemical ‘fitness’ of air and water have interacted with {{the evolution of the}} physical structures and physiological properties of aquatic and terrestrial algae and plants and altered the biogeochemistry of the planet. The two environments are particularly different for photosynthesis and the consequences of water stress in air and potential carbon and light stress under water are discussed, as are the consequences of the lower density of air compared to water for investment in support. The properties of air and water also affect mineral nutrition, reproduction and dispersal of <b>photoautotrophs</b> and the nature of competition between different types of plants. Furthermore, the pivotal role of <b>photoautotrophs</b> in global biogeochemical cycles and major feedbacks are emphasized. They have altered the environment dramatically, changed the availability of essential resources and created niches that can be exploited by new or different species or types of organism. Recent rapid anthropogenic changes, particularly in CO 2, are noted and discussed in relation to the security of human requirements...|$|R

5|$|Plant {{physiology}} encompasses all {{the internal}} chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals {{obtained from the}} air, soil and water {{form the basis of}} all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. <b>Photoautotrophs,</b> including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by <b>photoautotrophs</b> and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.|$|R

Similar {{results have been}} reported for the haptophyte Prymnesium parvum (Rahat and Jahn 1965) and marine cryptomonad Chroomonas salina (Antia et al. 1973); these algae can grow heterotrophically with 250  mM exogenous glycerol. However, ecologically speaking, these algae {{are considered to be}} obligate photoautotrophs because very high concentrations of glycerol do not normally exist in their natural habitat (Droop 1974).

30|$|Intertidal {{photosynthetic}} microbial mats {{from the}} Wadden Sea island Schiermonnikoog were examined for microscale (millimetre) spatial distributions of viruses, prokaryotes and oxygenic <b>photoautotrophs</b> (filamentous cyanobacteria and benthic diatoms) {{at different times}} of the year. Abundances of viruses and prokaryotes were among the highest found in benthic systems (0.05 – 5.43 × 1010 viruses g− 1 and 0.05 – 2.14 × 1010 prokaryotes g− 1). The spatial distribution of viruses, prokaryotes and oxygenic <b>photoautotrophs</b> were highly heterogeneous at mm scales. The vertical distributions of both prokaryotic and viral abundances were related to the depth of the oxygenic photoautotrophic layer, implying that the photosynthetic mat fuelled the microbial processes in the underlying layer. Our data suggest that viruses could make an important component in these productive environments potentially affecting the biodiversity and nutrient cycling within the mat.|$|R
50|$|While {{almost all}} {{phytoplankton}} species are obligate <b>photoautotrophs,</b> {{there are some}} that are mixotrophic and other, non-pigmented species that are actually heterotrophic (the latter are often viewed as zooplankton).

30|$|In aquatic environments, it is {{technically}} difficult to rigorously separate autotrophs (i.e., algae and cyanobacteria) from heterotrophs and detritus. Consequently, the carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of {{particulate organic matter}} (POM) have long been substituted for those of <b>photoautotrophs</b> in surface water. However, these records must {{be more or less}} overprinted by the isotopic signatures of the detritus from other organisms. Therefore, the isotopic compositions of chlorophylls are useful for more accurately characterizing the isotopic signatures of primary photosynthates. Chlorophylls are abundantly produced only by <b>photoautotrophs</b> and contain four nitrogen atoms. The biochemical processes of chlorophyll synthesis in the photoautotrophic cell have been studied intensively (e.g., Beale 1995). This strong research background is an advantage when interpreting the isotopic signatures of chlorophylls (Katase and Wada 1990; Ohkouchi et al. 2006, 2008), although the number of applications of this technique is still limited.|$|R
