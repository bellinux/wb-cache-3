40|$|Barrier creams and barrier creams with {{antifungal}} agents {{both are}} effective treatments of diaper dermatitis. Fungal yeast {{is present in}} over 90 % of diaper rashes, but {{is not necessarily the}} causative agent. In mild cases, antifungal agents may not perform better than barrier creams alone. In moderate to severe cases, patients will likely benefit from using an antifungal agent. For patients at increased risk for diaper dermatitis, such as those with diarrhea, taking oral antibiotics, wearing low-absorbance diaper material, better prevention may be possible using barrier cream with antifungal. In all cases, diaper dermatitis is best dealt with by following the ABCDEs: Air exposure –allow the diapered area to air dry, don’t over-tighten the diaper, allow naked nap time on a towel when possible Barrier cream – zinc oxide or petroleum, reapply with every diaper change, creams with antifungal agents may be better in severe rashes or when yeast infection is suspected Cleanliness – frequent diaper changes and baths, <b>pat</b> <b>dry</b> with a towel or air dry, avoid wipes with alcohol or scent Diaper changes – frequent changes, the less time spent in a dirty diaper the betterespecially with loose stools or low-absorbance diapers Education – teach caregivers about care of diapered chil...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Phosphate esters {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in any organism. Nucleic acids, metabolic intermediates like glucose- 6 -phosphate, energy-rich substrates (AMP, creatine phosphate) are some obvious examples. While many metabolic intermediates are activated through {{the transfer of}} phosphate groups (e. g., by kinases) it is equally important that phosphate esters can also be rapidly broken down. The hydrolytic removal of phosphate groups from phosphoesters is catalyzed by phosphatases. Many phosphatases are highly substrate-specific, like those enzymes involved in signal transduction. A number of phosphatases, however, cleave virtually any phosphate ester. Such unspecific enzymes function mainly in the catabolic breakdown of metabolites or nutrients. Depending on the pH at which such phosphatases have optimal activity, we distinguish between acidic phosphatases (also called acid phosphatases) and alkaline phosphatases. The latter enzymes require divalent metal ions as cofactors and are common in animal tissues and bacteria. Acidic phosphatases are widely distributed in many organisms, including plants. They work optimally at ~ pH 5 without additional cofactors. The enzymes are classified as E. C. 3. 1. 3. 2. In this experiment, we will extract an acidic phosphatase from seedlings of mustard (Sinapis alba) and partially purifiy the enzyme by ammonium sulfate precipiation. Most important prerequisite for any enzyme isolation is an activity test. For this phosphatase, we {{take advantage of the}} broad substrate specificity and use an artificial substrate that changes its color after hydrolytic removal of the phosphate group: ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") Since the phosphatase is active only at acidic pH values, but p-nitrophenol is colored at basic pH values, we must change the pH following the enzyme reaction. We will incubate for 30 min at pH 4. 8, and then stop the reaction by adding NaOH. ### EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL **Week 1 - Day 1 ** You are provided with a flat of 5 - 8 days old mustard seedlings grown in the dark in a bed of vermiculite. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") 1. Remove the 5 - 10 cm long seedlings from the vermiculite, wash and <b>pat</b> <b>dry</b> on paper towel. Weigh and record the weight. (use 25 - 50 g). ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") 2. Grind in a mortar with 75 ml of ice-cold water. 3. Make the volume up to 150 ml and transfer the slurry into the Polytron homogenizer. Homogenize 1 min at speed 5 (3 x 20 sec). 4. Filter the homogenate through 8 layers of cheese cloth into a cold beaker on ice. Remove 1 ml aliquot to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, and label as HOM and leave on ice. 5. Transfer the extract into one 250 ml centrifuge bottle. Balance against water or, if ready, against the extract of the other group. Always keep the extract on ice. 6. Centrifuge in the Sorvall superspeed centrifuge (B 7202) in GSA rotor (r = 12. 5 cm) at 9500 rpm (1, 000 x g) for 30 min. 7. Decant the supernatant (SN 1) (contains many organelles and the cytosol) into a graduated cylinder and note the volume. Remove 1 ml aliquot to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, and label as SN 1 and leave on ice. This will be used for subsequent protein and activity determination. Later freeze at - 20 °C. Resuspend the pellet which contains the cell debris and nuclei in 10 ml water, and take a 1 ml sample labeled P 1. Discard the remaining pellet. 8. Weigh the amount of solid (NH 4) 2 SO 4 required (0. 25 g/ml of solution SN 1). Record this amount. Leave the supernatant in a 250 ml beaker on ice bath and place on a magnetic stirrer. 9. Insert a clean stirring bar and using a spatula add small amounts of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 while stirring. This yields a [40 % saturated solution]([URL] which precipitates some proteins, but not the phosphatase. 10. Precipitate these proteins after 1 h by centrifugation in 50 ml centrifuge tube (approx. 35 ml per tube) at 31, 000 x g ([estimate the rpm]([URL] value using the rotor radius) for 30 min in the Hermle centrifuge at 4 °C (room B 8220). 11. Decant the supernatant (SN 2) into a grad. cylinder and note the volume. Remove 1 ml aliquot to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, label as SN 2 and leave on ice. Resuspend the pellet in 2 - 3 ml of ice cold water. Label as P 2 and freeze at - 20 °C. 12. To the supernatant, add another 0. 25 g (NH 4) 2 SO 4 /ml of the original volume of SN 1 while stirring slowly. The solution is now [70 % saturated]([URL] This should be stirred at least for 1 hour or you can leave this in the cold room while stirring overnight. **Day 2 ** 13. The next morning, transfer the suspension to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and spin for 30 min at the speed as in step 9. 14. Decant the supernatant (SN 3) and leave an aliquot (1 ml) in a microfuge tube. Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of cold distilled water. Most of the phosphatase activity should be contained in this pellet. Take an aliquot (0. 5 ml) labeled P 3. 15. Divide among 4 microfuge tubes and remove insoluble proteins by spinning in the microfuge at full speed for 2 min. 16. Carefully transfer the supernatant into four eppendorf tubes. Label as SN 4. 17. Leave all the aliquots in a beaker with your initials on it in the - 20 °C freezer. You will use these fractions for further analysis ([see flow scheme]([URL] ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") All fractions will be subjected to a [protein]([URL] and [enzyme assay]([URL]...|$|E

50|$|Larger yellow dung flies have a {{competitive}} advantage. Therefore, body size plasticity {{must be a}} survival mechanism. Offspring of large adults still survive under food limitations, despite needing more nutrients for a longer development. Thus, the observed growth plasticity {{is a result of}} altering body chemistry and not differing survival rates of offspring from small and large parents. Plastic development rate and body size are effective at avoiding premature death, meaning S. stercoraria adopts a strategy of being small and alive over large and dead. Smaller flies have an advantage in stressful environmental situations, due to larger dung flies needing more energy. Additionally, low genetic differentiation exists between yellow dung fly populations, likely due to extensive gene flow, as S. stercoraria is able to travel great distances. When species are unable to adapt through genetics, phenotypic plasticity is the most viable option to adjust to changing environments. Yellow dung flies develop in extremely variable environments, with <b>pat</b> <b>drying,</b> dung availability, and larval competition hindering survival. Therefore, phenotypic plasticity allows S. stercoraria to adjust development according to unpredictable ecological situations without genetic adaptation.|$|R

In brief, the wheat seeds with sterilization treatment were germinated on wet filter paper for 7  days, and then fifty seedlings were transferred to 1  L glass beakers containing half-concentrated Hoagland’s solution (Lin and Xing 2008) for further growth at 25  °C and a lighting period of 16  h per day. When their roots reached 8  ±  1  cm, and leaves grew 10  ±  1  cm, these seedlings were transferred to an exposure apparatus containing half-concentrated Hoagland’s solution with each of PFCAs at 1  μg/mL for the study of PFCA uptake induced by salinity and temperature. After the wheat was grown for five days in nutrient solution at different salinities (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4  %) or different temperatures (20, 25 and 30  °C), they were harvested at a time. The harvested wheat was divided into shoots and roots which were washed in deionized water to remove any external salt or PFCA residues and <b>patted</b> <b>dry</b> with a paper towel, and stored at − 20  °C until extraction.

Each fish was placed on plastic wrap liners in acid-rinsed {{dissecting}} pan for inspection. Weights and lengths were recorded followed by a count of lateral line scales to differentiate between longnose (C. catostomus) and white suckers (C. commersonii). After initial inspection, each fish was returned to the dissecting pan, an incision {{was made in the}} vent towards the head using stainless steel scissors to determine whether each fish was a gravid female, non-gravid female or male. From each of the 11 gravid females collected, ovaries, samples of skin, epaxial muscle and livers were removed and each positioned in individual weighing boats then placed in a Thelco model M drying cabinet at a temperature of 32  °C for 20  days. The wet to dry ratios of the 44 whole body homogenates averaged 0.267, a value close to the ratios of 0.284 for trout and 0.288 for non-game fishes reported by Fresquez and Ferenbaugh (1999). Therefore, all values of Se and Hg in the whole bodies of fish tissues are reported as wet weights by multiplying dry weights by a factor of 0.267. However, for the 44 individual tissues in the 11 gravid females, individual conversion factors were calculated for each ovary, skin, epaxial muscle and liver tissue.

30|$|Over 200 new {{external}} fixators {{are placed}} annually {{at the senior}} authors’ institution; the management of pin sites and pin site infections {{is an essential part}} of daily clinical practice. The prevention of infection protocol includes the following: intravenous antibiotics are given prior to skin incision and continued for 24 post-operatively; no tourniquet is used; and pins are inserted after pre-drilling with sharp drills using sleeves to protect soft tissues. Electrocautery is avoided at pin sites to prevent tissue necrosis. HA-coated tapered pins with cortical threads are used exclusively. For most applications, 6.0 -mm-diameter pins are used; however, 4.5 -mm pins are used in adult foot and forearm cases and for paediatric patients. Pin diameter is ensured to be < 33  % of the bone diameter. Pin site care starts on POD 2. Pin care is done once daily by cleaning each pin site with a new sterile cotton-tipped applicator that has been soaked in a solution of 1 : 1 hydrogen peroxide and normal saline. Dry sterile gauze is wrapped around each pin site. Daily showering is encouraged on POD 4 where the patients remove the dressings, allowing water to rinse the frame and use of an antibacterial liquid soap. The leg and frame are <b>patted</b> <b>dry</b> with a clean towel. Patients are allowed to swim in a chlorinated pool after 4  weeks. Most patients are allowed weight bearing as tolerated.

40|$|International audienceOur {{knowledge}} of Escherichia coli (E. coli) ecology {{in the field}} is very limited in the case of dairy alpine grassland soils. Here, our objective was to monitor field survival of E. coli in cow pats and underlying soils in four different alpine pasture units, and to determine whether the soil could constitute an environmental reservoir. E. coli was enumerated by MPN using a selective medium. E. coli survived well in cow pats (10 (7) to 10 (8) cells g(- 1) <b>dry</b> <b>pat),</b> but cow pats disappeared within about 2 mo. In each pasture unit, constant levels of E. coli (10 (3) to 10 (4) cells g(- 1) dry soil) were recovered from all topsoil (0 - 5 cm) samples regardless of the sampling date, that is, under the snow cover, immediately after snow melting, or during the pasture season (during and after the decomposition of pats). In deeper soil layers below the root zone (5 - 25 cm), E. coli persistence varied according to soil type, with higher numbers recovered in poorly-drained soils (10 (3) to 10 (4) cells g(- 1) dry soil) than in well-drained soils (< 10 (2) cells g(- 1) dry soil).

Although experimental analysis of the embryo and larva is extensive and the morphology has been well documented, descriptions of adult zebrafish anatomy and studies of development of the adult structures and organs, together with techniques for working with adults are lacking. The organs of the larva undergo significant changes in their overall structure, morphology, and anatomical location during the larval to adult transition. Externally, the transparent larva develops its characteristic adult striped pigment pattern and paired pelvic fins, while internally, the organs undergo massive growth and remodeling.

50|$|The Summerhill Borough Volunteer Fire Company #1 was {{chartered}} May 19, 1952. Inaugural officers included President Arthur Apple, Vice President George Bodenschatz, Second Vice President Felix Bopp, Secretary Cecil Bopp, and Treasurer Clement Bodenschatz.The original members saw a need {{to raise}} money to build a station and to purchase equipment and supplies for fire protection. In August 1952, the members started monthly 50-50 ticket sales as a fundraiser.In 1953, the company purchased a lot from Alex Betz for $600 which would be the site of the first Summerhill Borough fire station in 1956. The building still stands today as the Summerhill Borough Municipal Building.The department held its first major fundraiser in 1955 when it chanced off a 1955 Plymouth station wagon. Ticket sales brought in $3,475, a profit of $480.In 1958, after several years of planning, the fire company finally received its first pieces of firefighting equipment, a 1924 American LaFrance pumper from the Wilmore Fire Department, for $350. In addition to the pumper, the Brownstown Fire Department donated a Buick ambulance to the department {{to be used as a}} squad truck. Shortly after this, Summerhill Borough became an active fire department.Before Summerhill had its own fire department, fire protection was provided by the South Fork Volunteer Fire Company at no charge to the residents of Summerhill. In March 1958, the South Fork Fire Company, who also provided fire protection to South Fork Borough and parts of Croyle Township, realized the South Fork taxpayers were assuming too great of a burden in order to service all three of these municipalities. Thus, a new plan was devised for a better method of underwriting operational costs.The plan was based on the assessed valuation of properties at 1.5 mills. Summerhill Borough agreed to pay about $500 per year for fire protection. This agreement lasted only one year. In March 1959, the Summerhill Fire Department notified South Fork Borough council that they would handle their own fire protection and respond to any and all emergencies in Summerhill Borough. In that same year, the department joined the Cambria County Volunteer Firemen’s Association.Over the next few years, the department grew and many changes occurred. Seeing the need for improvements, the department made various equipment purchases. In 1961, the department purchased a 1946 Chevrolet pumper from Paul W. Miller for $4,000. A used siren, a new portable pump, and boots and helmets (which were the closest things to turnout gear then) were all purchased in 1963. Soon thereafter, the department bought a 1952 squad truck from Portage Volunteer Fire Company for $350 to carry personnel and equipment to scenes in a safe manner.Because the department had better vehicles and equipment, the members decided that the station needed attention. The department paid $1,700 to renovate the station in 1965 and held an open house in October of that year to show the community the improvements that were made.Due to the increase of rural fire calls and a poor water system in the borough, the department decided in 1966 to purchase a 1,000-gallon Chevrolet tanker from Wilfred Kibler for $550.Charles Huber relieved Jay Bimle as president in January 1968. In September 1971, the department purchased their first self-contained breathing apparatus. They were made by Survive-Air, and cost the company $352 each. These SCBA allowed the personnel to enter burning buildings and attack the fire from within for extended periods of time, replacing previously-used gas masks.The first milestone for the department came in 1972 when the members agreed to purchase their first new fire engine from Paul Miller Fire Equipment. The cab and chassis was purchased from E.L. Jones Dodge of Summerhill for $6,885. The chassis was shipped to Tipton, Indiana, where the John Bean division of the FMC Company manufactured the body at a cost of $18,742. The engine was put into service in January 1973.The Croyle Township Supervisors awarded the department with a contract in April 1973 to provide fire protection to all of Croyle Township north of Route 53 for $350 per year. This area includes New Germany, Rose Hill, Pringle Hill, and Swigle Mountain Road. The department continues to provide fire protection to these areas today.Another change was brought to the department in 1974. Due to the increasing decline of memberships, the department allowed 16-and-17-year-olds to become junior firefighters. In that same year, the department purchased two additional SCBAs for $620 each, bringing the total SCBAs to four.The company purchased its first radio equipment in 1975. This equipment included a base station from the Westwood Fire Company and three mobile radios from the Dale Fire Company. In that same year, the department purchased a new Chevrolet Suburban for $5,946, which lead to the sale of the 1952 squad truck to the Wilmore Fire Department for $250. The 1975 Suburban served as our rescue truck for 17 years until it was replaced in 1992 by a 1980 GMC/SWAB rescue. It lasted for another six years as our squad truck until finally being sold to a private owner.In February 1976, the company purchased 1000 feet of 4-inch hose, one of the first departments in the county to move to large-diameter hose. This decision was made due to the increasing building construction in our coverage area and it also brought down insurance costs to the residents.After months of planning, in an effort to reduce costs through group purchasing and to reduce the duplication of equipment in the area, the Forest Hills Fire Association was formed in December 1976. The Association members were Dunlo, South Fork, St. Michael, Summerhill Borough, Summerhill Township (Beaverdale), and Wilmore.Major flooding occurred on July 20, 1977, in parts of Cambria County, including Summerhill Borough. At the height of the storm, a pickup truck was washed downstream by the raging flood currents after a bridge washed out. Tom Bodenschatz, without due regard for his own personal safety, rescued the sole occupant of the truck. For his unselfish act, Tom was awarded the only honorary life membership for action from the department. The borough did suffer the loss of one life as a result of the flood.In September 1977, a truck committee was formed to look at and plan for the future purchase of a fire engine. The company didn’t want, or need, to rush into this project, so the committee carefully looked at numerous types of engines from various companies and dealers. In September 1979, the company agreed to purchase a 1980 American LaFrance from William Sprowls at a cost of $89,000.To help defray the cost of the engine, a monthly sub sale was started in August 1979. This sale is still a valuable fundraiser today and continues to be held on the second Saturday of every month.The Sector 8 Air Association was formed to purchase a “regional” air compressor in May 1980. Summerhill Borough, along with Beaverdale, Dunlo, St. Michael, South Fork, and Wilmore Fire Departments formed the association. In later years, the association went on to buy a 6-bottle cascade for the system and, more recently, upgraded to a high-pressure system.Also in 1980, Treasurer Paul Bimle resigned after 29 years of service. Larry Wilburn took over this office and still holds it today.Looking to the future, the department purchased the land adjacent to the fire station in July 1983. This purchase allowed for the planning of a new, larger fire station.In 1984, Summerhill was elected to host the 1986 Cambria County Firemen’s Convention and Charles Huber was elected as Second Vice-President of the association.From July 26 - Aug. 3, 1986, Summerhill hosted the 65th Annual Convention of the Volunteer Firemen’s Association of Cambria County and Vicinity. During the convention, the department appointed new honorary life members. They were Paul Bimle, Ed Bodenschatz, Jack Bodenschatz, Charles Huber, Ed Huber, Vince Kitchick, and Jack Wilburn.In March 1987, the department purchased the first hydraulic rescue system in the Forest Hills area when an AMKUS system was purchased from Kaza Fire Equipment. Prior to this tool being put into service, the area departments had to rely either on the Portage or Dauntless Fire Companies for a hydraulic tool.With a new-found interest in fire fighting once again on the rise in the Forest Hills area, our department, in conjunction with Harrisburg Area Community College and the Cambria County Department of Emergency Services, sponsored an Essentials of Fire Fighting class. Over 25 students participated in this course, with four from our department.A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on May 1, 1994, to open the new fire station. Guests included Cambria County Commissioner Kathy Holtzman and State Representative Ed Haluska. Cub Scout Pack 53 raised the flag at the station for the first time. The cost of construction was nearly $350,000.The Cambria County Firemen’s Convention came back to Summerhill in 1999 when the borough hosted the 78th annual event.Also in 1999, with age again creeping up on our apparatus, another truck committee was formed to start looking into replacing our rescue with a new vehicle. The committee looked at several models and styles, and decided HME would best serve our needs. Bids were sent out for construction. The contract was given to 4-Guys, Inc. of Meyersdale for $250,000. In January 2001, we took delivery of a 16 ft, non walk-in rescue built on an HME 1250 SFO chassis.2002 marked the 50th anniversary of the Summerhill Boro Fire Department. A dinner was held at the Imperial Room in Ebensburg to commemorate the event. All members, both past and present, along with members of the community who routinely help with our events were invited. Guest speakers were Charles Moyer, the Mayor of Ebensburg Boro, and Representative Gary Haluska from Patton. The women’s auxiliary, who has always worked hard to support the fire department, presented us with a gift that we had been working for… a thermal imaging camera. New honorary life members were also presented at the dinner. They were Linda Bodenschatz, Ron Parks and Larry Penatzer.The morning of Monday, February 9, 2004, brought tragedy to the department with the death of Charles Huber. Charlie was starting his 36th year as president of the department and died in the Summerhill home he grew up in. Greg Madison was elected president - only the fourth president in the department’s 52-year history.New leadership came to the department in January 2005 when Dan Penatzer was elected our fifth president. Greg Madison was retained as the vice president.The Assistance to Firefighters Federal Grant Program awarded the department a grant for $251,750 in August 2005. In late September, the truck committee started plans to replace the 1973 Dodge John Bean pumper.Tragedy struck the department again on October 23, 2005, when former assistant chief and life member Robert “Newt” Gallardy was injured in a training class at the Pennsylvania State Fire Academy in Lewistown. Bob was an instructor in a live burn session when, for an unknown reason, he failed to exit the building. Students found him unconscious on the basement floor. Bob suffered third-degree burns over most of his body and died two days later from his injuries. Bob was a volunteer firefighter with our department from 1975 until 1996 when he was hired by the Altoona City Fire Department, where he had been recently promoted to captain. Bob leaves behind his wife Vicki and sons Drew, Kyle and Derrek.After advertising for bids in August 2006, our department entered into an agreement with Nollie W. Neill Jr of Ennice, NC, to sell him the 1973 Dodge pumper for $5,000. Neill is a collector of Dodge fire trucks, and plans to refurbish it and take it to fire truck shows. Bright-and-early on the morning of Oct. 9, Neill arrived at the station to do the paperwork and drive the Dodge back to North Carolina. By 7:00 pm that evening the 73 Dodge Pumper was in Hillsville Virginia for a Fire Prevention Parade, the first of 3 Fire Prevention parades, it did that first week with its new owner.Our department took delivery of a 2006 HME engine on Oct. 13, 2006. The engine has an eight-man cab, 750-gallon tank, and 2000 gpm pump. The engine was placed into service in mid-November in a limited capacity until all its equipment could be purchased and installed.The Assistance to Firefighters Federal Grant Program awarded our department another grant in November 2006, this time for $50,799. This money was put toward equipment for the new engine and updating equipment on the 1980 American LaFrance.In October 2007, through a cooperative effort of Croyle Township, Summerhill Township, New Germany Wood Products and <b>Pat</b> Dumm, a <b>dry</b> hydrant was installed in Dumm’s pond located next to New Germany Wood Products, thus greatly increasing fire protection in New Germany. An access road was created from the business’s parking lot.Also during October 2007, we received a FEMA grant for $89,915. In an effort to complement our existing hydraulic rescue tools, the department purchased a Genesis C-165 cutter for $5,400 from Howell Rescue Systems and an AMKUS 24-inch spreader. We also replaced the arms on our current AMKUS spreader, purchased removable and extended reach tips, and quick chain adjusters. Also purchased were 20 new sets of turnout gear, 29 pairs of gloves, two sets of auto cribbing, accountability tags, 14 flashlights, eight SCBA with spare bottles, and traffic control equipment.After several months of planning, the department ordered a 2008 Ford F-350 pickup truck from Day Chevrolet in Monroeville in December 2007. Keith’s Truck Service in Hollidaysburg then built the body for what would become Utility 864.Charter member Edward “A” Bodenschatz died on April 3, 2008, at Lauralwood Care Center. “A” was a past fire chief, serving in 1972.Utility 864 was placed into service on July 30, 2008. That weekend, it won “Best Appearing Utility/Support Vehicle” at the Cambria County Firemen’s Convention Parade in Clymer.
