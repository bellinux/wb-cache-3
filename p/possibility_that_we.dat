500|$|Because Mackintosh had {{intended}} to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed, the ten stranded men were left with [...] "only the clothes on their backs". [...] Mackintosh [...] summarised their situation: [...] "We {{have to face the}} <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may have to stay here, unsupported, for two years. [...] We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize on what we have, and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather". Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. [...] These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. [...] "Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop" [...] fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco—"Hut Point Mixture"—was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. [...] By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: [...] "Tomorrow we start for Hut Point".|$|E

2500|$|This {{figure was}} {{obtained}} by doubling 78 billion light-years {{on the assumption that}} it is a radius. Because 78 billion light-years is already a diameter (the original paper by Cornish et al. says, [...] "By extending the search to all possible orientations, {{we will be able to}} exclude the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> live in a universe smaller than 24 Gpc in diameter," [...] and 24 Gpc is 78 billion light years), the doubled figure is incorrect. This figure was very widely reported. A press release from Montana State University–Bozeman, where Cornish works as an astrophysicist, noted the error when discussing a story that had appeared in Discover magazine, saying [...] "Discover mistakenly reported that the universe was 156 billion light-years wide, thinking that 78 billion was the radius of the universe instead of its diameter."

[...] The <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were conflating two different composers, [...] "Antonio da Teramo" [...] and [...] "Zacara da Teramo", into one person was removed by research into the composer's life by Agostino Ziino. (Another composer with a similar name, Nicolaus Zacharie, was of the following generation of composers). Antonio's nickname [...] "Zaccara" [...] (or [...] "Zachara"; often regularized in modern editions as [...] "Zacara") probably is a reference to his short stature (he is described as [...] "fuit statura corporis parva" [...] in a 15th-century biography). The name Zacara means a small thing of a thing of little value; hence the reason why Antonio never used the nickname himself and documents produced in circles close to the composer are careful to call him some variation on [...] "Antonius vulgatus dictus Zachara" [...] (Anthony, commonly called Zacara).|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Cornish et al. {{found this}} lower {{bound for the}} {{diameter}} of the whole universe (not just the observable part), if we postulate that the universe is finite in size due to its having a nontrivial topology, with this lower bound based on the estimated current distance between points that we can see {{on opposite sides of the}} cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). If the whole universe is smaller than this sphere, then light has had time to circumnavigate it since the Big Bang, producing multiple images of distant points in the CMBR, which would show up as patterns of repeating circles. Cornish et al. looked for such an effect at scales of up to 24 gigaparsecs (...) and failed to find it, and suggested that if they could extend their search to all possible orientations, they would then [...] "be able to exclude the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> live in a universe smaller than 24 Gpc in diameter". The authors also estimated that with [...] "lower noise and higher resolution CMB maps (from WMAP's extended mission and from Planck), we will be able to search for smaller circles and extend the limit to ~28 Gpc." [...] This estimate of the maximum lower bound that can be established by future observations corresponds to a radius of 14 gigaparsecs, or around 46 billion light years, about the same as the figure for the radius of the visible universe (whose radius is defined by the CMBR sphere) given in the opening section. A 2012 preprint by most of the same authors as the Cornish et al. paper has extended the current lower bound to a diameter of 98.5% {{the diameter of the}} CMBR sphere, or about 26 Gpc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{extraction}} {{of information from}} a source containing termclassified objects is plagued with uncertainty. In the present paper we deal with this uncertainty in a qualitative way. We view an information source as an agent, operating according to an open world philosophy. The agent knows some facts, but is aware {{that there could be}} other facts, compatible with the known ones, that might hold as well, although they are not captured for lack of knowledge. These facts are, indeed, possibilities. We view possibilities as explanations and resort to abduction in order to define precisely the <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want our system to be able to handle. We introduce an operation that extends a taxonomy-based source with possibilities, and then study the property of this operation from a mathematical point of view. ...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{descriptions}} of the anatomy and physiology of individual components of sensorimotor systems have revealed substantial complexity, {{making it difficult to}} intuit how complete systems might work. This has led to increasing efforts to develop and employ mathematical models to study the emergent properties of such systems.

In both cases models are most useful when they point up discrepancies between what we think <b>we</b> know and <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may have overlooked. This overview considers those components of complete sensorimotor systems that currently appear to be potentially important but poorly understood.

This abstracts from the wider economic and societal impacts of energy efficiency improvements that are often positive and valuable to policy makers. Second, <b>we</b> propose <b>that</b> economic expansion and economy-wide rebound need not be highly correlated. <b>We</b> argue <b>that</b> energy efficiency actions targeted at improving the competitiveness of less energy-intensive means of providing services, such as heat and transport, may provide opportunities to boost economic activity while minimising rebound effects.
