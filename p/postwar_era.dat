5|$|In the <b>postwar</b> <b>era,</b> Poland, Spain, and Germany {{developed}} or re-established many well-respected Arabian stud farms. The studs of Poland {{in particular}} were decimated {{by both the}} Nazis and the Soviets, but were able to reclaim some of their breeding stock and became particularly world-renowned for their quality Arabian horses, tested rigorously by racing and other performance standards. During the 1950s, the Russians also obtained additional horses from Egypt to augment their breeding programs.|$|E

5|$|Almost every fighter {{project in}} the <b>postwar</b> <b>era</b> {{immediately}} applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters in the late 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} century, {{veterans}} of America's wars have shown extraordinary human longevity in the <b>postwar</b> <b>eras.</b> As a result, contemporary public historical {{interpretations of the}} American second world war experience {{have been influenced by}} veterans' perceptions of historical issues for a longer time than was true of <b>postwar</b> <b>eras</b> before the twentieth centuıy. Public historical debates in the United States have recently focused on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (1941) and the American attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945). These events may seem quite dated by now, but they have remarkable contemporary resonance in light of debates over proliferation of nuclear weapons and tactics of so-called pre-emptive warfare. Though the aerial attacks are often related in popular American perception, the truth is they were incommensurate events in terms of their military and political objectives, their physical scale and results, and the natures of their targets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{existing}} estimates of prewar gross national product exaggerate the size of cyclical fluctuations. The source of the exaggeration is that the original Kuznets estimates {{are based on the}} assumption that GNP moves one-for-one with commodity output valued at producer prices. New estimates of GNP for 1869 - 1918 are derived using the estimated aggregate relationship between GNP and commodity output for the interwar and <b>postwar</b> <b>eras.</b> The new estimates of GNP indicate that the business cycle is only slightly more severe in the pre-Worid War I era than in the post-World War II era. ...|$|R
5|$|During the <b>postwar</b> <b>era,</b> Indiana {{became a}} {{critical}} swing state that often helped decide which party controlled the presidency. Elections were very close, {{and became the}} center of frenzied attention with many parades, speeches and rallies as election day approached; voter turnout ranging over 90% to near 100% in such elections as 1888 and 1896. In remote areas, both sides paid their supporters to vote, and occasionally paid supporters of the opposition not to vote. Despite allegations, historians have found very little fraud in national elections.|$|E
5|$|With new {{suburban}} developments beckoning, {{many white}} middle-class residents {{moved out of}} the city along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population declined, a pattern repeated in numerous cities during the <b>postwar</b> <b>era</b> independently of segregation issues. In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. The opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>postwar</b> <b>era,</b> the Haflinger was indiscriminately crossed {{with other}} breeds and some {{observers}} feared the breed was in renewed danger of extinction. However, starting in 1946, breeders focused on producing purebred Haflingers and a closed stud book was created. Interest in the breed increased {{in other countries}} and between 1950 and 1974 the population grew, even while the overall European horse population decreased. Population numbers continued to increase steadily and as of 2005, almost 250,000Haflingers existed worldwide. There are breeding farms in several countries, {{although most of the}} breeding stock still comes from Austria. In 2003, a Haflinger became the first horse to be cloned, resulting in a filly named Prometea.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{estimates}} of prewar {{gross national product}} (GNP) exaggerate the size of cycles because {{they are based on}} the assumption that GNP moves approximately one for one with commodity output valued in producer prices. This paper derives new {{estimates of}} GNP for 1869 - 1908 using an estimate of the actual relationship between GNP and commodity output. This estimated relationship is allowed to be time-varying and is derived from a regression covering the periods 1909 - 28 and 1947 - 85. The new estimates of GNP indicate that there has been much less stabilization between the prewar and <b>postwar</b> <b>eras</b> than is conventionally believed.

5|$|Hatfield was {{a popular}} Governor who {{supported}} Oregon's traditional industries of timber and agriculture, but felt that in the <b>postwar</b> <b>era</b> expansion of industry and funding for transportation and education needed to be priorities. While governor he worked to begin the diversification of the state's economy, such as recruiting industrial development and holding trade missions. As part of the initiative, he helped to found the Oregon Graduate Center {{in what is now}} the Silicon Forest in Washington County in 1963. A graduate level school in the Portland area (Portland State was still a college with no graduate programs at this time) was seen by business leaders as essential to attracting new industries and by Tektronix as needed to retain highly skilled workers. In lieu of the standard portrait for former governors, Hatfield is represented by a marble bust at the Oregon State Capitol.|$|E
5|$|Since the Turtle’s {{emergence}} {{over two}} centuries ago, the international playing field has leveled. The monopoly over submersible technology once {{held by the}} United States was lost over time as other navies around the world modernized and adopted submarine warfare. From the innovations of John Holland {{in the early twentieth}} century to the German U-boat campaigns of the World Wars, and the nuclear-powered ICBM submarines of the Cold War, modern navies embraced the submarine, first, for missions of reconnaissance and commerce-raiding, but, increasingly, in offensive, attack roles. In the <b>postwar</b> <b>era,</b> the submarine has become a central component of modern navies. Submarine usage has gone far beyond Bushnell’s conception of lifting naval blockades designed to bleed a country dry of their imports to become an essential arm of offensive naval warfare and power projection.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the wartime}} and <b>postwar</b> <b>eras,</b> {{documentary}} photography increasingly became subsumed {{under the rubric}} of photojournalism. Swiss-American photographer Robert Frank is generally credited with developing a counterstrain of more personal, evocative, and complex documentary, exemplified by his work in the 1950s, published in the United States in his 1959 book, The Americans. In the early 1960s, his influence on photographers like Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander resulted in an important exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), which brought those two photographers together with their colleague Diane Arbus under the title, New Documents. MoMA curator John Szarkowski proposed in that exhibition that a new generation, committed not to social change but to formal and iconographical investigation of the social experience of modernity, had replaced the older forms of social documentary photography.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{analyzes}} Max Weber’s {{place in}} post-World War II US social thought, when English-language translations, interpretations, and applications {{of his work}} proliferated and it became widely known in American sociology and related fields. The focus is on shifting interpretations and meanings of Weber’s work in different phases of postwar American culture, society, and politics from the Cold War era through the post- 9 / 11 years. Weber’s ideas have been fused with those of diverse thinkers and traditions and have been applied in ways that he likely would have rejected and that stricter Weberians castigate. The various Weber fusions engage modernization theory - arguably the <b>postwar</b> <b>era’s</b> primary metanarrative for legitimating and challenging the liberal democratic policy regime. The historical discussion provides context for later sections on Weber’s salience in the US today and for a possible Weber fusion after postwar modernization...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{although}} he is ordinarily relegated {{to the realm of}} international legal scholarship, Hersch Lauterpacht made a significant contribution to the development of International Relations theory. In particular, it demonstrates that in attempting to address the range of debates surrounding the relationship between law and morality in the interwar and <b>postwar</b> <b>eras,</b> Lauterpacht not only engaged directly with E. H. Carr's criticisms of 'utopian' thought but was responsible for providing the most comprehensive expression of the 'Grotian tradition' to date, a tradition that later appeared in the works of Martin Wight and subsequent scholars. In doing so, this article seeks to achieve not only Lauterpacht's reincorporation into the history of International Relations scholarship but brings into question the disciplinary demarcations that divide the so-called 'disciplines' of International Relations and International Law.

40|$|Dante's Inferno {{inspired}} Robert Rauschenberg (1925 - 2008) {{to create}} a series of 34 drawings that comprise {{one of the most}} remarkable creative enterprises of 20 th-century American art. Completed between 1958 and 1960, XXXIV Drawings for Dante's Inferno introduced an innovative transfer process to the artist's tradition of combining found objects and photographic imagery from newspapers and other popular sources. The resulting powerful, abstract narrative runs parallel to Dante's allegorical journey through the underworld. This publication is the culmination of years of research to identify the images used in Rauschenberg's pieces, and Ed Krcma elucidates the work's deliberate commentary on the fraught political climate of the Cold War and its overall significance for the career of one of the <b>postwar</b> <b>era's</b> most influential figures.

40|$|Ukraine {{once was}} home to the largest {{population}} of Jews in the Russian Empire, and {{on the eve of}} the Nazi invasion of the USSR in 1941 it was the largest Jewish community in Europe. As such, Ukraine was one of the most important centers of Jewish life destroyed during the Holocaust. Between 1941 and 1944, some 1. 4 million Jews were killed there. Yet, little is known about this chapter of Holocaust history. Drawing on new archival sources from the former Soviet Union, eyewitness accounts, postwar criminal investigations, and the extensive holdings of the United states Holocaust Memorial Museum, this book spans the prewar, wartime, and <b>postwar</b> <b>eras</b> and covers the terrain of almost all of modern Ukraine. The topics addressed – including Jewish-Ukrainian relations, forgotten ghettos and camps, interethnic violence, crimes of military and civil authorities, and the German-Romanian alliance – provide a detailed backdrop to the setting in which the Nazis realized their radically anti-Semitic agenda. This volume brings together researchers from Ukraine, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States, and sheds new light on the critical themes of perpetration, collaboration, Jewish-Ukrainian relations, testimony, rescue, and Holocaust remembrance in Ukraine...|$|R
