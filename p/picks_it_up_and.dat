5|$|Amy {{discovers that}} Kyle's adoptive parents have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral {{to see if}} Kyle is there and see him at the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> tries {{to give it back}} but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E

In salamandrids, the male deposits a bundle of sperm, the spermatophore, and the female <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid.

500|$|The American sitcom All in the Family has {{provided}} much influence for the comedy in The Simpsons, as John Alberti {{writes in his}} book Leaving Springfield: the Simpsons {{and the possibility of}} oppositional culture. He wrote that the series influence on The Simpsons is [...] "acknowledged quite openly in the program itself," [...] and used a scene in [...] "Make Room for Lisa" [...] as an example. The scene shows Homer, Bart and Lisa visiting the Smithsonian Exhibition, where a jacket worn by Fonzie, a character from another 70's series, Happy Days, receives more attention from visitors than the Bill of Rights. It does however catch the attention of Homer, who <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> reads it while sitting in a wing chair owned by Archie Bunker, a character from All in the Family.

[...] Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind [...] to talk with Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter, invisible to the other characters. [...] Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe. [...] He says that he will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an unsuitable match. Louise is outraged: [...] each insults the other's father, and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away. [...] Billy, able to make himself visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise, pretending to be a friend of her father. [...] He offers her a gift—the star he stole from heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand. [...] He makes himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow—and Julie understands her perfectly.

Some time afterward he goes to his mine, wheeling the girl along with him. He wheels her to the mouth of the shaft and leaves her, after throwing his coat over the arm of her chair. His devotion has caused her to love him. She tries to change her position and the coat falls to the ground.

2500|$|The brass Ressikan flute resembles, and has {{a similar}} sound to, a penny whistle or a tin whistle. It is {{considered}} a lasting reminder of Picard's virtual life on the planet {{throughout the rest of}} the series. Picard's flute could occasionally be seen in its box sitting on his desk. It plays a role in the episode [...] "" [...] where Picard develops a romantic relationship with a stellar cartographer assigned to the Enterprise, Nella Daren, who encourages his musical side, and with whom he performs a duet version of the [...] "Inner Light" [...] theme. Earlier in the season, a scene shows Picard practicing Mozart on the flute in the beginning of [...] "A Fistful of Datas". Its final appearance was in a deleted scene from Star Trek Nemesis; Lieutenant Commander Data <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> examines it while discussing human life with Picard. The original placement of this scene was to have been immediately following the wedding ceremony shown in the opening scenes. The simple theme that Picard plays on the flute was later developed into a full orchestral suite for the 30th anniversary of Star Trek.|$|E
