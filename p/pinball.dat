50|$|The Drude model treats {{electrons}} (or other charge carriers) like <b>pinballs</b> bouncing {{among the}} ions {{that make up}} the structure of the material. Electrons will be accelerated in the opposite direction to the electric field by the average electric field at their location. With each collision, though, the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field. The net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions, but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field.|$|R

5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a series}} of <b>pinball</b> machine-like environments in which the player {{controls}} Sonic the Hedgehog, who acts as a <b>pinball</b> {{for the majority of the}} game. Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball was commissioned by Sega when it became clear that a new Sonic the Hedgehog game could not be completed in time for the 1993 holiday season, as the majority of staff were occupied with developing Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The game was hastily developed, with most work taking place over 61 days. It received mixed reviews upon release, with most critics praising the game's novelty and graphics, although its control scheme was considered a negative factor. A second <b>pinball</b> game, Sonic <b>Pinball</b> Party, was released in 2003, and a spinning rollercoaster of the same name opened in Alton Towers theme park in 2010.|$|E

Sega later announced that the game would be co-published by North American video game company THQ as part of a joint agreement to publish and develop games for the Game Boy Advance. Composer Hitoshi Sakimoto was involved with the game's music. It was shown as part of THQ's E3 2002 booth. <b>Pinball</b> of the Dead was released in North America on June 18, 2002, and later on July 4, 2002, in Japan.|$|E

The players were shown blanks on the display's bottom line denoting the number of words and letters in the answer. A clue then crawled across the display's upper line. If no team buzzed-in once the clue was revealed, letters of the answer then filled in at random as time progressed. For example, with the clue [...] "He's center and he's square", and blanks displaying [...] "#### #####", the correct answer is [...] "Paul Lynde". James occasionally gave an additional clue before the main clue scrolled across the marquee.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{concerns}} {{the prediction of}} failure of a fluid-filled tank under impact loading, including the resulting fluid leakage. A water-filled steel cylinder associated with a piston is impacted by a mass falling at a prescribed velocity. The cylinder is closed at its base by an aluminum plate whose characteristics are allowed to vary. The impact on the piston creates a pressure wave in the fluid {{which is responsible for}} the deformation of the plate and, possibly, the propagation of cracks. The structural {{part of the problem is}} modeled using Mindlin-Reissner Finite Elements (FE) and Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics (SPH) shells. The modeling of the fluid is also based on an SPH formulation. The problem involves significant Fluid-Structure Interactions (FSI) which are handled through a master-slave-based method and the <b>pinballs</b> method. Numerical results are compared to experimental data...|$|R

5|$|Defender was Williams Electronics' {{first attempt}} at {{developing}} a new video game; the company's earlier game was a Pong clone. The popularity of coin-operated arcade games in 1979 spurred the company to shift its focus from <b>pinball</b> games to arcade games. The company chose Eugene Jarvis, who had a successful record of Williams <b>pinball</b> games, to head development. Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault assisted Jarvis. At the time, Williams had a small staff and the management was unfamiliar with technology used for its electronic games. As a result, the staff was afforded {{a large amount of}} creative freedom.|$|E
5|$|Kirby's Dream Land {{has since}} spawned dozens of sequels across {{more than a}} half-dozen video game consoles.

The series has featured several spin-offs, in differing genres including a racing game Kirby Air Ride, <b>pinball</b> game Kirby's <b>Pinball</b> Land, and even an Action-Golf hybrid game Kirby's Dream Course. Kirby's Dream Land would receive a Game Boy sequel in 1995 Kirby's Dream Land 2, which incorporated the copy mechanic from Kirby's Adventure.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of training target aircraft and specialized ammunition also increased the realisticness of the training. The {{idea was to}} have the students fire special bullets which had the same characteristics as a 30- or 50-caliber round but would splinter harmlessly on impact. Working with researchers at Duke University, the University of Michigan, and the Bakelite Corporation (one of the pioneering manufacturers of plastics), the Air Force came up with a frangible bullet that was weighted with powdered lead to give it the proper weight and density. The Douglas A-20 Havoc was initially used as a target trainer with additional aluminum armor added. The A-20 was found not to be ideal, as the gunners would largely face much more maneuverable single-engined fighter aircraft, and the Bell P-63 Kingcobra replaced it. The P-63 met the fighter plane criteria and was also available in quantity, as it was being used for lend-lease exports and was not used as a combat aircraft by the Air Force. The aerial target version of the aircraft was designated as the [...] "RP-63 Pinball" [...] and was painted a bright orange, re-fitted with 1" [...] thick glass and carried more than a ton of armor covering the parts exposed to gunfire of the specialized bullets. Lights were used to record [...] "hits" [...] that flashed from the propeller hub, some also had lights that flashed from the wingtips, giving rise to the name [...] "Pinball". Unfortunately, the number of hits registered by the recording devices in the aircraft was usually disappointingly small; whether because of misses or a failure of the recording mechanisms was unclear. Beginning in mid-1944 RP-63 <b>Pinballs</b> would fly attack profiles against bombers with student gunners before they were assigned to a combat unit. Eventually, over 300 RP-63s operated both from Buckinghamm and from the Naples Army Auxiliary Air Field.B-24 Liberator aircraft were the primary aircraft used for the air-to-air gunnery phase of the training. The Liberator was not pressurized and had room in the fuselage to accommodate the trainees and their instructors. B-24s were modified with sealed bomb bays and could be used for both waist and turret training, carrying large amounts of ammunition and both the [...]30 and [...]50 caliber machine guns. A B-24 might have 12 student gunners each having 2,000 rounds of the special ammunition to fire at the RP-63 <b>Pinballs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of using}} a {{slingshot}} like in the original Angry Birds, the birds dash through an area in a top down perspective and ricochet like <b>pinballs.</b> Most levels have pinball-style bumpers and sometimes there are hazards such as TNT crates, rocks, blocks of ice or strong winds. Each Angry Bird has a different ability, such as Bomb's ability to blast obstacles near him and Chuck's speed boost, which allows him to fly against powerful fans. Players have {{a limited number of}} birds to use for completing each level, and each bird has enough stamina to be launched up to three times, based on their starting or previous position. The game uses an energy system that, after completing a level or failing to finish a level a few times, either makes the player wait to continue playing or use in-game currency, called gems, to continue playing. Also, in contrast to the sizable variety of playable characters available in previous games, only four are playable in this title, which is Red, Bomb, Chuck or Terrence, the four students in Matilda's anger management class in the film adaptation.|$|R
