In the present investigation, in the recent past human powered flywheel motor concept has been used for chaff cutter, bricks making, wood turning, cloth washing and turmeric polishing. The machine uses bicycle technology, with speed increasing gearing and a flywheel, which drive the process unit through a spiral jaw clutch and torque increasing gearing. Pedal power is used transmit this power to run the machine by the operator. Power can be transmitted through crank chain to free wheel to the working unit. This human powered flywheel motor concept (HPFM) provide new era in the human powered agriculture processing, harvesting, post harvested operations equipments.

30|$|To reduce {{negative}} aspects of lignocellulosic materials, chemical processes, such as etherification, esterification, and phenylation as well as heat treatment methods, have been proposed for improving the physical properties of timber materials [4, 5]. Spruce wood (Picea abies) had degraded hemicellulose, softened lignin, and hence reduced hydrophilicity of cellulose after treated with high temperature [6]. The other similar effect of heat treatment was found to improve hydrophobicity of spruce wood [7], and ameliorating the susceptibility of wood to microbial decomposition component, thus enhancing their dimensional stability and durability [8]. Furthermore, studies confirmed that the contents of major chemical constituents, including cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens), and spruce wood, were reduced by heat treatment, and it significantly affected durability, surface properties, physical properties, and mechanical properties of wooden materials [9, 10]. Current trend of market of bamboo industry and development inclined toward production of glued laminated timber, which is also called glulam. To fulfill the performance requirements, there has been intense research on varieties of bamboo composites.

The main objective is to determine the critical values of mechanical properties significant for <b>peeling</b> <b>machines.</b> The response surface methodology was used to find the relationship between the input parameters and the output responses, and the fitness function was applied to measure the optimal values using the genetic algorithm. Two-parameter Weibull function was used to describe the distribution of mechanical properties. Based on the Weibull parameter values, i. e. shape parameter (β) and scale parameter (η) calculated for each property, the mechanical distribution variations were completely described and it was confirmed that the mechanical properties are rule governed, which makes the Weibull function suitable for estimating their distributions. The energy model estimated using response surface methodology shows that the mechanical properties relate exponentially to the moisture, and polynomially to the loading velocity and probe diameter, which enabled successful estimation of the rupture energy (R²= 0. 94). The genetic algorithm calculated the critical values of seed moisture, probe diameter, and loading velocity to be 18. 11 % on dry mass basis, 0. 79 mm, and 0. 15 mm/min, respectively, and optimum rupture energy of 1. 97 · 10 -³ J.

The methods of segregating veneers quality were defined. The superior veneers were obtained by peeling the billets until their diameters left approximately 12 inches, meanwhile the inferior veneers were obtained by further peeling the same billets used for obtaining superior veneers until their diameters left 4 inches. The mean densities for superior veneer as well as inferior veneer were about 478. 8 kg/m 3 and 385. 1 kg/m 3 respectively.   The mean moisture content of both superior and inferior veneers was approximately 11 %. The veneers were arranged with 5 layers into three types of moulded shapes of furniture components namely i) 100 % S ii) alternate S and I and iii) surface S & core I. The suitable pressure, temperature and time were set as important parameters. The arrangements of veneer quality were pressed using V-shape mould through hot press machine with three parameters pressure 1500 psi, 2000 psi and 2500 psi.

Separation of the particle - free outer region by a newly developed sphere - <b>peeling</b> milling <b>machine,</b> conditioning the graphite into compacts and in-situ cementation into a salt-mine are the basic elements of this head-end process variation. An annual cavern volume of approx. 2000 m$^{ 3 }$ will be needed to ultimately store the graphite of the particle - free outerregion, which corresponds to are processing capacity of 50 GW$_{e}$ installed HTR power. The brush-disintegration of the remaining inner particle region and the resulting peel-brush-crush-preparation are capable of separating 95 % of the graphite without any heavy metal losses. With the mentioned reprocessing capacity an annual cavern volume of approx. 16. 500 m$^{ 3 }$ is required...|$|R
5000|$|Steed and Jonah {{revisit the}} field and {{hear the sound of}} water. They {{discover}} a manhole hidden underneath the grass and go down and explore underground. They discover the body of Kelly and overhear Dr. Sturm talking to Mrs Peel about his plans through the vent to the distillery and that he intends to sell his rainmaking device to a military nation of the highest bidder and describes it as the greatest weapon since the atomic bomb, a [...] "great flood". Steed and Jonah enter the distillery through the vent when the doctor departs, and free Mrs <b>Peel</b> from the <b>machine.</b> They enter the [...] "rain" [...] room and fight with the distillery workers in the soaking wet environment. Dr. Sturm overblows the machine and kills himself to avoid the secret being stolen.|$|R
40|$|The seal {{strength}} of flexible packaging indicates both functional {{performance and the}} ease of opening. This research aims to compare the seal peeling mechanisms evaluated by human participants and standard machine tests. The tests were conducted on flexible films used for typical packaging applications, LDPE, LLDPE and Nylon/LLDPE. Human peeling was simulated {{through the use of}} novel force measurement equipment. The results showed that the maximum <b>machine</b> <b>peel</b> force set by standard test methods was generally lower than the human peel force for most sealing temperatures. In all film types no significant difference was shown between genders although for people over 65 years peel force was generally lower than for the younger cohort. The results also indicated that peeling speed of human participants was normally higher than the peeling speed set according to the machine test standard...|$|R
