5|$|During the Korean War, USAF fighter <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet pilots. Lockheed engineers, led by Kelly Johnson, {{designed}} and submitted a novel design to the Air Force, notable for its sleekness, particularly its thin wings and missile-shaped fuselage, {{as well as}} a novel pilot ejection system.|$|E
5|$|In total, 14 Allied {{aircraft}} {{were destroyed}} and nine damaged. JG 77 lost 11 Bf 109s and their <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> lost. Six {{were killed and}} five captured according to Allied sources. However, German records show the loss of only 10 pilots. Four are listed as captured.|$|E

5|$|On 4 February Bär led I. Gruppe {{into action}} against B-17 Flying Fortress bombers from the 97th and 301st Bomb Group and their Lockheed P-38 Lightning escorts from the 1st Fighter Group. Bär claimed one B-17. On 15 February Bär claimed two USAAF Spitfires. The American <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> {{possibly}} Lieutenant Joe Reed and H. E Huntingdon from the 31st Fighter Group. After an uncredited claim on 24 February over a P-40 Bär accounted for five on two days later. German fighter units claimed 13 against an actual 14 (possible 15) and several more damaged. Seven of the British <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> unhurt. The following {{day he was}} credited with another P-40 in combat with 11 pilots from 4 Squadron SAAF. Records suggest he may have claimed three but was only credited with one.|$|E
5|$|RTÉ also {{announced}} that it was seeking a new television format for the turkey, targeting a more mature audience, but the show would not be in a chat-show format. <b>Pilots</b> <b>were</b> currently in production; however, RTÉ was not expected to air the show until 2009.|$|E
5|$|Replacement <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> {{pushed through}} an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
50|$|From its {{founding}} in the 1980s until 1994, <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> an independent software company. In 1994 <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> acquired by Dun & Bradstreet corporation. Over time D&B began to break itself apart, {{and as part of}} that reorganization <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1997 to Platinum Equity Holdings. In 2000 <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> again sold, this time to Accrue Software.

5|$|The P-47 and P-51s took a heavy toll of JG 11; some 25 <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> lost, {{including}} Specht, who {{was posted}} as Missing In Action, {{along with other}} senior officers of JG 11.|$|E
5|$|The raid was a disaster. Just six {{machines}} were destroyed at Grimbergen {{for the loss}} of 21 Fw 190s and two damaged. Another eight sustained minor damage. Some 17 <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> missing, eight of whom would survive as prisoners.|$|E
5000|$|Corporate {{contract}} <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> {{a classification}} of pilot in general aviation.

5|$|The tactics {{were also}} {{unsuitable}} for fighter-versus-fighter combat. Packed in tight formation, the RAF <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> {{more concerned with}} keeping their position and not colliding with each other than they were keeping watch for the enemy. It made them vulnerable to surprise attacks by Bf 109s and Bf 110s. Even if the British fighters reached the bombers without interception, the chaos of modern aerial combat {{made it impossible to}} concentrate attacks with large, rigid formations. <b>Pilots</b> <b>were</b> also forced into paying far too much respect to the bomber's defensive capabilities. Attacks were broken off far too early and caused little damage to bombers. These tactical failures were evident during the battles in Belgium and France. Moreover, rushed training with pilots who were barely able to use the old tactical methods meant that airmen could not cope with much needed radical changes.|$|E
5|$|As the VPAF <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> {{completing}} the final phases of their conversion training, the VPAF Command chose to attack Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon. On {{the afternoon of}} April 27, the <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> flown out to Phù Cát Air Base in Bình Định Province where Major-General Le Van Tri, commander of the VPAF, briefed them on the upcoming operation. Tri also instructed the pilots {{to ensure that their}} bombs should not hit civilian areas in Saigon. From the original group of trainees, Luc, De, Quang, Vuong, Trung and On were selected {{to take part in the}} attack. Meanwhile, On and Xanh were also instructed to test-fly five captured A-37 bombers, which would be the mainstay of the Quyet Thang Squadron. On the morning of April 28, the Quyet Thang Squadron became operational with Luc as the squadron's commander, when it was transferred to Phan Rang Air Base.|$|E
5|$|During Operation Guardian II a {{squadron}} was deployed {{to protect the}} March 2002 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in south-east Queensland.

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{the only}} fully trained crews were pilots, other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades who {{underwent}} short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming. <b>Pilots</b> <b>were</b> responsible for navigation, and when accurate navigation was essential, a second pilot was carried. Early in 1936 the Air Navigation School had been formed at RAF Manston {{to take over}} this training for all pilots destined for Coastal and Bomber Commands. Conversion training for Flying Boats was also given there.|$|E
5|$|German {{casualties}} {{amounted to}} three Bf 109s destroyed, two severely damaged, and two Bf 110s severely damaged. Seven Bf 110s and one Bf 109 suffered light damage. Johann Fuhrmann and Roman Stiegler {{were the only}} pilots to die in this action. A third—Dietrich Robitzsch from Jagdgruppe 101—wrote-off a Bf 109 but was uninjured. Two <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> wounded: Feldwebel Hans Troitzsch (Bf 109) and Leutnant Gustav Uellenbeck (Bf 110).|$|E
5|$|Geschwaderkommodore Major Gerhard Michalski {{commanded}} the force. Five <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> {{shot down by}} ground fire. Another pilot got lost during the flight and ended up near Eindhoven where he was shot down and killed. Reduced in number, 8–10 fighters of IV./JG 4 continued to their target. After 10 minutes, they located a fairly large airfield and attacked, believing it to be Le Culot. It was in fact Sint-Truiden.|$|E

5|$|Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1) was {{responsible}} for the attack on the Ursel and Maldegem airfields. Oberstleutnant Herbert Ihlefeld led the Geschwader. The formation was mixed; Stab., (headquarters flight or Stabschwarm, attached to every Geschwader), I. and II./JG 1 operated the Fw 190 while the III./JG 1 flew the Bf 109. I./JG 1 lost four of their number to friendly anti-aircraft fire. Three of the four <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> killed.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{had always}} found it {{difficult}} to intercept high-flying German reconnaissance aircraft. The latest Rumpler C.VII which had entered service proved particularly elusive. With a 240 horse power engine, it could reach 24,000 feet and was thus beyond the reach of any prospective adversary. The average S.E.5, at that point, could reach only 17,000 feet. While most <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> prepared to accept this tactical-technological situation, McCudden was not.|$|E
5000|$|This {{term was}} used {{originally}} in aviation: when a <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> prevented from flying an aircraft due to misconduct, illness, technical {{problems with the}} aircraft, or other reasons, the <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> [...] "grounded".|$|R
