The <b>purse</b> <b>ring</b> system has been tested by this company for two years, and the Institute of Marine Research has carried out a simple analysis on the operation on board the commercial fishing vessel M/S «Libas» which was equipped with this new <b>ring</b> arrangement. The <b>purse</b> <b>ring</b> arrangement is working very well, it improves the crew safety on board and it reduces gear costs. NORSK SAMMENDRAG: Lie Management AS har utviklet et forbedret arrangement av snurperinger. Konseptet består av tre deler; en hel ring, et mellomledd og en krok med en fjærbelastet lukkemekanisme. Ringsystemet har vært utprøvd i to år i nevnte selskap, og Havforskningsinstituttet har utført en enkel operasjonsanalyse ombord på M/S «Libas» hvor dette systemet var i bruk. Snurperingarrangementet fungerer meget godt, det forbedrer sikkerheten for mannskapet og er kostnadsbesparende...|$|R

At the time this was interpreted as a Roman-style hearth that had consisted of three iron legs supporting hooks and rings from which would have been suspended a cauldron. The total height of the apparatus would have been approximately 5 ft. A flint arrowhead was found nearby. The gravel diggers also found a large iron knife measuring 10.5 in, including the tang.

40|$|Resently, {{investigation}} {{has been made}} into the relationship between underwater noises and fish catches and into the fishing method using sounds. As {{one of the fundamental}} problems on these subjects, it is necessary to clarify the acoustical features of the noises in the spaces where fishes are distributed, for example, the frequency distribution and the sound pressure of the underwater noises which are made by fishing boats and gear. Therefore the author has measured by the aid of the underwater tape-recorder the underwater noises in course of the fishing operation with the one-boat type trawl net, the bull trawl net, and the purse seine. The analytical results of the measurement are as follows: 1) The underwater noises measured in fishing with the three types of fishing gear were different from one another. The noise from the one-boat type trawl net was pulsating, whereas that from the bull trawl net was almost continuous. The noise from the purse seine was also continuous being similar to that from the bull trawl net, though its frequency band was narrower than that for both types of trawl nets. 2) The frequency distribution of the noise was DC to 5000 Hz in the case of both trawl nets, and DC to 3000 Hz {{in the case of the}} purse seine. The most predominant frequencies in these ranges were 500 Hz to 800 Hz in the case of the one-boat type trawl net, and 400 Hz to 600 Hz, somewhat lower though not so remarkable, in the case of the bull trawl net. In the case of the purse seine, on the other hand, any especially predominant frequency was not seen, but its peculiar noise of 5400 Hz to 6000 Hz caused by the friction of the <b>purse</b> <b>ring</b> against the <b>purse</b> wire was perceived in bracing the sinker side. 3) The acoustic comparison of the noises in fishing among the three type of netting gear showed that the engine noise was inaudible in the case of the one-boat type trawl net because of other noise, but was clearly perceived in the cases of the bull trawl net and the purse seine. 4) concerning the fish catch with the one-boat type trawl net in the East China Sea, the weight compositions of several useful species such as the drums (sciaenid fishes) were investigated. From the mean weight the resonance frequency of the air bladder was calculated and was revealed to almost correspond with the predominant frequency of the underwater noises given forth by the netting gear. In consequence, it is well considered that these underwater noise have significant influences on the perception and behavior of fish. トロール網,以西底曳網および旋網の操業中の水中騒音を録音分析し以下に示す結果を得た. 1) 測定を行なった両底曳網の水中騒音はトロール網の場合はパルス状であるのに対し以西底曳網はほとんど連続音であった. 旋網の場合は漁法上浮網形態で主に表層近くで用いられ網の海底との摩擦が少ないためエンジンノイズ,プロペラノイズが主でパターンとしては以西底曳網に似た連続音が主であった. 2) 周波数分布は両底曳網ではDC～ 5000 Hz,またはそれ以上広帯域におよんでおり,旋網の場合はDC～ 3000 Hzと両底曳網より狭い帯域範囲であった. また最も優勢な周波数はトロール網では 500 Hz～ 800 Hz(最大 37 dB),以西底曳網はトロール網ほど顕著ではないが 400 Hz～ 600 Hz(最大 30 dB),旋網に関しては優勢な周波数は認められなかった. しかし旋網特異の騒音として環と締括綱との網裾をしぼる時に摩擦音が 5400 Hz～ 6000 Hzの周波数帯域において確認された. 3) 録音の再生時における聴覚による比較では,トロール網の場合,自船のエンジンノイズは他の騒音が大きく認められなかった. これに反し以西底曳網の方はハイドロホンまでの自船からの水平距離がトロール網のそれの約 2 倍にもかかわらず明らかにエンジンノイズを認める事ができた. 旋網の騒音は集魚中,投揚網中共にエンジンノイズとプロペラノイズがほとんど全ての騒音であった. 4) 東支那海におけるトロール網の漁獲物中よりグチ,ニベ等有用魚種数種類の体重組成を測定し,その平均体重より「うきぶくろ」の共振周波数を算出した結果,網漁具の発する水中騒音の優勢な周波数とがほぼ一致した. この事から操業中の水中騒音が魚に対する知覚行動反応に有意的な影響を与えている事は充分考えられる...|$|R

The policeman conveyed him to the neighbouring hospital, where it was discovered that he was still alive, and the promptest attentions were immediately paid him. We understand that the surgeon in attendance considers it absolutely impossible that he could have been injured as he was, except by having been violently thrown down on his face, either by a vehicle driven at a furious rate, or by a savage attack from some person or persons unknown. In the latter case, robbery could not have been the motive; for the unfortunate man's watch, <b>purse,</b> and <b>ring</b> were all found about him.

The results are of importance to the industry because they show that lampara, <b>purse</b> seine and <b>ring</b> nets all take the same sizes of fish, that these sizes comprise the sardines available to the fishermen, and that no type of gear exhibits size selection differing from any other type. of greater importance to the industry is the evidence indicating that large fish first appear each winter to the north of Monterey and gradually become disseminated southward throughout the entire Monterey region, whereas in the San Pedro region no consistent distribution of differential sizes within the region is evident. The results are of value to the sardine investigation because of the demonstration of the continual reliability of our sardine sampling system and the furnishing of additional evidence indicating a southward movement of sardines along the California coast during the winter months...|$|R

Between 1990 and 2010 the FAO reported worldwide catch has ranged between 113,000 and 195,000 t, with a consistent trend towards higher catches. These statistics only include Indonesia, Malaysia and the UAE, suggesting true catch sizes to be higher. Of the countries that report catches to the FAO, Indonesia takes the highest amount, with between 129,000 t and 180,000 t reported each year between 2000 and 2010. Locally yellowstripe scad make up {{a high percentage of}} the catch; in an Indian example, it accounted for up to 36% of total landings in one survey. However, in India overall, yellowstripe scad makes up only 1.5% of total carangid catches. The species is predominantly taken in trawls, however is also caught by gill net, bag net, <b>purse</b> seines or <b>ring</b> nets, and push nets. The species is most abundant during spawning periods in India and consists of 8–13cm individuals. A study on the population dynamics in an Indian fishery during 1994 found there was low fishing pressure on the stocks, however a later assessment found stocks elsewhere in India to be overexploited. The novel use of hydroacoustic sounding to estimate the school size of yellowstripe scad, as well as other scad species, has been trialled with varying levels of effectiveness.|$|R

The apparition consisted of several troops of horse moving in regular order, with a steady rapid motion, making a curved sweep around the fell, and seeming to the spectators to disappear over the ridge of the mountain. Many persons witnessed this phenomenon, and observed the last, or last but one, of the supposed troop, occasionally leave his rank, and pass, at a gallop, to the front, when he resumed the steady pace. The curious appearance, making the necessary allowance for imagination, may be perhaps sufficiently accounted for by optical deception." ...|$|R

She could not at last conceal the change of her feelings to the person who rode at her rein, and who she doubted not was the Father Ambrosius; for Seyton, with all the heady impetuosity of a youth, proud, and justly so, of his first successful adventure, assumed all the bustle and importance of commander of the little party, which escorted, {{in the language of the}} time, the Fortune of Scotland. He now led the van, now checked his bounding steed till the rear had come up, exhorted the leaders to keep a steady, though rapid pace, and commanded those who were hindmost of the party to use their spurs, and allow no interval to take place in their line of march; and anon he was beside the Queen, or her ladies, inquiring how they brooked the hasty journey, and whether they had any commands for him. But while Seyton thus busied himself in the general cause with some advantage to the regular order of the march, and a good deal of personal ostentation, the horseman who rode beside the Queen gave her his full and undivided attention, as if he had been waiting upon some superior being. When the road was rugged and dangerous, he abandoned almost entirely the care of his own horse, and kept his hand constantly upon the Queen's bridle; if a river or larger brook traversed their course, his left arm retained her in the saddle, while his right held her palfrey's rein.|$|R
6000|$|The great {{pattern of}} biblioklepts, {{a man who}} carried his passion to the most regrettable excesses, was a Spanish priest, Don Vincente, of the convent of Pobla, in Aragon. When the Spanish {{revolution}} despoiled the convent libraries, Don Vincente established himself at Barcelona, under the pillars of Los Encantes, where are the stalls of the merchants of bric-a-brac and the seats of them that sell books. In a gloomy den the Don stored up treasures which he hated to sell. Once he was present at an auction where he was out-bid in the competition for a rare, perhaps a unique, volume. Three nights after that, the people of Barcelona were awakened by cries of [...] "Fire!" [...] The house and shop {{of the man who}} had bought [...] "Ordinacions per los gloriosos reys de Arago" [...] were blazing. When the fire was extinguished, the body of the owner of the house was found, with a pipe in his blackened hand, and some money beside him. Every one said, [...] "He must have set the house on fire with a spark from his pipe." [...] Time went on, and week by week the police found the bodies of slain men, now in the street, now in a ditch, now in the river. There were young men and old, all had been harmless and inoffensive in their lives, and--all had been bibliophiles. A dagger in an invisible hand had reached their hearts but the assassin had spared their <b>purses,</b> money, and <b>rings.</b> An organised search was made in the city, and the shop of Don Vincente was examined. There, in a hidden recess, the police discovered the copy of [...] "Ordinacions per los gloriosis reys de Arago," [...] which ought by rights to have been burned with the house of its purchaser. Don Vincente was asked how he got the book. He replied in a quiet voice, demanded that his collection should be made over to the Barcelona Library, and then confessed a long array of crimes. He had strangled his rival, stolen the [...] "Ordinacions," [...] and burned the house. The slain men were people who had bought from him books which he really could not bear to part with. At his trial his counsel tried to prove that his confession was false, and that he might have got his books by honest means. It was objected that there was in the world only one book printed by Lambert Palmart in 1482, and that the prisoner must have stolen this, the only copy, from the library where it was treasured. The defendant's counsel proved that there was another copy in the Louvre; that, therefore, there might be more, and that the defendant's might have been honestly procured. Here Don Vincente, previously callous, uttered an hysterical cry. Said the Alcalde:- [...] "At last, Vincente, you begin to understand the enormity of your offence?" [...] "Ah, Senor Alcalde, my error was clumsy indeed. If you only knew how miserable I am!" [...] "If human justice prove inflexible, there is another justice whose pity is inexhaustible. Repentance is never too late." [...] "Ah, Senor Alcalde, but my copy was not unique!" [...] With the story of this impenitent thief we may close the roll of biblioklepts, though Dibdin pretends that Garrick was of the company, and stole Alleyne's books at Dulwich.|$|R
