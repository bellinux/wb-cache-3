This β-amylase {{is intended to be}} used in several food-manufacturing processes: baking and brewing processes, distilled alcohol production, and starch processing for the production of glucose syrups. The compositional data provided for the food enzyme were considered sufficient. The manufacturing process did not raise safety concerns. Based on the maximum use levels recommended for the respective food processes, dietary exposure to the food enzyme–total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of individual data from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. This exposure estimate is similar to or lower than the exposure to a fraction <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> comparable to the food enzyme– TOS, resulting from the consumption of barley-derived foods. As the food enzyme is derived from edible parts <b>of</b> <b>barley,</b> in line with the requirements of the guidance document on food enzyme assessment, the Panel accepted that {{there was no need for}} the provision of toxicological data for this food enzyme. Barley is known as a gluten-containing cereal; however, the gluten content in the food enzyme was found to be below the detection limit of the applied analytical method and well below the threshold value of 20 mg/kg for ‘gluten-free’ products. Furthermore, the potential allergenicity was evaluated by searching for similarity between the amino acid sequence of β-amylase and the sequences of known food allergens; no match was found. Based on the origin of the food enzyme from edible parts <b>of</b> <b>barley,</b> the enzymemanufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided, the allergenicity and dietary exposure assessment, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use...|$|R
