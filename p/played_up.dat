5|$|The 1951 film , {{based on}} Young's biography, portrayed Rommel in a {{sympathetic}} way, as a loyal, humane soldier and a firm opponent to Hitler's policies.

Kaye, now known as Matt Striker, went on to compete on Heat and appear in WWE's developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling.|$|E
5|$|On the Cardinals' side, {{the media}} {{expressed}} disappointment at the team's failure {{to win a}} game in the Series after recording the team's best regular season in over 60years.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of <b>Play</b> <b>Up</b> humour therapy on antipsychotic, {{benzodiazepine}} and antidepressant use in Australian nursing homes. Methods: <b>Play</b> <b>Up</b> is a humour therapy program that has been implemented in Australian nursing homes. This study was an uncontrolled retrospective review of psychotropic medication charts of 406 residents in thirty-three nursing homes before and after 12 weeks of participation in <b>Play</b> <b>Up.</b> Prevalence and mean daily equivalent doses of psychotropic medication use were analysed. Results: There were significant reductions from before to after the <b>Play</b> <b>Up</b> program in the prevalence of any psychotropic medication use, antipsychotic use and benzodiazepine use (P = 0. 001, 0. 02, 0. 007, respectively). Mean daily dose equivalents of pro re nata (PRN) antipsychotics and PRN benzodiazepines significantly reduced over time (P = 0. 007; P = 0. 001). Conclusions: <b>Play</b> <b>Up</b> was associated with an overall decline in the use of psychotropic medications. Further trials are required to confirm and better define this association. 6 page(s...|$|R
5|$|President Roosevelt {{personally}} visited Kentucky {{to campaign}} on Barkley's behalf on July 8, 1938. As {{governor of the}} state, Chandler was on hand to greet Roosevelt on his arrival in Covington. Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley {{in the back seat}} of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to Latonia Race Track, the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler <b>played</b> <b>up</b> Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks.|$|E
5|$|Corley instituted {{sweeping}} changes in {{leadership in the}} regiment, hoping to improve its combat performance. He was able {{to cut down on}} straggling to a degree with more strict threats of court martial, but this had a negative effect on the regiment's morale. He began a unit newspaper, eventually called Eagle Forward, and moved to allow more discourse for the soldiers and leaders of the unit, and this was shown to improve the morale to a degree. Wanting to build a sense of pride in the unit, he sought to emphasize the toughness of the battles the regiment had seen, and <b>played</b> <b>up</b> its victory at the Battle of Yechon while downplaying other poor performances.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Brown again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson. He entered the race late – filing his candidacy papers in late February before the primary election in late May. When Brown approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged him to an impromptu debate, but Brown declined. As Brown quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish lifestyle {{in a series of}} campaign ads, one of which was based on the popular television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Other ads by Beshear <b>played</b> <b>up</b> Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that Brown would raise taxes. Brown refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and the battle between Beshear and Brown opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from the field by advocating for a state lottery – to make a late surge. He defeated Brown, his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|In November 1909, Crowley and Neuburg {{travelled}} to Algeria, {{touring the}} desert from El Arba to Aumale, Bou Saâda, and then Dā'leh Addin, with Crowley reciting the Quran {{on a daily}} basis. During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of Enochian magic, with Neuburg recording the results, later published in The Equinox as The Vision and the Voice. Following a mountaintop sex magic ritual, Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon Choronzon involving blood sacrifice, considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career. Returning to London in January 1910, Crowley found that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in The Equinox; the court found in favour of Crowley. The case was widely reported in the press, with Crowley gaining wider fame. Crowley enjoyed this, and <b>played</b> <b>up</b> to the sensationalist stereotype of being a Satanist and advocate of human sacrifice, despite being neither.|$|E
5|$|Although Rappe did not {{completely}} {{rule out the}} possibility of a German or British attack on southern Sweden if the opportunity arose, he felt that Russia was the most realistic threat. There were only two plausible scenarios for war with Russia: either Sweden would become involved in a war between Germany and Russia which would feature southern and central Sweden as the battlegroundand Rappe made no attempt to hide which country the General Staff wanted Sweden to side with in that caseor Russia would make a limited attack on Norrbotten to reach northern Norway and the Atlantic, an attack that Rappe earlier said was not very likely. Rappe had played down the strategic importance of the Ofoten and Iron Ore Lines and <b>played</b> <b>up</b> the importance of the main railway line to Boden, which was under discussion at that time, to speed up its completion. The railway to Boden was nearly finished by 1892, negating the need for Rappe to play that political game any longer. A railway line to Boden was of utmost {{need to be able to}} bring up troops to Lule Riverthe main line of defenceand a future fortress there.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan {{pursued a}} hard line {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming it to be puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi <b>played</b> <b>up</b> his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters – in August 1981 the US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country {{to reduce the number of}} American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several Libyan ships.|$|E
