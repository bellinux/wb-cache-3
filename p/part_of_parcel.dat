40|$|Plastics are manmade long chain {{polymeric}} molecules {{which are}} resistant against microbial attack and become <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>parcel</b> of today life. It {{turns out to}} be imperative component in agriculture as different plastics are used for various purposes namely plasticulture, polyhouses, mulches, packaging container, shrink film wrappers, etc. Plastics have replaced paper and cellulose-based products for packaging because of their strength, lightness, resistance to water and most water borne microorganism. Nowadays a wide variety of synthetic polymers are produced worldwide to the extent of ~ 140 million tonnes every year. Remarkable of these polymers are introduced in the ecosystem as industrial waste products every year. The dramatic increase in production and lack of biodegradability of commercial polymers, particularly commodity plastics used in packaging, industry and agriculture, focused public attention on a potentially huge environmental accumulation and pollution problem that could persist for centuries. Because of their persistence in our environment, several communities are now more sensitive to the impact of discarded plastic on the environment, including deleterious effects on wildlife and on the aesthetic qualities of cities and forests. In addition, the burning of polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastics produces persistent organic pollutants (POPs) known as furans and dioxins. In order to find alternatives, a new material has been developed known as bioplastic. Bioplastics are long chain of monomers joined with each other by ester bonds. These plastics are thus considered as polyesters. Bioplastics are classified into variou...|$|E
40|$|Apartment {{ownership}} or strata {{ownership is}} one of the new approach in housing industries in Malaysia based on existing legislation began in 1985. Strata cannot be avoided, especially in major cities due to lack of land and the cost to own land are become more expensive. However, with this types of approach by building a higher building, indirect costs of a piece of land shared by all owners and to reduce the overall cost of construction. However, the cost of sharing create a new problem to all parcel owners. The issue that often arises is connection with the payment of quit rent to be paid by the owner of the parcel {{based on the number of}} shares in the scheme of the strata development. Failure of payment of land quit rent by the parcel owner cause to the confiscation of the whole land by the authority although <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>parcel</b> owner make a payment based on their shares. It created injustice to the parcel owner. Basically in strata scheme there is a clear boundary between the parcel owner. Due to the problems of quit rent payment, new proposal been made. Parcel owner have to pay the quit rent individually directly to the State. This new proposal create a new concept in the ownership of strata. However, various issues must be clear first as the new approach conflicting with the laws and principles land ownership in Malaysia.
