25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

500|$|U2 {{recorded}} {{their next}} album, Zooropa, from February to May 1993 during an extended break between {{the third and}} fourth legs of the tour. The album was intended as a companion EP to Achtung Baby, but soon expanded into a full LP. Recording could not be completed before the tour restarted, and for the first month of the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg, the band flew home after shows, recording until the early morning and working on their off-days, before travelling to their next destination. Clayton called the process [...] "about the craziest thing you could do to yourself", while Mullen said of it, [...] "It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad." [...] McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The album was released on 5 July 1993. Influenced by the tour's themes of technology and mass media, Zooropa was an even greater departure in style from their earlier recordings than Achtung Baby was, incorporating further dance music influences and electronic effects into their sound. A number of songs from the album were incorporated into the subsequent [...] "Zooropa" [...] and [...] "Zoomerang" [...] legs, most frequently [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)".
