5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, as well as <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E

25|$|PWDs have a single-layered {{coat that}} does not shed (see Moult), and {{therefore}} their presence is tolerated well among many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from dog allergies. Some call PWDs hypoallergenic dogs, but any person with dog allergies who would like a dog with these qualities should actually spend time with the animals before purchasing, to test whether the dog is truly non-allergenic to them.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatric {{rehabilitation}} services {{aimed at helping}} people with mental health problems reduce psychosocial disability, engage in meaningful activities and avoid stigma and social exclusion may be of value to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from BPD. There are also many mutual-support or co-counseling groups run by and for individuals with BPD. Services, or individual goals, are increasingly based on a recovery model that supports and emphasizes an individual's personal journey and potential.|$|E
25|$|With {{the closing}} of these state mental {{institutions}} {{it has become increasingly}} difficult for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from severe mental illness to receive treatment in a facility. Many mentally ill individuals were left homeless after deinstitutionalization, making up one-third of the homeless population (D.E. Torrey). Today the most prominent treatment for the severely mentally ill is incarceration in a correctional facility, where mentally ill individuals are not receiving adequate care for their disorder.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people suffer}} from allergies to garlic {{and other species}} of Allium. Symptoms can include {{irritable}} bowel, diarrhea, mouth and throat ulcerations, nausea, breathing difficulties, and, in rare cases, anaphylaxis. Garlic-sensitive patients show positive tests to diallyl disulfide, allylpropyldisulfide, allylmercaptan and allicin, {{all of which are}} present in garlic. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from garlic allergies are often sensitive to many other plants, including onions, chives, leeks, shallots, garden lilies, ginger, and bananas.|$|E

25|$|<b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from {{infrequent}} heartburn {{may take}} either antacids or H2-receptor antagonists for treatment. The H2-antagonists offer several advantages over antacids, including longer duration of action (6–10 hours vs 1–2 hours for antacids), greater efficacy, {{and ability to}} be used prophylactically before meals to reduce the chance of heartburn occurring. Proton pump inhibitors, however, are the preferred treatment for erosive esophagitis since they {{have been shown to}} promote healing better than H2-antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} are {{the most}} prevalent type of hallucinations. They include hearing voices and music. Many times an individual suffering from auditory hallucinations will hear a voice or voices saying the individual's own thoughts out loud, commenting on all their actions, or commanding and ordering the individual around. These voices tend to be negative and critical toward the individual. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from schizophrenia and have auditory hallucinations will often speak to the voice {{as though they are}} speaking to a second person.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, FAO {{organised}} the World Food Summit, {{attended by}} 112 Heads or Deputy Heads of State and Government. The Summit concluded with {{the signing of}} the Rome Declaration, which established the goal of halving the number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from hunger by the year 2015. At the same time, 1,200 Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) from 80 countries participated in an NGO forum. The forum was critical of the growing industrialisation of agriculture and called upon governments – and FAO – to do more to protect the 'Right to Food' of the poor.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who suffer}} from social anxiety {{disorder}} fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous {{in the presence of}} people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from this disorder may behave a certain way or say something and then feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when they are with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or blushing when someone is talking to them.|$|E
25|$|Amnesia {{is seen in}} {{patients}} who, for the reason of preventing another more serious disorder, have parts of their brains known {{to be involved in}} memory circuits removed, the most notable of which is known as the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system, described below. Patients with seizures originating in the MTL may have either side or both structures removed (there is one structure per hemisphere). In addition, patients with tumors who undergo surgery will often sustain damage to these structures, as is described in a case below. Damage to any part of this system, including the hippocampus and surrounding cortices, results in amnesic syndromes. This is why <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from strokes have a chance of developing cognitive deficits that result in anterograde amnesia, since strokes can involve the temporal lobe and the temporal cortex, and the temporal cortex houses the hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from dysgeusia {{are also}} forced {{to manage the}} impact that the {{disorder}} has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake {{and can lead to}} weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment. This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.|$|E

500|$|Young {{children}} {{have the highest}} concussion rate among all age groups. [...] However, most <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> concussion are young adults.

[...] However, female athletes may be at a higher risk for suffering concussion than their male counterparts.|$|E
500|$|In Canada, David Todd of news {{magazine}} Maclean's commended {{the way that}} Miller had [...] "arriv at a portrait of [...] founder that is by turns hilarious and deeply unsettling", commenting that [...] "while scathingly critical of Hubbard and his church, Bare-Faced Messiah is, in fact, scrupulously fair." [...] Michael Harrison of the Toronto Financial Post criticised the book for [...] "lack a critical perspective beyond the requisite snide commentary" [...] and professed himself disappointed by Miller's avoidance {{of the question of}} whether Hubbard was [...] "genuine or just a fraud", which Harrison considered an important omission [...] "since the questions of selfishness, integrity and motivation are key issues in biographies of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from the messiah-complex.".|$|E
500|$|New to acting, the {{children}} often made errors such as {{staring into the}} camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised {{that this would be}} a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to [...] "bore the hell out of [...] ", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally. A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from dyslexia, and {{the children}}'s responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3–4days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were [...] "jaded". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions. The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was [...] deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in.|$|E

500|$|The {{nature of}} the head trauma also {{influences}} the risk of PTE. [...] <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> depressed skull fractures, penetrating head trauma, early PTS, and intracerebral and subdural haematomas due to the TBI are especially likely to suffer PTE, which occurs in more than 30% of people with {{any one of these}} findings. About 50% of patients with penetrating head trauma develop PTE, and missile injuries and loss of brain volume are associated with an especially high likelihood of developing the condition. [...] Injuries that occur in military settings carry higher-than-usual risk for PTE, probably because they more commonly involve penetrating brain injury and brain damage over a more widespread area. [...] Intracranial hematomas, in which blood accumulates inside the skull, {{are one of the most}} important risk factors for PTE. [...] Subdural hematoma confers a higher risk of PTE than does epidural hematoma, possibly because it causes more damage to brain tissue. Repeated intracranial surgery confers a high risk for late PTE, possibly because people who need more surgery are more likely to have factors associated with worse brain trauma such as large hematomas or cerebral swelling. [...] In addition, the chances of developing PTE differ by the location of the brain lesion: brain contusion that occurs on in one or the other of the frontal lobes has been found to carry a 20% PTE risk, while a contusion in one of the parietal lobes carries a 19% risk and one in a temporal lobe carries a 16% chance. [...] When contusions occur in both hemispheres, the risk is 26% for the frontal lobes, 66% for the parietal, and 31% for the temporal.|$|E
