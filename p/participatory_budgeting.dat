40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a web-based system to support groups in elabo-rating <b>participatory</b> <b>budgets.</b> Rather than using physical meetings with voting mechanisms, we promote virtual meetings with explicit preference elicitation, guided negotiations and, only if consensus is not reached, voting. 1 Basic Concepts in <b>Participatory</b> <b>Budget</b> Formation <b>Participatory</b> <b>budgets</b> constitute {{an attempt to}} allow citizens to have a word and aid in deciding and approving how public budgets, mainly in municipalities, are spent, whether (and how much) in transportation, culture, education, urban development, health, [...] . They constitute a budget allocation model based on di-alogue and citizen participation, which diverges from the current predominant representative model in which citizens choose representatives for four years, with practically no other direct opportunity to influence council policies. In a sense, <b>participatory</b> <b>budgets</b> are transforming {{the idea of a}} represen-tative democracy, in which the preferences of the citizens are considered just at the moment of elections, through voting, to move closer to a participatory democracy, based on direct participation and discussion of issues. In words of Souza, see [10]: <b>Participatory</b> <b>budgets</b> constitute a universal, direct and volunteer kind of democracy which gives population the opportunity of discussing about budgets and public policy, making relevant decisions. Citizens not only vote, but also get involved. Among many potential benefits of <b>participatory</b> <b>budgets,</b> we would include: – Legitimation – Approaching decisions to citizens – Public decisions made publicly – Mitigation of alienation and apath...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper was}} mainly {{intended}} to enable a preliminary {{assessment of the}} factors qualifying the out-of-town full-time students, temporarily staying in Wrocław, for the participation in creating the <b>participatory</b> <b>budget</b> of Wrocław. We can observe that only small group of students voted for <b>participatory</b> <b>budget</b> of Wrocław. Main reason of non-voting {{was a lack of}} information about <b>participatory</b> <b>budget</b> and possibility of voting. Some of respondents were also misinformed about possibility of voting. It seems also that that main reason of non-voting is really lack of interest. In introducing <b>participatory</b> <b>budget</b> one of main players is local community. Applicants, non-governmental organizations, district councils, schools or other institutions are able to motivate citizens for voting. In our survey we discovered that these actors didn’t play a single minute. Surveyed voting-students had heard about <b>participatory</b> <b>budget</b> from friends, family members, or they had found information from social media, town internet page and posters. The main factors influencing the choice of the projects by surveyed students were in general: descriptions of tasks in the electronic voting system, tasks descriptions available on the town website, information spread by the applicants (online, by leaflets, posters, banners and other ones) and opinions of family members. Summarizing we can notice that main problem is lack of information provided by different town and non-governmental bodies and what results poor acquisition of voters...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} the result of an ethnographic {{research}} on the <b>Participatory</b> <b>Budget</b> of Porto Alegre, Brazil.

The broader objective is related to understanding the meaning of political participation; that is the reason why the viewpoints of the counselors, local leaders with a well-known political engagement in the <b>Participatory</b> <b>Budget,</b> are taken into account. Thus, this article stands for an attempt to cast light on the conditions of the acquisition of ‘agency’, as a modality of action in which the subject tries to carry out a personal project by assessing the strategies he/she avails.
