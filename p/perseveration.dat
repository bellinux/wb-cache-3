5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought <b>perseveration</b> refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
25|$|Flexibility. Poor mental flexibility, as {{demonstrated}} in individuals with autism, is characterized by perseverative, stereotyped behaviour, and deficits in both the regulation and modulation of motor acts. Some {{research has suggested that}} individuals with autism experience a sort of ‘stuck-in-set’ <b>perseveration</b> that is specific to the disorder, rather than a more global <b>perseveration</b> tendency. These deficits have been exhibited in cross-cultural samples and have been shown to persist over time.|$|E
40|$|When unimpaired {{participants}} name pictures quickly, {{they produce}} many <b>perseverations</b> that bear a semantic {{relation to the}} target, especially when the pictures are blocked by category. Evidence suggests that the temporal properties of these "semantic perseverations" may differ from typical lexical <b>perseverations</b> in aphasia. To explore this, we studied semantic <b>perseverations</b> generated by participants with aphasia on a naming task with semantic blocking [Schnur, T. T., Schwartz, M. F., Brecher, A., & Hodgson, C. (2006). Semantic interference during blocked-cyclic naming: Evidence from aphasia. Journal of Memory and Language, 54, 199 - 227]. The properties of these <b>perseverations</b> were investigated by analyzing how often they occurred at each lag (distance from prior occurrence) and how time (response-stimulus interval) influenced the lag function. Chance data sets were created by reshuffling stimulus-response pairs {{in a manner that}} preserved unique features of the blocking design. We found that the semantic blocking manipulation did not eliminate the expected bias for short-lag <b>perseverations</b> (recency bias). However, immediate (lag 1) <b>perseverations</b> were not invariably the most frequent, which hints at a source of inconsistency within and across studies. Importantly, there was not a reliable difference between the lag functions for <b>perseverations</b> generated with a 5 s, compared to 1 s, responsestimulus interval. The combination of recency bias and insensitivity to elapsed time indicates that the perseveratory impetus in a named response does not passively decay with time but rather is diminished by interference from related trials. We offer an incremental learning account of these findings...|$|R

25|$|Stimulating the OFC in {{laboratory}} animals results in drug self-administration. In animal studies the OFC is hypothesized {{to not only}} {{be associated with the}} response to reward, but also to respond and adjust animal behavior when the rewarding properties of the reinforcement change - as well as learning the association between stimulus and reward. The damage to the OFC results in deficits in reversal of stimulus reinforcement in which an animal perseverates on a behavior and fails to extinguish a behavior. This <b>perseveration</b> and inability to extinguish a behavior can be related to drug administration in substance abuse and substance dependence where individuals compulsively self-administer a drug even with drastic decrease of reinforcing effects of that drug and tolerance to the pleasurable effects and in the presence of adverse consequences of drug use. Rats who are reintroduced to an environment in which they used cocaine experience activation of the OFC. In addition, in rats, repeated alcohol use causes degeneration of the OFC.|$|E
40|$|In most {{collections}} of segmental speech errors, exchanges are less frequent than anticipations and <b>perseverations.</b> However, {{it has been}} suggested that in inner speech exchanges might be more frequent than either anticipations or <b>perseverations,</b> because many half-way repaired errors (Yew…uhh [...] New York) are classified as repaired anticipations, but may equally well be half-way repaired exchanges. In this paper it is demonstrated for experimentally elicited speech errors that indeed in inner speech exchanges are more frequent than anticipations and <b>perseverations.</b> The predominance of exchanges can be explained by assuming a mechanism of planning and serial ordering segments during the generation of speech that is qualitatively similar to the scan-copier model proposed by Shattuck-Hufnagel (Sublexical units and suprasegmental structure in speech production planning.

In this study, 70 stroke patients and 30 healthy controls performed a computerized shape cancellation (SC) task and a non-lateral (vertical) SWM task. We compared performances between patients with and without VSN (VSN+ and VSN-), and healthy control participants. We calculated correlations between SWM and the omission difference on the SC task, used to indicate VSN severity. Furthermore, VSN is associated with perseverative search behaviour. We calculated correlations between SWM and the number of ipsilesional, and total non-consecutive <b>perseverations</b> on the SC task, as <b>perseverations</b> could be an expression of impaired SWM. Higher SWM threshold scores were found for VSN+ patients compared to VSN- patients, indicating a relationship between impaired SWM and VSN. However, individual performances overlapped. A strong positive correlation was found between impaired SWM and VSN severity. Moderate positive correlations were found between impaired SWM and the number of ipsilesional, and total non-consecutive <b>perseverations</b> in the VSN+ and stroke group, respectively. To conclude, impaired SWM was strongly related to VSN, and patients with more severe VSN showed even more impaired SWM. Impaired SWM was expressed by a greater number of (ipsilesional) non-consecutive <b>perseverations.</b> Our results suggest that impaired SWM contributes to VSN severity...|$|R

2500|$|Pathological gambling, in contrast, {{seems to}} involve many diverse aspects of impulsivity and {{abnormal}} reward circuitry [...] (similar to substance use disorders) {{that has led}} to it being increasingly conceptualized as a non-substance or behavioral addiction. Evidence elucidating the role of impulsivity in pathological gambling is accumulating, with pathological gambling samples demonstrating greater response impulsivity, choice impulsivity, and reflection impulsivity than comparison control samples. Additionally, pathological gamblers tend to demonstrate greater response <b>perseveration</b> (compulsivity) and risky decision making in laboratory gambling tasks compared to controls, though there is no strong evidence suggesting that attention and working memory are impaired in pathological gamblers. These relations between impulsivity and pathological gambling are confirmed by brain function research: pathological gamblers demonstrate less activation in the frontal cortical regions (implicated in impulsivity) compared to controls during behavioral tasks tapping response impulsivity, compulsivity, and risk/reward. [...] Preliminary, though variable, findings also suggest that striatal activation is different between gamblers and controls, and that neurotransmitter differences (e.g. dopamine, serotonin, opioids, glutamate, norepinephrine) may exist as well.|$|E

40|$|Stroke {{patients}} can have problems regarding visual search, which could affect rehabilitation {{and activities of}} daily living (ADL). Lesions in the right hemisphere are associated with disorganized visual search. Visual search can be evaluated with a cancellation test, in which targets that are embedded in a set of distractors, are cancelled.

In this study, visual search in stroke patients with lesions in the left hemisphere (LH) or the right hemisphere (RH) was explored with a digitized cancellation test with and without visual markers. The amount of omitted targets, <b>perseverations,</b> intersections, consistency in search direction and the duration of the test performance were extracted to evaluate visual search performance. It was found that more omissions and <b>perseverations</b> were made when no markers were provided. In contrast, search direction was more consistent. Furthermore, patients with lesions in the RH made more omissions, more intersections and showed a less consistent search direction on both versions. In addition, patients with lesions to the RH made more <b>perseverations</b> when no markers appeared in the test...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how associative and inductive reasoning processes develop over trials in feature positive (FP) and feature negative (FN) discrimination learning. Younger and older adults completed initial and transfer tasks with either consistent or inconsistent transfer. Participants articulated a rule on every trial. The measure of discrimination learning was the number of trials it took participants to articulate the exact rule. In the initial task, older adults articulated the rule more slowly than younger adults in FP discrimination and took marginally more trials to articulate the rule in FN discrimination than younger adults. Age differences were greater in FP discrimination than in FN discrimination learning because younger adults performed well in FP discrimination learning. In the transfer task, older adults articulated the FP rule more slowly than younger adults and both groups articulated the rule more quickly with consistent than inconsistent transfer. Older adults articulated the FN rule slower than older adults. The differences in trials to articulate the FN rule for the two groups were somewhat larger for inconsistent transfer than consistent transfer. Discrimination learning was explained in terms of associative and inductive reasoning processes reasonably well. The measure of associative processes was forgotten responses, whereas the measures of inductive reasoning processes were irrelevant cue shifts and <b>perseverations.</b> In FP discrimination learning in the initial task, older adults had a greater proportion of forgotten responses, irrelevant cue shifts, and marginally more <b>perseverations</b> than younger adults. Therefore, older adults had more difficulty with associative and inductive reasoning processes than younger adults in FP discrimination. In FN discrimination, older adults had a greater proportion of forgotten responses than younger adults. Older and younger adults had a similar number of irrelevant cue shifts and <b>perseverations.</b> Therefore, in FN discrimination older adults had more difficulty with associative processes than younger adults. Both groups had difficulty with inductive reasoning processes. In FP discrimination in the transfer task, older adults had a greater proportion of forgotten responses, irrelevant cue shifts, and <b>perseverations</b> than younger adults, and these proportions were similar in consistent and inconsistent transfer. Therefore, in FP discrimination older adults had more difficulty than younger adults with both associative and inductive reasoning processes. Both processes were similar with regards to consistent and inconsistent transfer. In FN discrimination, older adults had a greater proportion of forgotten responses than younger adults, and the proportion of forgotten responses was greater in inconsistent than in consistent transfer. Both groups made a similar number of irrelevant cue shifts, and there was a marginal difference in consistent and inconsistent transfer for this measure with a greater number in inconsistent transfer. Older adults had a greater proportion of <b>perseverations</b> than younger adults. However, there were no differences in the number of <b>perseverations</b> for consistent and inconsistent transfer. Thus, older adults had difficulty with associative and inductive reasoning processes. Younger adults 2 ̆ 7 inductive reasoning skills improved.

40|$|Nissim, a 64 {{years old}} Hebrew-speaking man who {{sustained}} an ischemic infarct {{in the left}} occipital lobe, exhibited an intriguing pattern. He could hold a deep and fluent conversation about abstract and complex issues, such as the social risks in unemployment, but failed to retrieve imageable words such as ball, spoon, carrot, or giraffe. A detailed study of the words he could and could not retrieve, in tasks of picture naming, tactile naming, and naming to definition indicated that whereas {{he was able to}} retrieve abstract words, he had severe difficulties when trying to retrieve imageable words. The same dissociation also applied for proper names – he could retrieve names of people who have no visual image attached to their representation (such as the son of the biblical Abraham), but could not name people who had a visual image (such as his own son, or Barack Obama). When he tried to produce imageable words, he mainly produced <b>perseverations</b> and empty speech, and some semantic paraphasias. He did not produce <b>perseverations</b> when he tried to retrieve abstract words. This suggests that <b>perseverations</b> may occur when the phonological-production system produces a word without proper activation in the semantic lexicon. Nissim evinced a similar dissociation in comprehension – he could understand abstract words and sentences but failed to understand sentences with imageable words, and to match spoken imageable words to pictures or to semantically related imageable words. He was able to understand proverbs with imageable literal meaning but abstract figurative meaning. His comprehension was impaired also in tasks of semantic associations of pictures, pointing to a conceptual, rather than lexical source of the deficit.

A Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score was also assigned to each participant as an overall indicator of daily functioning abilities. HIV+/BD+participants had significantly worse performance on CPT-II omission errors, hit reaction time SE (Hit RT SE), variability of SE, and <b>perseverations</b> than HIV+/BD- participants. When examining CPT-II performance over the six study blocks, both HIV+/BD+and HIV+/BD- participants evidenced worse performance on scores of commission errors and reaction times as the test progressed. The authors also examined the effect of current mood state (i. e., manic, depressive, euthymic) on CPT-II performance, but {{no significant differences were}} observed across the various mood states.
