It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E
5|$|Ingham {{was forced}} {{further down the}} Sunderland <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> after the signing of Thomas Myhre in July 2002 and he joined Second Division club Stockport County on a one-month loan on 23 August. He made his only {{appearance}} in a 3–1 victory away to Lincoln in the League Cup on 10 September 2002 and the loan was extended for a second month, before being recalled by Sunderland in October due to an injury crisis. Despite this, he was forced further down Sunderland's <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> after they signed Mart Poom on loan from Derby County and after considering handing in a transfer request he joined Third Division club Darlington on a one-month loan on 22 November 2002. He made three appearances before returning to Sunderland in December. He played for Sunderland in a friendly against Hull City {{for the opening of}} their new ground, the KC Stadium, which made him the first away goalkeeper at the ground, while also being the last to play at Hull's former ground, Boothferry Park. This was his final appearance for Darlington in a 1–0 victory over Hull, during which he denied Stuart Elliott from scoring on three occasions. He joined Third Division club York City on 24 January 2003 on a one-month loan after goalkeeper Alan Fettis left to join Hull, who Ingham made his debut against a day later in a 0–0 away draw. His loan at York was extended for second and third months in February and March 2003 and he finished the spell, in which he performed well, with 17 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{had been}} widely criticised, and even booed, by City fans at {{times during the}} {{previous}} season and Eriksson said that he hoped it would not happen again and that he appreciated why Samaras could have {{found it hard to}} play under those circumstances. Samaras was behind the likes of Valeri Bojinov and Rolando Bianchi in the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> and was included in the squad for the first time only on 25 September, when he was selected for a League Cup match against Norwich City.

40|$|The {{standard}} approach in accounting for hierarchical differentiation in biology {{and the social}} sciences considers a hierarchy as a static distribution of individuals possessing differing amounts of some valued commodity, assumes that the hierarchy is generated by micro-level processes involving individuals, and attempts to reverse engineer the processes that produced the hierarchy. However, sufficient experimental and analytical results are available to evaluate this {{standard approach}} in the case of animal dominance hierarchies (<b>pecking</b> <b>orders).</b> Our evaluation using evidence from hierarchy formation in small groups of both hens and cichlid fish reveals significant deficiencies in the three tenets of the standard approach in accounting for the organization of dominance hierarchies. In consequence, we suggest that a new approach is needed to explain the organization of <b>pecking</b> <b>orders</b> and, very possibly, by implication, for other kinds of social hierarchies. We develop an example of such an approach that considers dominance hierarchies to be dynamic networks, uses dynamic sequences of interaction (dynamic network motifs) to explain the organization of dominance hierarchies, and derives these dynamic sequences directly from observation of hierarchy formation. We test this dynamical explanation using computer simulation and find a good fit with actual dynamics of hierarchy formation in small groups of hens. We hypothesize that the same dynamic sequences are used in small groups of many other animal species forming <b>pecking</b> <b>orders,</b> and we discuss the data required to evaluate our hypothesis. Finally, we briefly consider how our dynamic approach may be generalized to other kinds of social hierarchies using the example of the distribution of empty gastropod (snail) shells occupied in populations of hermit crabs...|$|R

5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's <b>pecking</b> <b>order,</b> despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E

In that final season, he played rarely.

5|$|Babangida's {{international}} {{chances were}} partly limited {{due to the}} fact that he often found himself behind Finidi George in the <b>pecking</b> <b>order.</b> He played an important role in his team's Olympic triumph in Atlanta in 1996, as Nigeria overcame tough resistance from Brazil and Argentina, packed with the likes of Dida, Roberto Carlos, Bebeto, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Hernan Crespo, Claudio López, Ariel Ortega and Diego Simeone among others. Babangida took part in Nigeria's 1998 World Cup campaign, playing a total of 120 minutes as he started one game and came on as a sub in the other three. He scored his team's only goal in the second-round defeat to Denmark.

5|$|In a hierarchy, {{individuals}} are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant {{while the others}} are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> is a linear ranking of individuals {{where there is a}} top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.|$|E

In all models, evolution is primarily by individual selection, probably supplemented by group selection. Group selection is differential extinction of populations. It can act only on populations preformed by selection at the individual level, but can either cancel individual selective trends (effecting evolutionary homeostasis) or supplement them; its supplementary effect is probably increasingly important in the evolution of increasingly organized populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{subversion}} {{of the three}} feudal, patriarchal, and religious hierarchies turns Strindberg’s perennial play, Miss Julie (1888) into an exemplar of Bakhtinian carnival.

5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the <b>pecking</b> <b>order,</b> and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E
40|$|Evidence of {{an effect}} of the <b>peck</b> <b>order</b> in poultry on the {{variation}} in productive characters under floor conditions is {{used as the basis}} of a discussion on the design of animal experiments. Since these competitive effects increase the variation between animals penned together, the usual tests for the presence of pen effects between replicate pens are unsuitable. Replicates should be used in all experiments when treatments are allocated to pens of animals to provide an adequate measure of the experimental error. Considerations of social behaviour are likely to be relevant in many types of animal experiments, both husbandry and breeding. It is, however, emphasised that the amount of information available on such an important question is completely inadequate and that behaviour studies should be incorporated into all types of animal experiments to obtain such information...|$|R

This disposition, combined with conservative Protestantism’s unique theological tendency to reduce all matters to personal issues, led to indifference to or silence on socio-political issues.

40|$|The <b>peck</b> <b>orders</b> of {{chickens}} have been measured in many ways, {{and the question}} of which measure is most appropriate arises. This can only be answered in reference to the way that the measure is to be used. Staging paired contests between unacquainted birds is best used to assess the stable, intrinsic traits that underly dominance relationships. However, this method does not give reliable estimates of the relationships the birds form when grouped. The social environment of each bird is best assessed by observing the agonistic encounters that occur. However, the comparability of the different forms of aggressive behaviour needs to be established. Measures based upon priority of access to food cannot be used with confidence. Measures of rank need to be normally distributed and reflect the actual magnitude of the difference between birds only when these are to be used in assessing the underlying traits...|$|R
5|$|York {{suffered}} {{their first}} home league {{defeat of the}} season after AFC Wimbledon won 2–0, with Michael Smith scoring in each half.

Brobbel opened the scoring in the second minute of his home debut against Mansfield Town, although the away team went on to score twice to win 2–1. York's run of four defeats ended following a 1–1 draw away to Wycombe Wanderers, in which McGurk gave York the lead before the home team levelled through Dean Morgan. Taft was sent back to Leicester after he fell behind McGurk, Parslow and Smith in the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> for a central defensive berth.

5|$|According {{to former}} English paceman Bill Bowes, England had {{approached}} the First Test {{with the intention}} of achieving a draw against a team they regarded as their superior, reflected in their selections and use of defensive tactics. Bowes himself believed the tactics to be correct and almost successful. However, he suspected that Walter Robins, one of the selectors, considered the English strategy to be misguided and that they should attack the Australians. This was reflected in the English selections. The home team made three changes; the leg spinner Doug Wright, who was forced to withdraw from the First Test at late notice due to lumbago, had regained his fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox spin of Young, who had taken match figures of 1/107 in the First TestAustralian wicket-keeper Don Tallon was his only wicket. However, he had managed to keep the batsmen quiet with his defensive leg theory, bowling 60 overs for 79 runs; Wright was a much more attacking and therefore expensive bowler. Jim Laker, who had been called into the First Test team due to Wright's lumbago, was initially the third spinner in the <b>pecking</b> <b>order,</b> but he took 4/138, including three specialist batsmen, and was retained.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{advances}} in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still {{expected to attend}} to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals. Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the silkworms, feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons. In the family <b>pecking</b> <b>order,</b> the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these men often stayed at home. If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants. There were also many professional courtesans (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs. It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home. Yet two could play at this game. Most concubines were found in the families of feudal lords and kings. The ideal of the chaste, modest, and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou, where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author put it. This author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>peck</b> <b>orders</b> in mixed sex groups of domestic chickens was observed {{to determine how}} linearity occurred. Based on threats, head-pecks and submission, dominance relationships emerged in a virtual peck right form. Leaping by males, however, did not closely conform to dominance relationships. There were no rank reversals in 50 % of male-male and 80 % of female-female relationships, and only single changes occurred {{in most of the}} others. These resulted from the movements of individuals up the hierarchy rather than from any general reorganization of relationships. Reversals did not necessarily occur between rank neighbours, and stable triangles were sometimes introduced. The initial status of males and females depended upon the age at which they first showed aggression, while the final, stable status of males depended upon the age at which they were first submitted to. Sexual maturity of the males produced a number of changes, with earlier-maturing birds tending to rise in status above their later-maturing companions. Linear hierarchies therefore appear to result from birds developing at different rates...|$|R
