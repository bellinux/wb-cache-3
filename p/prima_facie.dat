5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights, and some <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. In this picture, the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights, represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against suffering and death ground <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights against the infliction of suffering and death. These <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> right not to be made to suffer and a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> right not to be killed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of the Presbytery of Paisley the Scottish Privy Council set up a {{commission}} to investigate the case. Under the chairmanship of Lord Blantyre, the hearing opened on 5February 1697. The commission's task was to decide whether there was a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case against those accused by Shaw before they were committed for trial.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge must make a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case. This requires only an inference, not preponderance. Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual. A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E
5|$|Varner's In Nature's Interests? {{offers a}} {{resolution}} of the debate between individualistic approaches to animal rights and holistic accounts of environmental ethics. Varner defends an interest-based biocentric individualism according to which all living beings—including plants—have morally significant interests that ground <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> (though overridable) duties. The approach follows {{in the tradition of the}} work of Kenneth Goodpaster and Paul Taylor, though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in its focus on interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear utilitarian commitments.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, film {{director}} Sathish Paul filed a copyright infringement {{suit against the}} makers, saying that it had similarities to his script titled Oru Mazhakkalathu, written in 2013. The court passed an order saying that the movie had <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> similarities to Sathish' script, but allowed {{the making of the}} Tamil version Papanasam to proceed, on the condition that the makers of Drishyam produce a 10 lakh bank guarantee before the court to ensure the compensation. The case was dismissed in March 2015 as it was proved that Jeethu had written the script in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and conditions of her detention rendered the detention unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> lawful can become unlawful if the nature or conditions of the detention fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must be shown to exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions of the detention, not the lawfulness of the detention itself.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
5|$|By law, a valid unexpired Lebanese {{passport}} or Identity card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (transl. Bitakat Al Hawiya); French: Carte D'identité) is conclusive (and {{not just}} <b>prima</b> <b>facie)</b> proof of Lebanese citizenship, {{and has the}} same force and effect as proof of Lebanese citizenship as certificates of naturalization or of citizenship, if issued to a Lebanese citizen for the full period allowed by law. The Lebanese law does not prohibit Lebanese citizens from holding passports of other countries, though {{they are required to}} use their Lebanese passport to enter and leave the country. An expired Lebanese passport can still be used to return to the Republic of Lebanon at any port and port personnel are obliged by law to allow the passage of the bearer without any delay or hindrance. Lebanese passports are property of the Republic of Lebanon and must be returned to the Lebanese Government upon demand.|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court {{held that the}} Registrar had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the Registrar had been entitled to take, <b>prima</b> <b>facie,</b> the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had {{been shown to be}} incorrect. Although the Registrar had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the Registrar by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that the Registrar had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any compelling reason for the Registrar to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} NatWest Three — Giles Darby, David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew — were extradited to the United States in 2006 {{on charges}} relating to a transaction with Enron Corporation in 2000 {{while they were}} working for Greenwich NatWest. It {{has been argued that}} the alleged crime was committed by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the Americans do not have to produce a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case, or even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be justiciable before the High Court {{will hear the}} case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and judges are ill-equipped to decide the case because of their limited training, experience and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands {{in the conduct of}} affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E

25|$|Speed {{limits in}} Texas, Utah, and Rhode Island are <b>prima</b> <b>facie.</b> Some {{other states have}} a hybrid system: speed limits may be <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> {{up to a certain}} speed or only on certain roads. For example, speed limits in California up to 55mph, or 65mph on highways, are <b>prima</b> <b>facie,</b> and those at or above those speeds are absolute.|$|E
25|$|A {{successful}} <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> {{defense is}} rare. Not {{only does the}} burden of proof rest upon the accused, a successful defense may involve expenses well in excess of the cost of a ticket, such as an expert witness. Furthermore, because <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> defenses must be presented in a court, such a defense is difficult for out-of-town motorists.|$|E

25|$|Since the Crown {{never had}} much of a case against Megrahi, it was no {{surprise}} when the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) found <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> evidence in June 2007 that Megrahi had suffered a miscarriage of justice and recommended that he be granted a second appeal.|$|E

25|$|Most {{states have}} {{absolute}} speed limits, meaning that a speed {{in excess of}} the limit is illegal per se. However, some states have <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> speed limits. This allows motorists to defend against a speeding charge if it can be proven that the speed was in fact reasonable and prudent.|$|E
25|$|UNESCO {{designation}} as a World Heritage Site provides <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> {{evidence that}} such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected {{pursuant to the}} Law of War, under the Geneva Convention, its articles, protocols and customs, together with other treaties including the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and international law.|$|E
25|$|Representations {{will not}} lead to {{legitimate}} expectations when delegation of such power to the individual making the representation is forbidden by statute, or where the individual making the representation lacks actual or apparent authority. In the latter case, the applicant's expectation will lack legitimacy and thus would <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> not be binding on the public authority.|$|E
25|$|It has {{therefore}} {{been argued}} that the TRIPS standard of requiring all countries to create strict intellectual property systems will be detrimental to poorer countries' development.

25|$|Medical ethicists Linsey Goey and Emily Jackson {{argued that}} the 1998 SmithKline Beecham {{position}} paper, in which {{the company said it}} had decided not to show studies 329 and 377 to regulators, represented a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> breach of the Medicines Act 1968 and Medicines for Human Use Regulations, which required pharmaceutical companies to pass to the regulator trial data that had safety and efficacy implications.|$|E

25|$|On 4 February 2013, {{the court}} of special CBI judge Ravinder Kaur found {{sufficient}} <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> evidence and ordered framing of charges against all the accused. The charges framed were: cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and causing a loss of over Rs 900million under the Prevention of Corruption Act. As the accused pleaded not guilty, the court ordered that daily Criminal trial (for 5 days a week) will begin from 20 February.|$|E
25|$|For an {{expectation}} to be legitimate, the individual making the representation must have actual or apparent {{authority to make}} it on the behalf of the public authority. Such representations would <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> bind the public authority. Although representations made by an individual with apparent authority may have been made outside his or her powers, they are nevertheless legitimate as they fall within the scope of powers of the particular public body.|$|E
25|$|The MRHA's {{constitutionality}} has not {{yet been}} tested in court. The Act <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> violates Article 15(1) since the imposition of a restraining order effectively inhibits a person's rights to profess, practise and propagate his or her religion. However, given Parliament's rationales for the enactment of the MRHA, {{it is likely that the}} Act amounts to a general law relating to public order. Thus, its constitutionality may be preserved by Article 15(4).|$|E
25|$|However, as {{mentioned}} above, statutes may place {{the burden of}} proof on the defendant or make presumptions of facts which require the defendant to prove otherwise. In such circumstances, the reverse burden must be justifiable to avoid being struck down as unconstitutional. According to R v. Sin Yau Ming, a statutory provision is <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> unconstitutional if the defendant has to prove the essential elements of the offence. Moreover, the reverse burden must be justified under the Oakes test.|$|E
