40|$|The present paper {{summarizes}} some of {{the important}} biological and physiological data recorded over a 30 -year period on the biology of bonnet monkeys in captivity. Data on sexual maturity, menstrual cyclicity, general behaviour, endocrine profile, reproductive physiology, gestation, parturition, <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhoea</b> in the female, and sexual maturity, hormone profile, and seasonal variation in sperm count of the male monkeys are presented. In addition to the biological values, weights of selected organs, vertebral and dental pattern are also presented. Menarche occurred at an age of 36 +/- 4 months and the first conception in the colony occurred at an age of 54 +/- 4 months. The average menstrual cycle length was 28 +/- 4. 3 days. Majority of monkeys did not cycle regularly during March-June during which the temperature reached a peak. The pregnancy index of the colony was 80 % with controlled breeding. The gestation period was 166 +/- 5 days with 6 - 7 months <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhoea.</b> Males attained sexual maturity {{by the age of}} 6 - 7 years and exhibited the characteristic nocturnal surge of serum testosterone at this age and sperm concentration ranged from 116 - 799 millions/ejaculate...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive health surveys often face {{difficulties}} in measuring age and durations. Heaping is the phenomenon that certain dates, ages or durations are over- or underrepresented. Following the calendar method used in several Demographic and Health Surveys, {{the current research}} proposes {{the use of a}} local timepath calendar, based on time perceptions of women in South India. The objective of the calendar is to reduce heaping in the durations of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhoea,</b> breastfeeding, postpartum abstinence, and contraceptive use. The interviewer takes the respondent back in time using the local calendar; the memory of respondents is triggered by relating events to Indian festivals and other landmarks in the lives of people, enabling them to reply in their own time perspective. The method was tested in 2000 in a survey in South India; the findings indicate significantly less duration heaping...|$|E

40|$|Reported {{is the use}} of a {{simplified}} methodology for carrying out a community-based epidemiological assessment that is compatible with the goals of primary health care research. For this purpose, a current-status life table analysis of data from 1131 women who were served by community health workers in the State of México was used to determine the distributions of the duration of <b>postpartum</b> breast-feeding, <b>amenorrhoea,</b> and contraceptive use. The field methods used incorporated quality assurance procedures. At 1 month postpartum, 78 % of the infants were still being breast-fed, at 5 months 50 %, and at 12 months 25 %. The level of amenorrhoea at 1 month postpartum was 85 %, at 3 months 50 %, and at 5 months 25 %. Use of contraceptives was initiated at an early stage, with 42 % of all users beginning during the first month postpartum. The simplified method described permitted the area's primary health care administrators to carry out research projects for programme development rapidly and was compatible with the locally available resources...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the three}} major {{components}} of a closed birth interval, waiting time to conception can somehow be managed with effective contraceptives while gestation is universally constant in its duration; the duration of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhoea</b> (PPA) varies in complex nature. The present study aimed to investigate the proximate factors influencing the duration of PPA. A community-based, cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} four valley districts of Manipur, India, during 1 August− 31 December 2009, to analyze the differentials and determinants of duration of PPA, applying the survival analysis technique. In total, 1, 225 ever-married women were selected through two-stage cluster sampling. The median duration of PPA was 5. 7 months. Among the 11 explanatory variables of interest, only three variables—place of residence (p< 0. 05), infant mortality from preceding pregnancy (p< 0. 01), and duration of breastfeeding (p< 0. 01) — had a significant effect on the duration of PPA. The findings may be used as baseline information for future researchers and maternal health policy-makers...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses hazard {{regression}} models {{to assess the}} impact of experienced infant and child mortality on the risk of subsequent conceptions in Ethiopia. The purpose of this paper is to test for the presence of a fertility response to an infant or child death, net of the effects of truncated breastfeeding on fecundity. Using retrospective birth history data from a national survey in Ethiopia, we find a significantly higher risk of a conception in the months following the death of an index child, even after controlling for <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhoea</b> and breastfeeding status. The fertility response is strongest after the death of the fourth or fifth child, which is when most women in Ethiopia are at or near their desired family size. However, we find no evidence of a fertility response to the death of a nonindex child. We attribute the higher risk of a conception following an index child’s death to the intentional efforts of couples to reduce the waiting time to a next birth and thereby replace the deceased child. However, absent evidence of replacement fertility in response to the death of older nonindex children, we interpret the response to the death of an index child as an emotional response to child loss rather than a conscious strategy to meet a fertility target.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} whether breast feeding {{is related to}} subsequent risk of breast cancer. DESIGN [...] Population based case-control study designed primarily to investigate the relation between oral contraceptives and risk of breast cancer; data obtained from questionnaires administered by interviewers, general practitioner notes, and family planning clinic records. SETTING [...] 11 health regions in Britain. SUBJECTS [...] Women {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} before age 36 living in the defined study areas. One control per case, matched for age, was selected from the list of the case's general practitioner. 755 case-control pairs were interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Duration of breast feeding each liveborn infant; timing of return of menses; hormone use; other risk factors for breast cancer. RESULTS [...] Risk of breast cancer fell with increasing duration of breast feeding (relative risk = 0. 94 per three months' breast feeding; test for trend p = 0. 026) and with number of babies breast fed (relative risk = 0. 86; test for trend, p = 0. 017). Breast feeding each baby for longer than three months conferred no additional benefit. Breast feeding was more strongly negatively associated with risk of breast cancer than duration of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhoea</b> (chi 2 test for trend, p = 0. 69). Hormonal suppression of lactation was unrelated to risk of breast cancer (relative risk = 0. 96 per episode of suppressed lactation; test for trend, p = 0. 72). CONCLUSIONS [...] These results suggest that breast feeding protects against the development of breast cancer in young women...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} breastfeeding on long-term (breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus) and short-term (lactational <b>amenorrhoea,</b> <b>postpartum</b> depression, postpartum weight change) maternal health outcomes. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library and CABI databases. Outcome estimates of odds ratios or relative risks or standardised mean differences were pooled. In cases of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were explored. Results. Breastfeeding > 12 months was associated with reduced risk of breast and ovarian carcinoma by 26 % and 37 %, respectively. No conclusive evidence of an association between breastfeeding and bone mineral density was found. Breastfeeding was associated with 32 % lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Exclusive breastfeeding and predominant breastfeeding were associated with longer duration of amenorrhoea. Shorter duration of breastfeeding was associated with higher risk of postpartum depression. Evidence suggesting an association of breastfeeding with postpartum weight change was lacking. Conclusion. This review supports the hypothesis that breastfeeding is protective against breast and ovarian carcinoma, and exclusive breastfeeding and predominant breastfeeding increase the duration of lactational amenorrhoea. There is evidence that breastfeeding {{reduces the risk of}} type 2 diabetes. However, an association between breastfeeding and bone mineral density or maternal depression or postpartum weight change was not evident...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Fertility {{is a major}} counteracting {{force to}} {{population}} attrition from mortality and therefore, has a significant impact as an expansionary force in population dynamics. While mortality, on the other hand, checks the unlimited growth of population and regulates the distribution of individuals in different age groups. It {{is well known that}} increasing birth rates cause exposure to several social problems like crisis of minimum needs for survival and subsistence which includes scarcity of food and land, poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, etc. Information on fertility and mortality is relevant both to demographic assessment of the population and to assessment of health policies and programmes. Keeping this in mind, the present study was conducted among Hindu Gujjars of Delhi. The data for present study was collected by interviewing ever-married Gujjar women aged 15 - 49 years from a sample of 558 households. Fertility among Gujjars is higher than all Delhi population. Gujjar women are by and large reproductively active during prime childbearing ages of 20 - 29 years. Gujjar women tend to marry early and there is still a fair amount of fertility at very younger ages. Majority of pregnancies resulted in live births. For over three children born, around ninety percent are surviving. Infant and child mortality is relatively higher in groups where fertility is higher. The mean duration of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhoea</b> is 4. 9 months. Mean age at menarche is 13. 99 years while mean menopausal age is 44. 06 years. Though IMR is lower among Gujjars, but overall mortality (CDR) is slightly higher than all Delhi population with respiratory disorder being the primary cause of death...|$|E
40|$|In {{rural areas}} of Central Africa, on an average infants are breast fed 13 times per day during first 12 months. This is {{considered}} to be due to the poor nutritional status of mothers, and lack of milk is compensate for by frequent breast-feeding. <b>Postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhoea</b> is exceptionally prolonged, up to two years after childbirth, and certain indications suggest that mother's poor nutritional state is in a large part responsible for this. There is an influence of nutritional state on reappearance of menstruation in the postpartum period and also on length of fertility. Infanticide and permanent abandonment of infants was widespread in many levels of western society up to the beginning of 20 th century. Physicians reestablished the mother-child relationship and advocated breast-feeding as the best way to nourish a baby. Recently a trend towards promoting maternal breast-feeding has developed and it is likely to observe new changes in infants' diet in next 10 years. A study showed all mothers nursed their infants at birth but urban mothers produced more milk compared to mothers in rural areas, whereas the latter had shorter duration of post partum amenorrhoea. In the city, mothers who have to leave their children for some part of the day cannot breast-feed in optimal fashion; and the economic level does not allow for a sufficient diet for baby based on commercial baby food. Many of the babies who do not die are drawn into a vicious cycle of malnutrition and disease that will leave them physically and intellectually stunted for life. There are factors other than formula feeding which is responsible for a decrease in breast-feeding practice. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|In urban Bangladesh, as in {{many other}} settings, an {{immediate}} postpartum family planning strategy prevails, where providers seek to promote and provide contraception at 40 - 45 days following birth to women regardless of their breastfeeding or menstrual status. Despite such practices, the majority of women choose to delay the initiation of contraception until menses resumes, often several months after birth. The present paper seeks to explain this discrepancy by describing poor, urban women's understandings regarding the chances of conception and the risks associated with contraceptive use in the postpartum period. Findings from in-depth interviews reveal that the majority of women perceive no personal risk of pregnancy during amenorrhoea, though most do not recognise an association between this diminished risk of conception and breastfeeding. In addition, the data illustrate that women are primarily concerned with their own and their newly born child's health and well-being in the period following childbirth, both of which are perceived to be extremely vulnerable. These perceptions, plus an understanding that modern methods of contraception are "strong" and potentially damaging to the health, mean that the majority of women are reluctant to adopt family planning methods soon after birth, particularly during <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhoea.</b> The paper advocates that, since breastfeeding affords good protection against pregnancy for six to nine months following birth, efforts should be made to actively incorporate lactational amenorrhoea into postpartum family planning strategies in Bangladesh. Recommendations are also made for ways in which women may be encouraged to adopt contraception during amenorrhoea beyond the period of high natural protection. The paper highlights the importance of taking the client's perspective into consideration in attempts to improve the quality and effectiveness of family planning programmes. postpartum contraception lactational amenorrhoea Bangladesh...|$|E
