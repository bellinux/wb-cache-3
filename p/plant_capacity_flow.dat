40|$|Determination of {{safe yield}} {{of a water}} source is a basic aspect of water supply planning. In this report, the safe yield {{is defined as the}} maximum {{constant}} release from a reservoir that is possible during a selected drought period. The yield depends on drought magnitude and duration controlled by nature and ability to manipulate the releases through man made controls in the form of impoundment structures and regulations. A water supply system with two reservoirs in series and one in parallel in Spotsylvania County – the Hunting Run Reservoir, the Motts Run Reservoir (in series), and the Ni River Reservoir is considered to demonstrate the yield calculations. When several reservoirs are considered, the critical periods (defined as the period from full storage to empty condition) may not coincide and the system must be analyzed for the binding critical duration. A zero-one linear integer programming formulation is proposed to compute the system yield. The formulation accommodates the various storage and river flow dependent instream flow requirements. It is found that the water treatment <b>plant</b> <b>capacity,</b> instream <b>flow</b> requirements, and flows themselves limit th...|$|R

40|$|The {{specification}} of a convex production {{technology is a}} potential issue in estimating firm-level Johansen <b>plant</b> <b>capacity</b> utilisation rates and their subsequent use in the short-run Johansen industry capacity model of the fishery. There are different <b>plant</b> <b>capacity</b> utilisation estimates with convex and nonconvex technologies. When entered as parameters in the short-run Johansen industry model, this leads to different distributions in the activity vectors. With non-convex technology, more vessels remain active in the fleet, {{and there is no}} longer an overestimation of the number of decommissioned vessels compared to the use of a convex technology. A second methodological reflection involves a way to trace the evolution of capacity over time and the possibility of formulating multi-period, short-run Johansen industry models using appropriate discrete time Malmquist productivity indices.

The report examines the current state of CAES technology including examples of operational and planned facilities. It further evaluates the potential challenges and benefits of the use of CAES in South Africa. A high level proposal for <b>plant</b> design <b>capacity</b> is documented, and potential costs for construction thereof are estimated. The cost of a CAES plant is compared to generating options using the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) method. The study proposes that by 2018 additional peaking <b>plant</b> <b>capacity</b> will be required and that a CAES plant able to provide additional capacity up to 3 500 MW would help to alleviate the potential shortfall which may be experienced at this time. The report further proposes conversion of underground mines for use as air receivers for high pressure storage of large volumes of compressed air required for CAES. The research report concludes that CAES presents a feasible solution to the potential future shortfall in peaking <b>plant</b> <b>capacity</b> in South Africa, and that site identification and construction of a suitable storage cavern presents the main obstacle to the implementation of this technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is a review of {{published}} investigations regarding the economy of ethanol production from lignocellulosic material The objective is to present relations between and tendencies observed in different cost estimates. The influence of <b>plant</b> <b>capacity</b> and overall product yield on the ethanol production cost is investigated, as well as variations in capital costs in the different processes. The underlying technical and economic assumptions show a large variation between the various studies published. The variation in the ethanol production cost is large, from 18 to 151 US cent/l. The most important factor for the economic outcome is the overall ethanol yield. Other important parameters are the feedstock cost, which was found to vary between 22 and 61 US$/dry metric ton, and the <b>plant</b> <b>capacity,</b> which influences the capital cost. It is shown {{that there is a}} tendency towards a decrease in ethanol production cost with an increase in <b>plant</b> <b>capacity</b> for the enzymatic processes.
