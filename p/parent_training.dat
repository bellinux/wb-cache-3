40|$|Mindful <b>parenting</b> <b>training</b> is an {{application}} of mindfulness-based interventions that allows parents to perceive their children with unbiased and open attention without prejudgment and become more attentive and less reactive in their parenting. This study examined the effectiveness of mindful <b>parenting</b> <b>training</b> in a clinical setting on child and parental psychopathology and of mindfulness {{as a predictor of}} these outcomes. Seventy parents of 70 children (mean age[*]=[*] 8. 7) who were referred to a mental health care clinic because of their children’s psychopathology participated in an 8 -week mindful <b>parenting</b> <b>training.</b> <b>Parents</b> completed questionnaires at pre-test, post-test and 8 -week follow-up. A significant decrease was found in children’s and parents’ psychopathology and a significant increase in mindful parenting and in general mindful awareness. Improvement in general mindful awareness, but not mindful parenting, was found to predict a reduction in parental psychopathology, whereas improvement in mindful parenting, but not general mindful awareness, predicted the reduction of child psychopathology. This study adds to the emerging body of evidence indicating that mindful <b>parenting</b> <b>training</b> is effective for parents themselves and, indirectly, for their children suffering from psychopathology. As parents’ increased mindful parenting, but not increased general mindfulness, is found to predict child psychopathology, mindful <b>parenting</b> <b>training</b> rather than general mindfulness training appears to be the training of choice. However, RCTs comparing mindful parenting to general mindfulness <b>training</b> and to <b>parent</b> management <b>training</b> are needed in order to shed more light on the effects of mindful parenting and mechanisms of change...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the {{differences}} between two; methods for <b>training</b> <b>parents</b> in child management skills. Group I, the educational training group, consisted of seven parents, while Group II, the competency-based training group, bad five participants. Two dependent measures, time-out and instruction giving, were assessed during simulations with a confederate. Probes were also taken during analogue situations between the parent and child. Follow-up probes were conducted at six- and twelve-weeks for the EFTG, and at 8 -weeks for the CBTG. Data was subjected to an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to determine statistical differences between groups. A multiple baseline across skill domains was also used to assess clinical changes between groups and within individuals. Findings <b>Parents</b> <b>trained</b> in the CBTG performed significantly better, in both time-out and instruction giving skill domains, than did <b>parents</b> <b>trained</b> within the educational format. All five CBTG parents achieved a mastery level of 90 % or higher. <b>Parents</b> <b>trained</b> through the traditional educational methods were unable to achieve mastery in either, skill domain. Subsequent to the introduction of competency training, all but one of the EFTG parents were able to reach mastery. The parent who was unable to reach mastery, was unable to do so in either skill domain. All parents were satisfied with service delivery regardless of treatment received. Parents also reported similar changes in their child's behavior throughout the course of the training program. Conclusions Competency-based training methods were far superior to the more traditional educational approach in shaping parents behavior (i. e., time-out and instruction giving skills). Parent perceptions of changes in their own behavior are a poor indicator of measured change. Parent's reported satisfaction is a poor prognosticator for termination of treatment services. Thesis (D.

Controls were asked to wait for the duration of the experimental period and were then offered a parenting class. Subjects rated child conduct problems at screening, after the 6 weeks of treatment, and at a 1 month follow up. Measures assessing attributions of behavior change and satisfaction with counseling were administered at the close of the 6 week treatment schedule. ^ Results indicated that: First, there was no significant difference between the telephone, traditional <b>parent</b> education <b>training</b> conditions, and the controls in the level of problem child conduct behavior.

40|$|Introduction. The {{number of}} {{children}} and youngsters with antisocial behaviour is estimated at 4 to 10 % of the total Flemish population. This means {{it is the most}} frequent mental health problem with children and adolescents. The prognosis of children showing antisocial behaviour is not favourable. Longitudinal research shows a high level of stability of antisocial behaviour. The cost for the community of children and adolescents with antisocial behaviour is very high. Ecological interventions are seen as necessary. However, they are very costly. The presentation will examine the effectiveness of a <b>parent</b> management <b>training</b> in comparison with an ecological intervention. Method. In this study 90 families with young children (4 - 7 yrs) having conduct problems were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three conditions: (1) a <b>parent</b> management <b>training</b> group, (2) an ecological intervention including a <b>parent</b> management <b>training,</b> a child training and an intervention at school or (3) a waiting list condition. Parents and children were assessed before and after the treatment and at 1 -year follow-up. The <b>parent</b> management <b>training</b> consists of 10 sessions spread over a 6 -month period. Parents were seen in groups of 8 - 10 parents. The aim of the <b>parent</b> management <b>training</b> group is to reinforce the prosocial behaviour of the child and to reduce antisocial behaviour in the natural context where it occurs via operant techniques. In the ecological intervention, the teachers received the same program. The child training focuses on the child’s social skills and problem solving behaviour.
