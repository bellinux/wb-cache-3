5000|$|Conventional FTCD has {{limitations}} {{for the study}} of cerebral lateralization. For example, it may not differentiate the lateralising effects due to stimulus characteristics from those due to light responsiveness, and does not distinguish between flow signals emanating from cortical and subcortical branches of the cerebral arteries of the circle of Willis. Each basal cerebral artery of the circle of Willis gives origin to two different systems of secondary vessels. The shorter of these two is called the ganglionic system, and the vessels belonging to it supply the thalami and corpora striata; the longer is the cortical system, and its vessels ramify in the pia mater and supply the cortex and subjacent brain substance. Furthermore, the cortical branches are divisible into two classes: long and short. The long or medullary arteries pass through the grey substance and penetrate the subjacent white substance to the depth of 3-4 cm. The short vessels are confined to the cortex. Both cortical and ganglionic systems do not communicate at any point in their peripheral distribution, but are entirely independent of each other, having between the parts supplied by the two systems, a borderline of diminished nutritive activity. While, the vessels of the ganglionic system are terminal vessels, the vessels of the cortical arterial system are not so strictly [...] "terminal". Blood flow in these two systems in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory supplies 80% of both hemispheres, including most neural substrates implicated in facial processing, language processing and intelligence processing at cortical and subcortical structures. The measurements of mean blood flow velocity (MFV) in the MCA main stem could potentially provide information about downstream changes at cortical and subcortical sites within the MCA territory. Each distal arm of the MCA vascular system could be separated into [...] "near" [...] and [...] "far" [...] distal reflection sites for the cortical and ganglionic (subcortical) systems, respectively. To accomplish this objective, one method is to apply Fourier analysis to the periodic time series of MFV acquired during cognitive stimulations. Fourier analysis would yield peaksrepresenting pulsatile energy from reflection sites at various harmonics, which are multiples of the fundamental frequency. McDonald in 1974 showed that the first five harmonics usually contain 90% of the entire pulsatile energy within the system of pressure/flow oscillations in the peripheral circulation. It could be presumed that each arm of the vascular system represents a single viscoelastic tube terminated by impedance, creating a single reflection site. Psychophysiologic stimulation induced vasomotor activity at each terminal site sets up a standing sinusoidal wave oscillation, comprising a summation of waves due to effects of incident, reflected, and re-reflected waves from distal to proximal point of measurement. fTCDS studies are performed with the participant placed in a supine posture with their head up at about 30 degrees. The <b>probe</b> <b>holder</b> headgear (e.g. LAM-RAK, DWL, Sipplingen, Germany) are used with a base support on two earplugs and on the nasal ridge. Two 2-MHz probes are affixed in the <b>probe</b> <b>holder</b> and insonation performed to determine the optimal position for continuous monitoring of both MCA main stems at 50 mm depth {{from the surface of the}} probe. A serial recording of MFV for each stimulus is acquired and latter used for Fourier analysis. Fourier transform algorithm uses standard software (for example, Time series and forecasting module, STATISTICA, StatSoft, Inc.). The most efficient standard Fourier algorithm requires that the length of the input series is equal to a power of 2. If this is not the case, additional computations have to be performed. To derive the required time series, the data were averaged in 10-second segments for 1-minute duration or each stimulus, yielding 6 data points for each participant and a total of 48 data points for all eight men and women, respectively. Smoothing the periodogram values was accomplished using a weighted moving average transformation. Hamming window was applied as a smoother. The spectral density estimates, derived from single series Fourier analysis, were plotted, and the frequency regions with the highest estimates were marked as peaks. The origins of the peaks are of interest in order to determine the reliability of the present technique. The fundamental (F), cortical (C) or memory (M), and subcortical (S) peaks occurred at regular frequency intervals of 0.125, 0.25, and 0.375, respectively. These frequencies could be converted to Hz, assuming that the fundamental frequency of cardiac oscillation was the mean heart rate. The fundamental frequency (F) of the first harmonic could be determined from the mean heart rate per second. For example, a heart rate of 74 bpm, suggests 74 cycles/60 or 1.23 Hz. In other words, the F-, C-, and S-peaks occurred at multiples of the first harmonic, at second and third harmonics, respectively. The distance of the reflection site for F-peak could be presumed to emanate from a site at D1 = wavelength/4 = cf/4 = 6.15 (m/s)/(4×1.23 Hz) = 125 cm, where c is the assumed wave propagation velocity of the peripheral arterial tree according to McDonald, 1974.Given the vascular tortuosity, the estimated distance approximates that from the measurement site in the MCA main stem, to an imaginary site of summed reflections from the upper extremities, close to the finger tips when stretchedsideways. The C-peak occurred at the secondharmonic, such that the estimated arterial length (using common carotidc = 5.5 m/s) was given by D2 = wavelength/8 = cf2/8 = 28 cm, and a frequency f of 2.46 Hz. The distance approximates the visible arterial length from the main stem of the MCA, through vascular tortuosity and around the cerebral convexity, to the end vessels at distal cortical sites such as the occipito-temporal junction oncarotid angiograms of adults. The S-peak occurred at the third harmonic, and may have arisen from an estimated site at D3= wavelength/16 = cf3/16 = 9.3 cm and a frequency f3 of 3.69 Hz. The latter approximates the visible arterial length of the lenticulostriate vessels from the main stem of the MCA on carotid angiograms. Although not displayed, the fourth harmonic would be expected to arise from the MCA bifurcation in closest proximity tothe measurement site in the main stem of the MCA. The pre-bifurcationlength from the measurement point would be given by D4 = wavelength/32 = cf4/32 = 3.5 cm and a frequency f4 of 4.92 Hz. The calculated distance approximates that of the segment of MCA main stem just after the carotid bifurcation, where probably the ultrasound sample volume was placed, to the MCA bifurcation. Thus, these estimates approximate actual lengths. However, it has been suggested that the estimated distances may not correlate exactly with known morphometric dimensions of the arterial tree according to Campbell et al., 1989. The method was first described by Philip Njemanze in 2007, and was referred to as functional transcranial Doppler spectroscopy (fTCDS). fTCDS examines spectral density estimates of periodic processes induced during mental tasks, and hence offers a much more comprehensive picture of changes related to effects of a given mental stimulus. The spectral density estimates would be least affected by artefacts that lack periodicity, and filtering would reduce the effect of noise. The changes at the C-peak may show cortical long-term potential (CLTP) or cortical long-term depression (CLTD), which has been proposed to be suggest equivalents of cortical activity during learning [...] and cognitive processes. The flow velocity tracings are monitored during paradigm 1 comprising a checkerboard square as object perception are compared to whole face (paradigm 2) and facial element sorting task (paradigm 3). Fast Fourier transform calculations are used to obtain the spectral density and cross amplitude plots in the left and right middle cerebral arteries. The C-peak also called memory (M-peak) cortical peak could be seen arising during paradigm 3, a facial element sorting task requiring iterative memory recall as a subject constantly spatially fits the puzzle by matching each facial element in paradigm 3 to that stored in memory (Paradigm 2) before proceeding to form the picture of the whole face.|$|E

This study examined bacterial contamination of Doppler ultrasound probes (USP) in routine use on vascular surgical wards in six hospitals and the knowledge of staff {{about the potential for}} cross infection from contaminated probes. Methods: probe head impressions and swab cultures of <b>probe</b> <b>holders</b> were plated on mannitol salt agar before and after cleaning with a paper towel. Putative S. aureus isolates were identified to species level and susceptibility to selected antimicrobials tested. Concurrently, junior medical staff were surveyed about probe cleaning protocols. Results: methicillin susceptible S. aureus was isolated from 2 / 21 (10 %) with near confluent bacterial growth from six others (28 %). The latter may have obscured low numbers of S. aureus. Further since swabs were plated without prior enrichment culture, it is likely that contamination with S. aureus might have been underestimated. No positive cultures were obtained after wiping the USP with a paper towel. 22 / 23 (95 %) junior doctors failed to clean the USP prior to use. Conclusion: USP contamination with pathogenic bacteria occurs under “in-use” conditions and junior medical staff are unaware of simple measures to prevent this. Strict guidelines for USP cleaning between patient use should, therefore, be adopted particularly when monitoring postoperative graft patency...|$|R

In this study we further tested that notion. A total of eight (6 male, 2 female) subjects participated (Part 1 n = 7; Part 2 n = 5, 4 of whom participated in Part 1). Skin blood flow was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Control of local skin and body temperatures was achieved with Peltier cooler/heater <b>probe</b> <b>holders</b> and water perfused suits, respectively. Microdialysis fibres were inserted aseptically. Saline, l-NAME (20 mm; to inhibit NOS activity) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP 10 μm) were infused by microdialysis. Bretylium tosylate (BT), to block adrenergic function, was administered by iontophoresis. CVC was calculated from blood flow and blood pressure. Part 1 was designed to determine the relative roles of the NO and the adrenergic systems. The infusion of l-NAME elicited a 35 ± 4 % decrease in CVC at the l-NAME and BT +l-NAME sites (P 0. 05). Part 2 was designed to test whether LC influences were specific to the NOS enzymes. Two sites were pretreated with both BT and l-NAME.

There was a 24 ± 10 % decrease (P 0. 05) at sites treated with BT +l-NAME only.

30|$|Long {{duration}} {{application of}} transcranial Doppler (TCD) for recording of middle cerebral artery (MCA) {{cerebral blood flow}} velocity (CBFV) has been fraught with difficulties [1, 2]. Classically, TCD has been labor-intensive, with limited ability to obtain uninterrupted recordings for extended periods. Furthermore, application of TCD within neurocritically ill for long durations has been limited given the complexity of care, regular bedside nursing care/patient manipulations, and presence of various other multi-modal monitoring devices. This is especially the case in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, with the adoption of extensive multi-modal monitoring. Within TBI, most TCD recordings, using standard widely available <b>probes</b> and <b>holders,</b> range from 30  min to 1 -h duration and are frequently interrupted due to shifting of the probe and signal loss [3, 4].

40|$|AbstractThe tunable {{electrical}} properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) {{make it an}} ideal candidate for many applications including energy storage.

For these measurements, there is no correlation between the electrode distance and the measured resistance indicating that contact resistance varies and dominates the measurements. There is, however, a correlation between increasing number of wrinkles underneath the probe and decreasing resistance, indicating that the wrinkles can provide surface area for contact with the probe and thus lower the resistance. The overall resistance is on the order of single kΩ, if the contact between the probe and the rGO is optimized.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{is to develop a}} miniature Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This analytical instrument would potentially be used for in-situ, in-field and in-process monitoring, characterization and identification of various chemical compounds. The intended spectral resolution of the NMR spectrometer is better than 0. 1 ppm (parts per million). The development of the miniature NMR spectrometer will rely, in part, on the microfabrication technology that includes photolithography, chemical etching, thin film processing and other techniques originally developed in microelectronics. Miniaturization of the NMR spectrometer will involve the miniaturization of the inductive NMR probes used to pick-up the NMR signals. It will also involve integration of the <b>probe,</b> sample <b>holder</b> and magnetic field correction (shimming) coils into a single miniature system. Lastly, it will involve the development of a hand-held permanent magnet capable of creating magnetic field of over 1 Tesla with uniformity of about 1 part per million over the extent of the sample. The advantage of the developed instrument will not only be its portability, but also its ability to handle nono-liter quantities of fluids. As of today, the following tasks have been completed. (1) Scaled versions (800 micron diameter) of the NMR inductive probes have been designed, fabricated and tested for their radio frequency properties. The resulting probe design, which can be called a scroll coil, {{has been found to be}} suitable for further miniaturization and compatible with the existing microfabrication technology. In addition tests and analysis indicate and this design will also provide higher sensitivity to NMR signals per unit volume of the sample than other proposed miniature NMR probes. Analysis and tests of the scroll coil design revealed a surprising fact that the sensitivity of the scroll coil is much better when the conductor thickness is smaller than the conductor skin depth. This result defies the conventional rules of NMR probe design which prescribe that conductors should be thicker than their own skin depth. (2) As samples and NMR probes become smaller, the problem of the NMR spectrum dispersion caused by the mismatch in the magnetic susceptibility of the sample and its surroundings becomes more pronounced. A method and a computer code for numerical modeling of the NMR spectrum dispersion has been developed. Upper bounds on the errors in the spectrum calculation have been derived. The developed numerical techniques have been applied to design NMR probes that introduce as little distortion as possible to the NMR spectrum. These designs rely on passive shimming (magnetic field correction) by specially patterned parts of the coil. (3) Initial evaluation of a commercially available permanent magnet (from Drexel Corporation) capable of delivering a 2 Tesla field has been carried out using numerical modeling. ...|$|R
30|$|A {{continuously}} operating active probe is, therefore, developed {{which does}} not need to be calibrated and which compensates the environmental effects as well as the heat conduction by the <b>probe</b> <b>holder.</b> By means of controlled electrical heating the probe is set to a given working temperature and then the energy supply supporting the fixed operating temperature is measured. The energy influx by the plasma is compensated by decreasing the heating power and is directly displayed in J/cm 2 s. Some practical measurements are presented. Even, if the probe is designed as double probe the directionality of the energy influx can be determined.|$|E
