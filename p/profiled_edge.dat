40|$|A {{literature}} review undertaken for Transit NZ {{has found that}} delineation has {{a significant effect on}} driver behaviour with, for example, shoulder rumble strips reducing run-off-theroad crashes by between 22 % and 80 % (average of 32 % for all crashes and 44 % for fatal run-of-the-road crashes). The concern that enhancing roadway delineation may sometimes be accompanied by an unwanted increase in drivers’ speeds (known as behavioural adaptation) is not borne out by the research and appears to be a phenomenon associated with a few restricted situations (e. g. where a centre line is added to an otherwise unmarked road). The preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that <b>profiled</b> <b>edge</b> lines and centre lines provide drivers with positive guidance and produce significant reductions in crashes as a result of improving drivers’ lateral position. Further, unlike other safety measures that show decreased effectiveness over time due to a novelty effect, profiled lane delineation continues to work regardless of driver familiarity. There is no published research to suggest that <b>profiled</b> <b>edge</b> lines will decrease the effectiveness of a profiled centre line or will result in an increase in crash rates or an increase in the severity of crashes. However it has also been noted that local conditions have a major influence on the level of benefits that can be achieved through improved delineation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} research which investigates whether <b>profiled</b> <b>edge</b> markings {{can reduce}} the number of accidents related to those occasions when vehicles go off course and leave the carriageway. The first part of this study determined the scope and nature of accidents where the vehicle leaves the carriageway. It was shown that the proportion of accidents where the vehicle leaves the carriageway with respect to motorway road sections is about 32 % {{of the total number of}} accidents. On national secondary roads, this figure is 26. 5 %. On national roads with restricted access, the proportion of accidents where the vehicle leaves the carriageway is slightly over 12 %. In addition, an increased risk was noted with respect to leaving the carriageway during wet road conditions and particularly when there was no lighting. The second part of the study calculated that the application of profiled markings would have a relatively high cost effectiveness. The third part of the study offers a selection of road sections for a subsequent evaluation study into the effect of profiled markings on accidents...|$|E

40|$|In human vision {{the first}} level of {{processing}} is edge detection. Edges {{are determined by the}} transitions from dark points to bright points in an image. For this paper, we consider an <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> model representing a boundary or edge in an image. From this model we can determine the strength of the edge, the width of the edge, and either the transition from dark to bright to dark or the transition from bright to dark to bright. Our first step was to take the given <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> and determine the type of edge that is represented and the characteristics of the edge, such as that of the varying width of the edge as the variable a is either increased or decreased. In the next step, we calculated the derivate of the <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> model. The final step involved utilizing the properties of the function defined by the derivative.

40|$|Part I of this two-part paper {{proposed}} a robust way to detect local points on linear-isophote surface in an image. Only {{a subset of}} these points corresponds to linear surface in image irradiance and provides useful information about the camera response function (CRF). In Part II, we show that, for some images, this subset of linear points could constitute a very {{small portion of the}} candidate set and the remaining points are often considered as noise. Our previous approach was to eliminate the noise using a learning-based method. The learning-based method could only reduce the noise but not eliminate it completely. Hence, it fails when the proportion of linear points is too small. As a main contribution in Part II, we introduce the concept of <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> and consider the candidate points as discrete samples of an <b>edge</b> <b>profile.</b> Instead of eliminating the unwanted candidate points as noise, we use them to instantiate the <b>edge</b> <b>profiles.</b> Assuming that every <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> has a linear component in image irradiance, the interactions of the <b>edge</b> <b>profiles</b> in the space of linear geometric invariants may correspond to the linear part which is CRF-indicating.

To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} soft contact lens midperipheral shape <b>profile</b> and <b>edge</b> design on the apparent epithelial thickness and indentation of the ocular surface with lens movement. Methods. Four soft contact lens designs comprising of two different plano midperipheral shape <b>profiles</b> and two <b>edge</b> designs (chiseled and knife edge) of silicone-hydrogel material were examined in 26 subjects aged 24. 7 ± 4. 6 years, each worn bilaterally in randomized order. Lens movement was imaged enface on insertion, at 2 and 4 hours with a high-speed, high-resolution camera simultaneous to the cross-section of {{the edge of the}} contact lens interaction with the ocular surface captured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) nasally, temporally, and inferiorly. Optical imaging distortions were individually corrected for by imaging the apparent distortion of a glass slide surface by the removed lens. Results. Apparent epithelial thickness varied with edge position (P < 0. 001). When distortion was corrected for, epithelial indentation decreased with time after insertion (P = 0. 010), changed after a blink (P < 0. 001), and varied with position on the lens edge (P < 0. 001), with the latter being affected by midperipheral lens shape <b>profile</b> and <b>edge</b> design. Horizontal and vertical lens movement did not change with time postinsertion. Vertical motion was affected by midperipheral lens shape profile (P < 0. 001) and edge design (P < 0. 001). Lens movement was associated with physiologic epithelium thickness for lens midperipheral shape <b>profile</b> and <b>edge</b> designs. Conclusions. Dynamic OCT coupled with high-resolution video demonstrated that soft contact lens movement and image-corrected ocular surface indentation were influenced by both lens edge design and midperipheral lens shape profiles...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{perforation}} <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> in micro-perforated plates (MPPs) is investigated and compared with the sharp edge case. MPPs are metal plates with small holes (perforations) that absorb incident sound waves using the Stokes boundary layers developed inside and {{in the vicinity of}} the perforations. The perforation diameter should be optimized so that the Stokes layers cover almost the entire perforation thus maximizing the absorbed sound energy due to viscosity. Hence, designing MPPs is a tuning problem. The existing analytical model for evaluating the transfer impedance of the MPPs is based on the assumption that the <b>edge</b> <b>profiles</b> of the perforations are sharp. In other words, the angle between the plate surface and the inner surface of the perforation is 90 ◦;. This case is not very practical to achieve in mass production of MPPs, since the perforations are formed by drilling and / or punching in manufacturing. To investigate {{the effect of}} the <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> on the performance of the MPP, we design samples with different <b>edge</b> <b>profiles</b> such as sharp and 45 ◦-chamfers on both edges. We carry out open-end reflection coefficient measurements in a semi-anechoic room with 6 microphones. The relative error of this setup is measured to be less than 0. 5 % for closed-end reflection coefficient between 100 Hz and 700 Hz in the linear regime.

We have {{analyzed}} {{the results of}} the Gaussian decomposition of the Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey (LDS) of galactic neutral hydrogen for the pres-ence of Gaussians probably not directly related to galactic H i emission.

The narrowest Gaussians, obtained during the decomposition, mostly represent stronger random noise peaks in profiles and some still uncorrected radio-interferences. Many of slightly wider weak Gaussians are caused by in-creased uncertainties near the <b>profile</b> <b>edges</b> and with the still increasing width the baseline problems become dominating among weak components.
