40|$|Research about {{consciousness}} from a neurobiological {{perspective is}} one of the most controversial issues in the broad domain of neuroscience. Traditionally, consciousness has been defined as subjective and private experience that arises from multiple neuronal activities and it includes our thoughts, memories and imaging.

From an evolutionary <b>perspective,</b> <b>consciousness</b> may be conceived as the result of complex cognitive skills leading to claim that it is distributed in phylogeny even beyond social mammals. From the relationship between consciousness and cognition, two theories have been widely discussed: the Dynamic Core and the Global Workspace.

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} few years {{numerous}} proposals have appeared that attempt to characterize consciousness in terms of what could be called its computational correlates: Principles of information processing with which to characterize the differences between conscious and unconscious processing. Proposed computational correlates include architectural specialization (such as the involvement of specific regions of the brain in conscious processing), properties of representations (such as their stability in time or their strength), and properties of specific processes (such as resonance, synchrony, interactivity, or information integration). In exactly the same way as one can engage in a search for the neural correlates of consciousness, one can thus search for the computational correlates of consciousness. The most direct way of doing is to contrast models of conscious versus unconscious information processing. In this paper, I review these developments and illustrate how computational modeling of specific cognitive processes can be useful in exploring and in formulating putative computational principles through which to capture the differences between conscious and unconscious cognition.

Knowledge, (k) nerves and know-how: The role of explicit versus implicit knowledge in the breakdown of a complex motor skill under pressure.

Consciousness and Cognition, 16 (2), 456 - 468. ] showed that they also remain stable under conditions of anaerobic fatigue that would have significantly challenged the survival skills of our ancestors. Here we examine the stability of an implicitly learned motor skill under fatigue conditions that primarily tax a different physiological system (the aerobic system), but which have equally strong evolutionary connotations.

40|$|Sandro Nannini, Unconscious, {{consciousness}} and intentionality in cognitive naturalism New studies on unconscious show an increasing reciprocal interest between psychoanalysts {{on the one}} hand and neuroscientists and philosophers of mind oriented toward naturalism and materialism on the other hand. Such an orientation was already manifest in Freud’s Entwurf der Psychologie and other essays. Moreover Freud could deny Descartes’ identification of mind to consciousness thanks to F. Brentano’s concept of intentionality. Freud could maintain that unconscious states such lapsus are strictly mental acts endowed with a goal, a content and a meaning, although they are not conscious, only because he followed Brentano and did not define mentality by its identification to consciousness but by its being endowed with intentionality. However, Freud unlike Brentano was not a dualist and oscillated between materialism and functionalism with regard to the Mind-Body Problem. Therefore, one can read in Freud’s psychoanalysis the attempt to reconcile naturalism with an anticartesian concept of mentality based on intentionality and not on consciousness. The same attempt can be recognized in philosophers of mind such as D. C. Dennett or the Churchlands. More in general, {{consciousness and}} the self can be naturalized only if intentionality has been previously reduced to a first order property of brain dynamics. In this <b>perspective</b> <b>consciousness</b> is reducible to a higher order property (a “format”) that gives unity and coherence to certain parts of brain activity. To sum up, those psychoanalysts who correct Freud’s theories in the light of contemporary neurosciences do not betray him but realize his deepest aspiration...|$|E

40|$|After having {{ignored it}} {{for over a}} century, science is again facing the problem of consciousness. Many {{scholars}} believe that soon, {{with the aid of}} new neuroimaging methods, {{it will be possible to}} comprehend the fundamental aspects of consciousness. Consciousness, however, differs radically from the ordinary objects researched by science: not only because of the complexity of the neural infrastructures which are at its base or because of the subtle connection of these infrastructures with phenomena such as decision making, morals and artistic creativity, but above all because of that which gives life to the qualitative dimension and to the subjectivity of its states. In this sense, self-awareness, perception, intentionality, qualia, and free will are not characteristics which are separate from consciousness, but rather aspects of the same phenomenon. If it is true that consciousness is caused by specific neuronal processes and, therefore, conscious states are causally reducible to neurobiological processes, it is also true that conscious states exist at a higher level than a few bundles of neurons. Accounts in the first person are real phenomena from the real world. For this reason we cannot reduce consciousness solely to its biological bases, because such a reduction to the third person would exclude experience in the first person. It is necessary, once and for all, not only to go beyond a hierarchical idea of levels of consciousness, but also to refute the idea according to which the 'mental' sphere is qualitative, subjective, and in the 'first person', while the 'physical' sphere is quantitative, objective and in the 'third person'. There are no plausible reasons for why a physical system, such as a human being or an animal, cannot have qualitative, subjective and intentional states.

40|$|Global {{education}} {{has emerged as}} a new educational response to the challenges and conditions of globalisation. Global education, however, has led to an on-going and vigorous debate among global scholars. Global education scholars have criticised nation-centric curricular and educational approaches of countries across the world for inadequately preparing students for the twenty-first century. The critical and post-colonial global scholars have also offered critique to global education for its failure to address economic inequity, dependency, structural violence, and the hegemonic processes of neoliberal globalisation (Kapoor, 2009 and Chana, 2011). Critique further indicates global {{education has}} failed to provide a multi-perspectival theoretical framework that truly represents views of the world’s diverse societies, nations and cultures (Kapoor, 2014 and Merryfield, 2009). The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore global education dimensions in the national curriculum of Pakistan Studies (class X-XII) for developing students’ global perspectives in schools. This research drawing upon colonial and post-colonial theoretical frameworks builds on the theoretical framework of one worldism (Pike and Selby, 2001), orientalism (Said, 1978), coloniality of power (Mignolo, 2000 and Quijano, 2000)) and southern theory (Connell, 2007). Employing two theoretical perspectives, this research analyses global education dimensions and practices in the national curriculum of Pakistan Studies, with specific reference to ethnocentric and Western-centric theoretical critiques. A case study method based on the interpretive approach was used to study Pakistan Studies curriculum practices of global education in two schools (one public and one private) in Chitral. The study employed qualitative data gathering strategies, particularly document analyses, semi-structured and open-ended interviews, classroom observations of participant teachers, and focused group discussions with students. The study utilised inductive data analysis technique to develop core categories in terms of dimensions of global education for developing students’ global perspectives. The research finds that the curriculum subject matter is superficially incorporates elements of cross-cultural awareness, <b>perspective</b> <b>consciousness,</b> world problems and local solutions, and global interconnections and interdependence for developing students’ global perspectives. The teachers’ pedagogies, on the one hand, construct/reconstruct and reinforce Western knowledge and promote Western-centric worldviews. On the other hand, some teachers introduce knowledge from Islamic and local traditions as a post-colonial resistance to the hegemony of Western knowledge. The Pakistan Studies curriculum provides perspectives within colonial and post-colonial frameworks rather than providing multiple perspectives on topical issues. The national curriculum over-emphasises economic and political global interdependence and interconnection, but ignores economic dependency, violence, and various forms of human rights violations. Thestudy finds that the examination-bound teaching culture in schools, teachers’ limited repertoire of world knowledge and globalisation, limited utilisation of resources, and schools’ participation in national-global programmes are factors that affect Pakistan Studies curriculum practices of global education. Lastly, the study finds that the four-dimensional theoretical framework of global education is heavily embedded in the Western-centric approaches of global education with overemphasis on interdependence of economic and political systems in human rights context. The framework lacks analysis of dependencies and structural violence of world economic, cultural and political systems. Hence, a seven-dimensional post-colonial global education theoretical framework has been proposed for teaching Pakistan Studies to develop students’ global perspectives...|$|E
