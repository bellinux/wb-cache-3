40|$|Despite {{numerous}} benefits {{associated with}} regular physical activity, the majority of North American women remain insufficiently active. Accordingly, researchers have examined a multitude of variables associated with women's physical activity participation. Two theoretical frameworks that may be extended to predict women's <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> are the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Self-Determination Theory. This thesis examined <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> change in a community based-sample of middle-aged women by integrating concepts from these two conceptual frameworks. Specific objectives were (1) to examine the relative influence of social support, TPB variables, and SDT variables on intentions to increase physical activity; (2) to assess the relative influence of intentions and motivation on <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> change over time by testing mediating and moderating models; and (3) to examine relationships among barriers, environmental characteristics, and change in physical activity behavior. To these ends, two empirical investigations were conducted. In the first study, French-speaking women (n= 109) completed a questionnaire package assessing the aforementioned variables. In the second study, English-speaking women (n= 149) complete similar questionnaire packages at baseline and at six months follow-up. All women were recruited from community-based facilities, including community centres and fitness clubs. Overall, results demonstrated that attitudes, perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, and autonomous motivation were associated with intentions to increase physical activity. Intentions were also related to reported <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> change over time. Among the most commonly reported barriers to physical activity increase were daily activities and fatigue. Inactive women {{reported higher levels of}} barriers than women who remained active or increased their physical activity level over time. Environmental characteristics (e. g., enjoyable scenery and the presence of others exercising) were also associated with change in <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour.</b> Collectively, results support the utility of integrating concepts from different theoretical frameworks as a means of understanding <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> change and <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> change intentions. Findings also suggest a number of ways in which <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> change could be fostered in middle-aged women...|$|R

Research has focused predominantly on maternal influences with little known about the relationships between fathers' and young children's dietary and <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviours.</b> A greater understanding of paternal beliefs regarding young children's dietary and <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviours</b> is important to inform the design and delivery of child-focussed health promotion interventions. This study aimed to describe fathers' perceived roles in their children's eating and <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviours.</b> It also sought to document fathers' views regarding how they could be best supported to promote healthy eating and <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviours</b> in their young children. In depth, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} twenty fathers living in socio-economically diverse areas of metropolitan Melbourne, Australia who had at least one child aged five years or less. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Thematic analysis of the transcripts revealed eight broad themes about fathers' beliefs, perceptions and attitudes towards the dietary and <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviours</b> of their young children: (i) shared responsibility and consultation; (ii) family meal environment; (iii) parental role modelling; (iv) parental concerns around food; (v) food rewards; (vi) health education; (vii) limiting screen time; and (viii) parental knowledge. Analysis of themes according to paternal education/employment revealed no substantial differences in the views of fathers. This exploratory study presents the views of a socio-economically diverse group of fathers regarding the dietary and <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviours</b> of their young children and the insights into the underlying perceptions informing these views. The findings suggest that fathers believe healthy eating behaviours and being physically active are important for their young children.

40|$|In {{research}} and in practise social-cognitive models, {{such as the}} theory of planned behaviour (TPB), are used to predict <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour.</b> These models mainly focus on reflective cognitive processes. As a reflective process, intention {{is thought to be}} the most proximal predictor to behaviour. Nevertheless, research suggests that the relation between intention and actual behaviour, the so called intention-behaviour gap, is moderate. Many health-related actions in daily life are performed repetitively and with minimal forethought. In contrast to social-cognitive theories, dual-process theories suggest that behaviour is based on both reflective and automatic processes. Recent research reveals that automatic processes, such as habit, can significantly explain <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> initiation. One important finding was that automaticity of behaviour strengthens intrinsic motivation for physical activity. However, research has yet to explain the effects of automaticity of behaviour within the adolescent population, although lifestyle habits are strongly influenced during this period of the lifespan. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the role of automaticity of behaviour within the constructs of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the self-determination theory (SDT), using the integrated model of SDT and TPB. A sample of 582 highly active adolescents aged 15 - 19 completed measures of behaviour regulation, attitude, intention, <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> and automaticity of behaviour. Results show that automaticity of behaviour correlated with higher forms of self-determined behaviour. Two multiple regression analysis were conducted to explore the effects of automaticity of behaviour on both intentions and on actual <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour.</b> Results show that automaticity of behaviour is a significant explanatory factor for <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> (β=. 10, p=. 01), even if controlled for reflective processes. Moreover, automaticity of behaviour was the second strongest explanatory factor for intentions (β=. 14, p=. 00). Secondly, a difference in behaviour regulation was found between the models on intention and physical activity. Intentions were best explained by intrinsic motivation (β=. 18, p=. 00), followed by automaticity (β=. 14, p=. 00) and attitudes (β=. 13, p=. 01). Actual <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> was best explained by integrated behaviour regulation (β=. 24, p=. 00), attitudes and intention, while intrinsic motivation had no significant explanatory power on actual <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour.</b> The present findings support previous research, which suggests that automaticity of behaviour has a role in the explanation of <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour.</b> The discrepancy in behaviour regulation between intentions and actual <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> is further discussed, as well the effects of automaticity on behaviour regulation, attitudes and intention. Finally, directions for future {{research and}} practical implications are presented...|$|R

A tailored counselling programme covering both {{the period of}} the rehabilitation treatment and the first months at home seems on the average effective. However, a considerable variation in response is observed in the sense that some patients show a relevant beneficial response while others show no or only a small response on <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour.</b> The Rehabilitation, Sports and Active lifestyle (ReSpAct) study aims to estimate the associations of patient and programme characteristics with patients' <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> after their participation in a tailored counselling programme. Methods and analysis: A questionnaire-based nationwide longitudinal prospective cohort study is conducted. Participants are recruited from 18 rehabilitation centres and hospitals in The Netherlands. 2000 participants with a physical disability or chronic disease will be followed during and after their participation in a tailored counselling programme. Programme outcomes on <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> and patient as well as programme characteristics that may be associated with differences in <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> after programme completion are being assessed. Data collection takes place at baseline and 14, 33 and 52 weeks after discharge from rehabilitation. Ethics and dissemination: The study protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre Groningen and at individual participating institutions. All participants give written informed consent. The study results will provide new insights into factors that may help explain the differences in <b>physical</b> activity <b>behaviour</b> of patients with a physical disability after they have participated in the same physical activity and sports stimulation programme. Thereby, it will support healthcare professionals to tailor their guidance and care to individual patients in order to stimulate physical activity after discharge in a more efficient and effective way...|$|R
