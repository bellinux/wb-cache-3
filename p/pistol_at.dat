5|$|Federal {{officials}} charged Loughner {{the next}} day with killing federal government employees, attempting to assassinate a member of Congress and attempting to kill federal employees. Police reports reveal he had purchased a Glock <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> a Sportsman's Warehouse store, after passing the required FBI background check, less than six weeks before and attempted to buy additional ammunition for the <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> a Walmart {{on the morning of the}} shooting, but the clerk refused to sell it to him based on his appearance and demeanor.|$|E

5|$|On 29 May 1842, Victoria {{was riding}} in a {{carriage}} along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis {{to take a second}} aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was {{riding in a}} carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.|$|E

5|$|On {{the last}} day of February 1872, two days after the thanksgiving service, 17-year-old Arthur O'Connor (great-nephew of Irish MP Feargus O'Connor) waved an {{unloaded}} <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> Victoria's open carriage just after she had arrived at Buckingham Palace. Brown, who was attending the Queen, grabbed him and O'Connor was later sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. As a result of the incident, Victoria's popularity recovered further.|$|E
5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E

25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his <b>pistol,</b> <b>at</b> which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E
25|$|Also {{on display}} {{was a letter}} written by Arthur O'Connor. He had been {{committed}} to Hanwell on 6 May 1875 for firing an unloaded <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> Queen Victoria earlier on 29 February.

25|$|Matthews endured more {{controversy}} over the winter firing a toy <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> a shop assistant. He was overlooked by NSW selectors {{at the beginning of}} the 1994–95 season.

25|$|On August 3 in Sandy, he {{purchased}} a Chinese-made AK-47 at Sandy Trading Post, which he later {{used in the}} shooting. He eventually returned to Stockton, California, where he rented {{a room at the}} El Rancho Motel on December 26. After the shooting, police found his room decorated with numerous toy soldiers. On December 28, Purdy purchased the 9mm Taurus <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> Hunter Loan and Jewelry Company in Stockton.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} May 1861, Wills {{returned}} to the Dig Tree to put his diary, notebook and journals in the cache for safekeeping. Burke bitterly criticised Brahe in his journal for not leaving behind any supplies or animals. While Wills was away from camp, Burke foolishly shot his <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> one of the Aborigines, causing the whole group to flee. Within a month of the Aborigines' departure, Burke and Wills both perished.|$|E
25|$|He also {{produced}} {{a series of}} small paintings in what was known as the Troubador style, idealized portrayals of events in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In 1815 he painted Aretino and Charles V's Ambassador as well as Aretino and Tintoretto, an anecdotal painting whose subject, a painter brandishing a <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> his critic, may have been especially satisfying to the embattled Ingres. Other paintings in the same style included Henry IV Playing with His Children (1817) and the Death of Leonardo.|$|E

25|$|Rudolf Berthold finally {{qualified}} {{as a pilot}} on 18 January 1915. At about the same time, he arranged Buddecke's transfer into FFA 223. Berthold now being a pilot, he was assigned an observer, Leutnant Josef Gruener for flying reconnaissance sorties; they quickly became friends. In June, they were finally supplied with machine guns for their aircraft; Berthold could give up his futile assaults on enemy aircraft with his <b>pistol.</b> <b>At</b> about the same time, Berthold was laid up for a fortnight with dysentery, possibly provoked by nervous worry.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 1835, what is {{believed}} to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring. Jackson, infuriated, attacked Lawrence with his cane. Others present, including DavyCrockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.|$|E

As she prepares to kill him, Don Antonio enters with his arm in a sling. He takes the gun from Angellica, then recognises Willmore {{as the man who}} stole Angellica's picture. He offers to shoot Willmore. Pedro enters. Angellica decides to let Willmore live, and leaves. Don Pedro asks why Don Antonio missed the duel; Antonio tells him what happened, and leaves in a huff. Pedro decides to give Florinda to Belvile in revenge. Willmore informs him that the marriage has already occurred. Pedro exits.|$|E

25|$|On June 2, the Union columns {{set off to}} {{converge}} on Philippi. After an overnight march in rainy weather, both arrived at Philippi before dawn the following morning. Morris had planned a predawn assault to be signaled by a pistol shot. The green Confederate volunteers had failed to establish picket lines for perimeter security, choosing instead to escape the cold rain and stay inside their tents. A Confederate sympathizer, Mrs. Thomas Humphreys, saw the approaching Union troops and sent her young son on horseback to warn the Confederates. As Mrs. Humphreys watched, she saw Union pickets capture her son and fired her <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> them. She missed, but her shots began the attack prematurely.|$|E
25|$|Pukanić, an {{influential}} and controversial person in Croatian politics, was already targeted {{in a murder}} attempt on April 9, 2008 in western downtown Zagreb, near Franjo Tuđman Square. He was shot at with a silenced <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> close range. Pukanić crouched as the perpetrator pointed his gun at him and successfully dodged the bullet, which created {{a hole in the}} window of a nearby gift shop. The perpetrator's gun subsequently jammed, enabling Pukanić to pull his legally-owned Glock 17 out of his bag. Pukanić fired a warning shot, causing the perpetrator to flee the crime scene. A facial composite of the perpetrator, who was unmasked and wore a dark knitted cap, was publicly released five days after the attack.|$|E
25|$|Murphy, then {{faced with}} the {{charging}} gang members, raised the rifle toward them and took aim. Gang member W. H. Jackson pointed his revolver at Tanner, who testified that Jackson was “possibly twenty or thirty feet” away. Tanner was unarmed and could do nothing. Jackson probably noticed Murphy was aiming his now-dead boss' rifle in his direction. This, coupled with the fast-approaching men from the Citizen's Committee, who prematurely ended their meeting {{with the sound of}} gun fire, perhaps convinced Jackson not fire his <b>pistol</b> <b>at</b> Tanner. Someone yelled out towards the men who were with Smith, “They have killed Soapy, and if you don’t clear out quick they will kill you too.” Not wanting to engage in a gun battle in which they were vastly outnumbered, the gang fled.|$|E
