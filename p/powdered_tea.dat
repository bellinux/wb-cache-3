25|$|To {{produce a}} tea brick, ground or whole tea is first steamed, then placed {{into one of}} a number of types of press and {{compressed}} into a solid form. Such presses may leave an intended imprint on the tea, such as an artistic design or simply the pattern of the cloth with which the tea was pressed. Many <b>powdered</b> <b>tea</b> bricks are moistened with rice water in pressing to assure that the tea powder sticks together. The pressed blocks of tea are then left to dry in storage until a suitable degree of moisture has evaporated.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Nathanson {{reported}} {{an effect of}} methylxanthines on larvae of the tobacco hornworm. He administered solutions of finely <b>powdered</b> <b>tea</b> leaves or coffee beans to the larvae and observed, at concentrations between 0.3 and 10% for coffee and 0.1 to 3% for tea, inhibition of feeding, associated with hyperactivity and tremor. At higher concentrations, larvae were killed within 24 hours. He repeated the experiments with purified caffeine {{and concluded that the}} drug was responsible for the effect, and the concentration differences between coffee beans and tea leaves originated from 2–3 times higher caffeine content in the latter. Similar action was observed for IBMX on mosquito larvae, mealworm larvae, butterfly larvae and milkweed bug nymphs, that is, inhibition of feeding and death at higher doses. Flour beetles were unaffected by IBMX up to 3% concentrations, but long-term experiments revealed suppression of reproductive activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> on {{the levels of}} {{alpha-tocopherol}} in egg yolk, egg production and egg quality of laying hens were examined. Twenty 84 -week-old laying hens were divided into 4 dietary groups of 5 hens each in the late stages of laying. Four levels of green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> (0 % = control diet, 1 %, 5 % and 10 %) were fed to the hens for 3 weeks. At the end of 3 weeks, all experimental diets were switched to the control diet (0 % green <b>tea</b> <b>powder)</b> for 3 weeks. The first group was fed the controlled diet throughout the experimental period. The egg weight, egg mass and feed intake were the highest for the 0 % and 1 % green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> diets and the lowest for the 5 % and 10 % diets (P < 0. 05). The rate of egg production and the intake of feed decreased significantly {{with an increase in}} the intake of green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> (P < 0. 05). The weights of the hens who received up to 5 % green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> in their diets decreased. However, the gain in the hens` weight was not influenced by the intake of 1 % green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> diet. There {{were no significant differences in}} the yolk color fan score for the 4 treatment diets. The egg shell strength decreased with increasing green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> intake, while the alpha-tocopherol content of egg yolk of the hens fed the experimental diet increased with increasing green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> intake. The fatty acid composition of yolk was not affected by the diet. The results suggested that the transfer of alpha-tocopherol from dietary green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> to egg yolk was sensitive to the alpha-tocopherol intake and that green tea supplementation would support adequate egg production and egg weight when used up to a level of 1 % in the diets of laying hens...|$|R

40|$|For serving green tea, {{there are}} two {{prominent}} methods: steeping the leaf or the powdered leaf (matcha style) in hot water. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to reveal chemical and functional differences before and after the powdering process of green <b>tea</b> leaf, since <b>powdered</b> green <b>tea</b> may contribute to expanding the functionality because of the different ingesting style. In this study, we revealed that the powdering process with a ceramic mill and stirring in hot water increased the average extracted concentration of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) by more than three times compared with that in leaf tea using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography–tandem mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses. Moreover, <b>powdered</b> green <b>tea</b> has a higher inhibition effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vitro compared with the same amount of leaf tea. Our data suggest that <b>powdered</b> green <b>tea</b> might have a different function from leaf tea due to the higher catechin contents and particles...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to develop optimal {{conditions}} for decaffeination and spray drying procedures to produce decaffeinated and high caffeine <b>powders</b> from green <b>tea</b> (Camellia sinensis). Blanching the tea leaves with water at 100. °C for 4. min at a water-to-tea ratio of 20 : 1. mL/g removed 83 % of the caffeine while retaining 94 % of the catechins. The optimal spray drying conditions, which gave the highest yield of green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> and the highest concentrations of the naturally occurring epistructured catechins were found to be 180. °C for the inlet temperature and 115. °C for the outlet temperature. Using these optimal conditions, a decaffeinated green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> (7 mg/g caffeine) and a high caffeine powder (95. mg/g) were produced. These two green <b>tea</b> <b>powders</b> had excellent physical properties and could be used as instant teas by consumers or utilized in the food, cosmetic and nutraceutical industries...|$|R
