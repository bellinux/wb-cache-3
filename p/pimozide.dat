5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), <b>pimozide</b> (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
25|$|Antacids {{containing}} aluminium or magnesium ions {{inhibit the}} absorption of moxifloxacin. Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., <b>pimozide)</b> may have an additive effect on QT prolongation and lead to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The international normalised ratio may be increased or decreased in patients treated with warfarin.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications include prior {{treatment}} (within {{the past}} two weeks) with MAOIs such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine, due to the potential for serotonin syndrome. Its use should also be avoided in those with known hypersensitivities to fluoxetine {{or any of the}} other ingredients in the formulation used. Its use in those concurrently receiving <b>pimozide</b> or thioridazine is also advised against.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{case reports}} on sudden death {{prompted}} {{a study on}} a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and <b>pimozide</b> (Orap). Theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, is also contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|No true {{psychiatric}} medications are {{prescribed for}} factitious disorder. However, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help manage underlying problems. Medicines such as SSRIs {{that are used}} to treat mood disorders can be used to treat FD, as a mood disorder may be the underlying cause of FD. Some authors (such as Prior and Gordon 1997) also report good responses to antipsychotic drugs such as <b>Pimozide.</b> Family therapy can also help. In such therapy, families are helped to better understand patients (the individual in the family with FD) and that person's need for attention.|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and nefazodone {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, <b>pimozide,</b> warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|According to the label, {{sertraline}} is contraindicated {{in individuals}} taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or the antipsychotic <b>pimozide</b> (Orap). Sertraline concentrate contains alcohol, {{and is therefore}} contraindicated with disulfiram (Antabuse). The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment [...] "must be approached with caution." [...] Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may {{be as high as}} three times the average exposure for the same dose.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) {{turned down}} a 1972 grant {{proposal}} from the TSA because [...] "the reviewers believed there were probably no more than 100 cases of TS in the entire nation", [...] and a 1973 registry reported only 485 cases worldwide. [...] Subsequent articles on Tourette's in Good Housekeeping, The New York Times and Ann Landers produced an [...] "enormous response, proving {{that there were many}} undiagnosed cases of TS across the United States". TS was listed as a rare disorder in the United States Orphan Drug Act of 1983, a law enacted to increase development of medications for conditions which affect small numbers of people. In 1985 <b>pimozide</b> was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of the condition.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{prescribing}} {{medication for}} these conditions which often resolve spontaneously, recommendations {{have pointed to}} improved skin hygiene, good hydration via fluids, good nutrition, and installation of padded bed rails with use of proper mattresses. [...] Pharmacological treatments include the typical neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine, <b>pimozide,</b> haloperidol and perphenazine which block dopamine receptors; these are {{the first line of}} treatment for hemiballismus. [...] Quetiapine, sulpiride and olanzapine, the atypical neuroleptic agents, are less likely to yield drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. [...] Tetrabenazine works by depleting presynaptic dopamine and blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, while reserpine depletes the presynaptic catecholamine and serotonin stores; both of these drugs treat hemiballismus successfully but may cause depression, hypotension and parkinsonism. [...] Sodium valproate and clonazepam have been successful in a limited number of cases. Stereotactic ventral intermediate thalamotomy and use of a thalamic stimulator {{have been shown to be}} effective in treating these conditions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pimozide</b> {{overdose}} presents {{with severe}} extrapyramidal symptoms, hypotension, sedation, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes. Gastric lavage, {{establishment of a}} patent airway and, if necessary, mechanically assisted respiration is the recommended treatment for <b>pimozide</b> overdose. Cardiac monitoring should be continued for at least 4 days due to the long half-life of <b>pimozide.</b>|$|E

5000|$|QT {{interval}} prolongation — {{more prominent}} in those treated with amisulpride, <b>pimozide,</b> sertindole, thioridazine and ziprasidone.|$|E
5000|$|Use of {{clarithromycin}} {{with the}} following medications: cisapride, <b>pimozide,</b> astemizole, terfenadine, ergotamine, ticagrelor, ranolazine or dihydroergotamine is not recommended.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{medications}} {{specifically designed}} to target tics. Typical neuroleptics, or antipsychotics, are primarily used to treat schizophrenia, but one - <b>pimozide</b> (Orap) - has been FDA-approved for treating Tourette's. <b>Pimozide,</b> along with haloperidol and fluphenazine are the medications with the most proven efficacy in controlling tics. These medications work by blocking dopamine receptors, but {{are associated with a}} large side effect profile, including tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, and akathisia when used long-term.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pimozide</b> {{acts as an}} {{antagonist}} of the D2, D3, and D4 receptors and the 5-HT7 receptor. It is also a hERG blocker.|$|E
50|$|Prochlorperazine (Compazine, Buccastem, Stemetil) and <b>Pimozide</b> (Orap) {{are less}} {{commonly}} used to treat psychotic states, and so are sometimes excluded from this classification.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pimozide</b> {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of delusional disorder and paranoid personality disorder. It has also been used for delusions of parasitosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pimozide</b> {{is used in}} its oral {{preparation}} in schizophrenia and chronic psychosis (on-label indications in Europe only), Tourette syndrome and resistant tics (Europe, USA and Canada).|$|E
50|$|As stated above, {{solifenacin}} {{may also}} prolong the QT interval. Therefore, administering it concomitantly with drugs which also have this effect, such as moxifloxacin or <b>pimozide,</b> can theoretically {{increase the risk}} of arrhythmia.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{with intense}} {{intrusive}} thoughts {{that do not}} respond to SSRIs or other antidepressants may be prescribed typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), and <b>pimozide</b> (Orap).|$|E
50|$|Weight gain can be {{a problem}} for some, with {{quetiapine}} causing more weight gain than fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, molindone, olanzapine, <b>pimozide,</b> risperidone, thioridazine, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, and ziprasidone, but less than chlorpromazine, clozapine, perphenazine, and sertindole.|$|E
50|$|Similarly {{to other}} typical {{antipsychotics}} <b>pimozide</b> {{has a high}} affinity for the Dopamine D2 receptor and this likely results in its sexual (due to prolactin hypersecretion) and extrapyramidal side effects {{as well as its}} therapeutic efficacy against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|Atazanavir is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with previous hypersensitivity (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions). Additionally, atazanavir should not be given with alfuzosin, rifampin, irinotecan, lurasidone, <b>pimozide,</b> triazolam, orally administered midazolam, ergot derivatives, cisapride, St. John's wort, lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, indinavir, or nevirapine.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{treatment}} is indicated {{for patients with}} severe disabling chorea. It is treated with haloperidol, chlorpromazine alone or in combination with diazepam, and also <b>pimozide,</b> which is another neuroleptic drug which may have fewer adverse effects than haloperidol. Valproic acid, chloral hydrate, risperidone, or phenobarbital can also be used.|$|E
50|$|Antacids {{containing}} aluminium or magnesium ions {{inhibit the}} absorption of moxifloxacin. Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., <b>pimozide)</b> may have an additive effect on QT prolongation and lead to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The international normalised ratio may be increased or decreased in patients treated with warfarin.|$|E
50|$|Its use is also advised {{against in}} {{individuals}} concurrently on monoamine oxidase inhibitors {{or if they}} have been on one in the past 14 days and in individuals on drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (e.g. ondansetron, citalopram, <b>pimozide,</b> sertindole, ziprasidone, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|The {{prescribing}} information {{states that}} paroxetine should [...] "not {{be used in}} combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI", {{and should not be}} used in combination with <b>pimozide,</b> thioridazine, tryptophan, or warfarin.|$|E
50|$|Fluconazole {{therapy has}} been {{associated}} with QT interval prolongation, which may lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, it is used with caution in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval, such as electrolyte imbalance or use of other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (particularly cisapride and <b>pimozide).</b>|$|E
50|$|People {{who have}} shown strong {{hypersensitivity}} to efavirenz, a constituent of Atripla, {{should not take}} Atripla. Drugs that are contraindicated in the intake of Atripla are: voriconazole, ergot derivative drugs, benzodiazepines midazolam and triazolam, calcium channel blocker bepridil, cisapride, <b>pimozide</b> and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). Breastfeeding is also contraindicated.|$|E
50|$|N-Benzyl-4-piperidone is {{made when}} 1 {{equivalent}} of benzylamine is condensed with 2 molecules of ethylacrylate and the double conjugate addition product is {{subject of a}} Dieckmann cyclization followed by saponification and decarboxylation. Note that the intermediate 3-carboethoxy-N-Benzyl-4-piperidone prior to saponification {{can be used as}} a product to make <b>Pimozide,</b> Benperidol and droperidol.|$|E
50|$|Dopamine BlockersWhen {{pharmacological}} treatment is necessary, the most standard type of drug to use is an antidopaminergic drug. Blocking dopamine {{is effective in}} about ninety percent of patients. Perphenazine, <b>pimozide,</b> haloperidol, and chlorpromazine are standard choices for treatment. Scientists are still unsure as to why this form of treatment works, as dopamine has not been directly linked to hemiballismus.|$|E
50|$|Contraindications include prior {{treatment}} (within {{the past}} two weeks) with MAOIs such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine, due to the potential for serotonin syndrome. Its use should also be avoided in those with known hypersensitivities to fluoxetine {{or any of the}} other ingredients in the formulation used. Its use in those concurrently receiving <b>pimozide</b> or thioridazine is also advised against.|$|E
