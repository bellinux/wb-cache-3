40|$|Abstract. Air quality {{monitoring}} {{is extremely important}} as air pollution has {{a direct impact on}} human health. Low-cost gas sensors are used to effectively per-ceive the environment by mounting them on top of mobile vehicles, for example, using a public transport network. Thus, these sensors are part of a mobile network and perform from time to time measurements in each others vicinity. In this pa-per, we study three calibration algorithms that exploit co-located sensor measure-ments to enhance sensor calibration and consequently the quality of the <b>pollution</b> <b>measurements</b> on-the-fly. Forward calibration, based on a traditional approach widely used in the literature, is used as performance benchmark for two novel al-gorithms: backward and instant calibration. We validate all three algorithms with real ozone <b>pollution</b> <b>measurements</b> carried out in an urban setting by comparing gas sensor output to high-quality measurements from analytical instruments. We find that both backward and instant calibration reduce the average measurement error by a factor of two compared to forward calibration. Furthermore, we un-veil the arising difficulties if sensor calibration is not based on reliable reference measurements but on sensor readings of low-cost gas sensors which is inevitable in a mobile scenario with only a few reliable sensors. We propose a solution and evaluate its effect on the measurement accuracy in experiments and simulation. ...|$|R

30|$|The spaces {{where these}} {{systems can be}} {{deployed}} are very diverse. There are closed spaces with relatively well defined boundaries and others which do not have well defined boundaries which we can call open spaces.
