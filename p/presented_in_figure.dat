5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design is <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 6. Again, narrow lines {{are used to}} implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the stopband rejection. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E

2500|$|The {{combinatorial}} {{complexity of}} signaling systems involving multi-state proteins poses {{two kinds of}} problems. The first problem is concerned with how such a system can be specified; i.e. how a modeler can specify all complexes, all changes those complexes undergo and all parameters and conditions governing those changes in a robust and efficient way. This problem is called the [...] "specification problem". The second problem concerns computation. It asks questions about whether a combinatorially complex model, once specified, is computationally tractable, given {{the large number of}} states and the even larger number of possible transitions between states, whether it can be stored electronically, and whether it can be evaluated in a reasonable amount of computing time. This problem is called the [...] "computation problem". Among the approaches that have been proposed to tackle combinatorial complexity in multi-state modeling, some are mainly concerned with addressing the specification problem, some are focused on finding effective methods of computation. Some tools address both specification and computation. The sections below discuss rule-based approaches to the specification problem and particle-based approaches to solving the computation problem. A list of the tools discussed here is <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 1.

2500|$|Shared {{situation}} awareness {{can be defined}} as [...] "the degree to which team members possess the same SA on shared SA requirements" [...] (Endsley & Jones, 1997, p.47; 2001, p.48). As implied by this definition, there are information requirements that are relevant to multiple team members. A major part of teamwork involves the area where these SA requirements overlap—the shared SA requirements that exist {{as a function of the}} essential interdependency of the team members. In a poorly functioning team, two or more members may have different assessments on these shared SA requirements and thus behave in an uncoordinated or even counter-productive fashion. Yet in a smoothly functioning team, each team member shares a common understanding of what is happening on those SA elements that are common—shared SA. Thus, shared SA refers to the overlap between the SA requirements of the team members, as <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 3. As depicted by the clear areas of the figure, not all information needs to be shared. Clearly, each team member is aware of much that is not pertinent to the others on the team. Sharing every detail of each person's job would only create a great deal of [...] "noise" [...] to sort through to get needed information. [...] It is only that information which is relevant to the SA requirements of each team member that is needed.|$|E

The early transition state proposed for the thermal ene reaction of propene with formaldehyde has an envelope conformation, with a C-O-H angle of 155°, as calculated at the 3-21G level of theory. Schnabel and co-workers have studied an uncatalyzed intramolecular carbonyl-ene reaction, which was used to prepare the cyclopentane fragment of natural and non-natural jatropha-5,12-dienes, members {{of a family of}} P-glycoprotein modulators. Their DFT calculations, at the B1B95/6-31G* level of theory for the reaction <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 3, propose that the reaction can proceed through one of two competing concerted and envelope-like transition states. The development of 1,3-transannular interactions in the disfavored transition state provides a good explanation for the selectivity of this process.|$|E
