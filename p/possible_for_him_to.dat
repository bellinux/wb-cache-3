5|$|Cotillo's early law {{practice}} included {{a lot of}} uncompensated charity for the neighborhood. Apart from a genuine social compassion, Cotillo was also building political alliances {{that would make it}} <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> use the Italian-American voter power as his Irish-American forerunners in New York were using the power of other immigrant groups.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight made it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> spot the opponent before he was spotted, allowing {{him to take the}} appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E

For her this was a turning point: she realised once and for all just how deeply her grandfather and her great-uncle Gebhard were in thrall to their brother's murderous racial policies." ...|$|R
5|$|MacGregor {{joined the}} British Army at 16, the {{youngest}} age it was <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do so, in April 1803. His family purchased him a commission as an ensign in the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot, probably for around £450. MacGregor's {{entrance to the}} military coincided with {{the start of the}} Napoleonic Wars following the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens. Southern England was fortified to defend against a possible French invasion; the 57th Foot was at Ashford, Kent. In February 1804, after less than a year in training, MacGregor was promoted without purchase to lieutenant—an advancement that usually took up to three years. Later that year, after MacGregor had spent some months in Guernsey with the regiment's 1st Battalion, the 57th Foot was posted to Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Weyland is {{the billionaire}} founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Lindelof {{described}} him as having a massive ego and suffering from a god complex. Applying the necessary prosthetics and make-up to transform Pearce into the aging Weyland took five hours, and an hour to remove it. Pearce observed elderly individuals to gain insight into the movement for his character, as he found replicating the impeded physical movement {{the most difficult part}} of the role. Max von Sydow was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a younger man who appeared in an earlier script draft.|$|E
5|$|Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) {{repeated}} Fizeau's {{experiment with}} improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized {{flow of water}} lasted only a short time; (3) the laminar flow profile of water flowing through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across {{the diameter of the}} tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes of steady water flow. His common path interferometer design provided automatic compensation of path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of reflections in each light path. This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> insert a glass plate at h or even to hold a lighted match in the light path without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results.|$|E

The thought of performing the instrument again occurred <b>to</b> <b>him</b> while planning special segments for his Fisherman's Pier Celebration Concert in Taiwan(2007). Although time constraint prevented such idea to come to fruition, Nicholas hoped that there will still be <b>possible</b> chances <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do so in future.|$|R
60|$|Should he put off {{his journey}} {{and go to}} her this very evening and claim her as his friend? The {{question}} was asked and answered in a moment. Of course he would not go to her.

5|$|Massa {{was slow}} to {{accelerate}} leaving the turn six hairpin on lap 49, giving Alonso the opening he needed to take the lead. Smedley was later heard apologising to Massa over the radio. De La Rosa made his one and only pit stop of the event for super-soft compound tyres on lap 51. Di Grassi, at turn one on the same lap, hit a kerb damaging his car's rear suspension, which meant it was not <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> continue competing in the race. He was pushed into his garage by his team to retire. Vettel placed pressure on Massa by setting consecutive fastest laps to reduce the time gap between them. Petrov was on course to score one point but was told by his team to shift early into seventh gear on lap 58 otherwise his maximum revolutions per minute would be changed to a lower setting. De La Rosa attempted to lap Kovalainen around {{the inside of the}} second corner on the 60th lap but the two cars made contact. De La Rosa sustained damage to a section of his front wing while Kovalainen drove to his garage and got out of his car to become the race's fifth (and final) retirement on lap 61.|$|E
5|$|The {{criminal}} trial continued {{for most of}} the summer and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime {{was supposed to have been}} committed and attempted to explain that it was not <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E

A few months before (over the summer), his brother and sister had both died, so Morin had asked Air France if it was <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> fly during the actual Christmas celebrations, but they had refused his request... so he went to work on the flight feeling very reluctant, because he had wanted to be with his parents and family.|$|R

60|$|At first, the Prince could {{scarcely}} distinguish {{the objects in}} the room, as it was lighted only by a small brazier which burnt dimly on a table; but the Afrite thrust his javelin into the brazier, and the flames, all green and red, burst forth luridly, lighting up the apartment with unearthly colors. The Afrite, after informing the Prince that the great Mahbracca would soon attend him, left <b>him,</b> and returned <b>to</b> his station {{on the other side}} of the door.

25|$|With {{the death}} of Abu Talib, the {{leadership}} of the clan of Banu Hashim was passed to Abu Lahab who was an inveterate enemy of Muhammad. Soon afterwards Abu Lahab withdrew the clan's protection from Muhammad. This placed Muhammad in mortal danger since the withdrawal of clan protection implied that the blood revenge for his killing would not be exacted. Muhammad then tried to find a protector for himself in another important city in Arabia, Ta'if, but his effort failed and further brought him into physical danger. Muhammad was forced to return to Mecca. A Meccan man named Mut'im ibn Adi and the protection of the tribe of Banu Nawfal made it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> safely <b>to</b> re-enter his native city.|$|R

40|$|The central {{function}} of moral judgements is,according to Hare's prescriptivism,to guide choice and action. When we admit that moral judgements {{have such an}} action-guiding function,then we must also admit {{that there is a}} logical connection between assenting to moral judgements and actions. Hare's contention concerning wrong acts could be stated as being that if one makes a moral judgement that ‘X is wrong’or‘X ought not to be done’,the statement is,when used typically and sincerely agreed and when it is <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> do X,equivalent to agreeing with the imperative:‘Let me not do X!’Then,how is it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> someone to prescribe to himself to do X which he sincerely judges as wrong or evil?This theoretical difficultyin explaining moral weakness is,it is said,peculiar to prescriptivism(hence it is sometimes called Hare's paradox.) 1 悪の問題は指図主義にとって難問とされてきたが，本稿は指図主義によってこそ悪の問題が説明されることを証明しようとした。行為選択がなされるクリティカルな状況に注目しながら，意志の弱さとアモラリズムの問題を指図（行為）と記述（半断）の分裂として捉え直す。さらに，指図主義の見地からのアモラリストは，記述主義的観測者からみて，イモラリストとノンモラリストに分けられ，後者が「〈ある〉－〈べき〉」導出から指図主義を救うと考える...|$|R
