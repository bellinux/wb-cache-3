50|$|The {{displays}} {{include a}} nursery with spectacular 3 seater rocking horse and a reconstructed classroom. The {{center of the}} collection is the Brian Elder collection of dolls purchased for the museum in 1976. It includes examples of peg dolls, <b>pressed</b> <b>felt</b> dolls by Lenci, poured wax dolls, bisque porcelain dolls and composition dolls by Armand Marseille, Simon & Halbig and S.F.B.J.. In the display cabinets are doll's houses, Lego, Meccano and some Hornby railway trains.|$|E
40|$|The {{project is}} a thesis work in master program of Intelligent Systems that’s done by Alireza Mozaffari and Kunal Varaiya with supervising of Dr Kenneth Nilsson and Dr Cristofer Englund. In this project we are {{estimating}} the depth distribution of different sizes of fibers in a <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> sample. <b>Press</b> <b>felt</b> is a product {{that is being used}} in paper industry. In order to evaluate the production process when <b>press</b> <b>felts</b> are made, it is necessary to be able to estimate the fiber sizes in product. For this goal, we developed a program in Matlab to process X-ray images of a <b>press</b> <b>felt,</b> scanned by micro-CT scanner that is able to find the fibers of two different known sizes of fibers and estimates the depth distribution of the different fibers. The project is done in Matlab which is estimating the distribution of different sizes of fibers in <b>press</b> <b>felt...</b>|$|R
50|$|Conventional roll presses are {{configured}} {{with one}} of the press rolls is in a fixed position, with a mating roll being loaded against this fixed roll. The felts run through the nips of the press rolls and continues around a felt run, normally consisting of several felt rolls. During the dwell time in the nip, the moisture from the sheet is transferred to the <b>press</b> <b>felt.</b> When the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.|$|R
50|$|Presses can be {{single or}} double felted. A single <b>felted</b> <b>press</b> has a <b>felt</b> {{on one side}} and a smooth roll on the other. A double <b>felted</b> <b>press</b> has both sides of the sheet in contact with a <b>press</b> <b>felt.</b> Single felted nips are useful when mated against a smooth roll (usually in the top position), which adds a two-sidedness—making the top side appear {{smoother}} than the bottom. Double felted nips impart roughness on both sides of the sheet. Double <b>felted</b> <b>presses</b> are desirable for the first press section of heavy paperboard.|$|R

50|$|The {{issue of}} street bookmaking was not {{addressed}} which the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> should have been. The restriction to 104 days was primarily brought in due to {{rapid growth of}} greyhound tracks after 1927 and the associated gambling implications that had followed.|$|R
40|$|When {{the paper}} web and <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> enter a nip {{in the press}} section of a paper machine, both the paper web and felt are compressed. Water is forced from the paper sheet into the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> due to a {{hydrodynamic}} pressure gradient between the sheet and felt. Water not only flows through the felt in the transversal z-direction, but also flows through the felt in the machine and cross-machine directions. On the exit side of the nip, the pressure imposed on the sheet-felt system by the rolls begins to decrease. Both the paper web and <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> begin to expand, and a vacuum is created in the web and felt. The vacuum in the web is stronger than that in the felt, and thus water and air tend to flow from the felt back into the sheet, causing rewet. Three mechanisms that contribute to rewet have been proposed: 1) film splitting between the paper web and <b>press</b> <b>felt,</b> 2) capillary forces in the web drawing water from the felt into the web, and 3) the pressure differential between the web and felt during expansion. The objective of this project was to design and test under flow conditions {{similar to those in}} a press nip a smart water receiver {{to be used in the}} press section of a paper machine. In this manner, the feasibility of such a water receiver was to be determined. The purpose of this water receiver is to accept water that is pressed from the paper web in a nip and prevent the return of this water to the paper web upon exit from the nip. Thus, the smart water receiver allows flow through the felt in the positive z-direction of the felt (away from the paper web) and not in the negative z-direction (towards the paper web). The smart water receiver concept utilizes a layer of micro-check valves incorporated into the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> to perform in the desired manner. A mathematical model and lab-scale prototype were created in order to predict the behavior of such a design in the press nip. M. S.

40|$|Dewatering of pulp in a {{paper machine}} is a well {{established}} process. Nevertheless, {{it is far from}} being fully understood. One of the major steps in this process is the mechanical dewatering within the press section. It is achieved by applying large mechanical loads on the wet paper web {{while at the same time}} providing an escape route for the excess water. The quality of this process is influenced by many parameters. Besides the press nip parameters like pressure, roll diameters and press type (roll or shoe press), also other factors contribute to the mechanical dewatering performance. Among these factors the <b>press</b> <b>felts,</b> that transport the paper web through the press nip, are a major influence. Besides dewatering pulp, <b>press</b> <b>felts</b> govern also the papers smoothness and printability...|$|R

50|$|The {{second section}} of the paper machine is the press section, which removes much of the {{remaining}} water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by <b>press</b> <b>felts</b> that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water.

40|$|Digital image {{analysis}} provides methods for automatic, fast, and reproducible analysis of images. The main contribution of this thesis is new {{image analysis}} methods for volumetric characterisation of microstructure with application {{in the field}} of material science. The methods can be used as tools to characterise material microstructure, in particular the structure of fibre-based materials, such as paper, wood fibre composites, and <b>press</b> <b>felts.</b> More information about the material microstructure enables design of new materials with more specialised properties. Volume images have recently become available to characterise material microstructure. Manual inspection of material properties using volume images is both non-reproducible and expensive. The methods presented in this thesis are developed to meet the growing need for automated analysis. The focus has been on 3 D methods for high-resolution volume images, such as X-ray microtomography images. New methods for characterisation of both the fibre structure and pore structure in fibre-based materials are presented. The fibre structure can be characterised by measuring either individual fibres or the local structure of the material. A method for tracking individual fibres in volume images is presented. The method is designed for wood fibres, but can also be applied to other types or fibres or in other areas where tubular or elongated structures are analysed in volume images. A method for estimating 3 D fibre orientation of both tubular and solid fibres is also presented. Both methods have been evaluated on real volume images acquired using X-ray microtomography with good results. Two new pore structure representations and corresponding measurements are introduced. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated on real data. A method for estimating the pore volume at the interface between <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> and fibre web is presented. It has been applied in a case study of <b>press</b> <b>felts</b> under load using confocal microscopy images. In addition to the methods for fibre-based materials, a general method for reducing ring artifacts in X-ray microtomography images is presented. The method is evaluated on real data with good results. It is also applied as a preprocessing step before further analysis of the X-ray microtomography images...|$|R
