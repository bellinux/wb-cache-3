50|$|It {{has been}} stated that a spinal lesion {{caused by the}} {{accident}} kept him bedridden {{for a period of}} three months, clear in reason and with intense pain, before his death. However, {{there is no evidence that}} conveys any typical sign associated to spinal injury following the accident. Therefore, it is possible that Cano suffered a complex pelvic ring fracture. The fact that he was prostrated, lucid, but suffered intense pain best sustains the hypothesis of a pelvic fracture. After the initial period, one of the most common causes of death resulting from a pelvic fracture is deep venous thrombosis with secondary <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism.</b> This must have been the sequence of events that most probably caused Cano de Aponte's death.|$|E
40|$|To {{date the}} {{management}} of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism</b> is still largely limited to anticoagulation. Heparin and oral anticoagulation {{have been shown to}} be effective in reducing recurrence and death in venous thrombo-embolism. During the acute stage, systemic thrombolytic therapy has also been advocated for the rapid dissolution of the thrombus in patients with haemodynamic instability. We describe four patients with acute <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism</b> who were managed with catheter-based thrombus manipulation with intrapulmonary thrombolysis. This management strategy should be considered in patients with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism</b> who continue to deteriorate despite conventional management with anticoagulation or systemic thrombolysis.    Keywords: pulmonary thrombo-embolism; catheter manipulation; thrombus; thrombolytic therap...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{orthopedic}} surgery, embolization of {{bone marrow}} fat {{can lead to}} potentially fatal, intra-operative cardiovascular deterioration. Vasoactive mediators may also be released from the bone marrow and contribute to these changes. Increased plasma levels of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) have been observed after <b>pulmonary</b> air and <b>thrombo-embolism.</b> The role of ET- 1 {{in the development of}} acute cardiovascular deterioration as a result of bone marrow fat embolization during vertebroplasty was therefore investigated. METHODS: Bone cement was injected into three lumbar vertebrae of six sheep in order to force bone marrow fat into the circulation. Invasive blood pressures and heart rate were recorded continuously until 60 min after the last injection. Cardiac output, arterial and mixed venous blood gas parameters and plasma ET- 1 concentrations were measured at selected time points. Post-mortem, lung biopsies were taken for analysis of intravascular fat. RESULTS: Cement injections resulted in a sudden (within 1 min) and severe increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (> 100 %). Plasma concentrations of ET- 1 started to increase after the second injection, but no significant changes were observed. Intravascular fat and bone marrow cells were present in all lung lobes. CONCLUSION: Cement injections into vertebral bodies elicited fat embolism resulting in subsequent cardiovascular changes that were characterized by an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure. Cardiovascular complications as a result of bone marrow fat embolism should thus be considered in patients undergoing vertebroplasty. No significant changes in ET- 1 plasma values were observed. Thus, ET- 1 did not contribute to the acute cardiovascular changes after fat embolism...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Alteplase is the {{treatment}} of choice in acute ischaemic stroke. It is licensed in two forms: ‘Activase’, within 3 [*]h of stroke onset in North America, and ‘Actilyse’, within 4. 5 [*]h of stroke onset in Europe. Aim To investigate for differences between Activase and Actilyse. Methods There were two components: a systematic review and a retrospective analysis of the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA). (1) We searched for randomised trials of alteplase versus control in stroke, myocardial infarction/unstable angina (MI/UA) and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism</b> (PTE). We assigned trials as Activase or Actilyse, estimated the summary odds ratios (ORs), 95...|$|E
40|$|Venous aneurysms {{arising from}} the mediastinal {{systemic}} veins are rare. There are only 27 reported cases of such aneurysms. Majority arise from the superior vena cava. We are reporting a saccular aneurysm of superior vena cava in a 58 -year-old male. The chest radiogram suggested superior mediastinal mass and the computed tomogram was suggestive of aortic arch aneurysm. Aortography and venography confirmed the diagnosis as saccular aneurysm {{arising from the}} superior vena cava. A 7 cm saccular aneurysm arising from the distal half of superior vena cava was resected through median sternotomy. The surgery was done to prevent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Pulmonary artery (PA) leiomyosarcoma (PAL) {{is a rare}} but {{extremely}} malignant tumor of {{the cardiovascular}} system, which is often misdiagnosed as <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism.</b> Although the early detection and surgical resection improves patient survival, the benefits of adjuvant therapy are not well understood. The current study presents {{the case of a}} patient with primary PAL who underwent surgical resec-tion along with three courses of chemotherapy. Despite these interventions, the patient experienced recurrence of the PAL within four months following treatment. The patient received localized radiotherapy and subsequently achieved a stable disease state. This case indicates that radiotherapy may offer a benefit to PAL patients, particularly those who do not respond to chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Background The saliva of blood-feeding {{arthropods}} {{contains a}} notable diversity of molecules that target the hemostatic and immune {{systems of the}} host. Dipetalodipin and triplatin are triatomine salivary proteins that exhibit high affinity binding to prostanoids, such as TXA 2, thus result-ing in potent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation in vitro. It was recently demonstrated that platelet-derived TXA 2 mediates the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a newly recognized link between inflammation and thrombosis that promote thrombus growth and stability. Methodology/Principal Findings This study evaluated the ability of dipetalodipin and triplatin to block NETs formation in vitro. We also investigated the in vivo antithrombotic activity of TXA 2 binding proteins by employ-ing two murine models of experimental thrombosis. Remarkably, we observed that both inhibitors abolished the platelet-mediated formation of NETs in vitro. Dipetalodipin and tri-platin significantly increased carotid artery occlusion time in a FeCl 3 -induced injury model. Treatment with TXA 2 -binding proteins also protected mice from lethal <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism</b> evoked by the intravenous injection of collagen and epinephrine. Effective antith-rombotic doses of dipetalodipin and triplatin did not increase blood loss, which was estimated using the tail transection method...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we model the impact of {{introducing}} outpatient investigation of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism</b> (PTE) to the acute medical unit (AMU) using the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) decision rule. Specifically, we ask what proportion of patients requiring imaging could be investigated without admission, and how many bed-days this would save.  We obtained records for all medical patients who had imaging for PTE in a six-month period at a large teaching hospital with a 40 -bedded AMU. The patients were categorized into suitability for outpatient investigation {{using a combination of}} the PESI rule and practical considerations. Three hundred and fifty-nine separate presentations were identified. From available records, 31 patients (9. 2 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 6. 6 – 12. 8 %) had no contraindications to outpatient management. These patients used a total of 79 bed-days in the six-month period, or 1. 1 % (95 % CI 0. 8 – 1. 5 %) of the maximum AMU bed occupancy. Around 10 % of patients who require imaging for suspected PTE could be triaged to outpatient investigation using the PESI tool. Adopting this method to triage patients of ambulatory care, would have only a modest effect on acute medical bed occupancy, but remains a valid option for motivated patients in the low-risk category...|$|E
40|$|Three {{patients}} presenting {{with massive}} venous <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism</b> are described, {{who have been}} selected {{from a series of}} 22 patients treated with thrombolysis during a 6 -year period. A 23 -year-old female presented with tachycardia and dyspnoea. She had pulmonary angiography following scintigraphy with a perfusion deficit of more than 60 %. Thrombolysis resulted in open blood vessels and a disappearance of the complaints. A 51 -year-old woman presented with profound hypoxemia, probably due to a patent foramen ovale, with shunting and tachycardia. Perfusion defects on scintigraphy combined with a normal chest radiograph in the absence of pre-existent pulmonary disease established the diagnosis. She responded favourably to intravenous streptokinase. The third patient was an 80 -year-old woman with hypertension. She developed dyspnoea, tachycardia and shock following immobilisation due to a fractured hip. Despite an initial improvement on streptokinase, she deteriorated and died from right-sided heart failure. The diagnostic tests should be limited and aimed at ruling out left-sided heart failure and pericardial tamponade. Echocardiography is often diagnostic in these patients. Thrombolysis may be life saving but there are no randomised trials to prove that survival rate is indeed better compared to heparin therapy. Streptokinase is less expensive than alteplase and there is no evidence from trials to suggest that it is inferior to more expensive thrombolytics such as alteplase or urokinase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Arrhythmias {{resulting}} in cardiac arrest during electroconvulsive therapy have been reported. Most {{reported cases of}} cardiac arrest had asystole as the initial rhythm. Pulseless electrical activity as an initial rhythm of cardiac arrest during electroconvulsive therapy has never been reported. Also, thromboembolism after inflation of pneumatic tourniquet during lower limb surgery has been reported but never following tourniquet inflation during an electroconvulsive therapy. Case presentation We report a case involving an 81 - year- old female who presented to us for an electroconvulsive therapy for severe depression and developed pulseless electrical activity immediately after electroconvulsive therapy. She was successfully resuscitated and was later found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli with a complete occlusion of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. The source of embolus was from her left lower extremity deep venous thrombus, which we believe, got dislodged intraoperatively after inflation of pneumatic tourniquet. Our patient not only survived the massive pulmonary embolus, but also showed significant improvement in her mental status compared to her pre-admission level {{at the time of}} discharge to a sub-acute rehabilitation centre. Conclusion We recommend that patients who are elderly and at high risk of thromboembolism should selectively undergo a preoperative doppler ultrasound for deep venous thrombosis. Also, selective application of tourniquet in the upper limb, to monitor for seizure activity, would reduce the incidence of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism</b> as embolic events are significantly less from deep venous thromboses of upper extremities when compared to lower extremities. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{unexpected}} case of venous and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thrombo-embolism</b> in {{a patient}} treated with thalidomide for refractory erythema nodosum leprosum: a case report Riyaaz Ahamed 1 *, Wijesiriwardena Bandula 2, Ratnayake Chamara 3 Recent literature reports an increased incidence of venous thrombosis following thalidomide use {{in the treatment of}} diseases with disease-related thrombotic risks such as malignancy, as well as concomitant use with chemotherapy and/or systemic corticosteroids. We report a case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following thalidomide use {{in a patient}} with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reaction who was concurrently treated with prednisolone, as well as a review of relevant literature. Background The benefit of the immunomodulatory effects of thalidomide was discovered accidentally in 1965 when it was given to patients with leprosy as a sedative to relieve their suffering. Subsequently, researchers noticed an unexpected clinical improvement in the signs and symptoms of ENL. Since then, the off-label use of thalidomide has become increasingly popular due to its effectiveness in the treatment of a variety of malignant and non-malignant conditions refractory to other treatments. Although common adverse effects of thalidomide therapy are well-documented in literature since its introduction, some of the uncommon risks associated with its use are still being discovered. In the recent past, there has been an increased incidence of adverse events being reported in patients treated with thalidomide including thromboembolic complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Many studies have reported thomboembolic events with thalidomide when used in combination with multi-drug chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of multiple myeloma [1]. These thrombotic events have also been reported in non malignant conditions treated with thalidomide. A literature search shows few cases o...|$|E
