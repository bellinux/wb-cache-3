5|$|Chuck E. Cheese's <b>Pizza</b> Time Theatre in San Jose, California, was {{the first}} {{location}} to open on May 17, 1977. The concept was authored by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, credited with bringing video games such as Pong to the mainstream. The <b>Pizza</b> Time Theatre {{was the first}} family restaurant to integrate food, animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade. Following a filing for bankruptcy, the chain was acquired by competitor Showbiz <b>Pizza</b> Place in 1984, forming Showbiz <b>Pizza</b> Time, Inc. In 1990, the company began unifying the two brands {{with the goal of}} renaming every location to Chuck E.

5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular <b>pizza</b> cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all <b>pizza</b> cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to the top of a <b>pizza,</b> and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed <b>pizza</b> cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other <b>pizza</b> cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, <b>Pizza</b> Time Theatre went public; {{however, the}} {{evolving}} video game {{industry and the}} video game crash of 1983 resulted in significant losses for <b>Pizza</b> Time Theatre, which lost $15 million in 1983, and by 1984, Bushnell’s debts were insurmountable, resulting in the filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy for <b>Pizza</b> Time Theatre Inc. Showbiz then bought the foundering company, recreating itself as Showbiz <b>Pizza</b> Time Inc.|$|E

5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention of <b>pizza</b> cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of <b>pizza</b> cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat <b>pizza</b> cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat <b>pizza</b> cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Processed <b>pizza</b> {{cheese is}} {{manufactured}} to produce optimal qualities in browning, melting, stretchiness and fat and moisture content. Several studies and experiments have analyzed {{the impact of}} vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical <b>pizza</b> cheeses. In 1997, {{it was estimated that}} annual production of <b>pizza</b> cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year.
