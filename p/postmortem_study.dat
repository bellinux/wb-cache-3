50|$|When {{tissue from}} a <b>postmortem</b> <b>study</b> is {{obtained}} {{it is imperative}} that the researcher ensures the quality is adequate to study. This is specifically important when an individual is researching gene expression (i.e. DNA, RNA, and proteins). Some key ways researchers monitor the quality are by determining the pain level/time of death of the individual, pH of the tissue, refrigeration time and temperature of storage, time until the brain tissue is frozen, and the thawing conditions. As well as finding out specific information about the individual’s life such as: age, sex, legal/illegal substance use, and a treatment analysis of the individual.|$|E
50|$|<b>Postmortem</b> <b>studies</b> {{allows for}} {{researchers}} to give {{information that is}} relevant to individuals by explaining the causes of particular diseases and behaviors. This is in hopes that others can avoid some of these experiences in the future. <b>Postmortem</b> <b>studies</b> also improve medical knowledge and help to determine whether changes happen in the brain itself or in the actual disorder. By doing this researchers are then able to help prioritize experimental studies and integrate the studies into animal and cell research. Another benefit to <b>postmortem</b> <b>studies</b> is that researchers {{have the ability to}} make a wide range of discoveries, because of the many different techniques used to obtain tissue samples. <b>Postmortem</b> <b>studies</b> are extremely important and unique despite their limitations.|$|R

50|$|The {{expression}} of reelin {{is controlled by}} a number of factors besides the sheer number of Cajal-Retzius cells. For example, TBR1 transcription factor regulates RELN along with other T-element-containing genes. On a higher level, increased maternal care was found to correlate with reelin expression in rat pups; such correlation was reported in hippocampus and in the cortex. According to one report, prolonged exposure to corticosterone significantly decreased reelin expression in murine hippocampi, a finding possibly pertinent to the hypothetical role of corticosteroids in depression. One small <b>postmortem</b> <b>study</b> has found increased methylation of RELN gene in the neocortex of persons past their puberty compared with those that had yet to enter the period of maturation.|$|E
50|$|The prototypical PDE4 {{inhibitor}} is rolipram. PDE4 inhibitors {{are known}} to possess procognitive (including long-term memory-improving), wakefulness-promoting, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. Consequently, PDE4 inhibitors have been investigated as treatments for {{a diverse group of}} different diseases, including central nervous system disorders such as major depressive disorder (clinical depression), anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, Huntington's disease, stroke, autism and inflammatory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. PDE4D inhibition, along with PDE4A inhibition also appears to be responsible for the antidepressant effects of PDE4 inhibitors. Similarly PDE4B inhibition appears to be required for the antipsychotic effects of PDE4 inhibitors, in line with this view PDE4B polymorphisms and altered gene expression in the central nervous system have been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in a <b>postmortem</b> <b>study.</b> PDE4 also regulates the D1/PKA/DARPP-32 signalling cascade in the frontal cortex, which may contribute to the antipsychotic and procognitive effects of PDE4 inhibitors. Whereas PDE4C is expressed primarily in the periphery and hence may be partly responsible for the peripheral effects of PDE4 inhibitors (e.g. their anti-inflammatory effects). PDE4 inhibition is also known to attenuate ethanol seeking and consumption in rats, hence suggesting its possible utility in the treatment of alcohol dependence. A few different lines of evidence suggests the therapeutic utility in the treatment of brain tumours.|$|E
5000|$|Epigenetic hypermethylation of DNA in {{schizophrenia}} {{patients is}} proposed {{as a cause}} of the reduction, in agreement with the observations dating from the 1960s that administration of methionine to schizophrenic patients results in a profound exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms in sixty to seventy percent of patients. The proposed mechanism {{is a part of the}} [...] "epigenetic hypothesis for schizophrenia pathophysiology" [...] formulated by a group of scientists in 2008 (D. Grayson; A. Guidotti; E. Costa). A <b>postmortem</b> <b>study</b> comparing a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) and Reelin mRNA expression in cortical layers I and V of schizophrenic patients and normal controls demonstrated that in the layer V both DNMT1 and Reelin levels were normal, while in the layer I DNMT1 was threefold higher, probably leading to the twofold decrease in the Reelin expression. There is evidence that the change is selective, and DNMT1 is overexpressed in reelin-secreting GABAergic neurons but not in their glutamatergic neighbours. Methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as valproic acid, increase reelin mRNA levels, while L-methionine treatment downregulates the phenotypic expression of reelin. One study indicated the upregulation of histone deacetylase HDAC1 in the hippocampi of patients. Histone deacetylases suppress gene promoters; hyperacetylation of hystones was shown in murine models to demethylate the promoters of both reelin and GAD67. DNMT1 inhibitors in animals have been shown to increase the expression of both reelin and GAD67, and both DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors shown in one study to activate both genes with comparable dose- and time-dependence. As one study shows, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) concentration in patients' prefrontal cortex is twice as high as in the cortices of non-affected people. SAM, being a methyl group donor necessary for DNMT activity, could further shift epigenetic control of gene expression.|$|E

50|$|Postmortem brain {{samples are}} limited resources, {{because it is}} {{extremely}} difficult for a researcher {{to get a hold of}} an individual’s brain. The researchers ask their participants or the families to consent to allowing them to study the loved ones brain, however there has been a falling rates of consent in the last few years.

50|$|<b>Postmortem</b> <b>Studies</b> are {{a type of}} neurobiological research, which {{provides}} information to researchers and individuals {{who will have to}} make medical decisions in the future.

Researchers look at certain lesions in the brain that could have an influence on cognitive or motor functions. These irregularities, damage, or other cerebral anomalies observed in the brain are attributed to an individual’s pathophysiology and their environmental surroundings. <b>Postmortem</b> <b>studies</b> provide a unique opportunity for researchers to study different brain attributes that would be unable to be studied on a living person.|$|R

40|$|Schizophrenia is a {{psychiatric}} disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and impairments in cognitive functioning.

Moreover, while the mean distribution volume in the thalamus was high, a <b>postmortem</b> <b>study</b> with 3 H-SCH 58261 [15] showed that A 2 AR density is low. The uptake in the thalamus {{is considered to}} be ‘atypical’ binding [1],[30], which is different from classical A 2 AR binding. This low reproducibility in the thalamus may be partly due to such an ‘atypical’ binding. Thus, given the low reproducibility and ‘atypical’ binding, the thalamus should be carefully considered in further clinical research.|$|E

As a result, it can now be clearly concluded that there are structural cerebral abnormalities in schizophrenia that are intrinsic to the disorder. The neuropathological process is not primarily degenerative, but involves a change in the normal cytoarchitecture of the brain, probably originating in development. Neurochemically, there is postmortem evidence for alterations in several transmitter systems including dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
