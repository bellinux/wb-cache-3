50|$|Clorindione is a vitamin K antagonist. It is a {{derivative}} of <b>phenindione.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenindione</b> was {{introduced}} in the early 1950s. It acts similar to warfarin, but it has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, so it is rarely used and warfarin is preferred.|$|E
50|$|Anisindione, fluindione, and <b>phenindione</b> are oral {{anticoagulant}} medicines with actions similar to warfarin. However, the indandiones {{are generally more}} toxic than warfarin, with hypersensitivity reactions involving many organs and sometimes resulting in death. They are therefore now rarely used.|$|E
50|$|These oral {{anticoagulants}} {{are derived}} from coumarin, which is found in many plants. A prominent member of this class is warfarin (Coumadin). It takes at least 48 to 72 hours for the anticoagulant effect to develop. Where an immediate effect is required, heparin must be given concomitantly. These anticoagulants are used to treat patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and to prevent emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and mechanical prosthetic heart valves. Other examples are acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, atromentin, and <b>phenindione.</b>|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design and}} results of a controlled trial of anticoagulant drugs {{in the treatment of}} patients admitted to hospital suffering from acute myocardial infarction. A total of 1, 427 patients were allocated at random to therapy with high-dosage or low-dosage anticoagulants. The high-dosage regimen was 36 hours of heparin administration and <b>phenindione</b> in doses to maintain the thrombotest level between 10 and 20 %. The mean <b>phenindione</b> dosage was 72 mg. /day. The low-dosage regimen consisted of 1 -mg. tablets of <b>phenindione.</b> Therapy was continued for 28 days...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesSmall dose of Warfarin (⩽ 5 mg/day) was {{suggested}} as being safe in pregnant patients with mechanical heart valve prosthesis (MHVP) however; no other oral anticoagulant (OA) alternative {{has been proposed}} to cases failing to achieve their target INR. We aimed to suggest the alternative use/shift of those cases to our previously reported safe (OA) <b>Phenindione</b> (⩽ 100 mg/day) and to compare both regimens. MethodsEighty-seven females with 106 bileaflet MHVP implanted in the aortic (10; 11. 5 %), mitral (58; 66. 7 %) or both positions (19; 21. 8 %) continued OA throughout pregnancy, with restriction of daily doses to 5 mg Warfarin or 100 mg <b>Phenindione.</b> Patients were allowed to cross over if failed to achieve their target INR: 2 - 3. 5. Aspirin (100 mg/day) was supplemented, starting second trimester. ResultsOut of 59 patients initially receiving Warfarin, 15 (25. 4 %) shifted to <b>Phenindione,</b> compared to none of 28 patients originally receiving <b>Phenindione</b> (P= 0. 002). Mean INR and daily OA dose for 44 patients remaining on Warfarin and 43 patients receiving <b>Phenindione</b> were: 2. 39 ± 0. 34 versus 2. 25 ± 0. 2 (P> 0. 05) and 3. 9 ± 1. 07 mg versus 79. 3 ± 18. 5 mg; respectively. Maternal complications were six cases of resolved vaginal bleeding (6. 9 %). There were no cases of embryopathy or prematurity. Fetal outcomes included 68 live births (78. 2 %), seven abortions (8 %), two fetal loss (2. 3 %); all insignificantly related to OA dose or INR level. ConclusionAlthough ⩽ 5 mg Warfarin per day can be safe during pregnancy, yet it cannot always achieve the target INR and ⩽ 100 mg of <b>Phenindione</b> {{can be considered as}} a comparatively safe alternative...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Limited dose {{warfarin}} (LDW) throughout {{pregnancy was}} suggested to provide {{safe and effective}} anticoagulation in pregnant patients with mechanical heart valve prosthesis (MHVP). Our aim was to study its rate of failure in achieving the INR recommended for high-risk patients with mitral (±aortic) MHVP. Methods: A clinical trial was designed to compare failure rates of either LDW (⩽ 5  mg/day) or <b>phenindione</b> (⩽ 100  mg/day) to achieve target INR (2. 5 – 3. 5) in pregnant (Group A) and non-pregnant patients with MHVP (Group B). Eligibility criteria: young females (18 – 40  years), mitral (±aortic) MHVP, NYHA class I-II and achieving INR {{during the last three}} months. At Ain-Shams University, 100 patients were randomized in each group to either receive LDW or <b>phenindione</b> in a 3 : 1 ratio. Primary outcome was failure to achieve target INR on two successive controls. Results: Group A: follow-up was complete, twenty patients on LDW (26. 7 %; CI at 95 %: 16. 7 – 36. 7 %) failed to achieve target but none on <b>phenindione</b> (P =  0. 003). Group B: follow-up was 97 %, four LDW patients failed to achieve target (5. 3 %; 0. 2 – 10. 4 %) and none on <b>phenindione</b> (P =  0. 5). Pregnant patients received larger doses of either OA (P <  0. 0001), achieved lower INR (P <  0. 0001) and experienced more failures to maintain INR (relative risk: 5; 1. 8 – 13. 9; P =  0. 002), compared to controls. We had no patient mortality or fetal embryopathy but 11 fetal losses that were related to lower INR (P =  0. 039). Conclusions: LDW may be insufficient to achieve the INR target recommended for high-risk pregnant patients with mitral (±aortic) MHVP. <b>Phenindione</b> can offer an effective and probably safe alternative (NCT 01758640) ...|$|E
40|$|ANTICOAGULANT {{therapy is}} {{becoming}} increasingly important in the pre-vention and treatment of thrombo-embolic disease. Various investigators, {{in a search for}} an "ideal anticoagulant/ ' have expressed preferences for {{one or the other of}} several drugs of this type which are available commercially or experimentally. Recently many investigators have favored <b>phenindione</b> (Hedulin) as the "anticoagulant of choice. ''x Among the anticoagulant drugs employed in our clinic since 1943 were bishydroxycoumarin (Dicumarol), cyclocumarol (Cumopyran), ethyl bis-coumacetate (Tromexan ethyl acetate), <b>phenindione</b> (Hedulin), diphena-dione (Dipaxin) and, more recently, phenprocoumon (Marcumar). f We were greatly impressed with the superiority of phenprocoumon with respect to greater predictability of results and better maintenance of prothrombin levels as compared with the other anticoagulants studied, and therefore wish to present our findings and observations.

40|$|Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) {{remain the}} oral {{anticoagulant}} {{of choice in}} venous thromboembolic disease. These drugs are characterized by a large inter-individual variability requiring frequent dose tailoring. Genetic polymorphisms for cytochrome CYP 2 C 9 and VKORC 1 {{explain some of the}} variability, especially in warfarin and acenocoumarol responses. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess, in cell models, the role of ABC transporters in the intestinal transfer of the main coumarin derivatives (warfarin, acenocoumarol) and indanedione derivatives (<b>phenindione,</b> fluindione). The results show a basal to apical polarized transport for fluindione, <b>phenindione</b> and acenocoumarol only. Experimental studies using specific inhibitors of transport protein demonstrate the implication of MRPs and BCRP proteins and to a lesser extent P-gp. Warfarin and acenocoumarol seem to be poor inhibitors of MRPs protein, whereas fluindione and <b>phenindione</b> have a slight or no effect. The regulation of the expression of ABC transporters by exposure to VKAs was also investigated in Caco- 2 cells. The expression of mRNA P-gp, MRP 1, MRP 2 and BCRP was weakly or not modified after 24 h of VKAs exposure. In conclusion, the intestinal transfer of indanedione derivatives and acenocoumarol could be influenced by transport proteins of the ABC superfamily. Coumarin derivatives are poor inhibitors of these proteins and AVKs have a slight effect on the mRNA ABC transporter expression level...|$|E
40|$|T H E {{last decade}} has seen {{universal}} acceptance of anticoagulant therapy in thromboembolic diseases. In {{the treatment of}} individual cases, however, par-ticularly those of acute coronary occlusion, opinion varies as to which cases should receive anticoagulants, and how long therapy should be continued. In addition, hemorrhage is generally accepted as a calculated risk directly attributa-ble to {{the very nature of}} the therapy, regardless of the type and kind of anti-coagulant used. Indeed, fatal hemorrhagic complications have occurred. Cau-tious, close supervision of the patient, better knowledge of the type of drug used, and due respect for established contraindications must be emphasized if a fatal hemorrhagic episode is to be avoided. It is agreed that toxicity should be low or even absent for an anticoagulant to meet one of the criteria of an "ideal " oral anticoagulant. Early clinical re-ports on the use of <b>phenindione</b> as an anticoagulant showed promising advan-tages over Dicumarol. However, in 1954, two reports of severe drug sensitivity reaction to <b>phenindione</b> appeared. 1 ' 2 Both cases had fever, rash, blood abnor...|$|E
40|$|Stored serum {{reduces the}} {{anticoagulant}} effect of heparin on the clotting times of normal plasma. This is also well marked with sera from patients with Christmas (factor IX) deficiency, with factor VII-deficient sera, and in sera derived from patients treated with <b>phenindione</b> with a gross defect in thromboplastin generation. The possible relationship between antiheparin activity of serum and heparin resistance in recent thrombosis is discussed. The antiheparin agent resembles factor VIi and Christmas factor in being present in excess in serum, adsorbed and subsequently eluted from alumina. Unlike these, however, {{it does not}} appear to be appreciably reduced by <b>phenindione</b> treatment. It appears to have some properties in common with those described for the thrombotic agent of serum described by Wessler and his colleagues. It may play a part in the increased coagulability associated with thrombosis from the release of serum products into the circulation, although its relationship to the production of thrombosis in man remains to be established. The observation that heparin " resistance " is associated with active thrombosis has attracted a good deal of attention in recent years. Th...|$|E
40|$|In {{patients}} on oral warfarin, nicoumalone and <b>phenindione</b> {{an increase of}} the anticoagulant effect has been described during concomitant treatment with cimetidine. Therefore we have investigated the effect of cimetidine on the steady state dynamics of phenprocoumon in ten outpatients. No changes in the anticoagulant effect and the plasma phenprocoumon levels were observed during and after 2 weeks application of cimetidine.

40|$|Low-dose Warfarin (LDW) {{throughout}} {{pregnancy was}} suggested to provide {{safe and effective}} anticoagulation in pregnant patients with mechanical heart valve prosthesis (MHVP). We aimed to study its rate of failure in achieving target INR of those patients. Methods: Group A: 100 pregnant patients with mitral (+aortic; 24 %) MHVP were randomized in a 3 : 1 ratio, to either receive LDW (< 5  mg/day) or <b>phenindione</b> (< 100  mg/day) throughout pregnancy; respectively. Group B: 100 females in the child-bearing period with mitral (+aortic; 19 %) MHVP were randomized similarly and followed same dosage limits. Both groups targeted an INR of 2. 5 – 3. 5. Patients failing to reach this target were shifted to the other oral anticoagulant (OA). Aspirin (100  mg/day) was supplemented on the 2 nd trimester / 4 th follow-up month (Group B). Results: Primary outcome: 20 patients in Group A (26. 7 %; 16. 7 – 36. 7 %; P =  0. 003) and 4 patients in Group B (5. 3 %; 0. 23 – 10. 37 %; P =  0. 5) failed to achieve target INR; all being on LDW. Secondary outcomes: Group A received larger doses of either OA (P <  0. 0001) achieved lower INR values (P <  0. 0001) and had higher failure rates, compared to Group B (relative risk: 5; 1. 8 – 13. 9); (P =  0. 001). We had no patient mortality or fetal embryopathy but 9 spontaneous abortions and 2 stillbirths related to insignificantly higher OA doses and lower INR achieved (P =  0. 039). Conclusions: LDW may be insufficient to reach INR target, especially in high-risk pregnant patients with MHVP. <b>Phenindione</b> can offer an effective and probably safe alternative.

40|$|NAD(P) H:quinone {{acceptor}} oxidoreductase (EC 1. 6. 99. 2) (DT-diaphorase) is a FAD-containing reductase that catalyzes {{a unique}} 2 -electron reduction of quinones. It consists of 2 identical subunits. In this study, {{it was found}} that the carboxyl-terminal portion of the 2 subunits can be cleaved by various proteases, whereas the amino-terminal portion cannot. It was also found that proteolytic digestion of the enzyme can be blocked by the prosthetic group FAD, substrates NAD(P) H and menadione, and inhibitors dicoumarol and <b>phenindione.</b> Interestingly, chrysin and Cibacron blue, 2 additional inhibitors, cannot protect the enzyme from proteolytic digestion. The results obtained from this study indicate that the subunit of the quinone reductase has a 2 -domain structure, i. e., an amino-terminal compact domain and a carboxyl-terminal flexible domain. A structural model of the quinone reductase is generated based on results obtained from amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal protein sequence analyses and electrospray mass spectral analyses of hydrolytic products of the enzyme generated by trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus protease. Furthermore, based on the data, it is suggested that the binding of substrates involves an interaction between 2 structural domains...|$|E
40|$|The main use of {{quinidine}} and of procaine amide lies in {{the treatment}} of cardiac arrhythmias. As their action is depressant they are potentially dangerous. The following case showed an unusual type of arrhythmia, which developed after myocardial infarction and the administration of these agents. Case Report A man, aged 74 years, was admitted to hospital as an emergency after an attack of prxcordial pain lasting 12 hours. He had had two similar episodes in the preceding two weeks. On admission the pulse rate was 180 a minute and regular, the blood pressure was 90 / 70. The jugular venous pressure was raised but there was no cedema. The heart sounds were soft and an apical triple rhythm was present. An electrocardiogram showed a posterior myocardial infarct pattern and also an arrhythmia interpreted as ventricular tachycardia (Fig. 1). Anticoagulant therapy was started with intravenous dextran sulphate and <b>phenindione</b> by mouth. A single dose of quinidine sulphate, 0 3 g., was given orally; two hours later the pulse was irregular and the electrocardiogram showed irregularly occurring periods of asystole lasting one second (Fig. 2).

40|$|The {{experience}} with a new prothrombopenic agent, Dipaxin, is presented. With a 30 mg. dose a prothrombin complex concentration under 30 per cent is reached in 41 hours or less. When associ-ated with 1500 mg. of Tromexan the latent period is reduced to 24 hours. The prothrombopenic action of Dipaxin is readily counteracted with vitamin K, administered either orally or intra-venously. NTICOAGULANT therapy has its main indication during the acute phase of thromboembolic disease. Among the drugs with anticoagulant properties {{the most commonly used}} are those which interfere with the synthesis of prothrombin and stable fac-tor, the so-called prothrombopenic agents. We have had a large personal {{experience with}} bishydroxycoumarin (Dicumarol), ethyl biscoumacetate (Tromexan), cyclocumarol (Cumopyran) and <b>phenindione</b> (Danilone). From these, we consider Danilone the drug of choice as its action starts in a relatively short time (36 to 48 hours) and the initial and maintenance doses are very similar in dif-ferent individuals. ' Many efforts have been directed towards the finding of a prothrombopenic agent with a quicker action and a more reproducible dosage. We have studied a new indandione derivative the 2 -diphenylacetyl-l, 3 -indandione (Dipaxin) which appears to meet the above mentioned characteristics and are presenting in this paper our observations.

40|$|Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) {{are known}} to act as teratogens; however, there is still {{uncertainty}} about the relative risk for birth defects and the most sensitive period. In a multi-centre (n = 12), observational, prospective study we compared 666 pregnant women exposed to phenprocoumon (n = 280), acenocoumarol (n = 226), fluindione (n = 99), warfarin (n = 63) and <b>phenindione</b> (n = 2) to a non-exposed control group (n = 1, 094). Data were collected by institutes collaborating in the European Network of Teratology Information Services (ENTIS) during individual risk counselling between 1988 and 2004. Main outcome measures were coumarin embryopathy and other birth defects, miscarriage rate, birth-weight, and prematurity. The rate of major birth defects after 1 st trimester exposure was significantly increased (OR 3. 86, 95 % CI 1. 86 - 8. 00). However, {{there were only two}} coumarin embryopathies (0. 6 %; both phenprocoumon). Prematurity was more frequent (16. 0 % vs. 7. 6 %, OR 2. 61, 95 % CI 1. 76 - 3. 86), mean gestational age at delivery (37. 9 vs. 39. 4, p< 0. 001), and mean birth weight of term infants (3, 166 g vs. 3, 411 g; p < 0. 001) were lower compared to the controls. Using the methodology of survival analysis, miscarriage rate reached 42 % vs. 14 % (hazard ratio 3. 36; 95 % CI 2. 28 - 4. 93). In conclusion, use of VKA during pregnancy increases the risk of structural defects and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risk for coumarin embryopathy is, however, very small, in particular when therapy during the 1 (st) trimester did not take place later than week 8 after the 1 (st) day of the last menstrual period. Therefore, elective termination of a wanted pregnancy is not recommended if (inadvertent) exposure took place in early pregnancy. Close follow-up by the obstetrician including level II ultrasound should be recommended in any case of VKA exposure during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{data are}} {{urgently}} needed {{to specify the}} risk and safety of drug use during pregnancy. For several reasons pregnant women are usually excluded from clinical studies. Therefore, observational data are {{the main source of}} knowledge, cohort studies as well as case-control studies. Pregnant women and health care professionals of various disciplines, in particular obstetricians and geneticists seek advice from Teratology Information Services (TIS) on drug risks during pregnancy. Consultations on drug exposure during pregnancy require a differential approach dependent on the type of inquiry: (1) recommendations on drugs of choice for a particular disease must consider the effectiveness in treating the disease and the safety for the unborn child; (2) risk assessment of a past drug exposure during pregnancy requires a careful risk quantification to prevent unnecessary interventions such as termination of pregnancy or invasive diagnostic procedures. The Berlin Institute for clinical teratology collects follow up data on the course of drug exposed pregnancies during individual risk counseling. Apart from such prospectively enrolled datasets retrospective case reports of abnormal pregnancy outcome are recorded separately. These two databases allow evaluation of relative risks for several pregnancy outcome parameters and the detection of specific pattern of anomalies. Based on the Berlin database and on similar databases from other European TIS collaborating in the European Network of Teratology Information Services (ENTIS) four studies on drug safety are presented. A total of 549 pregnancies exposed to quinolone antibiotics were collected by ENTIS. The malformation rate among the live-born babies was 4. 8 %. No specific patterns of congenital abnormalities were found. The results do not suggest an elevated risk for spontaneous abortion, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, birth defects and postnatal disorders. Hence, termination of pregnancy because of such exposure is not indicated. To assess the safety of calcium channel blockers during the first trimester of pregnancy. a multicenter prospective observational study was performed. The rate of major birth defects was compared between a cohort of pregnant women exposed to calcium channel blockers during the first trimester (n = 299) and a control group not exposed to potential teratogens (n = 806). Major birth defects were not more common in the study group than in the control group. Birth weight was significantly lower in exposed term newborns. There were more preterm infants in the study group than in the control group (23. 8 % vs. 6. 5 %). These adverse effects are more likely due to the underlying disease than to the medication. Vitamin K antagonists are known to act as teratogens; however, there is still uncertainty about the relative risk for birth defects and the most sensitive period. In a multi-centre, observational, prospective study we compared 666 pregnant women exposed to phenprocoumon (n= 280), acenocoumarol (n= 226), fluindione (n= 99), warfarin (n= 63) and <b>phenindione</b> (n= 2) to a non-exposed control group (n= 1, 094). Data were collected by institutes collaborating in (ENTIS). Main outcome measures were coumarin embryopathy and other birth defects, miscarriage rate, birth-weight, and prematurity. The rate of major birth defects after 1 st trimester exposure was significantly increased (OR 3. 86, 95 % CI 1. 86 – 8. 00). However, there were only two coumarin embryopathies (0. 6 %; both phenprocoumon). Prematurity was more frequent (16. 0 % vs. 7. 6 %, OR 2. 61, 95 % CI 1. 76 – 3. 86), mean gestational age at delivery (37. 9 vs. 39. 4, p< 0. 001), and mean birth weight of term infants (3, 166 g vs. 3, 411 g; p< 0. 001) were lower compared to the controls. Using the methodology of survival analysis, miscarriage rate reached 42 % vs. 14 % (hazard ratio 3. 36; 95 % CI 2. 28 – 4. 93). In conclusion, use of VKA during pregnancy increases the risk of structural defects and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risk for coumarin embryopathy is, however, very small, in particular when therapy during the 1 st trimester did not take place later than week 8 after the 1 st day of the last menstrual period. Therefore, elective termination of a wanted pregnancy is not recommended if (inadvertent) exposure took place in early pregnancy. Spontaneous abortion rates are of general interest when investigating pregnancy outcome. In most studies observations are left truncated as pregnant women enter with a delay of several weeks after conception. Apart from spontaneous abortion pregnancy may end in induced abortion or live birth. These outcomes are considered as competing events (risks). The authors propose simple methods which remove bias inherent to crude rates. The probability of spontaneous abortion is estimated using an event-history based approach for the sub-distribution of competing risks that handles left truncation appropriately. Variance estimation enables the construction of approximate confidence intervals and of a simple test-statistic for comparing rates between different cohorts. The proposed methods are applied to a comparative prospective study on the association of spontaneous abortion and exposure to coumarin derivatives. The naive analysis using crude rates gives substantially different results than those based on the proposed methods, with up to a twofold change. Apart from thalidomide, retinoids like isotretinoin are the strongest teratogens in humans known today. The overall risk of birth defects is estimated as up to 30 % after exposure during embryogenesis. In spite of well established pregnancy prevention programs, pregnancies still occur during isotretinoin therapy in many countries including Germany. The Berlin Institute for Clinical Teratology documents prospectively the course of drug-exposed pregnancies when contacted for individual drug risk assessment. A total of 108 pregnancies exposed to systemic isotretinoin (median dosage 20 mg/day) during the contraindicated period were prospectively registered by TIS Berlin. 76 % (69 / 91) of the pregnancies with known outcome were electively terminated— mainly for fear of medication risk. No terminations due to abnormal prenatal ultrasound were reported. Spontaneous abortions occurred in 5 pregnancies. Of 18 live births including 1 pair of twins 1 major birth defect (small ventricular septal defect) was observed. None of the infants showed symptoms of retinoid embryopathy. 70 % (48 / 69) of the patients with data on contraception did not use any method, in 30 % contraception failed. There was no evidence that poor maternal education was a major cause for the omission of contraception documented in 48 women...|$|E
