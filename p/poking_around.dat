25|$|Crevice-gleaning is a niche {{particular}} to dry and rocky habitats. Adaptations for crevice-gleaning {{are similar to}} that of bark-gleaning. Just as the Bewick's wren, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, has a long bill suited for <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> in the small places of woods and gardens, another North American wren, the canyon wren, has an even longer bill, which allows it to probe crevices in rocky cliffs. It also has skeletal adaptations to aid it in reaching deep into small spaces. These same traits are useful for gleaning the sides of buildings, as well. Another kind of rocky habitat is found along mountain streams, where birds such as the Louisiana waterthrush of North America and the forktails of Asia pick over stream-side rocks and exposed roots for aquatic insects and other moisture-loving prey.|$|E
500|$|Terry-Thomas {{identified}} himself as a comedy actor, but regarded himself [...] "first and foremost, as a comedian with a built-in ability to inject humour into situations". He worked hard at the humour element, especially during his days in cabaret and revue; he wrote that he [...] "spent {{an enormous amount of}} time studying how to write humour and reading books on the philosophical approach to it, but it didn't get me very far. I decided that humour was like a good watch. It would go well if left to do its job but the moment one started <b>poking</b> <b>around,</b> it went wonky". While working on his television series How do you View?, he would change lines around to ensure the scene worked well, even if he gave the best lines to others; it was a quality which was appreciated by a number of others, including Jack Lemmon, who appeared with Terry-Thomas in How to Murder Your Wife. Lemmon commented that [...] "like most really good professionals he was generous to fellow actors. He worked with you, not at you".|$|E
2500|$|As {{the keynote}} speaker, Obama {{set the tone}} for the party platform. His speech, proclaiming the {{unnecessary}} and artificial divides in American culture and politics, was reminiscent of John Edwards's [...] "Two Americas" [...] stump speech: [...] "There's not a liberal America and a conservative America—there's the United States of America." [...] Obama emphasized the importance of unity, and made veiled jabs at the Bush administration and the news media's perceived oversimplification and diversionary use of wedge issues: [...] "We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states, and yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq, and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the Stars and Stripes, all of us defending the United States of America." ...|$|E

60|$|An old shovel {{had been}} left at the place, and working with this James Morris began to turn {{over some of the}} burnt sticks at a spot where he thought he might {{possibly}} come upon something of value. In the meantime Dave <b>poked</b> <b>around</b> to suit himself, and presently found two jugs and an iron pot.|$|R

60|$|That town of Mountain Valley wasn't going. About a {{dozen people}} {{permeated}} along the sidewalks; but what you saw mostly was rain-barrels and roosters, and boys <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> with sticks in piles of ashes made by burning the scenery of Uncle Tom shows.|$|E
50|$|Naru is Otome's {{close friend}} who is an expressionless, cool girl. She is solemn and speaks bluntly at times. Naru is observant, realizing Minami's and Otome's {{changing}} feelings toward each other before they do. She <b>pokes</b> <b>around</b> Otome's personal life, {{trying to get her}} to admit the truth of her love. Naru has been dating Amane after he gave up on Otome.|$|R
6000|$|We {{saw this}} bear walk along, <b>poke</b> <b>around,</b> {{dig into the}} ground, go behind trees, come out again, and finally stand up on his hind feet and {{apparently}} reach for berries or something on a bush. R.C. bethought himself of his field-glass. After one look he exclaimed: [...] "Say, fellows, he's a whopper of a bear! He'll weigh five hundred pounds. Just {{take a look at}} him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, this Massachusetts lettuce--I'm {{perfectly}} {{convinced that}} they used it for floor-rags before they went and lost it in the sandwiches--and this thick crumby bread--oh, it's unspeakable. I do wish you wouldn't <b>poke</b> <b>around</b> in these horrid places, mama, or else leave me in the car when you are moved to go slumming. I'm sure I don't feel any call to uplift the poor." ...|$|R
60|$|One morning Idaho was <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> with a {{stick on}} top of a little shelf that was too high to reach. Two books fell down to the floor. I started toward 'em, but caught Idaho's eye. He speaks {{for the first time in}} a week.|$|E
6000|$|... "Benjy," [...] said he; [...] "thank God {{he did not}} die of fright." [...] We lighted a candle, and <b>poking</b> <b>around,</b> {{found the}} negro where he had crept into the {{farthest}} corner of a bunk with {{his face to the}} wall. And when we touched him he gave vent to a yell that was blood-curdling.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a good-hearted idiot. I {{rather like}} him, and I believe {{that as a}} {{salesman}} of motors he's a wonder. But he's a nuisance in the aeronautic section. Tries so hard to be useful but he doesn't know anything--he doesn't know anything. Rather pathetic: rich man <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> and trying to be useful. Do you {{want to speak to}} him?" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{was sitting}} at my piano thinkin about holy music. I <b>poked</b> <b>around</b> for some simple but moving chords. Later I sat down and wrote Our Prayer in sections. The boys were {{overtaken}} by the arrangement. I taught it to them in sections, the way I usually do. The purity of the blending of the voices made the listeners feel spiritual. I was definitely into rock church music. Brian Wilson, c.1969 ...|$|R
60|$|Back {{into the}} {{hen-house}} came Farmer Brown's boy {{and began to}} <b>poke</b> <b>around</b> in all the corners. He moved all the boxes and looked in the grain bin. Then he began {{to look in the}} nests. Unc' Billy could hear him coming nearer and nearer. He was looking in the very next nest to the one in which Unc' Billy was. Finally he looked into that very nest. Unc' Billy Possum held his breath.|$|R
5000|$|Since its abandonment, {{the plant}} {{has been a}} haven for {{graffiti}} artists, urban explorers, paintballers and auto scrappers, {{and much of the}} wiring and other building material has been scavenged. In one incident, vandals pushed a dump truck from the fourth floor. Karen Nagher, {{the executive director of the}} nonprofit organization Preservation Wayne, stated that she was irked to see people come from [...] "all over the world" [...] to <b>poke</b> <b>around</b> Detroit. [...] "Piece by piece, they're disassembling those buildings, making it harder and harder to restore them".|$|R
60|$|He {{never bothered}} his head {{very much as}} {{to what was going on}} in the Seven Isles group till he learned from some talk in Mintok or Palembang, I suppose, that there was a pretty girl living there. Curiosity, I presume, caused him to go <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> that way, and then, after he had once seen Freya, he made a {{practice}} of calling at the group whenever he found himself within half a day's steaming from it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't go to {{your room}} to get your things," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I have {{gathered}} them all up, your bag, too, and I have tumbled them over {{the wall in the}} entrance back here. You must get over as quick as you can. That will be your room now, and I will tell the sailors, if they go <b>poking</b> <b>around,</b> that you are in there getting ready to leave, and then, of course, they can't pass along the passage." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{lay still}} {{and listened to}} Farmer Brown's boy <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> outside. He heard him exclaim: [...] "Ah, I thought so!" [...] and {{knew that he had}} found the tracks Jimmy Skunk had made in the snow. Unc' Billy almost chuckled again as he thought what a smart fellow he had been to step in Jimmy Skunk's tracks. And right then he heard {{something}} that put an end to all his fine thoughts about his own smartness, and sent little cold shivers up and down his backbone.|$|E
60|$|Having eaten {{what was}} allotted to him, Randy began to <b>poke</b> <b>around</b> with the pick, while his uncle and Earl still rested. The cliff {{was divided into}} two sections, and between {{was a lot of}} rotten stone, dirt, muck, and rubbish. Striking the pick deeply into this, Randy {{loosened}} a portion of the stone, and out it rolled into the gulch, bringing the dirt and {{a good portion of the}} rubbish after it. He began to scatter the stuff to the right and the left when something shiny caught his eye, and stooping he picked it up, while his heart leaped into his throat.|$|R
5000|$|Hypertext Editors: At this time, {{hypertext}} editors, {{which are}} needed {{to take full advantage}} of the Web, are scarce. The WorldWideWeb browser for the NeXT workstation incorporates a hypertext editor; the ViolaWWW browser will eventually add a hypertext editor. For the moment, if you don't have a NeXT, you're out of luck. If you <b>poke</b> <b>around</b> in the online help long enough, you'll find a description of HTML, the markup language. If you're really bold, you can create hypertext 'by hand.' But that's beyond the scope of this book. We expect that use of the Web will really explode once hypertext editors are available. For the moment, though, its hobbled by the lack of editors (p. 241).|$|R
5000|$|Some time later, in Fletcher's apartment, Adrienne, {{accompanied}} by Grayson, asks Fletcher where [...] "you're {{going on this}} extended vacation". Fletcher says [...] "Rome" [...] to confirm that it was Nero [...] "who set fire to Rome — so I'm going to <b>poke</b> <b>around</b> in the ashes". He wishes John and Adrienne well and makes his [...] "grand exit". As the elevator door closes, Adrienne says, [...] "down please" [...] and it opens again. She tells him that {{she is going to}} Rome because [...] "I have a theory of my own". He asks, [...] "Do you think you'll find it… in the ashes?" [...] and she answers, [...] "I think I will".|$|R
6000|$|By and by, when it {{was away}} late {{in the night and}} all the sounds was late sounds and solemn, Tom nudged me and whispers to me to look, and I done it, and there we see a man <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> in the yard like he didn't know just what he wanted to do, but it was pretty dim and we couldn't see him good. Then he started for the stile, and as he went over it the moon came out strong, and he had a long-handled shovel over his shoulder, and we see the white patch on the old work-gown. So Tom says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{was saying}} when Sonny Bunny {{interrupted}} us, I yelled for Jimmy Hedgehog {{to tip the}} little house over with his nose; {{but you know what}} a clumsy thing he is, and it seemed as if I should fly before he got ready to make a try. While he was <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> to see how it could be done the easiest, I scratched away the dirt with my hind feet, making a hole for it to tumble into, and, last, when Jimmy had made up his mind, I shouted for Cheeko to look after himself when the thing fell, so's to be ready to jump out the minute the door opened.|$|E
60|$|This distressed me {{more than}} I can tell, for I could not but feel {{that it was a}} mistake. I was sure that the effect would be {{deleterious}} upon my poor departed friend. Thompson--the expressman's name was Thompson, as I found out {{in the course of the}} night--now went <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> his car, stopping up whatever stray cracks he could find, remarking that it didn't make any difference what kind of a night it was outside, he calculated to make us comfortable, anyway. I said nothing, but I believed he was not choosing the right way. Meantime he was humming to himself just as before; and meantime, too, the stove was getting hotter and hotter, and the place closer and closer. I felt myself growing pale and qualmish, but grieved in silence and said nothing.|$|E
5000|$|Schedler's lectures often {{focused on}} matters of {{environmental}} ethics, philosophy of religion, and the philosophy of honors education.

30|$|Poker {{utilizes}} the XMM SSE double quad word instructions. MOVNTDQ moves a 16 -byte aligned 64 -bit quad word {{value from}} a 128 -bit XMM register to a 128 -bit memory address. Poker continuously writes 8 KB {{blocks to the}} memory and measures the bandwidth by calculating the time taken for the writes. (In other words, it continuously <b>pokes</b> <b>around</b> in the memory bus to measure the available bandwidth.) In a virtualized environment, the time measured for a memory write is liable to be inaccurate due to virtualization overheads. However, we {{are concerned with the}} relative decrease in the bandwidth (and hence, with the corresponding increase in write latency) and not the actual time taken by the operation. Even with virtualization overheads, we can estimate the memory bandwidth as viewed from within the virtual machine.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} Jolly Little Sunbeams began to dance through the Green Forest, chasing out the Black Shadows. Redeye the Vireo awoke {{and at once}} began to sing, as is his way, not even waiting to get a mouthful of breakfast. Prickly Porky yawned and grunted. Then he climbed down from the tree he had been sitting in, walked slowly over to another, started to climb it, changed his mind, and began to <b>poke</b> <b>around</b> in the dead leaves. Old Granny Fox arose and slowly stretched. She glanced at Prickly Porky contemptuously. She had seen him act in this stupid, {{uncertain}} way dozens of times before. Then slowly, watching out sharply {{on both sides of}} her, without appearing to do so, she walked down the hill to the hollow at the foot.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{a little}} past midnight, and, with the wind nearly astern, we were running down Lower San Francisco Bay to Bay Farm Island. Paul Fairfax and I {{went to the same}} school, lived next door to each other, and [...] "chummed it" [...] together. By saving money, by earning more, and by each of us {{foregoing}} a bicycle on his birthday, we had collected the purchase-price of the Mist, a beamy twenty-eight-footer, sloop-rigged, with baby topsail and centerboard. Paul's father was a yachtsman himself, and he had conducted the business for us, <b>poking</b> <b>around,</b> overhauling, sticking his penknife into the timbers, and testing the planks with the greatest care. In fact, it was on his schooner, the Whim, that Paul and I had picked up what we knew about boat-sailing, and now that the Mist was ours, we were hard at work adding to our knowledge.|$|E
6000|$|There Peter Rabbit lay. He {{had dragged}} {{that piece of}} stake a long way, a very long way, indeed. But now he could drag it no farther, for it had caught in the bramble bushes. So Peter just dropped on the snow and cried. Yes, sir, he cried! You see he was so tired and worn out and frightened, and his leg was so stiff and sore and hurt him so! And then it was so dreadful to {{actually}} get home and be stopped right on your very own doorstep. So Peter just lay there and cried. Just supposing old Granny Fox should come <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> and find Peter caught that way! All {{she would have to}} do would be to get hold of that hateful stake caught in the bramble bushes and pull Peter out where she could get him. Do you wonder that Peter cried? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{only being}} {{for whom he}} seemed to have any liking, was Yan Yost Vanderscamp, and him he liked for his very wickedness. He in a manner took the boy under his tutelage, {{prompted}} him to all kinds of mischief, aided him in every wild, harum-scarum freak, until the lad became the complete scapegrace of the village; a pest to his uncle, and to every one else. Nor were his pranks confined to the land; he soon learned to accompany old Pluto on the water. Together these worthies would cruise about the broad bay, and all the neighboring straits and rivers; <b>poking</b> <b>around</b> in skiffs and canoes; robbing the set-nets of the fishermen; landing on remote coasts, and laying waste orchards and water-melon patches; in short, carrying on a complete system of piracy, on a small scale, Piloted by Pluto, the youthful Vanderscamp soon became acquainted with all the bays, rivers, creeks, and inlets of the watery world around him; could navigate from the Hook to Spiting-devil on the darkest night, and learned to set even the terrors of Hell-gate at defiance.|$|E
50|$|At night a {{black bear}} <b>pokes</b> <b>around</b> the tent while they are {{sleeping}} and eats the food stored in a bag outside. The couple wakes up and see this. When Jenn asks {{if it was a}} bear, Alex tells her it was a raccoon he saw last night. They hike almost an entire day, trying to find their way out, then stumble across signs of a bear. They try to get as far away as possible before dark, and then camp for the night. The bear attacks the following morning, eventually making its way into the tent and starts its attack by swiping at Jenn's arm and then biting into Alex's shin, eventually dragging Alex outside and eating him alive. She manages to escape the battered tent while the bear is busy occupied with Alex. She takes the engagement ring before running away.|$|R

Now, imagine that the people who live around the seam are born with an aptitude for mining. We are a mining country and we know this story well. But, unusually for Australia, we are leaving this seam in the ground untapped. If startups were treated as a natural resource, people would ask why we’re ‘leaving them in the ground’.
