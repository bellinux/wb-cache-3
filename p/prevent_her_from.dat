In every instance, they were seeking to solidify {{institutional}} boundaries for their evolving practice of allopathic or scientific medicine by first <b>preventing</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> getting a license and second by <b>preventing</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> practicing medicine without one. No {{evidence that she}} harmed a patient was ever produced {{in any of these}} cases.|$|R

The ship was eventually expended as a gunnery target in 1921. Sachsen and Württemberg, both at various stages of completion when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal. Bayern was raised in 1934 and broken up the following year.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and often {{involves}} pheromones. Butterflies then {{land on the}} ground or on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to <b>prevent</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> mating again.|$|E

Following the {{outbreak}} of the war, she took part in convoy escort duties initially before being withdrawn to Brest for refit. On 3 July 1940, when the British attacked the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir, Volta managed to escape without damage and sought refuge in Toulon.

5|$|Now in {{possession}} of the Royal Navy, President and her crew were ordered to proceed to Bermuda with Endymion. During the journey, they encountered a dangerous gale. The storm destroyed Presidents masts and strained Endymions timbers so badly that all the upper-deck guns were thrown overboard to <b>prevent</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> sinking. Decatur and his crew were briefly held prisoner in Bermuda. Upon the prisoners' return to the United States, a U.S. Navy court martial board acquitted Decatur, his officers, and his men of any wrongdoing in the surrender of President.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} {{occurring in the}} room is far older than the house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to <b>prevent</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> continuing her research.|$|E

5|$|The English {{hoped to}} avoid sinking their {{opponent}} and to <b>prevent</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> running aground. The damage on Madre de Deus's defences was becoming serious. With her bow rigging all but disabled, Burrough sent Roebuck which then crashed into Madre de Deus, followed by Foresight. Both moved directly under her main guns. The English boarded {{her in the}} dark at 10 pm. Golden Dragon, Sampson and Tiger and the repaired Dainty came up in support. The English took the ship after a bloody hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|By late December 1946, {{the ship}} was in very bad condition; on 21 December, she began to list severely. A salvage team could not be brought to Kwajalein in time, so the US Navy {{attempted}} to beach the ship to <b>prevent</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> sinking, but on 22 December, Prinz Eugen capsized and sank. Her main battery gun turrets fell out of their barbettes when the ship rolled over. The ship's stern, including her propeller assemblies, remains visible above {{the surface of the}} water. The US government denied salvage rights {{on the grounds that it}} did not want the irradiated steel entering the market. In August 1979, one of the ship's screw propellers was retrieved and placed in the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany. The ship's bell is currently held at the National Museum of the United States Navy, while the bell from Tegetthoff is held in Graz, Austria.|$|E

The following morning, the British, unable to drag the grounded Acteon off the sandbar, {{set fire to the}} ship to <b>prevent</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> falling into enemy hands. Patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ship, fired some of its cannons at the British ships, took what stores and loot they could, and retreated shortly before the ship's powder magazine exploded.|$|E
