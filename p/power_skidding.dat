40|$|A winch and a sulky can {{transform}} a farm tractor into an effective small-scale logging machine, closely resembling a wheeled cable skidder. The additional cost of these implements is very small, but they offer significant benefits when extracting timber under {{the conditions of}} small-scale forestry. The authors developed a productivity model for skidding timber with wheeled farm tractors, equipped with winch and sulky. The origin data pool contained over 300 individual skidding cycles, extracted from 8 separate tests. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} allowed calculating a simple mathematical relationship for estimating skidding productivity as a function of significant work conditions, such as: piece size, winching distance, tractor <b>power,</b> <b>skidding</b> distance and crew size. This model can provide useful directions to prospective users, contributing to operation planning, costing and optimization. It can predict {{a large proportion of the}} variability in the data and was successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same data pool and not used for model development. Depending on tractor power and piece size, the average turn volume and productivity can exceed respectively 2 m 3 per cycle and 4 m 3 per Scheduled Machine Hour (SMH). Top performance can reach 8 m 3 SMH - 1, with heavy tractors and large logs. © 2011 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|E
40|$|This thesis The Comparison of the Traditional Material Transport in the Mountain Economy of the Krkonoše and Šumava Mountains {{introduces}} the {{traditional forms of}} material and goods transport in the Krkonoše Mountains (the Giant Mountains) and the Šumava Mountains (the Bohemian Forest). The {{way of life in}} the highland area of Giant Mountains was significantly affected by the Alpine colonization {{in the second half of}} the 16 th century. The Alpine colonists brought knowledge of logging, mountain economy and transport equipment into the mountains. Inhabitants of the Giant Mountains used water <b>power,</b> <b>skids,</b> later sledge called "rohacky" for bundles of wood. They also used backpacks, textile "loktuse", baskets, wheeled means of transportation and animal skid for the transport of other goods and materials. The comparison shows that the Bohemian Forest unlike the Giant Mountains was populated by gradual colonization of woodmen from the surrounding regions. Various forms of traditional vehicles were applied in this area. Unlike the Giant Mountains there was increasingly developed timber transport on the canals and rivers. The thesis maps the traditional modes of material transport in both regions, highlightes their differences and records their transformation in the present. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{management}} of forests in nature conservation areas represents a key interest in Europe, animal-powered logging is only rarely covered by scientific papers. The main aim {{of this study was to}} explore the occurrences of this practice in Hungarian nature conservation areas (i. e. that belong to IUCN Categories Ia, II or V as well as Natura 2000 SPA or SAC sites) that are owned by the state (i. e. about 75 % of all the forested nature conservation areas), and compile the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of animal-powered logging according to interviews with loggers. All the Forest Districts in Hungary (116) were contacted by phone. 26 % of the Forest Districts apply animal logging regularly (draft horse in every case), but only 2. 6 % (a mere 3 Forest Districts) own a horse stock for this purpose, while the others (27) employ contractors. 7. 76 % (9 Forest Districts) use animal <b>power</b> for <b>skidding</b> only occasionally and none of them own horses. All operate at least partially on nature conservation areas. Although 2. 6 % of the Forest Districts own a horse stock, they do not use animal <b>power</b> for <b>skidding.</b> The average animal logging operation consists of two animals and three people (one of them leads the horses) that do thinning in young stands and selection work. Data on advantages and disadvantages was gathered via semi-structured onsite interviews. The daily logging capacity of a single draft horse ranges from 4. 5 m 3 to 30 m 3, depending on topography and weather conditions. Resulting advantages include: less harm to topsoil, wood stands, and saplings, the support of natural regeneration of forests, horses are more economical than machines in thick snow, there is no use of fossil fuels, more jobs are created, and preservation of native horse breeds is supported. Conversely, output capacity is less compared to the use of machines, and only few people want or are able to work with draft horses. It is mostly the terrain conditions (especially efficient in steep terrain) and the environmental constraints that determine the use of horses instead of skidders...|$|R
50|$|Early {{electrical}} models used a three-rail {{system with}} the wheels resting on a metal track with metal sleepers that conducted power and a middle rail which provided <b>power</b> to a <b>skid</b> under the locomotive. This made sense {{at the time as}} models were metal and conductive. Modern plastics were not available and insulation was a problem. In addition the notion of accurate models had yet to evolve and toy trains and track were crude tinplate. A variation on the three-rail system, Trix Twin, allowed two trains to be independently controlled on one track, before the advent of Digital Command Control.|$|R

40|$|When, in 1988, the UK Department of Transport first {{introduced}} requirements for skid resistance on its trunk road network, it introduced {{the concept of}} “investigatory levels ” to be compared with measurements from routine skid resistance surveys. At {{the heart of this}} process was a link between the risks of wet skidding accidents occurring and the levels of measured skid resistance on the road. Initially, this was based upon a survey of a sample of the network at which the time was limited by survey capacity and computing <b>power.</b> The <b>skidding</b> standards have recently been revised and as part of this process, a new assessment of the link between accident risk and skid resistance has been made. This has involved a study of the whole Trunk Road network. This paper will review the historic background and then describe in more detail the recent study and its findings, how the results compare with the historic work and the changes that were shown to be appropriate for application in the revised standard introduced in August 2004.

40|$|Loss of braking <b>power</b> {{and rubber}} <b>skidding</b> on a wet road {{is still an}} open physics problem, since neither the hydrodynamical effects nor the loss of surface {{adhesion}} that are sometimes blamed really manage to explain the 20 - 30 % observed loss of low speed tire-road friction. Here we advance a novel mechanism based on sealing of water-filled substrate pools by the rubber. The sealed-in water effectively smoothens the substrate, thus reducing the viscoelastic dissipation in bulk rubber induced by surface asperities, well established as a major friction contribution. Starting with the measured spectrum of asperities one can calculate the water-smoothened spectrum and from that the predicted friction reduction, which is of the right magnitude. The theory is directly supported by fresh tire-asphalt friction data. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures. Published on Nature Materials (November 7 th 2004...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT–Robotic tasks {{call for}} a range of {{steering}} activity: one extreme is highway driving with negligible turning for hundreds of kilometers; another is forklift handling, which calls for agile turning. Steady state turning of a wheeled vehicle on natural terrain with slow but capable locomotors characteristic of planetary robotic vehicles is the scope of this research. Two tire designs were developed, implemented and evaluated aboard the Nomad robot, enabling a comparative study of their effect on mobility and steering. Rigid tires, utilized on desert terrain, are relevant to planetary exploration where elastomeric tires are inappropriate. Pneumatic tires, specialized for Antarctic terrain, achieved performance advantages on ice. The research presented here investigates the collateral issues of steering and mobility for the two tire designs. Experiments involve a single robot that can exhibit both skid and explicit steering while driving in steady state circles on gravel terrain. Skid steering is accomplished through the creation of a differential velocity between the inner and outer wheels. In explicit steering, a change in the heading of the wheels causes a modification to the vehicle heading. Power draw, individual wheel torque, and position data have been gathered for the purpose of quantifying performance. The experimental results show that power and torque for skid and explicit turning degenerate to equal values at infinite radius (straight driving). As the turn radius decreases from that of straight driving to that of a point turn, greater power and torque are necessary as larger slip angles are induced. In the limiting case of a point turn, with both rigid and pneumatic tires, the <b>power</b> for <b>skid</b> steering is on the order of double that of an explicit point turn. For explicit steering, with turns greater than a radius of 4 m, the pneumatic tires exhibit a lower power draw than rigid tires...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a {{stochastic}} power management strategy for in-wheel motor electric vehicles (IWM-EVs) to optimize energy consumption {{and to increase}} driving range. The driving range for EVs is a critical issue since the battery is {{the only source of}} energy. Considering the unpredictable nature of the driver’s power demand, a stochastic dynamic programing (SDP) control scheme is employed. The Policy Iteration Algorithm, one of the efficient SDP algorithms for infinite horizon problems, is used to calculate the optimal policies which are time-invariant and can be implemented directly in real-time application. Applying this control package to a high-ﬁdelity model of an in-wheel motor electric vehicle developed in the Autonomie/Simulink environment results in considerable battery charge economy performance, while it is completely free to launch since it does not need further sensor and communication system. In addition, a skid avoidance algorithm is integrated to the power management strategy to maintain the wheels’ slip ratios within the desired values. Undesirable slip ratio causes poor brake and traction control performances and therefore should be avoided. The simulation results with the integrated <b>power</b> management and <b>skid</b> avoidance systems show that this system improves the braking performance while maintaining the power efficiency of the power management system...|$|R
500|$|The RAAF's Phantoms {{suffered}} several accidents. The first {{occurred on}} 19October 1970 when the systems needed to <b>power</b> the brake <b>skid</b> and nosewheel steering on board Phantom A69-7234 failed during flight. It {{was decided to}} use Amberley's arresting equipment to slow the aircraft as it landed, but this system failed after A69-7234's tail hook engaged the wires, causing the Phantom to slide off the runway. The pilot only suffered minor injuries and the navigator was unhurt, but A69-7234 was badly damaged. The aircraft was subsequently rebuilt by No.3 Aircraft Depot and returned to service on 30September 1971; at the time {{this was the most}} complex Phantom repair task to have been undertaken by military personnel in any of the countries operating the aircraft. The next serious accident occurred on the night of 16June 1971 when A69-7203 crashed into the sea during an exercise near Evans Head, New South Wales, resulting in the death of the aircraft's pilot and navigator. [...] The cost of this aircraft was written off against that of an Australian Lockheed P-3B Orion that had crashed in the United States during 1968 before being delivered to the RAAF. Other accidents involving the Phantom included A67-7220 being over-stressed in flight during February 1971 (which led to its engines being sent back to the United States for repairs) and A69-7206's nosewheel collapsing during takeoff in January 1972.|$|R
40|$|Small {{unmanned}} ground vehicles (SUGVs) {{are widely}} used in nuclear, military, space exploration, agriculture, mining, and construction applications. Energy storage, management, and efficient conversion are always critical issues for SUGV designs and controls, and fast and accurate power consumption models are required to avoid immobilization by energy depletion or reduced traction capability. This dissertation studies methods to improve the locomotion power consumption modeling for both tracked and wheeled SUGVs. As SUGVs are usually operated off-road, terramechanics models {{can be used to}} capture the relationship between the running gear and terrain. Most SUGVs use skid steering because of its simplicity and robustness. However, due to the sliding between the running gear and terrain, skid steering can consume a lot of the propulsion <b>power.</b> Thus the <b>skid</b> steering must be included in the power consumption models of SUGVs. Single track-terrain and single wheel-terrain interaction are first studied and modeled based on terramechanics theory. Skid steering maneuver is then studied using three widely used models of tracked vehicles. None of these models achieve desired computation efficiency and accuracy simultaneously. We subsequently developed a finite element skid steering (FESS) model, which is used for both tracked and wheeled vehicles, and achieve the same accuracy as Wong’s model and in the meantime is computationally efficient. The accuracy of the FESS model is validated by experiments using a 6 -wheel-drive track/wheel interchangeable test robot on dry sand. Two case studies are conducted on an imaginary Packbot (in 4 -wheel, 6 -wheel, and track configurations) in two missions (patrolling an area and search and retrieve). Finally, a design comparison between tracked and wheeled configurations on SUGVs is studied, and general conclusions regarding power consumption and mobility are drawn...|$|R
