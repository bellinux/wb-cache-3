25|$|In 1997, President Freeman Hrabowski {{created the}} Conservation and Environmental Research Areas of UMBC {{also known as}} CERA on {{the south end of}} the campus. The {{conservation}} area encompasses 50 acres surrounding <b>Pig</b> <b>Pen</b> Pond and Bwtech@UMBC Research and Technology Park. At the same time as preserving the land, CERA allowed UMBC students to use the land for educational and recreational purposes. CERA contains two parts. The larger tract, covering approximately 45 acres of {{the south end of the}} main campus, contains a wide variety of ecological conditions: mature upland forest, early- and mid- successional forest, and riparian and wetland environments. The second, area is much smaller, with an area of about 3 acres. This surrounds Pigpen Pond, which was once actually a pigpen until it filled with water. There are also several areas within CERA where evidence of previous human occupancy and use can be found. In addition to teaching opportunities for faculty, CERA offers a wide range of opportunities for students and faculty to undertake short and long term research projects in a variety of disciplines. Management of CERA is guided by the need to maintain these landscapes as natural areas to be preserved and protected for approved uses in education, research and wildlife observation.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s and 40s, {{there was}} a second wave of migration. This new group, mostly landless peasants, is known as the Zabbaleen. The {{descendants}} of subsistence farmers, the Zabbaleen originate from the El Badari district in Asyut, a rural region in Upper Egypt, which is the southern part of Egypt. As farming ceased to be a viable way of life, the Zabbaleen faced economic hardships which prompted them to migrate to Cairo in search of work. Henceforth, the Wahiya collaborated with the Zabbaleen, who purchased waste from the Wahiya for use as fodder for pig farming. Initially, the Zabbaleen settled in the Imbaba district of the Giza governorate, but were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970. Thereafter, the Zabbaleen settled mainly in an abandoned quarry {{at the foot of the}} Mokattam hills, east of Cairo, which is under the jurisdiction of the Cairo Governorate. Although the governor of Cairo granted the Zabbaleen administrative permission to settle in the area, he did not issue a lease or legal tenure. Thus, because of their precarious situation, the Zabbaleen initially lived in makeshift settlements of tin huts, made mostly of barrels that the Zabbaleen found amongst the waste that they collected. This Zabbaleen community later emerged as the informal garbage collectors and recyclers of Cairo. The literal meaning of the word Zabbaleen is garbage-men (singular: Zabbal). The Zabbaleen are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means <b>pig</b> <b>pen</b> operators, because they raise pigs that eat the organic components of the waste that they collect.|$|E

40|$|Swine Industry Day, 2014 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 2014 The {{accuracy}} and precision of pig subsampling methods can determine the swine producer’s ability to sell pigs at optimal market BW and reduce economic discounts. The first objective of this experiment {{was to determine the}} time required to weigh pigs for different sampling methods used to estimate the mean and SD of a population. The second objective was to define the optimal sampling method considering the time required to weigh pigs as well as the precision and accuracy of each sampling method. A total of 68 <b>pens</b> of <b>pigs</b> (359 × 1050, PIC, Hendersonville, TN; 169. 8 lb BW) in 2 commercial finishing facilities with 20 to 35 <b>pigs</b> per <b>pen</b> were used. <b>Pens</b> of <b>pigs</b> were blocked by location within barn and randomly allotted to 1 of 4 treatments with 17 pens per treatment. The 4 treatments included (1) selecting and weighing the heaviest and lightest pig per pen; and (2), (3), and (4) weighing the first 5, 10, and 15 pigs out of the pen, respectively. The time required for 2 people to complete each treatment was recorded. To determine the total barn time required to conduct a specific sample, the time required to weigh the specific number of <b>pigs</b> per <b>pen</b> was multiplied by n pens. The accuracy and precision for estimating the mean BW and SD for each sampling method was determined by using datasets A and C reported in Paulk (20144). The precision was determined by calculating a 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the sample means and SD. The time taken to select and weigh the heaviest and lightest <b>pigs</b> in a <b>pen</b> (Treatment 1) did not differ from weighing 5 <b>pigs</b> per <b>pen</b> (Treatment 2). Increasing the number of <b>pigs</b> weighed per <b>pen</b> (Treatments 3 and 4) increased (P < 0. 05) the amount of time to weigh a single pen. Based on these results, the number of pens for each treatment that can be weighed without influencing weighing time was determined to be 15 <b>pens</b> (30 <b>pigs),</b> 15 <b>pens</b> (75 <b>pigs),</b> 9 <b>pens</b> (90 <b>pigs),</b> and 6 <b>pens</b> (90 <b>pigs)</b> from Treatments 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. For dataset A, these 4 sampling methods had a similar CI range for estimating the mean BW and SD. For dataset C, Treatments 1 (30 pigs) and 2 (75 pigs) had a reduced CI range for estimating the mean BW compared with Treatments 3 (90 pigs) and 4 (90 pigs); however, Treatments 2 (75 pigs) and 3 (90 pigs) had a reduced CI range for estimating the SD compared with Treatments 1 (30 pigs) and 4 (90 pigs). Therefore, we conclude that swine producers should weigh 5 <b>pigs</b> from 15 <b>pens</b> to estimate the mean BW and SD within a barn...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aims of the}} {{research}} presented here were: (1) to model the effects of important housing and management factors on the hygiene level of pig pens; and (2) to evaluate the efficacy of methods aimed at improving pen hygiene. These project aims were achieved by: (I) modelling the hygiene levels measured; and (2) conducting a number of controlled experiments. Hygiene levels were visually assessed in 160 piggery buildings using a standardised 3 -step scale system. Engineering and management characteristics of the piggery buildings were recorded {{at the time of}} sampling and these building characteristics were used in the subsequent multi-factorial statistical analysis. The mean faecal contamination of pen floors in all study buildings was 36 %. According to the model developed, hygiene levels were affected {{by the size of the}} farm (as described by the number of sows), seasons, stocking rate per pen (kg weight/m 2) and management of piggery buildings. Summer conditions and continuous flow pig management resulted in reduced hygiene levels in <b>pig</b> <b>pens.</b> Piggery size positively, whereas stocking rate negatively associated with piggery hygiene. The results highlighted potential strategies that can be used to reduce the negative effects of sub-optimal piggery hygiene on pig production, environment, health and welfare of animals as well as piggery staff.

40|$|When {{compared}} to other species of farm animals, pigs are relatively sensitive to high environmental temperatures because the pig cannot sweat and is relatively poor at panting. Little information is available about the ambient temperatures above which group-housed pigs start to adapt their mechanisms of balancing heat loss and heat production. The temperature above which an adaptive response occurs (also called the critical temperature or inflection point temperature) may well differ depending on which physiological or behavioral parameter is studied. The objective of these studies {{was to determine the}} reactions of pigs to a hot environment (experiment 1) and to study the effects of different cooling systems (sprinklers and water bath) on behavioral, physiological and productive parameters (experiment 2). In experiment one 12 groups of 10 pigs of 60 kg were studied in respiration chambers. Each day, the temperature was increased by 20 C from low (160 C) to high (320 C). In experiment two 12 groups of 5 pigs were studied under the humid tropical climate of Viet Nam. The pig¿s first visible reaction to increasing ambient temperature was a change in behavior. Wallowing was the first of all behavioral changes. It occurs at relatively low ambient temperature: from 16 to 170 C. The first physiological reaction to high ambient temperatures was an increase in respiration rate; on average this occurred at 22. 40 C. An increase in rectal temperature occurred above an average ambient temperature of 26. 10 C. This implies that pigs can prevent an increase in their body temperature for an ambient temperature range of about 3. 70 C. An increase in rectal temperature and an extra reduction in feed intake are indicators that room temperature is clearly above the upper limit of the thermal neutral zone. <b>Pigs</b> in <b>pens</b> with sprinklers or water bath had lower respiration rate and skin temperature than <b>pigs</b> in control <b>pens,</b> especially during the hot period of the day in pens with outside yard. No effect of cooling on the rectal temperature was found. <b>Pigs</b> in <b>pens</b> with outside yard without cooling were less active than <b>pigs</b> in cooling <b>pens.</b> <b>Pigs</b> in control <b>pens</b> were lying more in lateral position than pigs in the cooled <b>pens.</b> <b>Pigs</b> in <b>pens</b> with sprinklers had the highest feed intake and the highest daily gain.
