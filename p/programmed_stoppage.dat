40|$|AbstractCurrently, the {{electrical}} power shortage in Iraq {{and the existence}} of <b>programmed</b> <b>stoppage</b> mechanism at the Ministry of Electricity does adversely affects the work of information systems. Videoconferencing is uninterruptable systems {{which is one of the}} most important activities in information technology and e-learning systems. The study aims to design solar (alternative) system to run Videoconferencing systems in Iraq. Iraq is one of the ideal countries for the application of such a system in terms of: its geographical location which provides a number of sunny hours at a rate of (6 - 5) hours per day, and the lack of cloudy days for summer and winter. A method of sizing stand-alone photovoltaic systems regarding the reliability to satisfy the load demand, economy of components, and discharge depth exploited by the batteries is presented in this work. This paper introduced number of necessary mechanisms to increase the economic benefit, as well as the level of scientific services that are supported by this system. The results described in this paper confirmed that the design of system parameters (solar size, charge controller, battery bank, inverter features, size of wiring and base plate moving vertically to measure the angle of inclination (tilt)) are give higher efficiency in the use of solar panels...|$|E
40|$|Accounting in Brazil {{is going}} through a period of {{reflection}} concerning the process of harmonization of Brazilian accounting standards to the International Accounting Standards Board " IASB. In this context, various aspects related to the accounting records of transactions will be reviewed and may be changed, as has alrea dy occurred in previous situations, among them the record of spending with "programmed stoppages. " The "programmed stoppage" is characterized by temporary shutdown of operations of an asset or group of assets with the purpose of carrying out relevant maintenance at regular intervals over economic life. The Brazilian standardization regarding transaction records was based on guidelines from the international standards for the recognition of expenses with <b>programmed</b> <b>stoppages.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze this change in accounting practice by observing the Accounting Theory practiced in Brazil, based on the widespread standards and literature identified and supplemented by the example of the company Petroleo Brasileiro S. A. In this study, it was found that there was no subversion of concepts related to this accounting practice with respect to the Assets, Liabilities and the Result, but that the adequacy of a foreign view concerning a particular guideline, accepted in Brazil...|$|R
