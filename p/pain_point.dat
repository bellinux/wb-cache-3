40|$|Abstract. The {{questions}} asked {{in this paper}} are for the first: what <b>pain</b> <b>points</b> challenges are there for future enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and second, what <b>pain</b> <b>points</b> challenges should the development of future ERPs solve. These questions are discussed by referring to findings from an interview study with executives in a major ERP vendor organiza-tion. In addition to the empirical findings a limited literature study was conducted and findings from the literature are used to analyze <b>pain</b> <b>points</b> given by the executives. From the analysis some conclusions are drawn and some future research areas are suggested. The aim of the paper {{is to build a}} foundation for what future development of ERPs should focus on and the paper does so by presenting <b>pain</b> <b>points</b> challenges for future ERPs. In that way the paper presents the first step in requirements gathering and requirements analyzing that could be used as input for the development of future ERPs and thereby manage the challenges that the <b>pain</b> <b>points</b> suggest...|$|R

50|$|The first NFS Version 3 {{proposal}} within Sun Microsystems {{was created}} {{not long after}} the release of NFS Version 2. The principal motivation was an attempt to mitigate the performance issue of the synchronous write operation in NFS Version 2. By July 1992, implementation practice had solved many shortcomings of NFS Version 2, leaving only lack of large file support (64-bit file sizes and offsets) a pressing issue. This became an acute <b>pain</b> <b>point</b> for Digital Equipment Corporation with the introduction of a 64-bit version of Ultrix to support their newly released 64-bit RISC processor, the Alpha 21064. At the time of introduction of Version 3, vendor support for TCP as a transport-layer protocol began increasing. While several vendors had already added support for NFS Version 2 with TCP as a transport, Sun Microsystems added support for TCP as a transport for NFS {{at the same time it}} added support for Version 3. Using TCP as a transport made using NFS over a WAN more feasible, and allowed the use of larger read and write transfer sizes beyond the 8 KB limit imposed by User Datagram Protocol (UDP).|$|E

40|$|Background: Many {{students}} find the peripheral sensory examination confusing. We {{set out to}} summarise the evidence base {{in order to provide}} guidance on the most useful manoeuvres. Methods: We performed a literature review starting with 5 secondary sources, supplemented by a literature search on MEDLINE. Results: A useful approach to neuropathy is to divide these into large fibre sensory neuropathy (LFSN) in which vibration and proprioception are affected, and small fibre sensory neuropathy (SFSN) in which pain and temperature are affected. Positive sensory symptoms such as burning, electric or sunburn <b>pain</b> <b>point</b> to a SFSN; negative symptoms such as loss of sensation, numbness or deep <b>pain</b> <b>point</b> to a LFSN. If LFSN is suspected, the most reproducible and best studied physical examination is a 10 g monofilament, but vibration sense is also useful. There is much less data on the best physical examination for a SFSN. The most appropriate diagnostic test for SFSN is quantitative sensory testing, whereas for LFSN a nerve conduction study is indicated. Conclusions: A modest amount of evidence is available to guide peripheral sensory examination but more research is needed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Glomus {{tumors are}} painful, benign {{neoplasms}} that frequently {{are associated with}} delayed diagnosis. Commonly in the hand, they rarely present in the foot. The purpose of this case series is to characterize the clinical presentation, radiology, pathology, and surgical outcomes associated with foot glomus tumors. We reviewed our pathology database for patients with foot glomus tumors diagnosed between 1995 and 2013. Medical records including physician notes, pathology, and radiology were reviewed. Eleven patients had foot glomus tumors excised at our institution during the study period. The mean age was 45. 4 (range = 28 - 60) years. One patient was lost to follow-up. Mean follow-up for the remaining 10 patients was 44. 7 (range = 3 - 142) months. Ten tumors were located in the subungual region, while 1 was located in the plantar pulp of the distal phalanx. All patients presented with <b>pain.</b> <b>Point</b> tenderness, cold hypersensitivity, and nail abnormalities were variably documented but frequently present. Four patients had had prior surgery for an ingrown toenail prior to presentation at our institution. Six patients had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging studies, which were diagnostic of glomus tumor in all cases except one. Radiographs failed to provide diagnosis in all 8 patients for whom they were obtained. Postoperatively, all patients had complete symptom relief with no recurrences. In conclusion, this case series demonstrates that foot glomus tumors frequently present with classic symptoms including <b>pain,</b> <b>point</b> tenderness, and cold hypersensitivity. When clinically suspected, magnetic resonance imaging should be obtained. Marginal excision results in symptom relief and cure...|$|E
