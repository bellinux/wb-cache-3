40|$|Research on {{morphological}} {{variability in}} second language (L 2) acquisition {{has focused on}} the syntactic consequences of variability: that is, whether or not morphological variability entails underlying syntactic deficits. The interrelationship between morphological features in their own right has been largely ignored. This thesis addresses the representation of L 2 features by investigating the use of default morphology [...] -the outcome of systematic substitution errors employed by speakers of L 2 Spanish. It is hypothesized that underspecified features act as defaults; by assumption, those features that are unmarked are underspecified. Evidence to support this hypothesis comes from two sets of experiments conducted on intermediate- and advanced-proficiency L 2 Spanish subjects (L 1 English). The first set of experiments addresses verbal morphology, and consists of a spontaneous production experiment on person, number, tense, and finiteness, and a comprehension task on person and number. The second set of experiments addresses gender and number in nominal morphology, and consists of a spontaneous production experiment on determiners, an elicited production experiment on clitics and adjectives, and a picture-selection task on the comprehension of clitics. Across tasks and across verbal and nominal domains, errors involve the systematic substitution of underspecified morphology. The observation that morphological variability extends to comprehension, and is qualitatively similar to the variability found in <b>production,</b> <b>counters</b> the suggestion that variability is strictly a product of mere performance limitations on production. Finally, the systematicity of substitution errors suggests that the natural classes of features such as gender, number, tense, and person are acquirable in an L 2, {{regardless of whether or not}} these features have been instantiated in the native language...|$|E
40|$|Although {{nitric oxide}} (NO) from {{inducible}} {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOSII) is proposed to be the {{major factor in the}} vascular abnormalities of sepsis in rats, its role in higher order species is not well established. This thesis thus, addresses the role of NO in septic pigs. I first hypothesized that induction of NOSII in pigs is the cause of sepsis-induced hypotension as occurs in rodents. To test this, I treated pigs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate sepsis. In contrast to what is observed in rats and mice, plasma nitrite did not change during the 4 hours of the LPS infusion and there was no increase in calcium (Ca) -independent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in lung tissue from endotoxemic pigs compared to control animals. Furthermore, there was only minimal induction of NOSII mRNA. My second hypothesis was that NOS (NOSIII) is not down regulated in septic pigs, and NO from NOSIII, could contribute to peroxynitrite formation. In support of this, western blot analysis of samples from aorta and vena cava showed no down regulation of NOSIII. There also was an increase in Ca ++-dependent NOS activity of aorta and vena cava after 2 -hour of endotoxemia, which indicates increased constitutive NOS activity. Moreover, there was an increase in NOSI in the vena cava. LPS produced a leftward shift in the dose-response curves of SVR and RVR in response to the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME (NG -nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester). Peroxynitrite is formed from NO and superoxide (O 2 -). Since NO was not increased in endotoxemic pigs, I next hypothesized that O 2 - is increased in endotoxemic pigs and this reacts with NO from constitutive NOS to form peroxynitrite. To test this hypothesis, I first studied rats to confirm that O 2 - is increased in arterial vessels of endotoxic rats. There was a small increase in basal O 2 - in endotoxic rats. Stimulation of NAD(P) H oxidase by giving the substrate, NADH, did not result in different O 2 - production in control and endotoxic rats. However, inhibition of NOS increased O 2 - in endotoxic rats. I demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis, that the components of NAD(P) H oxidase, gp 91 phox, p 22 phox, and p 47 phox are present in skeletal muscle and it has similar behavior to other non-phagocytic NADPH oxidases. The addition of L-NAME to NADH-treated diaphragm strips of endotoxic rats, increased O 2 - production in endotoxic rats indicating that O 2 - <b>production</b> <b>counters</b> the increased NO formation as we observed in rat aorta. These observations indicate that O 2 - generation from NADPH oxidase in skeletal muscles can {{play a role in the}} pathophysiology of sepsis. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{variety of}} oncogenic and {{environmental}} factors alter tumor metabolism to serve the distinct cellular biosynthetic and bioenergetic needs present during oncogenesis. Extracellular acidosis is a common microenvironmental stress in solid tumors, but {{little is known about}} its metabolic influence, particularly when present in the absence of hypoxia. In order to characterize the extent of tumor cell metabolic adaptations to acidosis, we employed stable isotope tracers to examine how acidosis impacts glucose, glutamine, and palmitate metabolism in breast cancer cells exposed to extracellular acidosis. Results: Acidosis increased both glutaminolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation, which contribute metabolic intermediates to drive the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and ATP generation. Acidosis also led to a decoupling of glutaminolysis and novel glutathione (GSH) synthesis by repressing GCLC/GCLM expression. We further found that acidosis redirects glucose away from lactate production and towards the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). These changes all serve to increase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) <b>production</b> and <b>counter</b> the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) present under acidosis.

This new form of the nuclear matter is of the great interest, since it is believed to resemble the state of matter just a few microseconds after the Big Bang.

Hydrolysis rate, during anaerobic digestion of miscanthus was inhibited up to 50 % by vanillic acid, while vanillic acid had no influence on the initial rate of biogas production during the anaerobic digestion of hemp straw. Miscanthus has a higher lignin concentration (12 - 30 g/ 100 g DM) making it less accessible for degradation, and in combination with phenolic compounds released after harsh pretreatments, it can cause severe inhibition levels during the anaerobic digestion, lowering biogas <b>production.</b> To <b>counter</b> the inhibition, lignin degrading enzymes can be used to remove or degrade the inhibitory phenolic compounds.
