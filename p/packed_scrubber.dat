40|$|The use of air {{cleaning}} systems to reduce ammonia emissions from animal houses is increasing. These systems are normally used {{in order to}} comply with local or national regulations of ammonia emission. Therefore, accurate determination of the proportion of ammonia being removed by these systems is crucial. There are two main methods available to measure ammonia removal efficiency of scrubbers: air balance (based on the measurement of ammonia concentrations in air) and combined water-air balance (in which it is also necessary to {{determine the amount of}} nitrogen recovered in the liquid phase). The first method is simpler to establish, while the second method might provide deeper information about the processes occurring. The main aim of this work was to assess, in terms of the variability of the results, the use of these two methods to evaluate the efficiency of an acid <b>packed</b> bed <b>scrubber</b> on a pig farm. An acid <b>packed</b> bed <b>scrubber</b> (70 % NH 3 removal) was monitored during ten complete 24 h cycles for ammonia concentrations, airflow rates, and nitrogen accumulation in the acid solution basin. The average efficiency calculated using the air balance method was 71 % (Â± 4 %), close to the design value of 70 %, while the average efficiency when using the combined water-air balance method was 255 % (Â± 53 %). The accumulation and precipitation of ammonium salts in the packing material seem to be the main cause of the high variability and inaccuracy of the combined water-air balance method observed for this type of scrubber. According to these results, it is recommended to use the air balance method when determining the ammonia removal efficiency for acid <b>packed</b> bed <b>scrubbers</b> similar to the one studied here.

In this way a concentrated N/K fertilizer is produced from urine and ammonia {{is removed from the}} pig house exhaust air. Experiments were conducted using a pilot scale <b>packed</b> bed <b>scrubber</b> in an experimental pig house. The ammonia scrubbing efficiency and the evaporation rate were determined during one pig fattening round of 112 days. The average composition of the collected pig urine was 4. 4 g nitrogen/kg, 6. 6 g potassium/kg and 0. 03 g phosphorus/kg.

40|$|Present {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) systems demonstrate high system efficiency and impressive environmental performance, giving them {{an edge over}} conventional pulverised fuel power stations. A key area {{in the development of}} IGCCs is hot fuel gas clean-up (HGCU). Fuel gas cleaning at elevated temperatures reduces thermal efficiency losses associated with gas quenching in conventional cold gas cleaning methods. Current hot gas desulphurisation techniques focus on the use of regenerable metal oxide sorbents, however the long-term sorbent performance issues have yet to be fully addressed. A fresh and radical approach may provide the key to overcoming the inherent limitations associated with metal oxide sorbents. A molten tin irrigated <b>packed</b> bed <b>scrubber</b> adopted in this research project is one such innovative way forward in HGCU. The hot scrubber offers the prospect of a multicomponent clean-up device. High-temperature sulphur removal takes place via absorption of H 2 S (and COS) into molten tin whilst discrete molten tin droplets and rivulets on the packing surface act as solid particulate collectors. The primary aim of this research project was to investigate the workings of a small-scale room temperature <b>packed</b> bed <b>scrubber</b> operating under non-wetting flow conditions analogous to the molten tin irrigated scrubber. Water irrigation of low surface energy packings simulated the nonwetting flow of liquid metals. The air-water analogue of the liquid metal scrubber provided the platform for hydrodynamics (flow visualisation, flooding and liquid holdup), particulate removal and mass transfer studies under non-wetting flow conditions. The performance of a small air lift for water circulation through the column was also investigated. These cold studies offered insight into the operation and performance of the liquid metal hot scrubber. Prior to the cold gas scrubber studies, preliminary small-scale gasification tests on petroleum coke samples were performed to investigate the effect of molten tin on H 2 S in the product fuel gas. The tests provided actual experimental evidence of the possibility of sulphur removal by molten tin in a gasification environment. It was shown that the maximum possible size of a liquid droplet hanging from a non-wetting spherical solid surface could be predicted from the liquid surface tension and density based on force balance. The mobility of static holdup in a non-wettable packed bed has been demonstrated, this being due to the tendency for the liquid to form discrete droplets rather than spreading films. Existing flooding and liquid holdup correlations that hold for conventional wettable packed beds were shown to be inadequate where non-wetting systems were concerned. Summary hence alternative methods applicable to the latter were sought. The introduction of a non-wetting tendency factor based on the ratio of the solid critical surface tension to the liquid surface tension, enabled the flooding capacities of non-wetting systems including those of this study to be predicted using Sherwood et al. 's graphical flooding correlation. The total volumetric liquid holdup was well correlated against the bed pressure drop, true gas velocity and gas density, offering the prospects of predicting holdup for systems using the same spherical packing. In general, the water-irrigated packed bed showed good hydrodynamic similarities to liquid metal systems, suggesting a dominating influence of liquid-solid contact angle which overrides striking differences in liquid physical properties. The performance of the small air lift pump was unaffected by varying the number of gas ports on the injector without any change to the hole size. The operating curve of the air lift pump could be predicted with good accuracy using momentum balance and two phase flow theory, provided that all major pressure losses in the system were accounted for, including notably the downcomer friction losses and accelerative effects.

An industrial biofilter of 23 m 3 in volume, packed with a coconut fiber filter medium inoculated with tobacco compost (20 % by weight) was operated for a period of 45 days. The biofilter was supplied with a humidified gas stream from. Tobacco processing with main components being ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. The flow rate of the gas stream was varied from 1160 m 3 h- 1 to 2100 m 3 h- 1. Results indicated that hydrogen sulfide and ammonia were effectively removed 100 % and 95 % under an empty bed retention time (EBRT) of 36 s and 100 % and 90 % under an EBRT of 20 s respectively. Maximum elimination capacities of 5. 9 gm- 3 h- 1 and 27. 6 gm- 3 h- 1 were reached for an inlet loading of 1. 8 gm- 3 h- 1 and 3. 8 gm- 3 h- 1 for ammonia and hydrogen sulfide respectivelyAn industrial scale odour abatement system was designed and constructed, consisting of three units namely: condenser, scrubber and biofilter, the latter acting as the major unit of the system. The gas passes initially through a shell and tube heat exchanger giving moderate pollutant removal (7 % ammonia). The gas stream is then directed to a <b>packed</b> column <b>scrubber</b> where average removal of 85 % ammonia and greater than 19 % hydrogen sulfide was achieved. The two layer biofilter unit (24 m 3 in total volume) was packed only in a single layer (11. 65 m 3 in volume) with a mixture of coconut fiber and tobacco compost (90 / 1 0 (w/w)) and was used to polish off remaining hydrogen sulfide completely while more than 95 % of ammonia removal overall was achieved, resulting in a non odourous gas stream emitting to the atmosphere at ambient temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first waste gas treatment system employing the tricombination of condensation, scrubbing and biofiltration for the removal of odourous contaminants from tobacco waste gas...|$|R
40|$|Dioxins and furans, PCDD/Fs, {{are highly}} toxic {{substances}} formed in post combustion zones in furnaces. PCDD/F emissions are regulated by a waste incineration directive which relates also to co-incineration plants. Several observations of dioxin and furan enhancements in wet scrub- bers {{have been reported}} previously. This {{is thought to be}} due to the so-called "memory effect" which occurs when dioxins and furans absorb into plastic material in scrubbers and desorb when ambient circumstances alter significantly. At the co-incineration plant involved, dioxins and furans are controlled with a wet <b>scrubber,</b> the tower <b>packing</b> of which is made of plastic in which activated carbon particles are dispersed. This should avoid the memory effect and act as a dioxin and furan sink since dioxins and furans are absorbed irreversibly into the packing ma- terial. In this case, the tower <b>packing</b> in the <b>scrubber</b> is covered with a white layer that {{has been found to be}} mainly aluminium. The aim of this thesis was to determine the aluminium balance and the dioxin and furan behaviour in the scrubber and, thus, the impacts that the foul- ing has on dioxin and furan removal. The source of aluminium, reasons for fouling and further actions to minimize its impacts on dioxin and furan removal were also to be discovered. Measurements in various media around the scrubber and in fuels were made and a profile analysis of PCDD/F and mass balance calculations were carried out. PCDD/F content de- creased in the scrubber. The reduced PCDD/F was not discharged into scrubbing water. The removal mechanism seems to work in spite of the fouling, at least with low PCDD/F loads. Most of the PCDD/F in excess water originates from the Kymijoki River which is used as feeding water in the scrubber. Fouling turned out to consist mainly of aluminium hydroxides. Sludge combusted in the furnace was found to be a significant source of aluminium. Ways to minimize the fouling would be adjustment of pH to a proper lever, installation of a mechanical filter to catch the loose material from the scrubbing water and affecting the aluminium content of the sludge...|$|R
40|$|The power {{industry}} in the United States is faced with meeting many new regulations to reduce a number of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, fine particulate matter, and mercury. With over 1, 000 power plants in the US, this is a daunting task. In some cases, traditional pollution control technologies such as wet scrubbers and SCRs are not feasible. Powerspan's Electro-Catalytic Oxidation, or ECO{reg_sign} process combines four pollution control devices into a single integrated system that can be installed after a power plant's particulate control device. Besides achieving major reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }), nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and mercury (Hg), ECO produces a highly marketable fertilizer, which can help offset the operating costs of the process system. Powerspan has been operating a 50 -MW ECO commercial demonstration unit (CDU) at FirstEnergy Corp. 's R. E. Burger Plant near Shadyside, Ohio, since February 2004. In addition to the CDU, a test loop has been constructed beside the CDU to demonstrate higher NOx removal rates and test various <b>scrubber</b> <b>packing</b> types and wet ESP configurations. Furthermore, Powerspan has developed the ECO{reg_sign}{sub 2 } technology, a regenerative process that uses a proprietary solvent to capture CO{sub 2 } from flue gas. The CO{sub 2 } capture takes place after the capture of NOx, SO{sub 2 }, mercury, and fine particulate matter. Once the CO{sub 2 } is captured, the proprietary solution is regenerated to release CO{sub 2 } {{in a form that}} is ready for geological storage or beneficial use. Pilot scale testing of ECO{sub 2 } began in early 2009 at FirstEnergy's Burger Plant. The ECO{sub 2 } pilot unit is designed to process a 1 -MW flue gas stream and produce 20 tons of CO{sub 2 } per day, achieving a 90 % CO{sub 2 } capture rate. The ECO{sub 2 } pilot program provided the opportunity to confirm process design and cost estimates, and prepare for large scale capture and sequestration projects. The objectives of this project were to prove at a commercial scale that ECO is capable of extended operations over a range of conditions, that it meets the reliability requirements of a typical utility, and that the fertilizer co-product can be consistently generated, providing ECO with an economic advantage over conventional technologies currently available. Further objectives of the project were to show that the ECO system provides flue gas that meets the inlet standards necessary for ECO{sub 2 } to operate, and that the outlet CO{sub 2 } and other constituents produced by the ECO{sub 2 } pilot can meet Kinder-Morgan pipeline standards for purposes of sequestration. All project objectives are consistent with DOE's Pollution Control Innovations for Power Plants program goals...|$|R
