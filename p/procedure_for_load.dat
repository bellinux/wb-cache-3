40|$|Abstract-A {{reduction}} <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>load</b> {{distribution in}} asymmetric tall buildings comprising stiffening elements uch as frames and shear walls (both planar and core walls) is presented. The building {{is assumed to}} be divided into a number of segments, each segment spanning a number of storeys. Within each segment three reference floors are chosen, and the equations of equilibrium of the building are formed with respect to the deflections at the reference floors. The load distribution at the reference floors among various elements is first obtained. The loads at the reference floors of the stiffening elements are then replaced by an equivalent distributed loading, from which loads at the floor levels are obtained. The procedure yields sufficiently accurate results, and requires CPU time and computer storage locations which are only a fraction of those needed in the standard procedure. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{measurement}} <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>load</b> flow analysis in medium voltage (MV) smart grids. The new approach {{is based on}} power measurements at low voltage (LV) side of MV/LV distribution substations. Such measurements are carried out by means of power quality analyzers. If compared with the load flow methods based on measurements at the MV side, the proposed approach has a lower cost and it offers an equally reliable measurement system. The proposed algorithm takes the basic concept of the current summation backward/forward method; some modifications are introduced to use LV load powers measurements. To this aim, the MV/LV power transformer is properly modeled and {{taken into account in}} the algorithm. The proposed approach is validated by means of both simulations and experimental measurements; the test system is the MV distribution grid of Ustica Island, Italy. First, the proposed algorithm is compared with the MATLAB/Simulink load flow tool, which is based on the traditional Newton-Raphson method. Second, a comparison is carried out between the proposed method and the measurement data collected in the actual MV network of Ustica. Such comparison takes into account the uncertainties of both proposed method, and experimental active and reactive MV power measurements...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a simple electroporation <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>loading</b> suspensions of unfertilized sea urchin eggs with impermeant small molecules under conditions that allow close to 90 % successful fertilization and development. Poration {{is carried out}} in a low-Ca 2 + medium that mimicks the intracellular milieu. The induced pores remain open for several minutes in this medium, allowing loading of the cells; resealing is achieved by adding back millimolar calcium ions to the medium. While the pores are open, an influx of exogenous molecules and efflux of endogenous metabolites takes place, and the eggs can lose up to 40 % of their ATP content and still survive. Introduced metabolites are utilized by the cells, e. g., introduced 3 H-thymidine is incorporated into DNA. This procedure will be useful <b>for</b> <b>loading</b> impermeant substrates into eggs, permitting in vivo assessment of metabolism, and also for introducing other interesting impermeant molecules, such as inhibitors, fluorescent indicators, etc. Though the details may differ, the principle of electroporation in an intracellular-like medium {{may prove to be}} useful <b>for</b> <b>loading</b> other cell types with minimal loss of viability...|$|R
