2500|$|The Tuvaluan economy {{therefore}} {{relies heavily}} on its fishing income, with 42% of the Tuvaluan population involved in fishing activity at various levels. UN Data calculated a gross value of fisheries at US$43,773,582 (2007 est), which accounted for the output of coastal commercial fishing, coastal subsistence fishing, locally based offshore fishing, foreign-based offshore fishing, freshwater fishing and aquaculture. In recent years [...] all of the income has been generated through the listed activities in Tuvalu waters, rather than through exports direct from Tuvalu. The activities of international fishing vessels, which in 2008 comprised 42 longline fishing vessels, 3 pole/line vessels and 126 purse seiners, far outweigh domestic activity, with a <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> of 35,541 <b>tonnes</b> worth US$40,924,370 (2009 est) or 93.5% of gross value, although Tuvalu retains a sizeable share in income via licensing. The fishing in the 900,000km2 of water area mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna.|$|R
40|$|The two-generation study (OECD TG 416) is the {{standard}} requirement within REACH to test reproductive toxicity effects of chemicals with <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> > 100 <b>tonnes.</b> This test is criticized in terms of scientific relevance and animal welfare. The Extended One Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study (EOGRTS), incorporated into the OECD test guidelines in 2011 (OECD TG 443) {{has the potential to}} replace TG 416, while using only one generation of rats and being more informative. However, its regulatory acceptance proved challenging. This article reconstructs the process of regulatory acceptance and use of the EOGRTS and describes drivers and barriers influencing the process. The findings derive from literature research and expert interviews. A distinction is made between three sub-stages; The stage of Formal Incorporation of the EOGRTS into OECD test guidelines was stimulated by retrospective analyses on the value of the second generation (F 2), strong EOGRTS advocates, animal welfare concern and changing US and EU chemicals legislation; the stage of Actual Regulatory Acceptance within REACH was challenged by legal factors and ongoing scientific disputes, while the stage of Use by Industry is influenced by uncertainty of registrants about regulatory acceptance, high costs, the risk of false positives and the manageability of the EOGRTS.

30|$|For {{regulatory}} testing, {{the decision}} on waiving of testing can be proposed by the registrant {{and has to be}} justified. The final decision on acceptance of the waiving is decided by the regulatory body. For chemical substances under REACH information requirement is triggered by their <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b> Four different ranges of <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> per year are agreed on for which ecotoxicity data are required: 1 to < 10 t/a; 10 to < 100 t/a; 100 to < 1000 t/a; 1000 t/a and more). Chemicals with a high <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> have to be tested more comprehensively than chemicals with a lower <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b> For chemicals with low <b>production</b> <b>volumes,</b> only aquatic tests are requested whereas for chemicals with high <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> additionally terrestrial and sediment tests are required. In the presented test strategy for ENMs, only one threshold value based on one, rather low <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> is intended. This value still has to be defined. ENMs with <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> exceeding this threshold value have to be comprehensively tested addressing endpoints in the three compartments: water, sediment and soil. Also ENMs with a lower <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> than the threshold can be toxic to the environment. Therefore, two scenarios have to be considered. For low volume ENMs with bulk material of known ecotoxicity, comprehensive investigation has to be performed. For low volume ENMs where no bulk material is available, the bulk material shows no ecotoxicity, or ecotoxicity of the ENMs is expected due to their physico-chemical properties, a screening test has to be performed. If toxic effects are detected in the screening test, comprehensive testing has to be performed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} the {{mathematical}} logic behind a hierarchical planning procedure is discussed. The planning procedure {{is used to}} derive <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> of consumer products. The essence of the planning procedure is that first a commitment is made concerning the <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> {{for a family of}} similar products and in a second stage the committed <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> is allocated among the products within the product family. A computationally attractive procedure is developed to compute the aggregate <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> and the allocated quantities, such that some target customer service level is achieved. The procedure is based on a combination of exact reasoning, approximation schemes and empirical findings. Numerical results showing the excellent performance of the procedure are included...|$|R

The application works with part demand which can be either expressed in a probability distribution (probab listic <b>production</b> <b>volume)</b> or can not expressed in probability distribution, where only the different possible values for volume that can occur are known (uncertain <b>production</b> <b>volume).</b> Decision making under risk is used to help the designer select the best cell arrangement in case of prob bilistic <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> whereas decision making under uncertainty is used to help the designer select the best cell arrangement in case of uncertain <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b> The objective of the design methodology has been to maximize the profit, imposed by the resource capacities constraints...|$|R
50|$|We {{note that}} the {{productivity}} model reports a 1.4% productivity growth from the same production data. The difference (1.4% versus 1.5%) {{is caused by the}} different <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> used in the models. In the productivity model the input volume is used as a <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> measure giving the growth rate 1.063. In this case productivity is defined as follows: output volume per one unit of input volume. In the growth accounting model the output volume is used as a <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> measure giving the growth rate 1.078. In this case productivity is defined as follows: input consumption per one unit of output volume. The case can be verified easily with the aid of productivity model using output as a <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b>|$|R

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{has been}} widely used for wastewater treatment for decades. Several Anaerobic Toxicity tests {{have been developed to}} screen wastewater for toxicity and assess the treatability of such toxicants. However, past research and reviews on Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) test and Anaerobic Toxicity Assay (ATA) were considered in this study. The experimental tests included ammonium-nitrogen and sodium chloride toxicity tests with varied concentration and solid retention time. These tests were designed to demonstrate the impact of ammonia- nitrogen and sodium chloride on the biological degradation process. The anaerobic test set-up includes bench-scale test reactors and respirometers used for measuring gas <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> and rate. The experimental data using the gas <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> and rates were plotted and analyzed. The hourly rate of gas production significantly decreases before the daily <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> decreases. Also, the gas <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> curves showed little or no toxicity when the gas production rates showed toxicity and acclimation. In conclusion, the hourly production rate curves will indicate toxicity faster and extensively than the cumulative daily <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> curves, thereby reducing testing time...|$|R
