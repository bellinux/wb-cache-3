500|$|After {{the release}} of Subterranean Jungle, Marky was fired from the band due to his alcoholism. He was {{replaced}} by Richard Reinhardt, who adopted the name Richie Ramone. Joey Ramone remarked that [...] " [...] saved the band as far as I'm concerned. He's the greatest thing {{to happen to the}} Ramones. He put the spirit back in the band." [...] Richie is the only Ramones drummer to sing lead vocals on Ramones songs, including [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice" [...] as well as the unreleased [...] "Elevator Operator". Joey Ramone commented, [...] "Richie's very talented and he's very diverse... He really strengthened the band a hundred percent because he sings backing tracks, he sings lead, and he sings with Dee Dee's stuff. In the past, it was always just me singing for the most part." [...] Richie was also the only drummer to be the sole composer of Ramones songs including their hit [...] "Somebody <b>Put</b> <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> My Drink" [...] as well as [...] "Smash You", [...] "Humankind", [...] "I'm Not Jesus", [...] "I Know Better Now" [...] and [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice". Joey Ramone supported Richie's songwriting contributions: [...] "I encouraged Richie to write songs. I figured it would make him feel more a part of the group, because we never let anybody else write our songs." [...] Richie's composition, [...] "Somebody <b>Put</b> <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> My Drink", remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits. The eightsong bonus disc, The Ramones Smash You: Live'85, is also named after Richie's composition [...] "Smash You".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... I just thought that is really not fair and I {{think we have to}} <b>put</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{discussion}} among {{the producers of}} the series regarding whether Bertram {{should be included in}} the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un-used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian [...] "Oh, turn to the next page. I bet they put him in someone's utility pocket", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing [...] "Milkshake" [...] to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to [...] "warn the chef of Lois' arrival", Lois was intended to say [...] "If he won't <b>put</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> me, I will", but the gag was never broadcast.|$|E

2500|$|Chief Flying Hawk once visited {{some of the}} {{survivors}} of the Seneca tribe in New York State and had great admiration for their great Chiefs Cornplanter and Red Jacket. [...] He wished to <b>put</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his commentaries to show his regard for them. When McCreight informed Flying Hawk that Cornplanter’s father was white and was raised by his Seneca mother, [...] "The Chief said with a smile, That is why he amounted to something." [...] Flying Hawk requested that Red Jacket’s Speech on [...] "Religion for the White Man and the Red" [...] be included in his commentaries.|$|E

2500|$|Lamar is a Christian, and {{originally}} converted {{following the}} death of a friend. He has been outspoken about his Christianity, both in his music and interviews. He announced to an audience in the Staples Centre during Kanye West's Yeezus Tour that he had been baptized in 2013. Lamar has credited God for his fame and his deliverance from crime that often plagued Compton in the 1990s. Lamar also believes his career is divinely inspired and that he has a greater purpose to serve mankind, saying in an interview with Complex, [...] "I got a greater purpose, God <b>put</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> my heart to get across and that's what I'm going to focus on, using my voice as an instrument and doing what needs to be done." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] was {{a parody of}} benefit concert Live Aid and Hands Across America. The video was {{described}} by author Everett True to be [...] "reassuringly foolish" [...] and [...] "a welcome return to [...] old sense of humor." [...] Several guests are featured in the video, including The B52s, Weird Al Yankovic, Spinal Tap, Ted Nugent, The Circle Jerks, Toni Basil, Rodney Bingenheimer, Holly Beth Vincent, and Afrika Bambaataa. Because the music video was praised by Warner Bros., they released [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] as a double A-side with [...] "Somebody <b>Put</b> <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> My Drink." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] was also released with [...] "Animal Boy" [...] in the United States and [...] "Crummy Stuff" [...] in Great Britain through Beggars Banquet Records.|$|E
2500|$|Paul McCartney {{wrote the}} song while the Beatles were in Rishikesh, India, {{studying}} Transcendental Meditation. The title parodied Chuck Berry's [...] "Back in the U.S.A.," [...] while the chorus and background vocals were a humorous {{take on the}} Beach Boys' [...] "California Girls". Mike Love of the Beach Boys also attended the retreat in Rishikesh {{at the same time}} and he has stated in interviews that, in order to make the song sound more like a Beach Boys number, he encouraged McCartney to [...] "talk about the girls all around Russia, the Ukraine and Georgia" [...] in the lyrics. In 2013, Love noted, [...] "I was at the breakfast table when Paul McCartney came down with his acoustic guitar playing [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R.". I said, [...] "You ought to <b>put</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> about all the girls around Russia," [...] and he did." ...|$|E

As he was putting on the costume, in the {{bathroom}} attached to Bottweill's office, Wolfe's man heard something, peeked out, and saw Margot <b>putting</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the Pernod bottle. Miss Quon is not blatant about it, but she implies strongly that if Wolfe does not comply with her demand she will tell the police that Wolfe himself was Santa.|$|R
60|$|Another denial was {{hovering}} on Spennie's lips, when, in a flash, he {{saw what}} {{he had not seen}} before, the cloud of suspicion which must hang over him when the loss of the notes was discovered.

And Molly had actually seen him coming out of the room, <b>putting</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his pocket.|$|R
2500|$|Consequently, the {{somewhat}} recently added drummer Richie Ramone {{stepped up to}} the writing process, resulting in the hit song [...] "Somebody <b>Put</b> <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> My Drink," [...] which would be released as a single and also appeared on the band's first compilation album Ramones Mania (1988). [...] "Joey was always encouraging me to write songs," [...] explained Richie, [...] "but I didn't really need the encouragement." [...] This would be the first time the band used the drummer as a songwriter since original drummer Tommy Ramone, with Joey saying he wanted to make Richie feel like a part of the band, because he felt past drummers were not {{so much a part of}} the band nor any good at writing, while calling Richie a [...] "regular Phil Collins." [...] Johnny would later say the album needed a better production quality, commenting that the guitar moments didn't sound like he had performed them. [...] "The producer on , Jean Beauvoir," [...] Johnny relates, [...] "was selected by the label, not us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Eduardo Rivadavia, editor for AllMusic, criticized the album for using more modern commercial conventions and heavy use of synthesizers and keyboards {{in an attempt}} to reinvent the band's style. Rivadavia specifically pointed out [...] "Somebody <b>Put</b> <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> My Drink" [...] which he wrote [...] "wastes an aggressive vocal performance from Joey Ramone by supporting it with a shamelessly polished synthesizer backing track." [...] He goes on to call [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] "unbearably soft," [...] summing up that the album was a [...] "career low," [...] while he still rated the album three out of five stars. Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "B+" [...] deemed both [...] "She Belongs to Me" [...] and [...] "Crummy Stuff" [...] to be [...] "defensive-sounding" [...] but called [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] an anthem, while also praising [...] "My Head Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)." [...] Rolling Stone critic David Fricke called the album a [...] "reductionist masterpiece" [...] that [...] "proves they still have a lot more to give," [...] claiming it to rival previous albums Leave Home and Rocket to Russia.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{begins with}} Dee Dee singing [...] "Somebody <b>Put</b> <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> My Drink", {{which was written}} by Richie who stated that {{he came up with}} the lyrics while he was dating Frankie Valli's daughter, and he mistakenly drank after someone else in a nightclub. Rolling Stone editor David Fricke {{described}} Joey's vocal performance in the song as an [...] "exaggerated wino growl while Johnny crushes the chord changes with his trash-compactor guitar." [...] "Animal Boy" [...] and [...] "Apeman Hop" [...] were written to have compositions similar to [...] "Cretin Hop" [...] from 1977's Rocket To Russia, but described by True to be [...] "a thousandth as good." [...] "Love Kills" [...] is inspired by the Alex Cox biopic Sid and Nancy (also known as Sid and Nancy: Love Kills). The lyrics explain that the couple {{will never be able to}} win with drugs, despite the writer himself, Dee Dee, died of a heroin overdose. The fifth track, [...] "She Belongs to Me," [...] is a ballad written by Dee Dee and Beauvoir regarding unrequited love, and features a heavy use of synthesizers compared to that in previously released albums, which would have used a soft acoustic guitar or occasionally strings. Side A of the album concludes with [...] "Crummy Stuff" [...] with Dee Dee as lead vocalist. It is especially so here that the band plays with a pop punk style, with very repetitive lyrics based on the bands past being hectic and never meeting expectations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Putting</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> {{the focus}} {{means that it}} is the new {{information}} for the listener that they may not have known or where their knowledge must be corrected. For example, in the sentence [...] "Én vagyok az apád." [...] (I am your father, more exactly, It is I who am your father.) from the movie The Empire Strikes Back, the pronoun I (én) is in the focus, implying that this is new information, and the listener thought that another person was his father.|$|R
5000|$|Lounds' {{mutilation}} at Dolarhyde's hands is {{not shown}} in the film Manhunter, but is [...] "depicted with both more restraint and more ambiguity". In the film, Dolarhyde <b>puts</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his mouth that can not clearly be seen and taunts Lounds, before [...] "cutting to an exterior night shot of the killer's house... lets Lounds's distant, muffled screams tell the real story". The 2002 film adaptation of Red Dragon, however, retains the original scene from the novel, and shows Dolarhyde biting Lounds' lips off in close-up.|$|R

50|$|The Advertisements (Hire-Purchase) Act 1957 (1957 c.41) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{regulated}} the way {{in which}} hire-purchase agreements could be advertised.

A rather limited palette of colors, but it made his works all the more interesting. Later, after 1930, he started incorporating more colors in his compositions and also began to emphasize important elements with thick, black lines - an interesting idea that built several [...] "attention landmarks" [...] in his paintings.
