This paper considers <b>public-private</b> <b>partnerships</b> as another form of public sector intervention in the economy. It analyses the microeconomic pros and cons of publicprivate partnerships by identifying the sources of both higher benefits and higher costs associated with them, as compared to traditional public investment. Such analysis allows the outlining of the conditions under which <b>public-private</b> <b>partnerships</b> may be the optimal form of public sector intervention. In addition, the paper considers <b>public-private</b> <b>partnerships</b> from a macroeconomic perspective, focussing on their impact on fiscal policy and aggregate growth. public-private partnerships; procurement; economic efficiency...|$|R

5|$|Located {{entirely in}} southeastern Millard County, SR-161 starts at a diamond {{interchange}} with the westernmost exit on I-70 before it terminates at I-15. The road continues northward {{until it reaches}} the historic Cove Fort and the associated visitors center. On {{the eastern side of}} the highway is a Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) maintenance center. SR-161 starts to make a gentle turn to the northeast, passing a filling station, which also serves as a rest area as part of a <b>public–private</b> <b>partnership</b> between UDOT and the owners of the station.

The toll road was operated by a <b>public-private</b> <b>partnership</b> known as South Bay Expressway LLC. However, the partnership declared bankruptcy in 2010 and sold the road to the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) in 2011. Since then, following a decrease in the toll amount, traffic using the highway has increased.|$|E
40|$|<b>Public–private</b> <b>partnerships</b> in {{environmental}} policy should {{not simply be}} viewed in instrumental terms as means of providing environmental infrastructure and services, but also as sites where norms of environmental concern and political accountability are formulated and replicated. Deliberative <b>public–private</b> partnerships––or <b>partnerships</b> that allow greater public participation {{in the formulation of}} these norms––may therefore become an important new form of local environmental governance and help make partnerships more relevant to local environmental needs. This paper examines case studies of <b>public–private</b> <b>partnerships</b> in waste-to-energy projects in the Philippines and India to identify how principles of institutional design may enhance the deliberative nature of <b>public–private</b> <b>partnerships</b> {{in environmental}} policy. The paper argues that current approaches to deliberative, or cooperative environmental governance concerning <b>public–private</b> <b>partnerships</b> need to acknowledge insights from network theory concerning the communication of environmental and political norms before they can be successfully transferred to developing countries. ...|$|R

5|$|Initial {{planning}} of the segment between Barkåker and Tønsberg considered 13 different initial route proposals. However, no analysis for possible rights-of-way south of Tønsberg or north of Barkåker were considered. In September 1999, the government presented their proposal for National Transport Plan 2002–11, which included three segments on the Vestfold Line: Holm–Nykirke, Barkåker–Tønsberg and Farriseidet–Porsgrunn. When Parliament passed {{the plan in}} February 2001, the Barkåker–Tønsberg segment was prioritized second on the Vestfold Line, after a new passing loop at Nykirke. National Transport Plan 2002–11 proposed that construction start in 2005, but by November 2002, the National Rail Administration delayed the plans, following investment cuts by Bondevik's Second Cabinet. In response, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that she was considering financing the project as a <b>public–private</b> <b>partnership</b> paid through a surcharge on tickets fares.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} over the contract between the MWAA and Dulles Transit Partners, which consists of Bechtel and Washington Group International. The $2.7 billion project was originally awarded by VDOT under the Virginia <b>Public-Private</b> <b>Partnership</b> Act, rather than by using conventional competitive bidding based upon a detailed specification. As a result, the contractor is allowed to both design and build the project with no upper cap on its cost. Problems could arise from the arrangement where MWAA is supervising the design and construction but ultimately WMATA must operate the Silver Line. The contract provides for price escalation of $3 million to $6 million a month for delays. VDOT transferred the contract to MWAA when MWAA took over the project in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|Much of Livingstone's {{first two}} years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration. He also devoted much time to battling New Labour's plans to upgrade the London Underground system through a <b>public–private</b> <b>partnership</b> (PPP) program, believing it to be too {{expensive}} and tantamount to the privatisation of a state-owned service. He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide {{different parts of the}} Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program. These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on the picket line by Livingstone. Appointing Bob Kiley as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue, as had been done {{in the case of the}} New York City Subway. They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001–02, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the project went ahead, with the Underground being privatised in January 2003.|$|E
