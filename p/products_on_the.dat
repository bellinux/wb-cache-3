5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to reach a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming <b>products.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{had begun}} to promote a {{clothing}} line called Brooklyn Mint, which was to produce plus-sized clothing but fell dormant after he died. In 2004, his managers, Mark Pitts and Wayne Barrow, launched the clothing line, with help from Jay-Z, selling T-shirts with images of Wallace on them. A portion of the proceeds go to the Christopher Wallace Foundation and to Jay-Z's Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. In 2005, Voletta Wallace hired branding and licensing agency Wicked Cow Entertainment to guide the estate's licensing efforts. Wallace-branded <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market include action figures, blankets, and cell phone content.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Second World War, Crewe Hall {{was used}} as a {{military}} training camp, repatriation camp for Dunkirk troops and a US army camp, becoming the gun operations headquarters for the north-west region in 1942. It housed a prisoner-of-war camp for German officers from 1943. The hall was leased as offices in 1946, becoming the headquarters of Calmic Limited, who eventually employed nearly 800 people at Crewe Hall. Calmic produced hygiene and medical <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site including tablets, creams, analgesics and antibiotic aerosols; they constructed industrial facilities adjacent to the hall including a drying and filtration plant and pharmaceutical packaging unit. After Wellcome's acquisition of Calmic in 1965, the hall served as the UK and Ireland headquarters of the Wellcome Foundation until the merger with Glaxo in 1995. Wellcome produced liquids, tablets, creams and antibiotic aerosols at the site; the hall itself was used for administration, but the stables block was rebuilt internally for use as laboratories and the industrial facilities were expanded.|$|E

25|$|The {{discontinuous}} {{stretches of}} DNA replication <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lagging strand {{are known as}} Okazaki fragments and are about 100 to 200 bases in length at eukaryotic replication forks.

In eukaryotes, these single-stranded binding proteins are a heterotrimeric complex known as replication protein A (RPA).|$|E

The main agricultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island are honey, almonds, walnuts, olives (famously Throuba olives), and olive oil, as well as wine, sheep, goat herding, and fishing. Other industries are lumber and mining which includes lead, zinc, and marble, especially in the Panagia area {{where one of the}} mountains near the Thracian Sea has a large marble quarry. The marble quarries in the south (in the area of Aliki), now abandoned, were mined during ancient times.|$|E

25|$|Besides the Main and Secondary Market, {{there is}} a Corporate {{participation}} certificates Market (corporate bonds). Secondary Market is an exchange facility where the listed securities of small and mid-size companies can be traded efficiently and competitively. Any company, domestic or foreign, can list their <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exchange {{for as long as}} they meet the listing criteria. The value of three markets of Securities and Stock Exchange, Over-the-Counter (OTC) stock exchange and commodity exchange hit $100 billion in December 2010. In 2010, the Kish Stock Exchange was launched to facilitate foreign investment and monetary activities in Kish Island free trade zone.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{currently}} {{debate the}} future implications of nanotechnology.

These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.|$|E

25|$|During {{the height}} of the company's {{troubles}} {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, the St Michael brand used as the selling label for all M products was discontinued in favour of Marks & Spencer and a new logo in the Optima typeface was introduced and began to appear in place of St Michael on product packaging. The same logo was also applied to store fascias and carrier bags. The St Michael name was subsequently adopted as a 'quality guarantee' and appeared as the St Michael Quality Promise on the back of food <b>products,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of delivery vehicles and on in-store ordering receipts. This has since been phased out, although receipts for made-to-order furniture still feature this 'seal of approval' on the bottom.|$|E

For AutoNation, the company tested 30 variables to improve the effectiveness of ads for local dealerships and found that the size of the ad and whether it was in color had no effect on its effectiveness, despite increased costs.|$|E
