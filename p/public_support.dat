40|$|Objective: The {{object of}} this {{research}} is <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> in European Economic Area and its effectiveness assessment. The main aim is to propose a new model for <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> effectiveness assessment, adjusted to contemporary needs and based on practice of <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> development. Research Design & Methods: The methods of comparative, cluster, regression, modelling analysis, multi-criteria evaluation, analogy search, logical abstraction and impact evaluation have been applied for the research presented in this paper. Findings:  The paper conceptualizes a new model for the assessment of <b>public</b> innovation <b>support.</b> It is based on theoretical argumentation and practical verification. Its structure is based on new solutions and quantitative assessment methods. Implications & Recommendations: The analysis of the proposed model applicability revealed important patterns for the <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> impact assessment. Findings suggest that the increase of <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> index is a necessary but insufficient condition for the growth of the countries innovation index. The impact of <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> occurs only in the long run, as the delay of the effect exists. Contribution & Value Added: The proposed system of quantitative and qualitative indicators that characterize any <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> system (<b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> index) enables the creation and implementation of measures devoted to the <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> impact improvement at EU and national level. The practical application of the suggested model is significant for the effectiveness improvement of <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> at EU institutions...|$|R
