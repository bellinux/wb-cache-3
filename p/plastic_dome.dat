2500|$|To {{protect the}} {{workings}} of the beacon, a <b>plastic</b> <b>dome</b> often covers the assembly. [...] These domes usually come in solid colors, but in some cases the front and back halves of the dome are different colors. [...] Other beacons use a clear dome with colored lenses on each lamp. [...] Especially in the last case, these rotating beacons are sometimes referred to colloquially as ‘gumball machines’ or sometimes ‘cherry tops’ in the case of red lights.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "iconic" [...] {{flying saucer}} {{of the film}} has been {{variously}} identified as a paper plate or a hubcap. According to the documentary Flying Saucers Over Hollywood, The Plan 9 Companion (1991) {{it was actually a}} recognizable model kit produced in 1956 by toy manufacturer Paul Lindberg. Lindberg Line model kits had introduced a flying saucer kit, roughly matching the popular image of UFOs of the time: [...] "a silver disc-shaped craft with a clear dome on top." [...] Inside the <b>plastic</b> <b>dome</b> was a little green man. Both a regular version of the assembled model and a modified version appear in the film.|$|E

5000|$|Back cover {{illustrations}} for Amazing Stories (September 1940, January 1942) by Frank R. Paul. Europa is {{inhabited by}} red, beetle-like intelligent beings who ride domesticated centipedes and live inside immense transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>domes</b> {{in a city}} called Oor.|$|R
50|$|The most {{effective}} waterproofing method {{with a wooden}} dome is to shingle the dome. Peaked caps {{at the top of}} the dome, or to modify the dome shapes are used where slope is insufficient for ice barrier. One-piece reinforced concrete or <b>plastic</b> <b>domes</b> are also in use, and some domes have been constructed from plastic or waxed cardboard triangles that are overlapped in such a way as to shed water.|$|R
50|$|David Henesy (born October 20, 1956) is an American actor. He is {{the younger}} sibling of actress Sharon Henesy, who {{appeared}} in several films, including The <b>Plastic</b> <b>Dome</b> of Norma Jean (1965).|$|E

50|$|The Corn Popper is a toy {{manufactured}} by Fisher-Price since 1957. Aimed at pre-schoolers, when the Corn Popper is pushed or pulled, colored balls inside a <b>plastic</b> <b>dome</b> bounce {{and create a}} popping, bouncing noise.|$|E
50|$|A modern {{laboratory}} school {{does not need}} to do anything special with building construction, and is able to use a standard-design school as a {{laboratory school}}. The standard rooms are instead outfitted with CCTV cameras hidden inside black <b>plastic</b> <b>domes</b> on the ceiling. Complex lens optics and multiple cameras allow a single stationary dome to view 360 degrees in all directions with no mechanical noises or moving parts, and high-speed Internet connections allow for a professor at a college to remotely view and interact with student-teachers in a distant laboratory school.|$|R
50|$|Concrete and foam <b>plastic</b> <b>domes</b> {{generally}} {{start with}} a steel framework dome, wrapped with chicken wire and wire screen for reinforcement. The chicken wire and screen {{is tied to the}} framework with wire ties. A coat of material is then sprayed or molded onto the frame. Tests should be performed with small squares to achieve the correct consistency of concrete or plastic. Generally, several coats are necessary on the inside and outside. The last step is to saturate concrete or polyester domes with a thin layer of epoxy compound to shed water.|$|R
50|$|A {{thermoset}} {{polymer matrix}} is a synthetic polymer reinforcement first developed for structural applications, such as glass-reinforced <b>plastic</b> radar <b>domes</b> on aircraft and graphite-epoxy payload bay {{doors on the}} space shuttle. In polymer matrix composites, polymers act as binder or matrix to secure in place incorporated particulates, fibres or other reinforcements.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s Dickie Dee {{promoted}} products at gas stations and retail outlets in freezers called [...] "Bubble Cabinets". The Bubble Cabinets were chest-style display freezers {{with a clear}} <b>plastic</b> <b>dome</b> shaped lid, which allowed seeing the various products.|$|E
50|$|A hood dryer {{has a hard}} <b>plastic</b> <b>dome</b> {{that fits}} over a person's head to dry their hair. Hot air is blown out through tiny {{openings}} around {{the inside of the}} dome so the hair is dried evenly. Hood dryers are mainly found in hair salons.|$|E
50|$|A {{scale model}} of the 1964 New York World's Fair site, {{including}} all of its buildings and pavilions, {{is located in the}} exhibit gallery. It is protected under a clear <b>plastic</b> <b>dome,</b> allowing a close examination of the model, in which each significant structure is labeled with a small flag.|$|E
50|$|To {{accomplish}} its task, EGRET {{was equipped}} with a spark chamber, calorimeter, and <b>plastic</b> scintillator anti-coincidence <b>dome.</b> The spark chamber was used to induce a process called electron-positron pair production as a gamma ray entered the telescope. The calorimeter on the telescope was then used to record {{the data from the}} electron or positron. To reject other energy rays that would skew the data, scientists covered the telescope with a <b>plastic</b> scintillator anti-coincidence <b>dome.</b> The dome acted as a shield for the telescope and blocked out any unwanted energy rays.|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between auditory acuity, somatosensory acuity and {{the magnitude of}} produced sibilant contrast was investigated with data from 18 participants. To measure auditory acuity, stimuli from a synthetic sibilant continuum ([s]-[ʃ]) were used in a four-interval, two-alternative forced choice adaptive-staircase discrimination task. To measure somatosensory acuity, small <b>plastic</b> <b>domes</b> with grooves of different spacing were pressed against each participant’s tongue tip and the participant was asked to identify one of four possible orientations of the grooves. Sibilant contrast magnitudes were estimated from productions of the words ‘said,’ ‘shed,’ ‘sid,’ and ‘shid’. Multiple linear regression revealed a significant relation indicating {{that a combination of}} somatosensory and auditory acuity measures predicts produced acoustic contrast. When the participants were divided into high- and low-acuity groups based on their median somatosensory and auditory acuity measures, separate ANOVA analyses with sibilant contrast as the dependent variable yielded {{a significant main effect for}} each acuity group. These results provide evidence that sibilant productions have auditory as well as somatosensory goals and are consistent with prior results and the theoretical framework underlying the DIVA model of speech production...|$|R
5000|$|The Miracle-Gro AeroGarden is a smart {{countertop}} indoor garden made by AeroGrow International. The AeroGarden features {{proprietary technology}} which helps consumers grow fresh herbs, vegetables, salad greens and more indoors, year-round, using hydroponics. The seeds come in special seed pods, or consumers {{can use their}} own seeds with a custom kit. The plants receive artificial sunlight with built in, full spectrum CFL or LED grow lights that turn on and off automatically. Most AeroGardens have an adjustable light hood {{that can be used}} to grow taller plants, such as tomatoes. The AeroGarden comes in several different designs, colors and sizes, accommodating three, six, seven or nine seed pods at one time. All of the AeroGardens make use of liquid nutrient that is mixed into the water reservoir. Reminders tell the user when to add water and the patented liquid nutrients. Using hydroponics, roots soak in nutrient-rich water and no soil is needed. AeroGarden comes with <b>plastic</b> <b>domes</b> to put over seed pods to encourage germination, however, these can cause excessive humidity and cause mold if kept on too long.|$|R

However {{it becomes clear that}} the young man {{does not want to be}} freed from his glamorous captors.|$|E
50|$|By 2001 the {{building}} had been painted externally and the amber <b>plastic</b> roof <b>dome</b> was replaced with a large funnel shaped object concealing an air conditioning plant. The interior of {{the building}} remains substantially intact with original unpainted internal timberwork, glazed brickwork on the lower floor and original furniture and fittings including the counter, some perimeter shelving and other shelving units. The building ceased operating as the Toowong Library in 2001 and is privately owned.|$|R
50|$|The R-6 was {{constructed}} {{with a metal}} fuselage, which was a departure from Ross's earlier designs. The passenger seat is behind the pilot's seat, aft of the wing spar and has no windows, visibility is provided by a removable <b>plastic</b> overhead <b>dome.</b> The wing features dive brakes. The wingspan was later increased to 60 ft, lowering the wing loading somewhat, but increasing the high aspect ratio to 28:1. Originally taking off from a dolly and landing on a fixed skid, the R-6 later had a retractable monowheel landing gear installed.|$|R
5000|$|Li'l Missy Beaded Doll Kits {{were made}} in the early 1970s. The 6" [...] tall doll had a dylite form body that {{required}} no sewing.Each kits included pins, sequins, beads, colorful fabric, ribbons and trim. Other embellishments included flowers and fruit. There was a large variety of kits representing countries of the world, careers, holidays, birthdays, etc. These kits were a big hit with girls from ages 8 to 75. Additional accessories available were revolving plastic musical stands, <b>plastic</b> display <b>domes</b> and cardboard doll houses, some sold in a three doll package.|$|R
50|$|The Corn Popper {{was invented}} in 1957 by Arthur Holt, who died in April 1996, and sold to Fisher-Price for $50. The Corn Popper {{is one of the}} most popular toys for young {{children}} in history, and was designed to help them learn to walk. It sends tiny, colorful, gumball-size balls flying and hitting the <b>plastic</b> <b>dome</b> to create its signature loud popping noise.|$|E

5000|$|While it was {{primarily}} {{restored to its}} colonial era appearance, Cuevas had the convent’s courtyard roofed with a <b>plastic</b> <b>dome</b> to have a contrary and modern element. The entrance of the museum is located at 13 Academia Street, {{around the corner from}} the Santa Inés Church. The courtyard's patio is dominated by a tall bronze sculpture named “La Giganta” (The Female Giant). Cuevas created this site specific sculpture for this space. [...] The statue is 8 m tall and weighs 8 tons.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1954, the U.S. Marines {{experimented with}} helicopter-deliverable {{geodesic}} domes. A 30-foot wood and <b>plastic</b> geodesic <b>dome</b> was lifted and carried by helicopter at 50 knots without damage, {{leading to the}} manufacture of a standard magnesium dome by Magnesium Products of Milwaukee. Tests included assembly practices in which previously untrained Marines were able to assemble a 30-foot magnesium dome in 135 minutes, helicopter lifts off aircraft carriers, and a durability test in which an anchored dome successfully withstood a day-long 120 mph propeller blast from the twin 3,000 horsepower engines of an anchored airplane without damage.|$|R
50|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{detecting}} individual gamma rays ranging from 30 MeV to 30 GeV, EGRET was equipped with a <b>plastic</b> scintillator anti-coincidence <b>dome,</b> spark chamber, and calorimeter. Starting from {{the outside of the}} telescope, scientists covered EGRET with a <b>plastic</b> scintillator anti-coincidence <b>dome.</b> The dome acted as a shield, blocking any unwanted energy waves from entering the telescope and skewing the data. To actually create recordable, usable data, scientists used a process called electron-positron pair production, which is creating an electron and positron simultaneously near a nucleus or subatomic particle. In order to induce this process, scientists assembled a multilevel thin-plate spark chamber within the telescope. A spark chamber is basically a chamber with many plates of metal and gases such as helium or neon. Finally, to record the data from the electron or positron about the gamma ray, scientists equipped EGRET with a thallium-activated sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) calorimeter at its base. The calorimeter captured the resolution of the gamma rays that entered EGRET.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{reports on}} the {{low-energy}} gamma-ray bursts observed by the <b>plastic</b> scintillator anticoincidence <b>dome</b> of the Small Astronomy Satellite- 2 (SAS- 2) gamma-ray telescope. SAS- 2 detected two events observed by other satellites and discovered one which was subsequently confirmed by other satellite observations. Two events seen by other satellites were not detected by SAS- 2, probably due to earth occultation. The event detection threshold for SAS- 2 was almost two orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} the Vela satellites...|$|R
50|$|The moving {{terrestrial}} globe {{was protected by}} a hemispherical transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>dome,</b> on which was engraved and printed a cross-shaped sight. Under normal operations, the point visible under the cross was the point on Earth which was directly under the spacecraft at any given time. A second mode of operation, activated by the cosmonauts, advanced the globe to a position where the spacecraft would land should the retrorockets be fired at that moment to affect the reentry sequence, which also lit the место посадки indicator. The latitude and longitude indicators followed these two modes of operation as well.|$|E

50|$|This pitfall (but {{not in the}} setting-sun case) is {{avoided by}} incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an {{integrating}} sphere (usually, a translucent hemispherical <b>plastic</b> <b>dome</b> is used to approximate this) placed {{on top of the}} light sensor. Because the incident-light reading is independent of the subject's reflectance, it is less likely to lead to incorrect exposures for subjects with unusual average reflectance. Taking an incident-light reading requires placing the meter at the subject's position and pointing it {{in the general direction of}} the camera, something not always achievable in practice, e.g., in landscape photography where the subject distance approaches infinity.|$|E
50|$|The basic dome has a {{rectangular}} floor and two poles which cross at the peak; each pole {{runs in a}} smooth curve from one bottom corner, up to the peak, and then down to the diagonally opposite bottom corner. There are usually special fittings at each corner which fit into sockets {{at the ends of}} each pole - pole tension keeps everything in shape. The poles can run on either the inside or outside of the tent fabric. When located on the interior, poles are held in place by a variety of means including hook and loop style straps, clips, and other fastening hardware. Poles that are located {{on the outside of the}} tent fabric are attached via fabric pole sleeves or <b>plastic</b> clips. <b>Dome</b> tents do not require guy ropes and pegs for structural integrity as they are considered free-standing, but must be pegged down in high winds.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} covered litter boxes exist that are {{commonly}} available and moderately priced. Many are constructed out of plastic and feature a <b>plastic</b> hood or <b>dome</b> {{that covers the}} litter pan and litter. The pet enters through {{an opening in the}} cover. Pet owners lift the cover off the tray to scoop, clean and change the litter. Covered litter boxes may reduce the amount of litter that is tracked outside the box and may address issues of pet eliminating waste over the walls of a litter pan.|$|R
