Results of analysis useful for government to review whether the price received by farmers is quite feasible when viewed from the price of rice sold to consumers. The data used are secondary data from monthly data for average price of rice retail and average prices of grain producers in Indonesia. Monthly data from January 2000 to December 2008 is the time series data and analyzed with a model of Vector Autoregression (VAR). The {{results showed that the}} price movements of grain producers and rice consumers in Indonesia have a similar direction, but the price of grain producers more volatile than rice consumers. Grain <b>producers</b> <b>market</b> has not fully integrated with the rice retail market in Indonesia. In the short term grain <b>producers</b> <b>market</b> influenced by rice consumers market but it does not vice versa.

50|$|Swedish {{interest}} {{in research on}} channels of distribution for industrial goods has been limited historically. The same is true in other countries as well, as has been reported, for example, by Ford. In fact, this is tree for the field of industrial marketing in general. It is a little surprising that industrial markets have been so neglected. If economic values are considered, <b>producer</b> <b>markets</b> are dominant over consumer markets. According to Flodhammar and Nielsen, the turnover of the Swedish <b>producer</b> <b>market</b> is four {{times that of the}} consumer market. One reason for the slight research interest is that up to the 1970s many industries could be characterised as operating in a 'seller's market.' Demand exceeded supply. No kind of modern marketing existed; it was only a question of selling.|$|R

The study takes into consideration a market condition in which government policy restricts arbitrage coffee trade between coffee producing areas. Using coffee price data from 1998 - 2013 and applying a bounds test approach and Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality test, the study finds that the establishment of ECX has strengthened regional integration rather than a national harmony between <b>producer</b> <b>markets.</b> We also find evidence that, since the establishment of ECX, an opportunity was created for high quality coffee to dominate price formation while also allowing lower quality coffee producing areas to establish themselves. The study underlines the importance of market transparency and exchange of price information between <b>producer</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{changes in}} {{government}} policies, {{supply and demand}} fundamentals and price patterns in the cotton market have led to several shifts in how <b>producers</b> <b>market</b> their cotton. This thesis examined <b>producer</b> cash <b>marketing</b> choices, including direct and indirect hedging, in four different periods since 2001. Special {{emphasis was placed on}} the 2010 season - a season characterized by historically high prices and volatility. <b>Producer</b> <b>marketing</b> behavior was modeled as a discrete choice between four different cash market outlets: forward contracting with a merchant, post-harvest cash contracting, contracting with a merchant pool and contracting with a cooperative pool. Hedging was characterized as a tool that was used in conjunction with one of the four discrete choices. This thesis employed multinomial logit estimation to determine the influence of factors on producers' choice of primary cash marketing decisions. Data were collected from a mail survey of the population of cotton growers in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. The most important determinants of cotton cash marketing choices were 1) prior participation in cooperative pools, beliefs about the value of pre-harvest pricing, beliefs about the performance of merchant pools, willingness to accept lower prices to reduce risk, and several socio-economic variables...|$|R
