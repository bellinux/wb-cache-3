A cooperative agreement between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project, with one of their aims being to promote sleep hygiene awareness.|$|E

500|$|The five doctors {{examined}} Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Terri herself. Drs. Cranford, Greer, and Bambakidis {{testified that}} Terri Schiavo {{was in a}} persistent vegetative state. Drs. Maxfield and Hammesfahr testified {{that she was in}} a minimally conscious state. As part of the court-ordered medical exam, six hours of video of Terri Schiavo were taped and filed at the Pinellas County courthouse. The tape included Terri Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Terri [...] "clearly does not consistently respond to her mother". From that six hours of video, the Schindlers and their supporters produced six clips showing reactions and emotions, totaling less than six minutes, and released those clips to <b>public</b> <b>websites.</b> Judge Greer ruled that Terri Schiavo was in a PVS, and was beyond hope of significant improvement. The trial court order was particularly critical of Hammesfahr's testimony, which claimed positive results in similar cases by use of vasodilation therapy, the success of which is unsupported in the medical literature. This ruling was later affirmed by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, which stated that [...] "this court has closely examined all of the evidence in the record," [...] and [...] "we have... carefully observed the video tapes in their entirety." [...] The court concluded that [...] "...if we were called upon to review the guardianship court's decision de novo, we would still affirm it." [...] This decision by the Second District Court of Appeals {{came to be known as}} Schiavo IV in later rulings.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to the Wall Street Journal, Robert Bell, the President and CEO of University Health Network, Toronto, said that Michael Moore's film Sicko [...] "exaggerated the {{performance}} of the Canadian health systemâ€” {{there is no doubt that}} too many patients still stay in our emergency departments waiting for admission to scarce hospital beds." [...] However, [...] "Canadians spend about 55% of what Americans spend on health care and have longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. Many Americans have access to quality healthcare. All Canadians have access to similar care at a considerably lower cost." [...] There is [...] "no question" [...] that the lower cost has come at the cost of [...] "restriction of supply with sub-optimal access to services," [...] said Bell. A new approach is targeting waiting times, which are reported on <b>public</b> <b>websites.</b>|$|E

[...] However, when Ash Carter became Defense Secretary the next month, he replaced the Board chairman, the McKinsey results were classified as secret, and its report was removed from <b>public</b> <b>websites.</b> [...] Mabus then gave a speech at the American Enterprise Institute highlighting the McKinsey report, calling the back-office costs [...] "pure overhead" [...] and particularly criticizing the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Defense Logistics Agency. [...] Under Secretary Frank Kendall III then wrote to him asking [...] "please refrain from taking any more public pot shots" [...] and [...] "I do not want this spilling over into further public discourse." ...|$|E
