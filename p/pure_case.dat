60|$|Unregenerate as I was I {{could read}} the queer {{implications}} of this speech. The present owner’s superior virtue {{as well as his}} deeper craft spoke in his reference to the late editor as one of that baser sort who deal in false representations. Mr. Deedy would as soon have sent me to call on Neil Paraday as he would have published a “holiday-number”; but such scruples presented themselves as mere ignoble thrift to his successor, whose own sincerity took the form of ringing door-bells and whose definition of genius was the art of finding people at home. It was as if Mr. Deedy had published reports without his young men’s having, as Pinhorn would have said, really been there. I was unregenerate, as I have hinted, and couldn’t be concerned to straighten out the journalistic morals of my chief, feeling them indeed to be an abyss over the edge of which it was better not to peer. Really to be there this time moreover was a vision that made the idea of writing something subtle about Neil Paraday only the more inspiring. I would be as considerate as even Mr. Deedy could have wished, and yet I should be as present as only Mr. Pinhorn could conceive. My allusion to the sequestered manner in which Mr. Paraday lived—it had formed part of my explanation, though I knew of it only by hearsay—was, I could divine, very much what had made Mr. Pinhorn nibble. It struck him as inconsistent with the success of his paper that any one should be so sequestered as that. And then wasn’t an immediate exposure of everything just what the public wanted? Mr. Pinhorn effectually called me to order by reminding me of the promptness with which I had met Miss Braby at Liverpool on her return from her fiasco in the States. Hadn’t we published, while its freshness and flavour were unimpaired, Miss Braby’s own version of that great international episode? I felt somewhat uneasy at this lumping of the actress and the author, and I confess that after having enlisted Mr. Pinhorn’s sympathies I procrastinated a little. I had succeeded better than I wished, and I had, as it happened, work nearer at hand. A few days later I called on Lord Crouchley and carried off in triumph the most unintelligible statement that had yet appeared of his lordship’s reasons for his change of front. I thus set in motion in the daily papers columns of virtuous verbiage. The following week I ran down to Brighton for a chat, as Mr. Pinhorn called it, with Mrs. Bounder, who gave me, on the subject of her divorce, many curious particulars that had not been articulated in court. If ever an article flowed from the primal fount it was that article on Mrs. Bounder. By this time, however, I became aware that Neil Paraday’s new book was on the point of appearing and that its approach had been the ground of my original appeal to Mr. Pinhorn, who was now annoyed with me for having lost so many days. He bundled me off—we would at least not lose another. I’ve always thought his sudden alertness a remarkable example of the journalistic instinct. Nothing had occurred, since I first spoke to him, to create a visible urgency, and no enlightenment could possibly have reached him. It was a <b>pure</b> <b>case</b> of profession flair—he had smelt the coming glory as an animal smells its distant prey.|$|E
40|$|Numerical and {{analytical}} {{investigations of the}} hydraulic fracture propagation problem, from a cased and cemented wellbore, have been pursued in this communication. A two-dimensional plane model has been used. Pure bond and pure slip boundary conditions, along the steel/cement and the cement/rock interfaces have been implemented, as two extreme cases. Both the in-plane and the anti-plane problems have been considered. Analytical and numerical methods have been applied {{to the problem of}} a straight fracture, while in the curved crack case only a numerical solution has been adopted. Crack turning is found to depend on the elastic properties of the rock in the <b>pure</b> bond <b>case,</b> while in the <b>pure</b> slip <b>case</b> no turning occurs. Results indicate that in the <b>pure</b> slip <b>case,</b> a larger pressure than that of the <b>pure</b> bond <b>case,</b> is required at the first propagation step. Results related to a starter (i. e. at the first propagation step) crack lying parallel to the plane of the maximum remote principal stress while the elastic modulus of the rock varies, indicate that bigger values, for both the pressure and the mode I crack opening displacement (COD) at the open hole, develop in the <b>pure</b> slip <b>case</b> than in the <b>pure</b> bond <b>case.</b> Results concerning a starter crack, inclined at varying angles with respect to the plane of the maximum remote principal stress, show that the mode II COD at the open hole is bigger in the <b>pure</b> bond <b>case</b> than in the <b>pure</b> slip <b>case,</b> for all the angles of inclination.

Anderson (2013) cites among the failures: Eastern Europe (the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia), Africa (the East African Federation and Ethiopia-Eritrea), the Caribbean region (the Federation of the West Indies), and Asia (Pakistan and Malaya-Singapore).

40|$|We {{study the}} design of {{monetary}} policy in a continuous time framework with delays. More explicitly, we consider a linear, flexible price model where inflation and nominal interest rates chage continously, but where nominal rates are set by the Central bank {{in response to a}} lagged inflation measure, and where the measure of inflation can be constructed as a flexible distributed delay. Therefore the central bank has, in addition to the choice of an ”active ” or ”passive ” response to inflation, two additional parameters to select: the lag of the inflation measure, and the coefficient for the distributed delay to construct the inflation measure. The pure continuous time and discrete time frameworks emerge as special cases of our differential-delay system. This richer framework also allows us to reconcile results on the local uniqueness and multiplicity of equilibria that obtain in the two <b>pure</b> <b>cases,</b> to uncover special assumptions embedded in the <b>pure</b> <b>cases,</b> and to prescribe effective policy options to avoid the problem of local indeterminacy and its unintended consequences...|$|R
5000|$|Marx insists {{both that}} output prices {{obtained}} will necessarily deviate from values produced, {{but also that}} the sum of prices would equal to the sum of values in the <b>pure</b> <b>case,</b> yet, critics claim, he fails to show quantitatively how a distribution process could then occur such that price magnitudes map onto value magnitudes, and such that a uniform profit rate returns equal profits to capitals of equal sizes (a mapping relation is used here in the mathematical sense of a bijective morphism, involving one-to-one correspondence between value quantities and price quantities via mathematical equations).

5000|$|A {{more serious}} {{criticism}} of Marx {{is that the}} theory of prices of production is still pitched at a far too abstract theoretical level {{to be able to}} explain anything like specific real price movements. That is, Marx only illustrated with examples the general results towards which the competitive process would tend to move in capitalism as a social system. He tried to establish what regulates product prices in the [...] "simplest and purest case". He believed that if one could not do that, then one could also not explain all the variations from the <b>pure</b> <b>case.</b> He had not however provided a model for accurately predicting specific price movements. In this regard, it is interesting to study the writings of Michael Porter, in order to see how Marx's original intent relates to modern competitive business practice, and how it might be elaborated on (see further the important studies by Willi Semmler, Christian Bidard, Peter Flaschel, Anwar Shaikh, and Lefteris Tsoulfidis).|$|E

40|$|Artificial {{numerical}} dissipation is {{in important}} issue in large Reynolds number computations. In such computations, the artificial dissipation inherent in traditional numerical schemes can overwhelm the physical dissipation and yield inaccurate results on meshes of practical size. In the present work, the space-time conservation element and solution element method {{is used to}} construct new and accurate implicit numerical schemes such that artificial numerical dissipation will not overwhelm physical dissipation. Specifically, these schemes have the property that numerical dissipation vanishes when the physical viscosity goes to zero. These new schemes therefore accurately model the physical dissipation {{even when it is}} extremely small.
