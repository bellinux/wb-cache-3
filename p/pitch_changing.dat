This initial product was notably used by ELO, 10cc and Paul McCartney, who used it on the Wings' London Town album in 1978. In 1978 AMS introduced the world's first microprocessor controlled, 15 bit digital delay line - the AMS DMX 15-80.One of the early users of the AMS DMX 15-80 was Manchester record producer Martin Hannett who {{would go on to}} own quite a few of the devices.

50|$|The newest {{version of}} the Mandala, mk2.9, is a {{standard}} class-compliant USB MIDI controller (no special drivers required) which uses a computer as its sound source. When the pad is struck it sends a MIDI trigger note with velocity {{as well as a}} position value (in the form of a MIDI continuous controller) across a USB cable into a computer. A Virtual Brain program is included with mk2.9 and has a set of included instrument samples and multiple effects (filters, delay, distortion, etc.) which can be applied to individual zones or to the overall surface. Unlimited user samples can also be added to the included sound library. Any parameter of any effect can be controlled by the position (0-127) or velocity (0-127) of a surface strike, resulting in effects such as bending <b>pitch,</b> <b>changing</b> delay time, or increasing reverb as the pad is played from center to edge. The position controller and velocity controller can be scaled to the player's liking. Factory preset sound configurations are included with the Virtual Brain as well as unlimited empty slots for user created presets. Drummers can also modify panning and note settings for each zone. The Virtual Brain program is not required to play the Mandala because the pad is a MIDI controller that can trigger any software that accepts MIDI input.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{innovative}} method for tonal and non-tonal language classification using prosodic information is reported. The normalized feature parameters that measure <b>pitch</b> <b>changing</b> speed and <b>pitch</b> <b>changing</b> level {{are used to}} train a 3 -layer feedforward neural network for the classification. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, the recognition rate and the processing time of the novel system are compared with a PPRLM system on a 2 -language identification task. For the evaluation results of identifying English/Mandarin, the novel system can achieve a recognition rate of 83. 3 %, compared with 91. 7 % of the PPRLM system. However, the processing time of the novel system is only half of that of the PPRLM system. In another extended tonal and non-tonal language classification task with 6 languages, the novel system can achieve a classification rate of 80. 6 %. Possible applications of the new method to perform pre-classification in language identification are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our research}} on speech interfaces using nonverbal speech information. Although speech information consists of {{verbal and nonverbal}} information, most speechrecognition research has made use of only verbal information such as words and sentences. From among nonverbal information, we have focused on hesitation (filled pause) and prosody (voice pitch) to create four speech-interface functions: Speech Completion, Speech Shift, Speech Starter, and Speech Spotter. Hesitation, for example, {{can be used as}} a trigger to complete an uttered fragment and <b>pitch</b> <b>changing</b> can be used to enter a word with it having different functions. By having users intentionally utter nonverbal information according to simple rules, we have achieved interfaces that can exploit the potential of speech in various forms.

40|$|A {{frequently}} repeated {{machine element}} {{in almost every}} mechanical design, regardless {{of the field of}} use, is the power screw (leadscrew). It`s main purpose is to transform rotary motion into linear, and vice versa, whereat the last mentioned option is rarely used since self-locking of the power screw is no longer provided. Every machine element has different advantages and disadvantages but all come together in one unique technical parameter which is valid for every machine, the degree of efficiency. Irrespective of many advantages power screws have, it`s wider use in other applications is restricted due to it`s low degree of efficiency. This paper should give some theoretical proposals on how to increase the degree of efficiency on power screws. Authors present several ways to increase the degree of efficiency by starting to increase the <b>pitch,</b> <b>changing</b> the thread geometry (profile), assuming a lower coefficient of drag, using multi-start screws and finally giving a suggestion which includes a combination of some mentioned solutions. It is important to emphasize that all mentioned suggestions are solutions through out the design of power screws, not considering tribological phenomenons like coefficient of drag or used material...|$|E
