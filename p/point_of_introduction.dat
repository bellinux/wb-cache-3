Due to its history of successful dispersal and range extension, the lime butterfly is likely to spread from its original <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> in Hispaniola in the Caribbean to neighbouring Florida, Central America and South America. Due to its capability for rapid population growth under favourable circumstances and its having been recorded to have five generations in a year in temperate regions of China, it is considered a serious potential threat. The caterpillars can completely defoliate young citrus trees (below 2 feet) and devastate citrus nurseries. In mature trees, caterpillars may prefer young leaves and leaf flush.|$|E

In March 2009, it was announced that the first unit had received its passenger certification from Network Rail, allowing it to carry passengers. London Midland stated that they would begin a phased entry into service, starting with weekend operation in April, leading up to a full service by the timetable change in May 2009. Until then, London Midland temporarily returned a Class 153 to operating the branch service. 139 002 officially entered service on 29 March 2009 as part of the type's phased entry.

5000|$|Two {{days after}} the 2012 Hungarian Grand Prix, the teams {{unanimously}} agreed to ban the use of double-DRS systems for the 2013 season. Nevertheless, Lotus continued their development of a double-DRS system, which they referred to as [...] "The Device", and anticipated its introduction at the Belgian Grand Prix, one month later. However, heavy rain {{in the first two}} practice sessions at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit delayed The Device's introduction. The team's plans were further put on hold after Romain Grosjean was banned from taking part in the Italian Grand Prix for his role in a multi-car pile-up {{at the start of the}} Belgian Grand Prix. Grosjean was replaced by the team's testing and reserve driver, Jérôme d'Ambrosio, but d'Ambrosio's inexperience with the 2012-specification of cars and the low-downforce nature of the Monza circuit — which meant that any gain a double-DRS system had to offer would be negated — prompted the team to delay The Device's introduction even further, naming the Japanese Grand Prix in early October as their planned <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction.</b> The team used the double-DRS system as planned during Friday practice, but shelved it until the third round of Young Driver Tests in November after being unhappy with their progress.

40|$|Monitoring {{the spread}} and {{distribution}} of introduced species in an area can be challenging due {{to a variety of}} issues. Range expansion may exceed expected rates if the area <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> is more suitable than expected, and may be slowed by an area in which it is difficult to establish a population. The species of interest in this study is the Eastern Fox Squirrel (Sciurus niger rufiventer) and the focus of the study is the spread of the species in Southern California. Previous studies have shown a steady and continuous spread from main <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> in Southern California and the species is now considered well established in the Los Angeles area. In this study, we collect, display, and discuss the spread of the Eastern Fox Squirrel in this area from 2005 through 2014 and include habitat suitability models to predict the future distribution of the species over time. Results show that the Eastern Fox Squirrel has spread east into Rancho Cucamonga, into southern portions of Irvine, and has maintained isolated populations in places such as San Diego and Riverside.

40|$|Abstract Background Initial {{data on the}} {{molecular}} epidemiology of HCV infection in Cyprus showed a highly polyphyletic infection and multiple <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> in{{to the general population}}. The continuation and expansion of this investigation is presented here including high risk groups. Findings The samples include additional subjects from the general population, a group of inmates and HIV/HCV coinfected individuals, whose strains were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced in partial Core-E 1 and NS 5 B regions. The results confirm the broad genotype distribution and polyphyletic infection on the island, and no new subtypes were found. Monophyletic clusters between strains of the prisoners and the injecting drug users imply sharing of infected equipment, and highlight the risk of widespread transmission in these cohorts, although no spill-over to the general population was observed. Conclusions The results of this study underline the impact of population movements and high-risk population groups on the changing molecular epidemiology of HCV, with strains moving to Europe from Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe by means of immigration and modern transmission routes. </p...|$|R
50|$|Tilapia {{are unable}} to survive in {{temperate}} climates because they require warm water. The pure strain of the blue tilapia, Oreochromis aureus, has the greatest cold tolerance and dies at 45 F, while all other species of tilapia will die at a range of 52 to 62 F. As a result, they cannot invade temperate habitats and disrupt native ecologies in temperate zones; however, they have spread widely beyond their <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> in many fresh and brackish tropical and subtropical habitats, often disrupting native species significantly. Because of this, tilapia are on the IUCN's 100 of the World's Worst Alien Invasive Species list.

40|$|Release {{from natural}} enemies is {{considered}} to potentially {{play an important role}} in the initial establishment and success of introduced plants. With time, the species richness of herbivores using non-native plants may increase [species-time relationship (STR) ]. We investigated whether enemy release may be limited to the early stages of invasion. Substituting space for time, we sampled invertebrates and measured leaf damage on the invasive species Senecio madagascariensis Poir. at multiple sites, north and south of the introduction site. Invertebrate communities were collected from plants in the field, and reared from collected plant tissue. We also sampled invertebrates and damage on the native congener Senecio pinnatifolius var. pinnatifolius A. Rich. This species served as a control to account for environmental factors that may vary along the latitudinal gradient and as a comparison for evaluating the enemy release hypothesis (ERH). In contrast to predictions of the ERH, greater damage and herbivore abundances and richness were found on the introduced species S. madagascariensis than on the native S. pinnatifolius. Supporting the STR, total invertebrates (including herbivores) decreased in abundance, richness and Shannon diversity from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> to the invasion fronts of S. madagascariensis. Leaf damage showed the opposite trend, with highest damage levels at the invasion fronts. Reared herbivore loads (as opposed to external collections) were greater on the invader at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> than on sites further from this region. These results suggest there is a complex relationship between the invader and invertebrate community response over time. S. madagascariensis may be undergoing rapid changes at its invasion fronts in response to environmental and herbivore pressure. 14 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This study {{combined}} microsatellite nuclear DNA {{analysis with}} cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) mitochondrial DNA analysis to evaluate coastal population structure, environmental factors influencing population distribution, {{and the potential}} for hybridization among coexisting Watersipora haplogroups along the California coast. Mitochondrial DNA analysis of the COI gene identified three haplogroups: W. subtorquata clade A, W. subtorquata clade B, and W. new species. Analyses resulted in seven haplotypes for haplogroup clade A, and a single haplotype in each haplogroup clade B and new species. Microsatellite data indicated the greatest source of genetic variation in the two species examined (W. subtorquata and W. new species) was within individuals of the population (53. 7 % and 69. 3 %, respectively), compared to among individuals (36. 2 % and 20. 2 %, respectively), populations (5. 5 % and 10. 5 %, respectively), and regions (4. 6 % and 0. 0 %, respectively).

40|$|Multiple {{parasite}} species simultaneously infecting a host {{can interact}} with one another, {{which has the}} potential to influence host-parasite interactions. Invasive species typically lose members of their parasite community during the invasion process. Not only do the founding population escape their parasites, but the rapid range expansion of invaders once in the invaded range can lead to additional stochastic loss of parasites. As such, parasite community dynamics may change along an invasion gradient, with consequences for host invasion success. Here, we use the bank vole, Myodes glareolus, introduced as a small founding population at a point source in the Republic of Ireland in c. 1920 's and its ecto- and endoparasites to ask: i) how does the parasite community vary across an invasion gradient, and ii) are parasite community associations driven by host traits and/or distance from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> host <b>introduction?</b> We sampled the parasite community of M. Â glareolus at the proposed focal site <b>of</b> <b>introduction,</b> at mid-wave and the invasion front, and used a parasite interactivity index and statistical models to determine the potential for the parasite community to interact. Bank voles harboured up to six different parasite taxa, with a significantly higher parasite interactivity index at the foci <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> (zÂ =Â  2. 33, pÂ =Â  0. 02) than elsewhere, suggesting the most established parasite community has greater opportunities to interact. All but one of four synergistic parasite community associations were driven by host traits; sex and body mass. The remaining parasite-parasite associations occurred at the mid-point of the invasion wave, suggesting that specific parasite-parasite interactions are not mediated by distance from a focal <b>point</b> <b>of</b> host <b>introduction.</b> We propose that host traits rather than location along an invasion gradient are more likely to determine parasite-parasite interactions in the invasive bank vole.
