40|$|On organic farms, {{where the}} {{importation}} of materials to build/maintain soil fertility is restricted, {{it is important that}} a balance between inputs and outputs of nutrients is achieved to ensure both short-term productivity and long-term sustainability. This paper considers different approaches to nutrient budgeting on organic farms and evaluates the sources of bias in the measurements and/or estimates of the nutrient inputs and outputs. The paper collates 88 nutrient budgets compiled at the farm scale in 9 temperate countries. All the nitrogen (N) budgets showed an N surplus (average 83. 2 kg N ha- 1 year- 1). The efficiency of N use, defined as outputs/inputs, was highest (0. 9) and lowest (0. 2) in arable and beef systems respectively. The phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) budgets showed both surpluses and deficits (average 3. 6 kg P ha- 1 year- 1, 14. 2 kg K ha- 1 year- 1) with horticultural systems showing large surpluses resulting from <b>purchased</b> <b>manure.</b> The estimation of N fixation and quantities of nutrients in purchased manures may introduce significant errors in nutrient budgets. Overall, the data illustrate the diversity of management systems in place on organic farms, and suggest that used together with soil analysis, nutrient budgets are a useful tool for improving the long-term sustainability of organic systems...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWithin the {{framework}} of the Optenerges project, funded under the Interreg IV program, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 62 cattle farms representative of the main production systems in the Province of Luxembourg in Wallonia, Belgium were assessed. The main goal {{of this study was to}} give reference values for GHG emission intensity in meat production systems based on grass (G) and on grass and maize (G-M). A second goal was to analyze emission variability in order to identify potential mitigation options. On average, for every kg live weight the G systems emitted 18. 2 CO 2 eq [...] and the G-M systems 19. 2 CO 2 eq [...] The difference reflected differences in feed and mineral fertilizer <b>purchases,</b> in <b>manure</b> emissions and in mineral fertilizer application. There were large variations in GHG emissions both between and within the two systems, particularly the latter. This variability was not due to the division of the farms into G and G-M systems, indeed production system types did not allow explaining the variation. When carbon credits were included in the assessment, there was an emission reduction of 31 % and 23 % for the G and G-M systems, respectively, indicating an opportunity for the systems using grassland to increase their advantage...|$|R

All 47 case farms experienced a clinical outbreak of salmonellosis which was confirmed {{with a positive}} bacteriologic culture for serovar Typhimurium {{in one or more}} samples. Serovar Typhimurium phage type 401 and 506 (definitive type 104, DT 104) were the most frequently isolated phage types (13 isolates). On most farms (66 %), clinical signs were seen only among adult cows. The most frequently reported clinical signs were diarrhoea (in 92 % of the farms) and depression (in 79 % of the farms). Control farms were matched on region and had no history of salmonellosis. A questionnaire was used to collect data on case and control farms. The relationship between serovar Typhimurium status of the farm and possible risk factors was tested using conditional logistic regression. Significant factors in the final model were presence of cats on the farm (OR= 0. 06), <b>purchase</b> of <b>manure</b> (OR= 21. 5), feeding colostrum only from own dam (OR= 0. 08), a non-seasonal calving pattern (OR= 25), unrestricted grazing of lactating cows (OR= 0. 07), and a high mean mowing percentage of pasture (OR= 1. 02).

40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} as system approach gains strength if it {{can produce}} its own nitrogen, more than what is now realized. This could be done by increased nitrogen fixation on both cattle farms and arable farms, combined with an increased nitrogen use efficiency. Because {{of these and other}} reasons, arable farmers can decide to reduce or stop the <b>purchase</b> of <b>manure.</b> Instead of this, cut-and-carry fertilizers could be used. Cut-and-carry fertilizers are alfalfa and grassclover, not sold but used on the farm as fertilizer. This text reports on the design of an arable farm based on the use of alfalfa and grassclover as cut-and-carry fertilizer. This causes a shortage in the P-balance, which is compensated by the purchase of local available compost. The design is based on the arable farm of Joost van Strien, Ens, Noordoostpolder. The soil organic matter may not decline, and the yields may not be lower than what is realized now. Based on these starting points, a crop rotation and fertilizer scheme is inserted in the nitrogen and organic matter model NDICEA. After this, an iterative process with the farmer, the farm advisor and the researcher led to a design accepted by the farmer. It turns out to be possible to make a system based on farm-own nitrogen fixation and purchase of local compost with a net zero phosphate balance. The soil organic matter stays constant. Some fertilizer is left for crops which need more nitrogen. The research will be continued in field experiments, testing the viability of the model calculations. ...|$|R
40|$|Manure is an {{unavoidable}} waste product from dairy and other livestock operations. If managed well, {{it can be}} a valuable resource, providing crop nutrients and improving the physical and biological properties of soil.

Comprehensive whole-farm nutrient management planning is necessary to maximize utilization of all on-farm and <b>purchased</b> nutrient inputs (<b>manure,</b> plow-down legumes, fertilizer, etc.) and to balance economic and environmental goals. Part of that process involves prioritizing fields to receive manure and avoiding those with high risk of contributing to water quality degradation.

Two tools available for field assessment of water quality impacts of nutrient application are the Phosphorus Index and the Nitrate Leaching Index.

40|$|Smallholder farmers may gain notable {{livelihood}} {{benefits by}} participating in organic value chains. However, whether there are enough resources available to maintain organic production sustainably on smallholder farms in resource-poor regions is of concern. If not balanced by sufficient inputs, continual nutrient export via commodity crops will result in nutrient mining, and livelihood improvements gained {{by participating in}} profitable value chains could be negated by soil degradation in the long term. The objectives {{of this study were}} to test an integrated approach for understanding the farm-level impacts of subsystem nutrient management actions and to identify locally viable interventions for increased nutrient supply and recycling. We employ a systems analysis methodology to address the nutrient gaps on smallholder farms in Uttarakhand, India producing organic Basmati rice for an international value chain. Farmers here rely on few livestock (three to five head of cattle ha − 1) to supply nutrient inputs and are achieving smaller than potential Basmati yields. We surveyed 42 small farms (< 3. 5 ha, average annual income around $ 1000 year − 1) and analyzed available manure stocks for nutrient contents in order to trace the farm-level flow of manure nutrients, identify vectors of avoidable nutrient loss, and systematically identify locally relevant and feasible improvements. The interventions identified as viable were reducing nutrient losses through simple and relatively cheap manure management modifications (i. e. using straw bedding to capture livestock urine, covering farmyard manure stockpiles with plastic sheeting, enclosed biogas slurry storage, and using biogas slurry for improved compost production), in situ green <b>manuring,</b> and <b>purchasing</b> farmyard <b>manure.</b> Cost–benefit analyses predicted that proposed interventions could increase farmers’ net profit by up to 40 % while also addressing problematic nutrient gaps. While our results pertain specifically to Uttarakhand, we found that our integrated research approach worked well {{to address the problem of}} nutrient gaps on resource-poor smallholder organic farms, and believe that the strategy could be used with equal success to address similar problems in other regions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two grow-out {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the functlOnal role of chicken manure for Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.), production in central Thailand. Experi-ment 1 {{examined the relationship between}} chicken manure input and net fish yield (NFY). Experiment 2 determined the value of chicken manure in providing tilapia particulate organic carbon, and/or dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for stimulating algal productivity. In both experiments supplemental urea and triple superphosphate (TSP) gave all treatments total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs of 28 'Okg/halweek and 7 · 0 kg/halweek, respectively. Addition of chicken manure to inorganic fertilization did not enhance production of Nile tilapia. NFY in experiment 1 increased with decreasing manure loading, which corresponded to increasing TSP input. Regression analysis suggested that chicken manure-P was about 10 % effective as TSP-P at increasing NFY. NFY was linearly correlated to net primary productivity (,- 2 = 0 · 62, P < 0 · 001), which was linearly correlated to total alkalinity (,- 2 = 0 · 77, P < 0 · 001). Treatment differences in alkalinity, community respiration or dissolved oxygen concentrations at dawn were not related to manure input. Simple economic comparisons discourage the <b>purchase</b> of chicken <b>manure</b> as a source of soluble Nand P for increasing algal productivity in Thailand...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} is a production system which relies on ecosystem management and ecological processes {{rather than on}} the external flow of agricultural inputs. The development of the organic sector has incluced a spatial decoupling of livestock and crop production. This has increased the flow of nutrients that occurs between farms compared to what happens within individual farms. Organic systems have replaced synthetic inputs with site-specific management practices to balance input and output nutrients to ensure short-term productivity and long-term sustainability. This paper addresses the nutrient management of mixed and specialized farming systems, with a special emphasis on the reliance on livestock production for the nutrient management of arable farmland. We assessed the nutrient budgets of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) of 28 organic farms selected according to livestock density from three French countries. The farms were classified as stockless, mixed, and cattle farming systems. A soil surface nutrient budget was calculated for each farm based on inputs (N fixation, excreta, and manure) and outputs (grazing, offtake, harvests) on annual crops and grasslands. Inputs due to N atmospheric deposition and seeds and losses due to leaching and volatization were not considered in this study. Nutrient budgets of the 28 farms revealed N, P and K deficits, although disparities between farming systems and their geographical location were also observed. Stockless farms presented high N deficit whereas mixed and livestock farming systems presented lower deficits (close to equilibrium) or even surpluses in a county with a high density of livestock farms. Differences between farming systems in terms of P and K budgets followed the same trend, but regional specificities appreared significant in stockless and livestock systems (related to the size of farms and the stocking rate). None of the farms purchased off-farm organic fertilizers when exchanges of manures and straw were observed at the regional scale. When livestock is present on the farm, the nutrient resources came mainly from recycling internal resources (manures, excreta, and N fixation), whereas stockless farming systems <b>purchased</b> organic <b>manure</b> from neighboring farms (14 to 58 % of total N inputs, 10 to 100 % of total P and K inputs). The sustainability of stockless organic farming systems is questioned, noticeably those that were located in regions where resources of organic matter are scarce.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the practice of}} applying nutrients in organic or slowly soluble inorganic form {{in the belief that}} plants will obtain balanced nutrition through the actions of soil microbes. The organic principle of only fertilising the soil and not directly feeding the crop with watersoluble nutrients has no support in science. The release of organically bound nutrients in soil through biological activity is not necessarily synchronised with crop demands and occurs even at times when there is no crop growth. Changes in the soil biological community do not overcome this limitation. Despite the ideal of organic agriculture being self-sustaining through cycling of nutrients, in principle only on-farm wastes are recycled and most municipal wastes are excluded due to concerns about pollutants and philosophical views on life (biodynamic agriculture). Nutrient supply in European organic agriculture is mainly covered through <b>purchase</b> of straw, <b>manure</b> and fodder from conventional agriculture and by-products from the food industry. Untreated minerals seem to play a minor role. The fertility of agricultural soils can only be maintained over the long-term if plant nutrients removed, are replaced with equivalent amounts and if added sources have a higher solubility than those present in the soil. These conditions are in most cases not fulfilled in organic agriculture. It can thus be concluded that the naturalness of nutrient sources is no guarantee of superior quality and that promotion of organic principles does not improve the supply and recycling of nutrients but excludes other more effective solutions for nutrient use in agricultural systems...|$|R
40|$|The project SOILEFFECTS will {{identify}} potential {{risks and benefits}} for soil fertility when animal manure is anaerobically digested for biogas production. In systems with preferably closed cycles of nutrients and organic matter,such as organic farms, soil fertility cannot be easily maintained by <b>purchased</b> nutrients, and <b>manure</b> quality is crucial. Anaerobic digestion of animal manure for biogas utilization decreases the amount of organic carbon (C) applied to the soil, especially easily degradable C fractions. This may affect soil biology, for instance because earthworms and microorganisms compete about this C {{as a source of}} feed. Less earthworm activity would impact negatively soil structure and fertility. Less C application to the soil may also more directly affect soil physiochemical characteristics, because soil organic matter (humus) is an essential component of cultivated soil, heavily impacting soil structure, quality and fertility. A long-term experiment will be established on Tingvoll research farm organically managed), where a biogas plant is built in 2010 to digest the manure from the herd of 25 dairy cows. Initial characterization of the soil structure,chemistry and biology will be done and the effects of the manure treatment will be studied after the first transition period of 2 - 3 years. Trials will be done on less productive, recently cultivated soil to reveal the effect of the digested versus the non-digested manure as a soil conditioner. Soil respiration, enzyme activities and humus fractionations will be measured.

40|$|Cattle {{manure and}} {{inorganic}} fertiliser use in smallholder peri-urban crop-livestock farms in Uganda was investigated by conducting {{a survey of}} 40 farms in the central districts of Wakiso and Kampala. The {{results showed that the}} major benefits obtained from cattle manure application were increased yields (52. 5 %) and low cost of <b>manure</b> <b>purchase</b> (37. 5 %). The major problems associated with its use included weight and bulkiness (75 %), lack of labour (67. 5 %), insufficient quantities (55 %), high transportation and application costs (37. 5 %), enhanced weed infestation (35 %), poor hygienic conditions (32. 5 %) and lack of storage facilities to maintain quality attributes of manure (32. 5 %). A large number of farmers supplemented the cattle manure with other animal manures, such as poultry (45 %), pig (38 %), goat (33 %) and rabbit (18 %) manures where available. The majority of farmers (95 %) never supplemented manure with inorganic fertiliser claiming that it was expensive in terms of purchase and transportation (90 %) and lack of capital to purchase the fertilisers (67. 5 %). Farmers were aware of the benefits of using cattle manure as a source of fertiliser in their crop-livestock production system. However, the nutrient content of cattle manure was low (0. 42 - 0. 56 % total N), being attributed to poor handling, collection and storage of manure, insufficient fodder and poor livestock diet, which need better management to maximise nutrient recovery. There was little information available to farmers regarding optimum management and rates of fertiliser application (both inorganic and organic) to improve crop yields, which is required to improve food security and economic development in Uganda. Ugandan extension services should therefore make efforts to intensify education among farmers in relation to soil fertility management options. In addition, farmers should collect and store the manure properly and preferably in a covered pit to enhance manure quality. Effective manure handling and storage systems should be designed that reduce loss of nutrients after excretion and during composting. Farmers should explore the viability of community based manure collection initiatives at the farm level where manure transportation costs are shared and hence minimized...|$|R
40|$|Liquid manure tank wagons were {{evaluated}} on a cost basis {{to determine the}} optimum size for a given livestock operation. Also the economics of adding a liquid injector to the tank wagon was studied for profitability. INTRODUCTION The proper selection of a liquid manure tank wagon is a problem faced by many progressive livestock producers with liquid manure systems. Selection of a manure tank wagon is usually based on the farmer 2 ̆ 7 s or dealer 2 ̆ 7 s opinion of what size is right rather than on a logical analysis including an economic {{analysis of the costs}} involved. This paper provides guidelines for selecting the proper size tank wagon for a given situation based on a least cost approach. Additionally, the economics of liquid manure injection is presented. EXPLANATION OF THE PROBLEM In order to select the proper size tank wagon, an economic comparison must be made. This comparison can be based upon the annual costs of using machinery of different sizes. Hunt (1977) gave the following equation for finding the approximate cost of a machine. ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCEDURE To use Hunt 2 ̆ 7 s equation for approximate annual costs for manure tank wagons requires some assumptions. The term cA/SWe represents hours of field use by a machine. Hours of tanker use will depend on the quantity of manure to be spread, on the tank capacity, and on the distance traveled to and from the disposal area. An assumption of 0. 3 -h round trip travel time, which includes loading and unloading time, was made. Travel time multiplied by the number of trips required equals the total hours of annual machine use. The number of trips required is determined by dividing the quantity of liquid manure to be hauled annually by the wagon capacity. Values of other constants in equation [1] can be found in Table 1. The <b>purchase</b> price of <b>manure</b> tank wagons can be expressed as a function of their capacity in liters. The purchase price per liter is not constant but varies according to capacity. Generally, the tanker price per liter decreases as the size increases with the form of the equation being...|$|R
40|$|English Summary Ethiopia {{has been}} facing serious food {{shortages}} as food production growth has not {{kept pace with}} population growth. The rugged topography and steep slopes, removal of vegetation cover and high rainfall erosivity makes agricultural land prone to erosion. Loss of soil organic matter and nutrients due to removal of the vegetation cover through long term practices of overcultivation and overgrazing are primary causes for soil fertility decline that resulted in low agricultural productivity. The Ethiopian highland soils are deficient in nutrients such as total nitrogen, available phosphorus, iron and zinc. Agricultural production demands for replenishment of the soil fertility. The prevailing predictions made on nutrient losses at national level so far are coarse {{to be used as}} information for deciding on precise soil fertility management options at local level. Hence, it is imperative to systematically establish field scale nutrient balance assessment experiments in order to obtain reliable information for planning, implementing and monitoring integrated soil fertility management projects adapted to specific conditions at local level. Thus, the objectives of this research were: · To increase the productivity levels of crops such as wheat through application of N and P fertilizers on specific soil type under rainfed conditions in order to indicate efficient ways to meet the ever-increasing food demand and to achieve household food securityTo understand the significance of N-fixation by legumes in response to applied P and Zn fertilizers on calcareous soils leading to increased yield of subsequent cereal crops such as wheat in the crop rotation systemsTo evaluate the potential of reservoir sediments through studying their fertility characteristics for reclaiming bare land and for subsequent crop production on reclaimed bare landsTo understand and discuss nutrient flow pathways at farm level and main causes of soil nutrient depletion in perspective of the role of household wealth and landscape positions in micro-catchments and recommend strategies for improving nutrient management and crop productivity in the existing farming systems· To understand the causes for and the variability of runoff associated nutrient flows and suggest alternative tools and techniques for management of runoff nutrients for improving in-situ soil fertility and crop performance in the micro-catchments· To understand the variations in release and flow patterns of materials and nutrients in the different landscapes and socio-economic conditions and investigate the implications on maintenance of the nutrient balance in the northern Ethiopian highlands This study shows that a substantial increase in food production can be achieved from using mineral fertilizers in crop lands of declining soil fertility. Increased application rates of mineral fertilizers can build up the nutrient status of the soils thereby improving their responsiveness to inputs and increasing crop productivity in a sustainable way. Furthermore, fertilizer application such as P and Zn to grain legumes grown on less fertile soils improves the grain yield and N 2 fixation by the legumes. Furthermore, reclamation of bare lands using reservoir sediments, subsequent growing of garlic resulted in a three-fold increase in bulb yield (from 2. 0 to 7. 7 t/ha) when bare lands were reclaimed using a 15 -cm layer of reservoir sediment. In order to provide farming communities an opportunity to judiciously manage their soil nutrient resources, monitoring nutrient flows can be a vital tool to understand sustainability of the subsistence farming systems and to precisely identify and quantify the nutrient gains and losses of a given farm. Our study along this line also showed a negative nutrient balance at farm scale for N (54 kg/ha. yr) and K (16 kg/ha. yr). Furthermore, it was found there is diversity of the crop nutrient import-export patterns among various household wealth groups, namely; poor, medium and rich households. We found that specific nutrient movement patterns can be defined for various landscape positions and socio-economic groups and understanding these patterns would enable planning and implementing improved soil fertility management through properly harvesting runoff associated nutrients. Soil fertility depletion in smallholder farms is often related to ownership and access to productive assets and their careful management by the households. The resource rich farmers own large livestock with sufficient draught power, cultivate more land, produce more <b>manure,</b> <b>purchase</b> more fertilizer and generate large production output. The significant variation in resource endowment of households in turn has a major impact on farmers success in agricultural activity and soil fertility management. This calls for household variable packages of soil fertility management at farm scale. Higher nutrient mining rate is primarily due to large removals of nutrients in harvested crops and crop residues. Development of other feed sources such as cut and carry systems from exclosures should receive priority. The holistic approach designed for and employed to achieve the objectives of this research {{can be used as a}} valid methodological approach to undertake research and development projects for areas in a comparable agro-ecological setting as the northern Ethiopian highlands. status: publishe...|$|R
