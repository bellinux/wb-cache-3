40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the installation tool. In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent gasket and retaining ring (retaining ring is also called <b>snap</b> <b>ring),</b> loading the new <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> and gasket into the installation tool and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of <b>snap</b> <b>rings</b> from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate air actuated retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new gasket, the <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> loader is used to load a new <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> into a groove in the gasket installation tool. A new gasket is placed on the installation tool and retained by custom springs. An MSM lifts the installation tool and presses the mounted gasket against the connector block. Once the installation tool is in position, the gasket and <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> are installed onto the connector by pneumatic actuation. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. Extensive testing of tooling operation was performed in the DWPF manipulator repair shop. This testing allowed the operators to gain confidence before the equipment was exposed to radioactive contamination. The testing also led to multiple design improvements. On July 17 and 29, 2008 the Remote Gasket Replacement Tooling was successfully demonstrated in the REDC at the DWPF of The Savannah River Site...|$|R

40|$|The Savannah River Site's (SRS) Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} {{development of}} tooling for remote replacement of gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors. The facility has compressed air supply, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and a lightweight robotic arm for {{operation of the}} remote tools. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) developed and tested multiple tools to perform the gasket replacement tasks. Separate pneumatic snap-ring removal tools that use the connector skirt as a reaction surface were developed for removal of the <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> and spent gasket on both vertical and horizontal Hanford connectors. A pneumatic tool that clamps and centers on the jumper pipe ID was developed to simultaneously install the new gasket and <b>snap</b> <b>ring.</b> A pneumatic snap-ring-loading tool was developed that compresses the <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> and places it in a groove in the installation tool. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed.

The Hanford connector gasket replacement tooling has been successfully tested using MSM's to manipulate the various tools. Nitric acid is used {{in many of the}} decontamination processes performed in the REDC, where the tooling will be deployed. Although most of the tool components were fabricated/purchased with nitric acid and radioactive service in mind, some of the prototype parts must be replaced with parts that are more compatible with nitric acid/radioactive service. Several modifications to the various tools are needed to facilitate maintenance and replacement of failed components. Development of installation tools for replacement of 1 -inch, 2 -inch and multi-hole gaskets is being considered. Deployment of the existing system in the DWPF REDC is expected during FY 08...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{techniques}} for different applications. The word safetying is a term universally used in the aircraft industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, <b>snap</b> <b>rings,</b> oil caps, drain cocks, valves, and parts. The wire itself maintains tension and remains in place by being twisted around itself and attached to the fastener to be secured on one end and an anchor point (which could be another fastener) on the other end. Since safety wire is made of a malleable alloy, it retains its shape after being bent, rather than springing back to its original shape. This property allows it to remain locked around an object, such as when it is passed through a small hole on a fastener, looped back upon itself and then twisted. The same process is then repeated around the anchor point, which could be another fastener. Since it remains twisted instead of unraveling, it acts as a fixed loop and will not back out without considerable force (greater than the stresses which {{it is intended to}} counter) being applied.|$|R
5000|$|The {{foundation}} of the bedroll consisted of a thoroughly waterproofed white canvas tarpaulin made of Number Eight ducking weighing, most often, 18 oz. per square yard (i.e., 9 sq. ft.), and measuring either 6x14ft. or 7x18. (The reprinted 1897 Sears Roebuck Catalog lists [...] "stockmen’s bed sheets" [...] of [...] "heavy white duck," [...] with <b>snap</b> <b>rings</b> or eyelets, as 13-18 oz. for either size, but Fay Ward states that of the various weights of tarp (16-, 18-, 20-, and 22-ounce), the preferable one was [...] "the 18-ounce type… a good water excluder, is not too heavy to manage and will stand a lot of rough handling.") The tarpaulin cover was made {{with a series of}} <b>snaps</b> and <b>rings</b> down either side so it could be folded over and snapped shut. Inside were two to four almost-square heavy quilts called [...] "sougans," [...] folded double, made of heavy wool or cotton batting quilted between patches of pants, coats, and overcoats, or sometimes of patches alone, weighing about 4 lb. each, and generally used as a pad. The sougans in turn enwrapped a blanket or two (woolen ones weighed 4-6 lb. per; Navajo and Mexican Chimayo ones, which were both warm and waterproof, were highly desirable), a lightweight double blanket sheet 35" [...] wide (about 1 lb. for 3.75 yd.), and sometimes, sandwiched between them as a mattress, a thin, feather-filled comfort (probable weight about 5 lb.) known in cowboy vernacular as a [...] "henskin." [...] (The modern cowboy uses a 4"-thick twin-size foam mattress, but this is the only significant change that has taken place in over a century.) The tarpaulin cost roughly $7.70-$11.60, depending on its weight; the sougans, about 28-30c. for two 3x7' rolls of cotton batting (the patches being more or less free); the blankets $1.10-$9.96 each; the sheeting 34-53c., and the henskin, if applicable, 96c.-$2.25, so the entire roll could be assembled for anywhere between $9.42 and $34.60.
