5|$|A watch post {{existed on}} Punta di Santa Maria (now known as Tigné <b>Point</b> <b>after</b> the fort) in 1417. The post was {{probably}} a small unfortified structure, which was manned by three persons. The peninsula {{played a significant role}} during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, when the invading Ottomans built a battery on it in order to bombard Fort Saint Elmo. After the siege, the peninsula became known as Dragut <b>Point</b> <b>after</b> the Ottoman corsair Dragut.|$|E

She was married several times (making many of the {{proposals}} herself) but none of these unions lasted. As well as Shen Defu, her husbands included General Li Hualong, art critic Li Rihua and, in later life, an unnamed (but wealthy) merchant from Suzhou. Although she wanted children, she was never able to have any.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} quantitatively if {{a unique}} rehabilitation program using traditional Thai massage, herbal treatments and physical therapies could improve {{activities of daily}} living, mood and sleep patterns, and pain intensity of stroke patients over time. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study, conducted over a three-month period. Patients were recruited from a 42 -bed rehabilitation centre in Northern Thailand, which admits mainly stroke, head injury and spinal patients for rehabilitation. Results: There were 62 patients enrolled in the study, with 55 % being male. The average age of patients was 59 years and 63 % were married. The average time since the initial stroke was 15 months. At baseline, the average Barthel Index score was 50. 7, and the average emotion, pain and sleep scores were 2. 6, 3. 1, and 3. 2, respectively. After adjusting for age, gender and time since initial stroke in the longitudinal model, the Barthel Index significantly improved by 6. 1 <b>points</b> <b>after</b> one month (P< 0. 01) and by 14. 2 <b>points</b> <b>after</b> three months (P< 0. 01); emotion significantly improved by 0. 7 <b>points</b> <b>after</b> one month (P< 0. 01) and by 0. 9 <b>points</b> <b>after</b> three months (P< 0. 01); pain significantly improved by 0. 5 <b>points</b> <b>after</b> one month (P< 0. 01) and by 0. 5 <b>points</b> <b>after</b> three months (P< 0. 01); sleep significantly improved by 0. 5 <b>points</b> <b>after</b> one month (P< 0. 01) and by 0. 6 <b>points</b> <b>after</b> three months (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: This unique stroke rehabilitation program has produced significant improvements in activities of daily living, mood, pain and sleep patterns of stroke patients. These findings warrant {{the need for further}} research to compare patients undergoing this program of rehabilitation with patients undergoing more conventional rehabilitation programs...|$|R
5|$|At some <b>point</b> <b>after</b> leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier {{was commissioned by}} the firm of Negretti and Zambra to travel to China to photograph the Second Opium War (18581860). It {{may be that the}} firm considered Rossier's Swiss citizenship an asset for such a voyage, that his country's neutrality might help him find passage aboard either British or French ships. Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E
5|$|At some <b>point</b> <b>after</b> the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army chartered Kentuckian for transporting animals to Europe {{in support of the}} American Expeditionary Force. Although there is no information about the specific conversion of Kentuckian, for other ships this typically meant that any passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.|$|E

From July to September 1942, Pennsylvanian sailed between New York and Caribbean ports, calling at Trinidad, Key West, Hampton Roads, Guantánamo Bay, and Cristóbal. In January 1943, Pennsylvanian called at Bandar Abbas, Iran, on the Persian Gulf, and returned to Caribbean sailings again by March 1943.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{deteriorated}} {{during this}} period. The masonry {{of the castle}} had probably been stripped for use as local building materials, as this part of England was traditionally very short of suitable stone. Edward VI gave the castle to Sir John Checke, until it reverted to Mary I. After Mary, the castle was acquired by Sir Gervase Elwes, whose family retained it until the 19th century.
