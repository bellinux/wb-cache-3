50|$|<b>Personal</b> carbon <b>credits</b> {{differ from}} <b>personal</b> carbon trading which imposes a cap or {{allowance}} on individual GHG emissions. <b>Personal</b> carbon <b>credits</b> are a voluntary method {{for individuals to}} directly reduce energy consumption and the resulting GHG emissions. Successful individual reductions are rewarded through lower utility costs {{and the value of}} the created <b>personal</b> carbon <b>credits.</b>|$|R
50|$|No <b>personal</b> <b>credits</b> {{are given}} by the titles for Our Job in Japan. Theodor S. Geisel, better known by his pen name Dr. Seuss, wrote the film, and Elmo Williams edited it. Both men were working {{as part of a}} {{military}} film production unit headed by Frank Capra.|$|R
25|$|Adad-nirari III died prematurely in 783 BC, {{and this}} led to a period of true stagnation. Shalmaneser IV (783-73 BC) seems to have wielded little authority, and a victory over Argishti I, king of Urartu at Til Barsip, is {{accredited}} to a general ('Turtanu') named Shamshi-ilu who does not even bother to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the Arameans and Neo-Hittites, and again, takes <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> at the expense of his king.|$|E

25|$|Rubicon {{was founded}} in Kentucky in 2008 by Nate Morris and Marc Spiegel who were friends from Eastern High School in Louisville. Spiegel’s family {{had been in the}} waste and {{recycling}} hauling trade for more than a century; his knowledge piqued Morris’s interest in starting a company that could disrupt the waste industry. Morris maxed out <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> cards and sold items on eBay to fund initial expenses, like a website and basic legal work. Shortly thereafter, Hank Dudgeon joined as a co-founder.|$|E

50|$|Verification and {{certification}} of all carbon credits {{are necessary to}} insure real GHG reductions are occurring and to insure buyer confidence in using credits to offset GHG emissions. There are many certification standards in existence today for both the compliance and voluntary <b>credit</b> markets. <b>Personal</b> carbon <b>credits</b> are {{a new approach to}} GHG reduction strategies and as such there are no specific protocols existing today within the various certification standards, specifically, because <b>personal</b> carbon <b>credits</b> are so new. However, the proper design of the verification system, {{such as the use of}} utility company billing meters and review of historical consumption patterns, can insure that <b>personal</b> carbon <b>credits</b> comply with all the requirements of The Greenhouse Gas Protocol by the World Resources Institute, including additionality. Greater awareness of <b>personal</b> carbon <b>credits</b> will encourage certification organizations to develop specific protocols in the future.|$|R
25|$|The FICO Small Business Scoring Service (SBSS) {{score is}} used to {{evaluate}} small business credit applicants. This score can evaluate the <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> report of a business owner along with the business credit report of the business itself. Financial information of the business may be evaluated as well. The score range for the FICO SBSS score is 0-300. A higher score indicates less risk. Applications for SBA 7(a) loans for $350,000 or less will be prescreened using this score. A minimum score of 140 is needed to pass this prescreen, though most lenders require scores of 160 or less.|$|E
25|$|Fearing {{the immense}} {{popularity}} {{of the armed forces}} after World War II, Stalin demoted war hero Marshal Georgy Zhukov and took <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> for having saved the country. After Stalin's death in 1953, Zhukov reemerged as a strong supporter of Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev rewarded Zhukov by making him minister of defense and a full Politburo member. Concern that the Soviet army might become too powerful in politics, however, led to Zhukov's abrupt dismissal in the autumn of 1957. Khrushchev later alienated the armed forces by cutting defense expenditures on conventional forces in order to carry out his plans for economic reform.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislature}} was not {{in session}} when Matthews ordered the militia to duty, but they approved of his actions when they gathered later in the year. Because they had not approved the call up, no funds had been appropriated for paying the men, and Matthews borrowed over $40,000 on his <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> {{to pay for the}} operations. The legislature agreed to reimburse him for his expense. In addition to fighting strikers, Matthews continued the policy of the previous governors of suppressing white cap organizations {{in the southern part of}} the state. Matthews had advocated in the campaign the banning of horse racing and prize fighting in the state. He successfully pressed the General Assembly to pass legislation banning the enterprises. He then dispatched the militia and state police to seize the horse tracks and fighting arenas in the state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Personal</b> carbon <b>credits</b> {{were first}} {{introduced}} by My Emissions Exchange in April 2009.

Verifiable reductions in GHG emissions are aggregated into 1 metric ton increments and they become <b>personal</b> Carbon <b>Credits.</b>|$|R
500|$|Before penning [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", Behar {{had written}} a 1986 article in Forbes magazine, [...] "The Prophet and Profits of Scientology", which {{reported}} on the Church of Scientology's business dealings and L. Ron Hubbard's financial success. Behar wrote that during research for [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", he and a Time contributing editor were themselves investigated by ten attorneys and six private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology. According to Behar, investigators contacted his friends and previous coworkers to ask them {{if he had a}} history of tax or drug problems, and obtained a copy of his <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> report that had been obtained illegally from a national credit bureau. Behar conducted 150 interviews {{in the course of his}} research for the article.|$|E
500|$|Various [...] {{explanations}} for Morrell's [...] error have been suggested, including intentional deception. However, Morrell describes his find briefly and prosaically, evidently seeking no <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> or glory from the discovery. In his narrative he assigns the honour {{to his fellow}} sealing captain, Robert Johnson, for finding and naming the land two years earlier. Morrell may have been honestly mistaken, through miscalculation of his ship's position or by misremembering detail when writing the account after nine years. Alternatively, he may have made the common error of confusing distant icebergs with land, or been misled by the distorting effects of Antarctic mirage. [...] In 1843 the distinguished British naval explorer James Clark Ross reported possible land in a position close to Morrell's; this land, too, would eventually be proven not to exist.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} side of the feud, to hold the territory, Gebhard needed the full support of his {{military}} brother and the very able Neuenahr. To push Ernst out, he needed additional support, which he had requested from Delft and from England. It was clearly in the interests of England and the Dutch to offer assistance; if the Dutch could not tie up the Spanish army in Flanders, and if that army needed a navy to supply it, Philip could not focus his attention on the English and the French. His own diplomats had sought to present his case as one of pressing concern to all Protestant princes: in November, 1583, one of his advisers, Dr. Wenceslaus Zuleger, wrote to Francis Walsingham: [...] "I assure you if the Elector of Cologne is not assisted, you will see that the war in the Low Countries will shortly spread over the whole of Germany." [...] The support Gebhard received, in the form of troops from the Earl of Leicester, and from the Dutch, in the form of the mercenary Martin Schenck, had mixed results. Leicester's troops, professional and well-led, performed well but their usefulness was limited: Elizabeth's instructions to help Gebhard had not come with financial support and Leicester had sold his own plate and had exhausted his own <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> while trying to field an army. Martin Schenck had seen considerable service in Spain's Army of Flanders, for the French king and for Parma himself. He was a skilled and charismatic soldier, and his men would do anything for him; reportedly, he could sleep in his saddle, and seemed indomitable in the field. Unfortunately, Schenck was little more than a land-pirate, a free-booter, and rascal, and ultimately he did Gebhard more harm than good, as his behavior in Westphalia and at the Battle of Werl demonstrated.|$|E

2500|$|Business {{credit cards}} offer {{a number of}} {{features}} specific to businesses. They frequently offer special rewards {{in areas such as}} shipping, office supplies, travel, and business technology. Most issuers use the applicant's <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> score when evaluating these applications. In addition, income {{from a variety of sources}} may be used to qualify, which means these cards may be available to businesses that are newly established. In addition, most major issuers of these cards do not report account activity to the owner's <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> unless there is a default. This may have the effect of protecting the owner's <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> from the activity of the business.|$|E

2500|$|For example, Trump took <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> and {{was honored}} for a Trump Foundation grant to the Palm Beach Police Foundation that was {{actually}} from an outside source (see above). He had pledged the money personally, and then the Trump Foundation solicited the $150,000 earmarked for the police foundation from an unrelated philanthropic organization, the Charles Evans Foundation. [...] The Trump Foundation then paid the $150,000 to the Palm Beach charity. The police then honored Trump personally with its annual Palm Tree Award at Trump's Mar-a-Lago hotel at its annual fundraiser.

Similarly, filmmaker Robert Townsend financed part of Hollywood Shuffle using credit cards. Director Kevin Smith funded Clerks in part by maxing out several credit cards. Actor Richard Hatch also financed his production of [...] partly through his credit cards. Famed hedge fund manager Bruce Kovner began his career (and, later on, his firm Caxton Associates) in financial markets by borrowing from his credit card. UK entrepreneur James Caan (as seen on Dragons' Den) financed his first business using several credit cards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack was}} a {{surprise}} to the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade as it was different from previous loyalist attacks. Thomas Mitchell suggested that it was the [...] "most effective attack ever mounted by the loyalists against a republican target". Wright considered Cappagh to have been a successful UVF operation and took <b>personal</b> <b>credit</b> for [...] "wiping them out". He discussed this in the Guardian newspaper:"I genuinely believe that we were very successful, and that may sound morbid but they know that we hammered them into the ground and we didn't lose one volunteer. Indeed, members of the security forces had said that we done what they couldn't do, we put the East Tyrone brigade of the IRA on the run. It was the East Tyrone brigade which was carrying on the war in the North, including in Belfast. East Tyrone were decimated, the UVF wiped them out and that's not an idle boast". When asked about the military importance of specific UVF operations, Wright replied, [...] "I would look back and say that Cappagh was probably our best".|$|E
