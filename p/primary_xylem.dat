40|$|Watermelon plants, at {{all stages}} of growth, are liable to attack by Fusarium niveum which enters through the root tips and {{ruptures}} formed by newly developed lateral roots. Epidermal cells of the zones of elongation and maturation {{at the side of}} the root 2 to 6 mm. back of the zone of meristematic activity were as readily penetrated as meristematic tissues at the tip. After penetrating the epidermis, hyphae continued intracellularly through the cortical cells to the pericycle where the massed mycelium broke down the endodermal cell walls and entered the xylem vessels. Entrance of the pathogene through the ruptures formed by lateral roots was accompanied by the formation of lesions, intracellular penetration of the cortical and parenchymatous tissues, and disorganization of the endodermis by the action of massed hyphae, which then entered the xylem vessels. Infection of seedlings at or shortly after germination of the seed, combined with favorable conditions for the pathogene led to rapid invasion of the xylem vessels with mycelium in the primary root, accompanied by a high percentage of wilting. Older plants, repeatedly infected through young lateral roots, apparently succumbed from a series of internal pathological disturbances involving the accumulation of gum-like materials, tyloses and mycelium in the xylem vessels, particularly those of the primary root where the conductive capacity of the vessels was so reduced in time that wilting ensued. Gum-like materials and tyloses in the xylem of diseased plants seem to be produced by living cells of the host, injured by either toxic, metabolic or enzymatic products of the wilt pathogene. Older resistant plants seemingly withstood attacks of the wilt pathogene, which in seedlings often proved fatal. Apparently no well developed defense mechanism had time to develop and function in the early seedling stage. It was significant that resistant plants, which survived in fields heavily infested with Fusarium niveum had bands of gum-like material surrounding the older xylem near the center of the root axis, while the secondary xylem at the periphery of the stele remained unaffected. On the other hand, wilted susceptible plants were filled with gum-like materials throughout the <b>primary</b> root <b>xylem.</b> Neither resistant nor susceptible plants, grown in soils free of the wilt pathogene, had appreciable quantities of gum-like materials and tyloses in the <b>primary</b> root <b>xylem.</b> Greenhouse indexing of resistant seedlings has proved of value in the Iowa Belle and Pride of Muscatine varieties, but, with the dosage of inoculum employed, Iowa King selections failed to show measurable diffcrences in resistance when compared with susceptible checks. In 4 years, field studies on soils heavily infested with the wilt pathogene, resistant plants seemed more resistant with age, the heaviest mortality being within the first 16 to 24 days, after which few plants wilted; susceptible checks continued to wilt throughout the season. Changes in air and soil temperatures and precipitation retarded or accelerated wilting for periods of 1 to several days; however, irrespective of environmental factors, there was an upward trend in the percentage average daily wilt, which reached a maximum at 23 to 39 days after planting susceptible seedlings and at 16 to 24 days with resistant seedlings. Pride of Muscatine, Iowa King and Iowa Belle have proved to be suitable stock for the transmission of resistance. the last named variety being especially desirable as a resistant parent.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{functions}} of wood is hydraulic conductivity, and the general physical properties controlling this are well characterized in living plants. Modern species capture {{only a fraction of}} the known diversity of wood, which is well preserved in a fossil record that extends back over 400 million years to the origin of the vascular plants. Early fossil woods are known to differ in many key respects from woods of modern gymnosperms (e. g., tracheid size, secondary wall thickenings, lignin chemistry, cambium development) and recent discoveries are shedding new light on the earliest stages of wood evolution, raising questions about the performance of these systems and their functions.

The hydraulic properties of fossil woods cannot be measured directly, but with the development of mathematical models it is becoming increasingly feasible to make inferences and quantify performance, enabling comparison with modern woods. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of hydraulic conductance to quantify is the resistance of pits and other highly distinctive and unique secondary wall features in the earliest tracheids.

R. songziensis {{consists}} of branched axes, up to 20 cm long, which have slightly swollen nodes and internodes with ribs and narrow branches produced from the nodes. The axes are protostelic. Cross sections show a roughly triangular or quadrangular organization of the <b>primary</b> <b>xylem</b> and radial arrangement of the secondary xylem. <b>Primary</b> <b>xylem</b> is exarch upon maturation, with protoxylem strands positioned around the tips of the <b>primary</b> <b>xylem</b> arms. No differentiation between fascicular and interfascicular regions of the secondary xylem is apparent, and ray cells are rarely observed. Protoxylem tracheids have helical wall thickenings, whereas the tracheids of meta- and secondary xylem possess scalariform and/or bordered pits. All R. songziensis axes bear trichomes or spines, some up to 2.8 mm long. At the nodes are whorls of six leaves, up to 2.4 cm long, that regularly or irregularly fork two to four times. The leaves are positioned perpendicular to the axis in proximal portions of the plant but insered at acute angles in distal portions. Fertile branches are produced in a terminal strobilus (8.5 cm long), which is subtended by whorls of normally developed leaves. It consists of a central axis and up to 16 whorls of fertile units, each of which consists of a bract and 6-10 sporangia. The bracts are elongate-cuneate and have prominent marginal fringes; sporangia are attached to the abaxial surface at the base of each brac.

In many of those, the endodermis is later discarded, together with the cortex, when the periderm develops from the pericycle. If the pericycle is superficial and the cortex is retained, either the endodermis is stretched or crushed or it keeps pace with {{the expansion of the}} vascular cylinder by radial [...] divisions, and the new walls develop Casparian strips in continuity with the old ones.|$|E
50|$|As a young {{vascular}} plant grows, {{one or more}} strands of <b>primary</b> <b>xylem</b> form in its stems and roots. The first xylem to develop is called 'protoxylem'. In appearance protoxylem is usually distinguished by narrower vessels formed of smaller cells. Some of these cells have walls which contain thickenings {{in the form of}} rings or helices. Functionally, protoxylem can extend: the cells are able to grow in size and develop while a stem or root is elongating. Later, 'metaxylem' develops in the strands of xylem. Metaxylem vessels and cells are usually larger; the cells have thickenings which are typically either in the form of ladderlike transverse bars (scalariform) or continuous sheets except for holes or pits (pitted). Functionally, metaxylem completes its development after elongation ceases when the cells no longer need to grow in size.|$|E
50|$|In young stems, which lack what is {{commonly}} called bark, the tissues are, {{from the outside}} to the inside: epidermis, periderm, cortex, primary phloem, secondary phloem, vascular cambium, secondary xylem, and <b>primary</b> <b>xylem.</b> As the stem ages and grows, changes occur that transform {{the surface of the}} stem into the bark. The epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body, including the stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, that protects the plant from the outside world. In old stems the epidermal layer, cortex, and primary phloem become separated from the inner tissues by thicker formations of cork. Due to the thickening cork layer these cells die because they do not receive water and nutrients. This dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems.|$|E

Although the most salient morphological evidence still largely supports the anthophyte hypothesis, there are some more obscure morphological commonalities between the gnetophytes and conifers that {{lend support to the}} gnetifer hypothesis.

5000|$|Sphenophyllales are small, slender {{branching}} plants, usually {{growing to}} {{a height of}} less than 1 m tall. The long stems range from 0.5 cm to 1.2 cm in diameter.

The stem anatomy is protostelic (root-like), containing a solid <b>primary</b> <b>xylem</b> core with secondary xylem tissue present in some species. The leaves, which can be several centimeters long, are borne on each node in whorls (called verticels) and are wedge-shaped, fan-shaped, linear, or forked.

Very rapid internode elongation results in the formation of a pith cavity and a ring of carinal canals formed by disruption of the <b>primary</b> <b>xylem.</b> Similar spaces, the vallecular canals are formed in the cortex. Due to the softer nature of the phloem, these are very rarely seen in fossil instances. In the Calamitaceae, secondary xylem (but not secondary phloem) was secreted as the cambium grew outwards, producing a woody stem, and allowing the plants to grow as high as 10m.

Fertile stems had terminal 'strobili', structures very superficially resembling an ear of wheat, which consisted of four vertical rows of fan-shaped leaf-like organs (sporophylls), each with a stalked sporangium on the side facing the stem (adaxial).

The redefinition of Bostonia proposed here, a protostelic calamopityacean with medullosan-like vascular segments, reinforces long-standing views of a calamopityacean origin of Medullosales. Cladistic interpretation of stelar form and petiole anatomy in members of these groups, however, reveals character incompatibility hinging upon whether Quaestora (a protostelic medullosan) or Bostonia (a calamopityacean with medullosan-like dissected vascular system) should be preferred {{as a candidate for}} medullosan ancestor...|$|E

Our results suggest that (a) channeling of leaf-derived IAA first delineates isolated strands of pre-procambial tissue but then later shifts to include basipetal transport through the rapidly expanding xylem elements, and (b) the transition from primary to secondary vascular development is gradual, with an auxin response preceding the appearance of a unified and radially-organized vascular cambium...|$|E
