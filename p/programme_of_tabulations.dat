40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} modular design of tabular parsing {{algorithms}} for treeadjoining languages. The modularity {{is made possible}} by a separation of the parsing strategy from the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>tabulation.</b> The parsing strategy is expressed in terms of the construction of a nondeterministic automaton from a grammar; three distinct types of automaton will be discussed. The mechanism <b>of</b> <b>tabulation</b> leads to the simulation of these nondeterministic automata in polynomial time, independent of the parsing strategy. The proposed application of this work is the design of efficient parsing algorithms for tree-adjoining grammars and related formalisms...|$|R

In many ways, the {{compilations}} of {{the first}} knot tables {{marked the beginning of}} the modern study of knots, and it is perhaps not surprising that as knot theory and topology grew, so did the knot tables.
