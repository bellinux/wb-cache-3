5000|$|A chirp is {{a signal}} {{in which the}} {{frequency}} increases (up-chirp) or decreases (down-chirp) with time. In some sources, the term chirp is used interchangeably with sweep signal. [...] It is commonly used in sonar and radar, but has other applications, such as in spread-spectrum communications. In spread-spectrum usage, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices such as reflective array compressors (RACs) are often used to generate and demodulate the chirped signals. In optics, ultrashort laser pulses also exhibit chirp, which, in optical transmission systems, interacts with the dispersion properties of the materials, increasing or decreasing total <b>pulse</b> <b>dispersion</b> as the signal propagates. The name is {{a reference to the}} chirping sound made by birds; see bird vocalization.|$|E

40|$|For {{realising}} {{fast and}} highly dynamical laser-based material processing, scanner systems are already utilised for many different industrial applications. Furthermore, ultra-short pulsed (< 1 ps) laser sources provide possibilities of processing most different materials with highest accuracy. Owing {{to the large}} spectral bandwidth of ultra-short laser <b>pulses,</b> <b>dispersion</b> in optical components becomes relevant. The dispersion in optical systems for laser scanners may lead to scan angle-depending pulse properties as, for example, pulse front tilt. The investigation of these effects is not {{state of the art}} today but absolutely necessary to exploit the full potential of laser scanners for ultra-short pulse applications. By means of an exemplary focusing lens, the simulation and experimental analysis of scan angle-depending pulse front tilt is presented for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Pulsar <b>pulse</b> <b>dispersions</b> and low-frequency {{absorption}} of galactic and extragalactic radio sources {{strongly suggest that}} the interstellar medium is much more ionized than previously assumed. The search was confined to directions near pulsars because of the additional {{information provided by the}} dispersion measure which gives the total number of electrons along the line of sight to the pulsar. Of the four directions in which observations were made, an emission line appears to be present in at least two and possibly three directions. The data are shown from a low galactic latitude direction near the Crab Nebula pulsar. The observing direction was about 9 arcmin off the Crab with the field of view of about 1. 5 arcmin.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{study has been}} made of propagation in multimode optical fibre. The fibre used in the experiments mainly consists of a capillary of ME 1 glass filled with hexachlorobuta- 1, 3 -diene. The main topics considered in this thesis are single-mode propagation and mode conversion effects due to bending, undulation and stress or strain. A measured <b>pulse</b> <b>dispersion</b> of less than 0. 4 ns/km has been achieved. A contributing factor is the high-loss cladding which results in a preferential mode filtering of higher-order modes so that the <b>pulse</b> <b>dispersion</b> for a beam of high launching angular width is reduced for a relatively small increase in attenuation. <b>Pulse</b> <b>dispersion</b> and mode conversion are not strong functions of bending and undulation of the fibre, but strongly depend on stress or strain. The graded-index fibre has also been considered and its <b>pulse</b> <b>dispersion</b> is predicted to be half that of the <b>pulse</b> <b>dispersion</b> of the liquid-core fibre...|$|E

40|$|In {{a uniform}} fiber Bragg grating, if the input signal is a Gaussian <b>pulse</b> the <b>dispersion</b> is zero near center {{wavelength}} and becomes appreciable only near the band edges and side lobes of the reflection spectrum. However for chirped Gaussian <b>pulses,</b> group velocity <b>dispersion</b> and the reflected light must become asymmetric.

40|$|Abstract. Chromatic {{dispersion}} and nonlinearity effect are the {{two important}} factors affecting the optical pulse which propagates in the optical fiber.

Therefore, the linear and nonlinear dispersive propagation and control of optical pulses in the fiber {{has always been an}} important research topic of concern. In this paper, Starting from the nonlinear Schrodinger equation of the optical pulse and neglecting the chromatic dispersion, under the situation of chirp and chirp-free Gaussian pulse, we analytical analyzed, calculated and simulated the frequency chirp, pulse broadening factor and waveform of the Gaussian optical <b>pulses</b> in <b>dispersion</b> fiber.

40|$|Local {{oscillator}} (LO) leakage in a carrier-based ultrawideband (UWB) {{system is}} a major design concern. In many cases, mixer LO-RF isolation is not sufficient and the LO leakage is well above the useful UWB signal. However, this leakage can be substantially reduced by using a notch filter located before the UWB transmitting antenna {{as long as it}} will not lead to unacceptable signal distortion. Therefore, various filter parameters, such as the filter order and 3 dB rejection bandwidth, have been studied to see their effects on providing sufficient band rejection level to reduce the unwanted LO leakage while minimizing the transmitted <b>pulse</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Time domain simulations and measurements have been utilized to evaluate the <b>pulse</b> <b>dispersion</b> using both the relative signal's first pulse amplitude and the pulse time delay spread. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Pulses from these interactions are dispersed, and therefore reduced in amplitude, during propagation through the Earth’s ionosphere. <b>Pulse</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{must therefore be}} corrected to maximise the received {{signal to noise ratio}} and subsequent chances of detection. The <b>pulse</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristic may also provide a powerful signature to determine the lunar origin of a pulse and discriminate against pulses of terrestrial radio frequency interference (RFI).

Surface properties, defect structure energy, elastic characteristics {{and a number of other}} features, which are critical for the simulation of the electric <b>pulse</b> metal wire <b>dispersion,</b> can be described by these interatomic potentials with high accuracy. The nanowires simulated had a cylindrical shape. Along the cylinder axis use was made of periodic boundary conditions, while in the other directions, a free surface was simulated. Heating of the nanowires was performed by scaling of the atomic velocities following a linear law while maintaining a Maxwell distribution. In the course of high-rate heating the specimen experienced fracture followed by the formation of clusters. Influence of interfaces, heat rate, temperature distribution along sample profile on structure of generated nanoparticles was investigated. The atoms were assumed to belong to one cluster, given that the spacing between the nearest atoms was less than the threshold distance.

40|$|We {{consider}} a long fiber-optical link consisting of alternating dispersive and nonlinear segments, i. e., a split-step model (SSM), {{in which the}} dispersion and nonlinearity are completely separated. Passage of a soliton (localized pulse) through one cell of the link is described by an analytically derived map. Multiple numerical iterations of the map reveal that, at values of the system’s stepsize (cell’s size) L comparable to the <b>pulse’s</b> <b>dispersion</b> length zD, SSM supports stable propagation of pulses which almost exactly coincide with fundamental solitons of the corresponding averaged NLS equation. However, {{in contrast with the}} NLS equation, the SSM soliton is a strong attractor, i. e., a perturbed soliton rapidly relaxes to it, emitting some radiation. A pulse whose initial amplitude is too large splits into two solitons; however, splitting can be suppressed by appropriately chirping the initial pulse. On the other hand, if the initial amplitude is too small, the pulse turns into a breather, and, below a certain threshold, it quickly decays into radiation. If L is essentially larger than zD, the input soliton rapidly rearranges itself into another soliton, with nearly the same area but essentially smaller energy. At L still larger, the pulse becomes unstable, with a complex system of stability windows found inside the unstable region. Moving solitons are generated by lending them a frequency shift, which makes it possible to consider collisions between solitons. Except for a case when the phase difference between colliding solitons is < ∼ 0. 05 ·π, the interaction between them is repulsive. ...|$|R
