It is a group of synthetic chemicals that person exposed every day. <b>Parabens</b> are ubiquitously present in waste water, river, soil and house dust. It has also been detected in human tissue and body fluids. It also acts as endocrine disrupter at high exposure levels. Studies in young male rats exposed during development have shown adverse effects on sperm production and testosterone levels following exposure to <b>parabens</b> with longer side chains i. e. butyl,-isobutyl and propylparabens. After dermal uptake, <b>parabens</b> are hydrolyzed, conjugated with protein and excreted in urine. Despite high total dermal uptake of <b>parabens</b> and its metabolites, little intact <b>parabens</b> can be recovered in blood and urine. Overall the estrogenic <b>parabens</b> and their metabolites in blood may exceed the action of endogenous estradiol. The interaction between <b>parabens</b> and mitochondrial function in the testis may be key in explaining the contribution of <b>parabens</b> for a decrease in reproductive potential.

40|$|A {{framework}} for understanding the complexity of cancer development was established by Hanahan and Weinberg in their definition {{of the hallmarks of}} cancer. In this review, we consider the evidence that <b>parabens</b> can enable development in human breast epithelial cells of 4 / 6 of the basic hallmarks, 1 / 2 of the emerging hallmarks and 1 / 2 of the enabling characteristics. Hallmark 1 : <b>parabens</b> have been measured as present in 99 % of human breast tissue samples, possess oestrogenic activity and can stimulate sustained proliferation of human breast cancer cells at concentrations measurable in the breast. Hallmark 2 : <b>parabens</b> can inhibit the suppression of breast cancer cell growth by hydroxytamoxifen, and through binding to the oestrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR) may prevent its deactivation by growth inhibitors. Hallmark 3 : in the 10 nM to 1 M range, <b>parabens</b> give a dose-dependent evasion of apoptosis in high-risk donor breast epithelial cells. Hallmark 4 : long-term exposure (> 20 weeks) to <b>parabens</b> leads to increased migratory and invasive activity in human breast cancer cells, properties which are linked to the metastatic process. Emerging hallmark: methylparaben has been shown in human breast epithelial cells to increase mTOR, a key regulator of energy metabolism. Enabling characteristic: <b>parabens</b> can cause DNA damage at high concentrations in the short term but more work is needed to investigate long-term low-doses of mixtures. The ability of <b>parabens</b> to enable multiple cancer hallmarks in human breast epithelial cells provides grounds for regulatory review of the implications of the presence of <b>parabens</b> in human breast tissue...|$|R

40|$|<b>Parabens</b> {{are widely}} used {{preservatives}} in basic necessities such as cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. In previous studies, xenoestrogenic actions of <b>parabens</b> were reported in an immature rat model and a rat pituitary cell line (GH 3 cells). The relationship between <b>parabens</b> and ovarian failure has not been described. In the present study, the influence of <b>parabens</b> on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis was investigated. A disruptor of ovarian small pre-antral follicles, 4 -vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD, 40 mg/kg), was used to induce premature ovarian failure (POF). Methylparaben (MP, 100 mg/kg), propylparaben (PP, 100 mg/kg), and butylparaben (BP, 100 mg/kg) dissolved in corn oil were treated in female 8 -week-old Sprague-Dawley rat for 5 weeks. Estrus cycle status was checked daily by vaginal smear test. Ovarian follicle development and steroid synthesis were investigated through real-time PCR and histological analyses. Diestrus phases in the VCD, PP, and BP groups were longer than that in the vehicle group. VCD significantly decreased mRNA level of folliculogenesis-related genes (Foxl 2, Kitl and Amh). All <b>parabens</b> significantly increased the Amh mRNA level but unchanged Foxl 2 and Kitlg acting in primordial follicles. VCD and MP slightly increased Star and Cyp 11 a 1 levels, which are related to an initial step in steroidogenesis. VCD and <b>parabens</b> induced an increase in FSH levels in serum and significantly decreased {{the total number of}} follicles. Increased FSH implies impairment in ovarian function due to VCD or <b>parabens.</b> These results suggest that VCD may suppress both formation and development of follicles. In particular, combined administration of VCD and <b>parabens</b> accelerated inhibition of the follicle-developmental process through elevated AMH level in small antral follicles...|$|R

It is noteworthy that octylparaben with longer chain was firstly detected in this work. Mass balance results showed that 91. 8 % of the initial <b>parabens</b> mass loading was lost mainly due to degradation, while the contribution of sorption and output of primary and excess sludge was much less (7. 5 %), indicating that biodegradation {{played a significant role}} in the removal of <b>parabens</b> during the conventional treatment process. Specifically, <b>parabens</b> were mainly degraded in the anaerobic tank, and PHBA could be effectively removed at high rates after the advanced treatment. However, both biodegradation and adsorption accounted for minor contribution to the removal of chlorinated <b>parabens</b> during conventional treatment process, and they were only scantly removed by conventional treatment (33. 9 - 40. 7 %) and partially removed by advanced treatment (59. 2 - 82. 8 %).
