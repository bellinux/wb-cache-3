40|$|Background. Indirect revascularization is a {{therapeutic}} approach {{in case of}} severe angina not suitable for percutaneous or surgical revascularization.

Benefits of the procedure are related mainly to the angiogenesis caused by inflammation and secondly to the destruction of the nervous fibers of the heart. <b>Patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>method.</b> From September 1996 up to July 1997, 14 patients (9 males – 66. 7...|$|R

40|$|The Prader-Willi {{syndrome}} (PWS) is {{the most}} common congenital disorder leading to obesity. It presents in in-fancy with hypotonia and a failure to feed, and in later childhood may be diagnosed from the combination of mental retardation, hyperphagia, hypogonadism and char-acteristic dysmorphic features [1]. Hypersomnolence is a common but unexplained feature [2]. Ventilatory failure with cor pulmonale has been reported to be a common cause of death [3], but there are no published data on the successful treatment of ventilatory failure in adult pati-ents. In this paper, we describe our experience of treating adults with the PWS using noninvasive ventilatory assist-ance. <b>Patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>method...</b>|$|R

40|$|Backgrounds. Chronic eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} (CEP) {{is a rare}} disorder {{characterized by}} eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates and progressive respiratory failure. <b>Patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>method.</b> A 78 -years old male with heart failure presented with progressive dyspnea, persistent cough and respiratory failure. Chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. His physical deterioration progressed after cardiac recompensation. Pulmonary infiltrates resolved and presenting symptoms disappeared during steroid treatment. Despite of atypical radiographic presentation laboratory changes and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. Conclusions. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare disease, {{but it should be}} considered even in older patients with heart failure, when peripheral blood eosinophilia and pulmonary infiltrates hardly explainable only with left-sided heart failure are present. </em...|$|R
