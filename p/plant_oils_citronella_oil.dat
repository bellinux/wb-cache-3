40|$|The {{terpenes}} {{constitute an}} important group amongst the naturally occurring organic compounds. They vary greatly {{in nature and}} character and {{a very large number}} of them are still of unknown constitution. An interesting number of these compounds have been termed terpene aliphatic alcohols. They are comparatively small in number and although non-cyclic in nature, they are closely related to cyclic compounds and prone to cyclize under certain conditions. [ [...] . ] Their general structure and chemical properties have been fairly thoroughly investigated but the question of their isomeric structures has not yet been definitely settled. A brief historical review of the chemistry of the primary aliphatic terpene alcohols, namely, geraniol and citronellol, will be given. The attention attached to these compounds is largely due to their importance in the perfumery trade. Geraniol is a colourless liquid of sweet odour, recalling that of rose and pelargonium. It is found in the free state and also in the form of its esters in a large number of essential oils. Most of the work done on its occurrence was carried out in the last decade of the nineteenth century. It was found to be a constituent of palmarosa, Bulgarian and Turkish rose <b>oils,</b> geranium <b>oils,</b> <b>citronella</b> <b>oils,</b> lemongrass oil, linaloe oil, nutmeg oil, sassafras oil, petigrain oil, lavender oil and in smaller quantities in a large number of other oils.

Therefore DEET substitute must be searched such as essential oils, for example eucalyptus, clove, and <b>citronella</b> <b>oils,</b> which are safer. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare which oil from these ones is the most effective, to know whether these oils can be listed in standard repellent against Culex as a DEET substitute, and also to know the time interval of application needed. The laboratory study was carried out based on method described by  Fradin and Day’s method. Repeated tests were conducted simultaneously in five cages using repellent treated forearms of volunteers. The time needed in minutes since repellent application until first mosquito bite was recorded. The data was analyzed using one way ANOVA and continued with Duncan analysis using α= 0. 01. Highly significant statistical analysis proved that against Culex, duration of repellent effect of eucalyptus oil was shorter than clove oil/ <b>citronella</b> <b>oil,</b> and duration of repellent effect of clove oil/ <b>citronella</b> <b>oil</b> was shorter than DEET.

Therefore {{it is important to}} replace synthetic fungicides by environmentally friendly natural fungicides (extracted from plants). In this work cinnamon leaf <b>oil,</b> <b>citronella</b> <b>oil</b> and neem seed oil were used as natural fungicides. 8 fungal types grown on dried paint films were used to investigate the anti-fungal activity of the above oils. Quantitative analysis of cinnamon leaf <b>oil</b> and <b>citronella</b> <b>oil</b> were done using gas chromatography and quantitative analysis of neem seed oil was not done due to unavailability of standards. Modified method of agar over-lay technique was used to determine minimum inhibition concentration of the fungal types used, after introducing three oils. The results indicated cinnamon leaf oil is the best to use as fungicide for exterior emulsion paint out of three oils, as growth of all used fungal types were inhibited below at concentration of 2000 ppm, when introducing cinnamon leaf oil into each fungal type individually. It was more than 12000 ppm in <b>citronella</b> <b>oil</b> and more than 20000 ppm in neem seed oil. Modified method of ASTM D 2373 - 74 was used to determine the minimum inhibition concentration of cinnamon leaf oil to inhibit fungal growth on exterior emulsion paint film. Aging tests were done to determine effect of cinnamon leaf oil on viscosity, pH, colour of exterior emulsion paint and adherence of binder to the substrate after aging for three years. Tropical chamber test was used as an accelerated test method to investigate fungal degradation after applying cinnamon leaf oil as fungicide. According to the results, fungal growth in exterior emulsion paint could be inhibited below 3500 ppm of cinnamon leaf oil and applied paint film on a surface of an exterior substrate will not attack by fungi" for 2 - 3 years. Significant changes in viscosity, pH, colour of the exterior emulsion paint and adherence of binder to the. substrate were not detected due to cinnamon leaf oil.
