50|$|Examples of {{available}} hands-free computing devices include mouth-operated joystick types {{such as the}} TetraMouse, the QuadJoy, the Jouse2, the QuadStick, and the IntegraMouse, camera based head tracking systems such as SmartNav, Tracker Pro, FreeTrack, HeadMouse Extreme, HeadMaster and KinesicMouse, and speech recognition specialized for disabilities such as Voice Finger. The joystick types require no physical connections to the user and enhances the user's feeling of independence. Camera types require targets mounted on the user, usually {{with the help of}} a caregiver, that are sensed by the camera and associated software. Camera types are sensitive to ambient lighting and the mouse <b>pointer</b> may <b>drift</b> and inaccuracies result from head movements not intended to be mouse movements. Other examples of hands-free mice are units that are operated using switches that may be operated by the feet (or other parts of the body), such as the NoHands Mouse and the switch-adapted TetraMouse. Speech recognition specialized for disabilities and hands-free computing focus more on low-level control of the keyboard and mouse than on usual areas like dictation.|$|R
