The international backdrop to this legislation is the Convention on Biological Diversity, which came into force in 1993.

A patent is monopoly right granted to a person who has invented a new and useful or an improvement of an existing article or a new process of making an article. After the expiry of the duration of patent, anybody can make use of the invention. A patent is a form of industrial property or as it is now called intellectual property.

A patent is not granted for an idea or principal as such, but for some article or the process of making some article applying the idea. The object of granting a patent is to encourage and develop new technology and industry. An inventor may disclose the new invention only if he is rewarded; otherwise he may work it secretly. In consideration of the grant of monopoly for a limited period, the inventor discloses the details of the new invention and the method working it so that after the expiry of monopoly period others can use the invention or improve upon it...|$|R
