5|$|The {{advent of}} iron {{ships in the}} late 19thcentury and the {{development}} of <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> on the River Tees led to the decline of smaller Yorkshire harbours.

5|$|Although {{identified}} {{early as}} a vital strategic outpost, Port Moresby, the most significant Papuan town, had just two airfields and basic <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> in early 1942. An enormous amount of work was required to transform it into a major base for both air and land operations against the Japanese. This {{was done in the}} face of frequent Japanese air raids. During the course of the Kokoda Track campaign, the two original airfields were improved, and five new airfields were developed. To make them operational, the engineers had to construct more than just runways; taxiways, hardstands, facilities and access roads all had to be built. The operation of the base depended on shipping, but the <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> were limited. To increase the capacity of the port, a causeway was built to Tatana Island, where pontoon docks were emplaced. Engineers also built roads, warehouses, and a water treatment plant. They ran the town's electricity and water supply, and quarried stone for the roads and airstrips.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} benefit of Operation Dragoon {{was the use}} of the <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> in Southern France, especially the large ports at Marseille and Toulon. After Operation Cobra and Operation Dragoon, the Allied advance slowed almost to a halt in September due to a critical lack of supplies. The ports were quickly brought back into service, together with the railroad system in Southern France. Thereafter, large quantities of supplies could be moved north to ease the supply situation. In October, 524,894 tons of supplies were unloaded, which was more than one third of the Allied cargo shipped to the Western front.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler ordered the {{construction}} of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but due to shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, most of the strongpoints were never built. As the expected site of an Allied invasion, Pas de Calais was heavily defended.
