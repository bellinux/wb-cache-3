The top coating can be changed by development and {{has at least one}} hydrophile and at least one hydrophobe and oliophile component. They are distributed ahead of the latent picture production and the development of the surface so that the surface of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is hydrophile for positive <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> and hydrophobe or oliophile for negative <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> A latent, electrostatic picture can be produced in the top coating.

50|$|The TMA-1 and TMA-1A are circular, plastic cased Yugoslavian minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mine. The mine {{consists of}} an upper plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> and the lower body containing the main charge. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has eight triangular raised sectors, and a central fuze cap. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is {{held in place by}} four plastic pins, which when suffient pressure is applied, shear allowing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> to collapse onto the mine body, triggering the UANU-1 fuze. A secondary fuze well is provided in the base of the mine, allowing the use of anti-handling devices. The mine is found in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.|$|R
50|$|The T-AB-1 is a {{rectangular}} plastic cased Brazilian anti-tank blast mine. The mine uses a T-AB-1 anti-personnel mine as a fuze. The AP mine is {{inserted into the}} body of the AT mine under a large stiff ABS plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is fastened in place by a number of shear pins, which are designed to give way under a pressure of 200 kg. The AP mine under the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is then triggered, triggering the mine's main charge.|$|R
5000|$|The Type I mine had a {{cylindrical}} {{case with}} a domed upper <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> that is held above the main case of the mine by the spring-loaded central fuze well. A strip of canvas around the circumference seals {{the gap between the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and {{the main body of the}} mine. The Type II uses a smaller <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> that does not cover the entire top surface of the mine, giving the center of the mine a raised appearance. In every other detail, the mines are identical.|$|R
50|$|Spring type - When no {{electricity}} {{is applied to}} the brake, a spring pushes against a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> squeezing the friction disk between the inner <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and the outer cover plate.

The dynamic model of the vehicle when it started and the CFD model of <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> have been established. A new method which can be used to calculate the heat flux and the heat transfer coefficient has been proposed when after anglicizing the model. A simulation analysis of thermal stress coupling of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has been made in order to calculate temperature distribution and the stress level of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> A new improved solution has been proposed. The result shows that although the plate quality is almost same after the improvement, the temperature peak is reducing about 1 o C, the maximum stress decreased 38. 6 %, and the axial stiffness improved significantly...|$|R
50|$|An Elsie mine {{has a small}} raised <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> on the {{top surface}} of the mine which {{is covered with a}} small pad of flock material. The {{flocking}} material is designed to act as camouflage. Sustained downward pressure on the small <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (by the victim's foot) cocks a spring-loaded striker. When the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has been pressed down approximately 2.5 cm, a single retaining ball bearing flips side-ways into a recess. When the ball bearing flips side-ways, it frees the striker (held under tension by a coiled spring beneath it) which snaps upwards into the stab detonator, thereby detonating the explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|The NV-41 was a wooden-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine consists of a square wooden box with a filling plug on the bottom. The top of the box is covered by a thin pressure lid, which covers a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> held up by a spring. Sufficient pressure on the lid collapses it down onto the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> Downward movement of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> moves down a pressure plunger, which in turn levers up the striker retaining lever, releasing the spring-loaded striker and allowing it to impact the stab sensitive detonator, triggering the main charge.|$|R

The P2 Mk2 has {{a square}} {{case with a}} central circular ribbed <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> the P3 is circular with a central circular <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> Both mines use anti-personnel mines as the fuse, typically the either the P4 Mk1 or P2 Mk2 anti-personnel mines. The anti-personnel mine sits in a cavity below the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> when enough <b>pressure</b> is place on the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> of the mine, it collapses onto the anti-personnel mine triggering it and the main charge which sits below it. A yellow canvas carrying strap is normally fitted {{to the side of}} the mine. The mines have a secondary fuse well on the bottom which can be used with anti-handling devices. A GLM-2 electronic booby trap can be fitted to the cavity under the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The mine is supplied with a steel disc which makes the mine more easily detectable, although this is seldom used. Since 1997 only a detectable version of the mine has been produced, and to comply with the Convention on Conventional Weapons amended protocol II, Pakistani stocks of the mine are being retrofitted with steel detection discs. The mines are found in Afghanistan, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, and Tajikistan.|$|R

50|$|The M6, M6A1 and M6A2 are {{a series}} of metal-cased, {{circular}} anti-tank landmines produced by the United States; they were superseded in service by the larger M15 mine. The mine is normally painted olive green and has a large central <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> In the centre of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is an arming plug that has an arming lever with three settings: ARMED, DANGER and SAFE. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> rests on a concertina-like structure, which when enough force is applied is compressed. Compression results in a transfer plate under the arming plug pressing downwards onto a belleville spring which inverts, flipping the firing pin into the detonator, which triggers the adjacent explosive booster and main explosive charge.|$|R
5000|$|The MATS/2.6 is a scatterable Italian circular, plastic-cased minimum metal blast {{resistant}} anti-tank blast mine. It {{is very similar}} to the MATS/2, except that it uses a smooth <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> rather than a griddle <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> It uses a pneumatic fuse which is resistant to shock and blast similar to the fuze fitted to the TS-50. The mine's plastic case is waterproof, and the mine can be scattered from a helicopter.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that soil–water {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{plays an important role in}} unsaturated soil mechanics, but the measurement of SWCC is inconvenient. In laboratory it requires days of testing time. For fine-grained clays, it may last for a couple of months using <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests. In this study, the effects of sample dimensions and shapes on the balance time of measuring SWCCs using <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and the shape of SWCCs are investigated. It can be found that the sample dimensions and shapes have apparent influence on the balance time. The testing durations for circular samples with smaller diameters and annular samples with larger contact area are significantly shortened. However, there is little effect of sample dimensions and shapes on the shape of SWCCs. Its mechanism is explored and discussed in details through analysing the principle of <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and microstructure of the sample. Based on the above findings, it is found that the circular samples with smaller dimensions can accelerate the testing duration of SWCC using the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

50|$|The TM-35 was a rectangular, metal-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} mine {{used during the}} Second World War. The mine has a metal case, which is rectangular with a carrying handle {{on one side and}} a large raised <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> in the centre. Sufficient pressure on the central <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> presses down on one end of an internal see-saw like lever, which removes the retaining pin from an MUV fuze, releasing the striker, triggering the mine.|$|R
5000|$|The casing of the Tellermine is circular, rising {{towards the}} {{center with a}} large flat <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> A {{rectangular}} metal carrying handle is fitted {{to the side of}} the mine. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> sits over the fuze well which can hold either a T.Mi.Z.42 shear pin fuze or T.Mi.Z.43 ball release fuze. The mine is armed by removing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> screwing a fuze into the fuze well, then screwing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> back on again. At the bottom of the fuze well is a PETN booster charge, surrounded by the doughnut-shaped main charge of TNT explosive. The mine has secondary fuze wells located on the side and base to enable anti-handling devices to be fitted if required. Additionally, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze features an integral anti-handling device as standard: when the fuze is inserted and the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> screwed down into place, it shears a weak arming pin in the fuze with an audible [...] "snap". This action arms the anti-handling device. Thereafter, any attempt to disarm the mine by unscrewing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (to remove the fuze) will automatically trigger detonation. Since it is impossible to determine which fuze type has been installed, no <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> should be removed from a Tellermine. The Tellermine 43 can also be fitted with an optional tilt-rod fuze, which is screwed into the side fuze well. Anti-tank mines with this type of fuze were capable of inflicting much more damage to armored vehicles. This was demonstrated numerous times in the Normandy Campaign. On June 8th, 1944, a Sherman tank was accompanying the 1st Ranger Battalion in an attack on the Maisy battery. It ran over a Tellermine and was blown to pieces, with a total crew loss. Sergeant John Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Slaughter describes the scene: [...] "The explosive energy from that hidden teller mine sent the 32-ton Sherman tank into the ditch on its side. This scene echoed the bloody, grotesque carnage of D-Day. One minute they were healthy young men, and the next minute they were bloody arms and legs wrapped around bloody torsos. We found body parts and shoes with the feet still stuck in them twenty-five yards away." ...|$|R
50|$|One {{significant}} difference between the PMN-1 and PMN-2 is that the PMN-2 (a mid-1970s design) contains a more modern fuze with an integral baffle beneath the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> This and the X-shaped design of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> makes the PMN-2 much more resistant to traditional explosive mine countermeasures, which use sudden overpressure to detonate mines. It can therefore be regarded as a blast resistant mine. In contrast, the PMN-1 (a 1950s design) can successfully be cleared by such methods.|$|R
50|$|The Single 8 {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} to use the camera's film gate to hold the film in place during exposure. This contrasted with the Kodak system which had a plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> built into the cartridge. It was widely believed by Single 8 enthusiasts that this would offer superior film positioning, but the reality was that Super 8's plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> could be moulded with far smaller tolerance than Single 8's metal version could be machined.|$|R
5000|$|The mine {{consists}} of a large, circular rounded steel case, with a central <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> In {{the center of the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is the M4 arming plug, which has an arming lever which can be set to [...] "ARMED" [...] or [...] "SAFE". The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> sits on top of a belleville spring, which in turn rests directly over the M603 fuze. When sufficient downward pressure is applied to the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (i.e. when a vehicle drives over it) the concertina spring is compressed. This action transfers pressure onto the M603 fuze which fires, triggering detonation. Because this mine has a metallic case, it is very easy to find it using even the most basic mine detector. However, a complicating factor is posed by the two secondary fuze wells. These enable anti-handling devices to be fitted: one {{on the side of the}} mine and one underneath. Additionally, a minefield containing M15 mines may also contain a number of minimum metal M19 mines, plus various antipersonnel mines of different types (e.g. the VS-MK2, SB-33, TS-50, PMA-2 or PMA-3), all of which are specifically designed to be difficult to find using metal mine detectors.|$|R
40|$|A new double-layer grating {{template}} {{is designed}} to reduce the out-of-band loss as much as 1. 8 dB when the loss of LP 03 reaches 10. 2 dB. Meanwhile, we propose a method to remove the sidelobes in the transmission spectra by the adjustment of the thickness of <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> The plate-thickness-induced shift of resonant wavelength and the attenuation of loss peak intensity when removing sidelobes can be modified by the fibre distance and contact point on the <b>pressure</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{a manual}} transmission, the {{flywheel}} {{is attached to}} the engine's crankshaft and spins along with it. The clutch disk is in between the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., clutch pedal up), the flywheel spins the clutch plate and hence the transmission. As the clutch pedal is depressed, the throw out bearing is activated, which causes the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> to stop applying pressure to the clutch disk. This makes the clutch plate stop receiving power from the engine, so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the clutch pedal is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the clutch disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.|$|R
