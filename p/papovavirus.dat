40|$|Overlapping {{redundant}} short oligomers in DNA {{sequences of}} retroviruses and <b>papovaviruses</b> have been identified. For each sequence, a search procedure determines the 5 % short oligomers {{of the same}} length with the highest ratios of observed to expected occurrences based on singlet composition of the sequence. These short oligomers {{are referred to as}} compositionally-assessed redundant sequence elements (COARSEs).

Most COARSE overlaps of the 7 th order (overlapping septuplets) are found in long terminal repeats of retroviruses and in the regulatory control regions of <b>papovaviruses</b> SV 40, BK and JC. Many of the 7 th order COARSE overlaps in HIV- 1 and SV 40 are identical with regulatory elements determined experimentally.

50|$|TAg is {{a product}} of an early gene {{transcribed}} during viral infection by SV40, and is involved in viral genome replication and regulation of host cell cycle. SV40 is a double-stranded, circular DNA virus belonging to the Polyomaviridae (earlier <b>Papovavirus)</b> family, Orthopolyomavirus genus.

40|$|The tumor antigens {{directed}} by human papovaviruses BK and JC and the monkey <b>papovavirus</b> simian virus 40 have two methionine-containing tryptic peptides in common.

In addition to the two peptides, which are present in all three <b>papovavirus</b> tumor antigens, the larger forms of the tumor antigens specified by simian virus 40 and BK virus share four other methionine-containing tryptic peptides, {{two of which are}} also present in the smaller (17, 000 daltons) species of antigen. The occurrence of common peptides at the amino-terminal portion of tumor antigens of primate papovaviruses suggests that these conserved regions may play a fundamental role in the function of these proteins and in the propagation of these viruses in nature. The tryptic peptides of the small forms of <b>papovavirus</b> tumor antigen were examined and compared to those present in the large species. Out of a total of nine and ten methionine-containing peptides in the 17, 000 -dalton tumor antigens of simian virus 40 and BK virus, seven and nine peptides, respectively, are constituents of the corresponding larger (97, 000 daltons) forms of the antigen...|$|E

DNA reassociation saturation tests using 125 I-labelled RFV DNA show that BKV has 88 ~o homology, and SP-SV 4 o has 29 % homology to RFV.

These genomes displayed overlapping deletions consistently sharing a common end within the noncoding regulatory sequences; the other end was variable but always extended into the sequence coding for the N-terminal part of the viral capsid VP 2.

40|$|Eukaryotic {{expression}} vectors {{have been used}} successfully in viral LT-expressing cell lines (ie. COS) to clone cDNAs encoding proteins that can be detected through their bio-activity or reactivity with specific antibodies. Since Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) have been used extensively for the isolation and characterization of somatic cell mutants, we felt {{it would be an}} advantage to develop an expression cloning system in CHO cells. We have modified the eukaryotic expression vector CDM 8 by replacing the polyoma and SV 40 origins of replication with the 427 bp non-coding region of the Syrian hamster <b>papovavirus.</b> Wild-type CHO cells and the CHO glycosylation-mutant Lec 4 A were transfected with plasmids bearing the early genes of either polyoma virus or hamster <b>papovavirus</b> in order to establish stable, LT antigen-expressing cell lines designated CHOP or CHOH, respectively. CHOP cell lines expressing polyoma LT antigen supported efficient replication of CDM 8, but replicated pMH poorly. Conversely, CHOH cells expressing the hamster <b>papovavirus</b> LT antigen supported replication of pMH, and at a lower efficiency, CDM 8. Replication of CDM 8 and pMH vectors were equally efficient in selected CHOP and CHOH cell lines, respectively and comparable to that of CDM 8 replication in COS- 1 cells. A bacterial beta-galactosidase fusion gene inserted into the multiple cloning site of a CDM 8 derivative was efficiently expressed when transiently transfected into CHOP and CHOH cells but not CHO cells since only the former supports autonomous plasmid replication. These results show that expression-cloning in CHO cells expressing either polyoma virus or hamster <b>papovavirus</b> LT antigens is possible using either the CDM 8 or the pMH vectors, respectively...|$|E

5000|$|TS {{was first}} {{described}} in a 1995 case report as [...] "ciclosporin-induced folliculodystrophy", {{thought at the time}} to be an adverse effect of ciclosporin treatment. A subsequent report in 1999, which introduced the term [...] "trichodysplasia spinulosa", used electron microscopy to identify the presence of virus particles in affected cells consistent with what were at the time known as <b>papovaviruses.</b> (The group has since been divided into the papillomavirus and polyomavirus families.) In 2010, researchers used rolling circle amplification to recover viral DNA from TS lesions and thus discovered a novel polyomavirus, trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus (TSPyV). There is compelling evidence that TSPyV is the direct causative agent of TS.|$|R
40|$|Simian virus 40 (SV 40) and polyomavirus (Py) DNA {{replication}} require {{cellular proteins}} and a virus-encoded early gene product, large T antigen (SVT and PyT, respectively). Primate cells contain factors permissive for SV 40 replication, whereas murine cells express those factors permissive for Py. We have compared the roles T antigen, cell permissiveness and replication play in transcription of SV 40 and Py genes. We {{show that in}} their respectively permissive cells, SV 40 replication causes {{a major shift in}} transcription initiation from the early to the late viral promoter, whereas when Py replicates a comparable shift does not occur. This difference is discussed in relation to differences in the organization of the origin and promoter region between these two <b>papovaviruses.</b> Reporter plasmids were constructed that carried both viral origins, one at the natural position in the promoter being tested and the other at a distal location. With the appropriate TAg, these vectors could be made to replicate in either primate (HeLa) or rodent (3 T 6) cells. The SV 40 early to late shift occurred when replication was driven in HeLa cells, and was not seen on replicating templates in rodent cells. Thus, replication per se does not account for the shift. We show also that, like SVT, PyT is a potent activator of transcription, and that SVT and PyT can activate each other's late promoters independently of DNA replication, but only in cells permissive for DNA replication catalysed by the respective T antigen. Taken together, the data presented here suggest that <b>papovaviruses</b> may utilize permissive factors in transcription control mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The hamster <b>papovavirus</b> (HapV) is {{associated}} with multiple skin epitheliomas of the Syrian hamster. We have sequenced its genome. It is a double-stranded circular DNA of 5366 bp. The hypothetical genomic organization deduced from this nucleotide sequence is clearly of the polyoma type with the two strands coding in the opposite directions from a noncoding region that shows some {{of the features of}} a replication origin and a transcription control region. The amino acid sequences predicted from the open reading frames show an average of 50 % homology with polyoma-coded polypeptides.
