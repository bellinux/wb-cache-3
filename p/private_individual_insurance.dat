In developing countries, demographic profiles, poverty, the labour market and public finances {{are such that}} a comprehensive approach to solidarity -combining contributory and non-contributory mechanisms- is essential. In 1981, Chile redesigned the contributory component of its system by means of private health-insurance companies. The rationale of <b>private,</b> <b>individual</b> <b>insurance</b> runs counter to the ethical imperatives of contracts based on social rights. In Europe, this dilemma has been tackled using risk-levelling mechanisms that resolve the conflict between accessibility, efficiency and selection. In Chile, competitive health insurance companies (Isapres) coexist with a solidarity-based State alternative, the National Health Fund (FONASA). The Isapres engage in aggressive risk selection. The challenge for health policy is to integrate the two systems to balance the principles of equivalence and solidarity...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I study two {{different}} economies that consist of heterogeneous labor. By allowing for differences among individuals where previous analyses restricted attention to homogeneous labor, I {{am able to}} understand the impact of such a consideration on issues of optimal policy and potential equilibria. The first chapter, Optimal Social <b>Insurance</b> with <b>Individual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Insurance</b> and Moral Hazard, characterizes optimal social insurance in an economy where competi-tive firms also provide insurance to workers facing uncertain outcomes. An ex-ante heterogeneous population of workers exerts effort to increase the likelihood of high outcome events. This chapter is novel in its joint consideration of two sources of heterogeneity, two potential sources of insurance, and an endogenous ex-post distri-bution of outcomes. The introduction of ex-ante heterogeneity in the presence of optimal private insurance changes the optimal prescription for social insurance away from zero. Moreover, the relative source of the variation in outcomes due to ex-ante heterogeneity and ex-post shocks plays {{a significant role in the}} welfare loss associ...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "A growing number of states [...] 35 as of June 2009 [...] have created high-risk health insurance pools (HRPs) primarily to provide coverage to individuals whose health status limits their access to coverage in the <b>private</b> <b>individual</b> health <b>insurance</b> market. HRPs [...] typically state-run nonprofit associations [...] often contract with a private health insurance carrier to administer the pool and offer a range of health plan options to such individuals, who are {{commonly referred to as}} medically uninsurable. Plan options vary within pools and from state to state, and like the <b>private</b> <b>individual</b> market, HRPs typically impose waiting periods for coverage of preexisting conditions to discourage medically uninsurable individuals from foregoing health insurance until they require care. Because of the higher health care costs typically incurred by medically uninsurable individuals, all pools operate at a loss. Premiums for HRP health plans are higher than for plans offered to healthy <b>individuals</b> in the <b>private</b> health insurance market; however, these premiums are capped to limit enrollees' costs and are thus insufficient to cover the costs of enrollee health care claims. As a result, all HRPs supplement their revenues through various funding mechanisms, such as assessments on health insurance carriers and state general revenues. Federal grants are also awarded to establish and fund HRPs. As part of the Trade Adjustment and Assistance Reform Act of 2002, Congress established a program to provide grants to HRPs to offset losses and establish HRPs [...] commonly referred to as operational and seed grants, respectively. Subsequent legislation authorized funding for the program through 2010, including grants to be used for supplemental consumer benefits [...] commonly referred as bonus grants. Since 2003, the grant program has awarded nearly $ 286 million to state HRPs for various purposes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), withiDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers this federal grant program. Recent health care reform proposals call for an expanded role for HRPs to enhance health insurance options for the medically uninsurable. Because of the federal funding provided to HRPs, you expressed interest in obtaining data on several aspects of each state HRP. In this report, we describe (1) HRP enrollment and enrollee demographics; (2) HRP plans' cost-sharing provisions, coverage restrictions, and premiums, and comparable information for certain private market health plans; and (3) HRPs' governance, expenditures, and funding. ...|$|R

50|$|An {{intermediate}} {{care facility}} (ICF) is {{a health care}} facility for individuals who are disabled, elderly, or non-acutely ill, usually providing less intensive care than that offered at a hospital or skilled nursing facility. Typically an ICF is not privately paid by the individual or by the individual's family, but involves federal Medicaid financing with a state and federal share, and individual contribution. An <b>individual's</b> <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> and/or a third party service like a hospice company may cover part of the cost. ICFs in the community have been increasingly replaced financially by Home and community-based waiver services. (In FY 2011, only 8% ICFs compared to 65% HCBS waiver of $48.29 billion community spending in intellectual and developmental disabilities nationally). For comparisons between intermediate care facilities large and small in intellectual disabilities, see Home and community-based services: Costs, utilization and outcomes {{in the state of}} Minnesota (Lakin et al., 2005). The primary problem with these facilities today are their exorbitant cost (reported as average of $123,053 per person, likely institutions)compared to home and community-based Medicaid waiver services ($42,896 per person) which also far exceed the cost of nursing facilities (American Association of Retired Persons, 2012, p. 14).|$|R

40|$|AbstractHealth shocks {{are among}} the most {{important}} unprotected risks for microfinance clients, but take-up of micro health insurance remains low. A framed field experiment with credit groups in Tanzania, eliciting demand for group versus <b>individual</b> <b>insurance,</b> attributes this to a social dilemma. In a context of joint liability, insurance is a public good because clients can rely on contributions from group members to cope with health shocks. We hypothesize that clients have a private incentive to free-ride and forgo <b>individual</b> <b>insurance</b> even when full enrollment optimizes group welfare. The binding nature of group insurance eliminates such free-riding. Our experiment yields substantial support for this hypothesis. Whereas the demand for group insurance is high, a substantial share of clients forgoes <b>individual</b> <b>insurance</b> and relies on peers to repay their loan when falling ill.

40|$|More than 45 % of Australians buy health {{insurance}} for private treatment in hospital. This is despite having access to universal and free public hospital treatment. Anecdotal evidence suggests that avoidance of long waits for public treatment is {{one possible explanation for}} the high rate of insurance coverage. In this study, we investigate the effect of waiting on individual decisions to buy <b>private</b> health <b>insurance.</b> <b>Individuals</b> are assumed to form an expectation of their own waiting time as a function of their demographics and health status. We model waiting times using administrative data on the population hospitalised for elective procedures in public hospitals and use the parameter estimates to impute the expected waiting time and the probability of a long wait for a representative sample of the population. We find that expected waiting time does not increase the probability of buying insurance but a high probability of experiencing a long wait does. On average, waiting time has no significant impact on insurance. In addition, we find that favourable selection into private insurance, measured by self-assessed health, is no longer significant once waiting time variables are included. This result suggests that a source of favourable selection may be aversion to waiting among healthier people. 19 page(s...|$|R

We used self-reported baseline data on socio-demographics, phenotype and sun exposure behaviours from participants in the QSkin Sun and Health Study {{with at least one}} histopathologically confirmed keratinocyte cancer or melanoma (n= 5, 673). Linkage to Australian Medicare data (2011 - 2014) provided resource data and government and out-of-pocket patient costs. Generalised linear models examined costs by frequency of skin cancer groups separately for melanoma and keratinocyte cancer. Over three years, 539 participants were diagnosed with melanoma (11 % had ≥ 2 melanomas) and 5, 134 participants were treated for keratinocyte cancers (10 % had ≥ 6). Median Medicare costs per person were $ 1, 325 (maximum $ 6, 117) for ≥ 2 melanomas and $ 2, 126 (maximum $ 54, 618) for ≥ 6 keratinocyte cancers. Increased costs were associated with <b>private</b> health <b>insurance.</b> <b>Individuals</b> who are multiply affected by skin cancers are relatively common and the accompanying individual and government cost burden can be substantial.

40|$|Abstract: Some {{states have}} {{implemented}} community rating regulations {{to limit the}} extent to which premiums in the <b>individual</b> health <b>insurance</b> market can vary with a person’s health status. Community rating and guaranteed issues laws were passed with hopes of increasing access to affordable insurance for people with high-risk health conditions, but there are concerns that these laws led to adverse selection. In some sense, {{the extent to which}} these regulations ultimately affected the individual market depends in large part on the degree of risk segmentation in unregulated states. In this paper, we examine the relationship between expected medical expenses, <b>individual</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums, and the likelihood of obtaining <b>individual</b> <b>insurance</b> using data from both the National Health Interview Survey and the Community Tracking Study Household Survey. We test for differences in these relationships between states with both community rating and guaranteed issue and states with no such regulations. While we find that people living in unregulated states with higher expected expense due to chronic health conditions pay modestly higher premiums and are somewhat less likely to obtain coverage, the variation between premiums and risk in unregulated <b>individual</b> <b>insurance</b> markets is far from proportional; there is considerable pooling. In regulated states, we find that there is no effect of having highe...|$|R
