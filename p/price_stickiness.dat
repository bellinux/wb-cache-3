500|$|Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was {{published}} in 1936. It was researched and indexed by one of Keynes's favourite students, later the economist David Bensusan-Butt. The work served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The General Theory challenged the earlier neoclassical economic paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish full employment equilibrium. In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou. Keynes believed the classical theory was a [...] "special case" [...] that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his own theory being the general one. Classical economists had believed in Say's law, which, simply put, states that [...] "supply creates its own demand", and that in a free market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of <b>price</b> <b>stickiness</b> – the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is rational {{for them to do}} so. Due in part to <b>price</b> <b>stickiness,</b> it was established that the interaction of [...] "aggregate demand" [...] and [...] "aggregate supply" [...] may lead to stable unemployment equilibria – and in those cases, it is the state, not the market, that economies must depend on for their salvation.|$|E
500|$|While [...] "money surprise" [...] models floundered, efforts {{continued}} {{to develop a}} new classical model of the business cycle. A 1982 paper by Kydland and Prescott introduced real business cycle theory (RBC). Under this theory business cycles could be explained entirely by the supply side, and models represented the economy with systems at constant equilibrium. RBC dismissed the need to explain business cycles with price surprise, market failure, <b>price</b> <b>stickiness,</b> uncertainty, and instability. Instead, Kydland and Prescott built parsimonious models that explained business cycles with changes in technology and productivity. Employment levels changed because these technological and productivity changes altered the desire of people to work. RBC rejected the idea of high involuntary unemployment in recessions and not only dismissed the idea that money could stabilize the economy but also the monetarist idea that money could destabilize it.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we analyze firms' pricing {{behavior}} using a full informative micro dataset {{that accounts}} for {{a large part of}} Italian firms. In our view, â€œthe black boxesâ€ to examine are the relations between price setting, market structure and spatial disparities. A first goal of the research is to investigate the link between asymmetries in price changes and spatial dependence. Besides, we compare the price dynamics among sectors, namely manufacturing vs. service. It is irrefutable that <b>prices</b> <b>stickiness</b> is linked to good market rigidities. Consequently, these issues have extremely important policy implications; for instance, the Monetary Authority considers the macro price indexes to determine the right policy to stabilize the economy and to improve social welfare. However, the Central Bank does not distinguish the likely aggregation bias source from the cross sector-region-country heterogeneities. On the other hand, the propagation mechanism of an adverse monetary policy impulse, following a cost-push shock, may induce considerable mortality for firms' survival, expressed by the entry/exit balance.

500|$|A [...] "new synthesis" [...] or [...] "new neo{{classical}} synthesis" [...] {{emerged in}} the 1990s drawing ideas from both the new Keynesian and new classical schools. From the new classical school, it adapted RBC hypotheses, including rational expectations, and methods; from the new Keynesian school, it took nominal rigidities (<b>price</b> <b>stickiness)</b> and other market imperfections. New synthesis theory developed RBC models called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. DSGE models formulate hypotheses about the behaviors and preferences of firms and households; numerical solutions of the resulting DSGE models are computed. These models also included a [...] "stochastic" [...] element created by shocks to the economy. In the original RBC models these shocks were limited to technological change, but more recent models have incorporated other real changes. DSGE models have a theoretical advantage, avoiding the Lucas critique. The new synthesis was adopted by academic economists and soon by policy makers, such as central bankers.|$|E
2500|$|During the Great Depression, the {{definitive}} liberal {{response to it}} was given by the English economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946). Keynes had been [...] "brought up" [...] as a classical liberal, but especially after World War I became increasingly a welfare or social liberal. A prolific writer, among many other works, he had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. [...] Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the Great Depression. He believed that budget deficits were a good thing, a product of recessions. He wrote, [...] "For Government borrowing {{of one kind or}} another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill". At the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes published The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter cyclical public spending. The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was published in 1936, and served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The General Theory challenged the earlier neo-classical economic paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish full employment equilibrium.

Methodology {{and data}} collection [...] Chapter 5. Results and robustness check [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion. This thesis is the first study in Australia that examines the presence and determinants of operating cash flows asymmetric timeliness. Several explanations for cash flows asymmetry documented in the US studies are tested, including product <b>pricing,</b> cost <b>stickiness</b> and firm's life cycle. Using firm’s stock return as the proxy for economic news and 23, 203 firm-year observations within the period of 1992 - 2012, the empirical results indicate that product <b>pricing</b> and cost <b>stickiness</b> are valid explanations for operating cash flows asymmetric timeliness. However, although firm’s life cycle {{has been found to}} {{have a significant effect on}} operating cash flows asymmetry in US studies, it is insignificant in Australia. Compared to US firms, 40 per cent of Australian listed firms are mining and resource firms with low sales in their early stages of life. Accordingly, analytical comparisons between mining and non-mining firms are carried out in this thesis. Mining firms are found to exhibit less operating cash flows asymmetric timeliness than non-mining firms. Given the important role of operating cash flows as the key indicator of firm performance and valuation, this research provides investors with an in-depth understanding of operating cash flows asymmetric timeliness, and contributes to the improvement of their forecasts and predictions of operating cash flows.

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} {{set up a}} model that {{incorporates}} firm dynamics into the Global Economy Model (henceforth, GEM) developed by the IMF Research Department. Then, we show how the economic variables respond to the shocks that shift the production frontier outwards, namely productivity gains in manufacturing, efficiency gains in creating new firms, {{and an increase in}} the labor force. Contrary to the model used in previous research on the same topic by Corsetti, Martin and Pesenti (2007, henceforth, CMP), our model contains rich and realistic dynamics embedded in the GEM such as a time-to-build constraint for firm dynamics, and nominal <b>price</b> and wage <b>stickiness.</b> We show that (1) the analytical results of CMP are dependent on the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods, (2) short-run responses could be different from those in CMP because of the existence of <b>price</b> and wage <b>stickiness,</b> and (3) persistence of shocks also alters the direction of responses via the wealth effect. These results suggest that it is of great importance for policy institutions to acknowledge the dynamic aspects of productivity spillovers by simulating a model with richer dynamics like the GEM.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} on the patterns of price and wage changes and the link between <b>price</b> and wage <b>stickiness</b> in European firms. It uses a unique data set collected from a firm-level survey conducted in {{a broad range of}} European countries. The typical frequency of wage changes in European firms is once per year and than prices change more frequently than wages. The frequency of price changes varies across sectors and depends on the degree of competition, the share of labour costs in total cost and other economic features. Instead the country differences in wage change frequencies are larger than is the case of price change frequencies, as wage changes respond most to institutional variables. Wage-setting is time-dependent with more than 54 % if firms in Europe wage changes are concentrated in a particular month. In this regard, there is a notable “January effect”. Finally, results in this paper point to a degree of synchronisation at the firm level between the timing of wage and price changes and a relationship between <b>price</b> and wage <b>stickiness.</b> When examining the links between prices and wages we find that wages partially feed into prices and the frequency of wage changes influences that of price changes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We discuss {{an array}} of models of {{dynamically}} optimizing representative firms and workers, with inertia and price-wage stickiness modeled in various ways. The degree of <b>price</b> and wage <b>stickiness</b> bears no necessary connection {{to the strength of}} real effects of monetary policy. Matching the combination of real and nominal inertia in responses to monetary policy found in the data requires a more complex model, with more sources of stickiness and inertia, than has been standard in the literature. The pervasiveness of sluggish cross-variable responses in the macro data, combined with the implausibility of many of the microeconomic stories underlying adjustment cost models, suggests that we look for a different approach to modeling the sources of inertia in both prices and real variables.
