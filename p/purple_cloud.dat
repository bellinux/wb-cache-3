Some details of the story may also have been taken from M. P. Shiel's 1901 Arctic exploration novel, The <b>Purple</b> <b>Cloud,</b> which was republished in 1930.|$|E
25|$|When Henry is {{pronounced}} dead, Emma and Regina {{return to the}} Hospital {{to say goodbye to}} his body. Emma kisses him on the forehead, causing a pulse of energy to engulf the entire town and restore everyone's true memories while freeing Henry from the effects of the poisoned apple. Snow and Charming reunite with each other and Regina returns to her mansion alone as Emma begins to wonder why no one is returning to the Other World since the curse is broken. Rumplestiltskin reunites with his true love Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and takes her to a Wishing Well {{deep in the heart of}} the forest, a well with the power to restore that which one had lost. He takes the potion and drops it into the well, causing a <b>purple</b> <b>cloud</b> to emerge and consume Storybrooke as the Clock Tower strikes 8:15.|$|E

2500|$|In M. P. Shiel's {{short story}} [...] "The Primate of the Rose" [...] (1928), {{there is an}} {{unpleasant}} womaniser named E. P. Crooks, who was written as a parody of Wells. Wells had attacked Shiel's Prince Zaleski when {{it was published in}} 1895, and this was Shiel's response. Wells praised Shiel's The <b>Purple</b> <b>Cloud</b> (1901); in turn Shiel expressed admiration for Wells, referring to him at a speech to the Horsham Rotary Club in 1933 as [...] "my friend Mr. Wells".|$|E
2500|$|Emma and Hook {{arrive at}} Granny's Diner together, {{with both of}} them telling a {{concerned}} David and Mary Margaret that they were fine, despite Emma's change in appearance, and with Hook adding that he [...] "didn't look like a Crocodile just yet." [...] The others tell them that they can finally continue their quest to destroy the Darkness, with Hook volunteering to get Merlin from the Diner. As Merlin was finishing the message that would be later be received in Storybrooke, Hook appears and locks the doors, revealing that he planned to cast another Dark Curse in order to get his revenge on Gold. Merlin says that this is impossible, since he would have to crush the heart of [...] "the thing they love most" [...] to enact it, and Hook would never kill Emma. Hook then takes Merlin’s heart, and the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin morphs into one of Nimue, who appears to see Hook crush the heart. Just then, Emma enters, devastated to find out that Hook has tricked her. Hook says that he had always planned to get his revenge on Gold, and adds that no one will ever control him again, before sending Excalibur back into the Stone to ensure this. When Emma asks Nimue why she was helping Hook, Nimue reveals that Hook had made a deal with her: the Darkness would ensure Hook vengeance on Gold while Hook in turn would help the Darkness snuff out the Light, which devastates Emma. Nimue goes on to explain that when Hook crushes Merlin's heart, it also counts as her crushing his heart, since she is [...] "in all the Dark Ones," [...] which will allow Hook's Curse to work. Emma tries desperately to convince Hook to stop, telling him that he doesn't need revenge, and that his happy ending was with her. She warns Hook that if he crushes Merlin's heart, he will destroy his happy ending. However, Hook states that it was her [...] "lovesick puppy dog" [...] "Killian Jones" [...] who {{had fallen in love with}} her, claiming that his former self was killed when she [...] "turned him into a Dark One." [...] Then, he suddenly crushes Merlin’s heart in his hand, to enact the Curse. When Merlin dies, Emma tells Merlin that she was sorry, before dissolving his body and telling him to rest in peace. Unable to stop the Curse, a heartbroken Emma knocks Hook out, before using a dreamcatcher to erase Hook's memories, to prevent him from remembering why he cast the Curse. Then, at the behest of the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin, Emma brings her parents, Henry, Regina, Robin, Belle, their friends and Zelena (whom she reinstalled the magic-inhibiting cuff on) back to Granny's Diner in an unconscious state, before using the dreamcatcher to erase all of their memories, and to add a forgetting spell to the Curse, to keep Hook from ever finding out that he was a Dark One. Meanwhile, in Camelot, Arthur is shocked to find Excalibur's fragment returned to the Stone, and Guinevere points out the cloud of the Curse, which Arthur describes as [...] "extremely dark magic." [...] Then, Merida (who was riding her way back to Camelot to fight Arthur), Arthur, and Guinevere look on as the <b>purple</b> <b>cloud</b> of the Dark Curse engulfs Camelot and part of the Enchanted Forest.|$|E

The world is split up into climate regions, each containing multiple kingdoms and villages, a few of which are not on the main path, but hold small stories, such as the giants, and the sheep, as well as hidden dungeons.

60|$|Great, velvety, <b>purple</b> <b>clouds</b> heaped up in {{the west}} and spread over the valley. There was no wind and {{everything}} was suddenly, strangely, dreadfully still. The marsh was full of thousands of fire-flies. Surely some fairy parliament was being convened that night. Altogether, Rainbow Valley was not a canny place just then.|$|R
60|$|The {{day came}} when Wade {{walked down to}} White Slides. There {{seemed to be a}} fever in his blood, which he tried to {{convince}} himself was a result of his wounds instead of the condition of his mind. It was Sunday, a day of sunshine and squall, of azure-blue sky, and great, sailing, <b>purple</b> <b>clouds.</b> The sage of the hills glistened and there was a sweetness in the air.|$|R
25|$|According to a legend, {{on a day}} in {{the year}} 834, the monk Sanshū, on a meditative walk along the western shore of Lake Biwa, would have seen <b>purple</b> <b>clouds</b> in the eastern sky across the lake. A {{dazzling}} light suddenly appeared. The monk, interpreting this phenomenon as a sign of celestial power, went to the spot where the brilliance of light had formed. There he found a pond on which he began to pray.|$|R
60|$|The <b>purple</b> <b>cloud</b> had passed, and sunk {{behind the}} house, {{and a bright}} white sky was pouring down a {{sparkling}} rain; a patch of deep blue showed behind the fir-trees in the drive.

A squirrel scampering along a branch {{stopped and looked at}} Mrs. Pendyce, and Mrs. Pendyce looked absently at the squirrel from behind the little handkerchief with which she was drying her eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} went swiftly and noiselessly {{down the road to}} his boat. The murmur of the sea sounded very far off. Mosey Louis was busy {{counting}} out the mackerel, Xavier was dipping up buckets of water and pouring it over the silvery fish. The sun was setting in a bank of <b>purple</b> <b>cloud,</b> and the long black headland to the west cut the golden seas like a wedge of ebony. It was all real and yet unreal. Benjamin went to work mechanically.|$|E
60|$|The south held a {{panorama}} of purple-shrouded range and canyon, canyon and range, on across the rolling leagues to the dim, lofty peaks, all canopied over with angry, dusky, low-drifting clouds, horizon-wide, smoky, and sulphurous. And as Ellen watched, hands pressed to her breast, feeling incalculable relief {{in sight of}} this tempest and gulf that resembled her soul, the sun burst {{out from behind the}} long bank of <b>purple</b> <b>cloud</b> in the west and flooded the world there with golden lightning.|$|E
6000|$|Juan, {{instead of}} courting courts, was courted,-- [...] A thing which happens rarely: this he owed [...] Much to his youth, {{and much to}} his {{reported}} [...] Valour; much also to the blood he show'd, [...] Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported, [...] Which set the beauty off in which he glow'd, [...] As <b>purple</b> <b>clouds</b> befringe the sun; but most [...] He owed to an old woman and his post.|$|R
60|$|Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for {{through an}} opening in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the other side, far over the {{outskirts}} of the great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and <b>purple</b> <b>clouds</b> lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.|$|R
5000|$|Argorribles: Ghostly <b>purple</b> <b>clouds</b> that Zordrak {{sends out}} each night to deliver nightmares to the {{sleeping}} world. The {{power of the}} Dreamstone is often far too much for them and so only occasionally do they slip through. However, {{with the power of}} the Nightmare stone the Argorribles are powered up {{and are more likely to}} bypass the Dreamstone's defenses. Though usually thwarted from making a full-scale attack on the Land Of Dreams, the Argorribles have a handful of large victories throughout the show's run. They are incorporeal, although one is briefly made solid in the episode [...] "Horrible Argorrible".|$|R
60|$|Above the velvet-dark, flat-toughed cedar trees, {{which rose}} like pagodas of ebony {{on either side}} of the drive, the sky hung {{lowering}} in one great <b>purple</b> <b>cloud,</b> endowed with sinister life by a single white beam striking up into it from the horizon. Beneath this canopy of cloud a small phalanx of dusty, dishevelled-looking men and women were drawn up in the road, guarding, and encouraging with cheers, a tall, black-coated orator. Before and behind this phalanx, a little mob of men and boys kept up an accompaniment of groans and jeering.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{had been}} gone a {{fortnight}} when Jacinta and Muriel Gascoyne sat under the lee of the Estremedura's deck-house one morning, {{on their way to}} Las Palmas. Above them the mastheads swung languidly athwart a cloudless sweep of blue, and the sea frothed in white incandescence about the lurching hull below as the little yacht-like steamer reeled eastwards with a rainbow in the spray that whirled about her bows. Astern of her the Peak's white cone gleamed above its wrappings of fleecy mist, and ahead on the far horizon Grand Canary swam a <b>purple</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
60|$|Slowly {{the melancholy}} Indian-summer day waned as Jonathan strode {{out of the}} woods into a plain beyond, where he was to meet Wetzel at sunset. A smoky haze like a <b>purple</b> <b>cloud</b> lay upon the gently waving grass. He could not see across the stretch of prairie-land, though at this point he knew it was hardly a mile wide. With the trilling of the {{grasshoppers}} alone disturbing the serene quiet of this autumn afternoon, all nature seemed in harmony with the declining season. He stood a while, his thoughts becoming the calmer for the silence and loneliness of this breathing meadow.|$|E
60|$|It {{required}} keen {{vision to}} see any movement whatever in the <b>purple</b> <b>clouds.</b> By infinitesimal degrees the dark cloud-line merged upward into the golden-red haze of the afterglow of sunset. A shadow lengthened from under the western wall across the valley. As straight and rigid as steel rose the delicate spear-pointed silver spruces; the aspen leaves, by nature pendant and quivering, hung limp and heavy; no slender blade of grass moved. A gentle splashing of water came from the ravine. Then again {{from out of the}} west sounded the low, dull, and rumbling roll of thunder.|$|R
60|$|It was the {{earliest}} dawn. The morning only showed itself along {{the lower edge}} of a bank of <b>purple</b> <b>clouds</b> pierced by the misty peaks of Tahiti. The tropical day seemed too languid to rise. Sometimes, starting fitfully, it decked the clouds with faint edgings of pink and gray, which, fading away, left all dim again. Anon, it threw out thin, pale rays, growing lighter and lighter, until at last, the golden morning sprang out of the East with a bound--darting its bright beams hither and thither, higher and higher, and sending them, broadcast, over {{the face of the}} heavens.|$|R
60|$|Lassonthwaite lost {{none of its}} charms {{on closer}} acquaintance. Mr. Hunt's farm stood on the slope of a hill, {{commanding}} {{a view of the}} mountains, rising like <b>purple</b> <b>clouds</b> above the moorland, richly carpeted with the varied colours of heath, fern, and furze, and scattered with flocks of the white bleached mountain sheep, and herds of sturdy little black cattle; while the valley, nearer at hand, was fringed with woods, sheltering verdant pasture land, watered by the same clear frolicsome stream that danced through the garden--Olivia's garden--brilliant with roses and other beauties, such as the great Harrison himself would hardly have disdained.|$|R
