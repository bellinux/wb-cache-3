40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) for the Cal Poly dairy milk barn, which will help prepare students to be more efficient at milking in the newly renovated milking parlor. A double 10 parallel parlor is {{to be put into}} place to update the current milk barn. The current milking parlor is a double 8 herringbone barn which holds eight cows per side that are positioned at an angle. The double 8 herringbone parlor is to be remodeled into a double 10 parallel parlor. In addition, a double 10 parallel barn has ten cows on each side and are being milked between the hind legs. Information was gathered from the Cal Poly dairy’s herd manager, Rich Silacci, to develop a new SOP poster for the new milking parlor. Proper milking procedures were discussed and a poster was developed. The poster is to be placed in the milk barn near the pit where students are milking. The SOP poster is to be used as an easy way to answer any questions that they may have about proper milking procedures. The poster that was created contains 6 different steps to insure that students are consistent in their milking procedures. The first step in this SOP poster is to <b>Pre-dip.</b> It is important to apply the <b>Pre-dip</b> to the first five cows, cover the whole bottom 2 / 3 of each teat and allow the <b>Pre-dip</b> to sit for 30 seconds. Step number 2 calls for stripping the milk from the teats of the five cows and remove 2 - 3 squirts from each quarter. Step number 3 calls for wiping all five cows teats clean and to use as many towels as needed, but making sure not to transfer dirty towels to the next cow. Step number 4 calls for attaching the milking unit to the five cows and to make sure the milk hose and pulsation hose are parallel with the cows body pointing directly back towards the parlor pit. The milk hose will rest on the hose clamp located on the curb. Step number 5 is when the automatic take-off removes the milking unit when the cow is done being milked. Finally, step number 6 calls for the five cow’s four teats to be post-dipped. In addition, the SOP poster will contain extra information such as attending to liner slips, also known as squawking, as soon as possible to decrease chance of mastitis. In addition, it is important to make sure cows are completely milked out to decrease the chance of mastitis. The use of this SOP poster will aid students in learning how to milk the cows properly and provide for their success in the work place...|$|E

A group of 15 Italian dairy farms were visited three times during different seasons: the cold (3. 8 °C), the hot (23. 5 °C) and the mild (12. 1 °C) seasons. Hygiene of udder, flanks and legs was scored on 2, 330 cows based on a 4 -point scale system, from very clean (score 1) to very dirty skin (score 4). On the same cows, a total of 9, 201 teats were assessed for teat-end condition and assigned to four different classes of hyperkeratosis: No lesion (N), Smooth ring (S), Rough (R) and Very rough skin (VR). The average percentage of teats classified in the worst classes of hyperkeratosis (R and VR) equaled 15. 9 %. Teat hyperkeratosis, cow cleanliness and milk somatic cell count were significantly affected by the season. Teat condition was significantly better in primiparous than in multiparous cows and deteriorated during lactation. Cows with the lowest values of SCC, better teat conditions and better hygiene scores were found in the farms where more than one milking practice (among forestripping, <b>pre-dipping</b> and post-dipping) were performed. Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed that parity and days of lactation significantly influence the risk of high somatic cell count. Among environmental and management aspects, clean udders and <b>pre-dipping</b> are associated with a reduced likelihood to have individual cows with milk SCC greater than 100, 000 cells/mL. Teat hyperkeratosis does not seem to be a risk factor of high SCC.

Bacteria of Pseudomonas spp. genus were isolated from 85 and 82 sampling points in dairy farms with manual and mechanical milking system, respectively. A significant difference (p= 0. 02) on Pseudomonas spp. isolation was observed among samples of surface of cows’ teats before and after <b>pre-dipping,</b> but no significant difference (p> 0. 05) was observed among milking systems or seasons. The possibility of the same Pseudomonas spp. patterns are distributed in different farms and seasons using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) technique was demonstrated. Milkers’ hands, surface of cows’ teats, teat cups and cooling tanks were associated with raw milk contamination with Pseudomonas spp. on farms with manual and mechanical milking system, showing that regardless of the type of milking system and season, proper hygiene procedures of equipment, utensils and workers’ hands are essential to avoid contamination of the milk and, therefore, improve milk quality...|$|R

Bulk tank milk samples were collected from all Prince Edward Island dairy herds (n= 235) from March 2005 to March 2007. Biweekly total bacterial, preliminary incubation, laboratory pasteurization, and coliform counts were conducted using a Petrifilm culture system. Data for on-farm risk factors were collected via a mail-out survey which consisted of 4 main sections: (1) general farm demographics and management, (2) cow cleanliness and hygiene, (3) milking procedures and mastitis control, and (4) equipment maintenance and cleaning. Of 235 producers, 153 completed the mail-out survey giving a response rate of 65 %. Both total aerobic and preliminary incubation counts were positively associated with the amount of soiling on the teats prior to udder preparation, manual cleaning of the bulk tank, and the use of a specific type of detergent. Additionally, various methods of premilking udder preparation were important, with <b>pre-dip</b> followed by drying being superior to other methods in reducing the bacterial counts. The laboratory pasteurization count was positively associated with the presence of a plate cooler and inadequate frequency of acid wash, whereas having a water purification system was negatively associated with laboratory pasteurization count. Finally, coliform count was negatively associated with clipping udder hair and automated washing of the bulk tank, whereas increasing herd size and inadequate frequency of acid wash were risk factors.

If a grower can effectively remove any existing phylloxera on new plants, the rate of spread of phylloxera. in Oregon vineyards will be significantly decreased. The objectives {{of this study are}} to determine methods for dipping of young self-rooted and grafted vines (nursery stock) that will eradicate existing phylloxera populations without causing plant damage. In November, 1993, an initial hot water dip study involved dipping all life stages of phylloxera and five different rootstocks (not grafted) in 125 °F water for 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 minutes. Three root pieces with established populations of eggs, nymphs, and adults were dipped for each time treatment. After the heat treatment, the root pieces were placed in petri dishes and stored in an incubator. Data on percent survival for each life stage and amount of time to kill all life stages were collected. The results showed that all life stages were killed at the five minute dip in 125 °F water. The five rootstocks studied were Pinot Noir, 5 C, 101 - 14, 3309 C, and Freedom. The dormant plants were removed from their pots, washed free of soil, and pruned to 4 buds and 6 " root length. Control plants were dipped in 70 °F for 10 minutes (5 minutes as a <b>pre-dip</b> and 5 minutes for the time needed to eradicate the insect).

40|$|In Belgium, {{the main}} {{economic}} penalty accounted for bovine milk quality is the bulk milk somatic cell count geometric mean over 3 months reaching more than 400, 000 cells/ml. Yet, {{it is still}} difficult to make progress on udder health and milk quality because regional risks related to endemic farming practices are not broadly known. Hence, {{a first step in}} understanding specific udder health risks associated with herd management has to be a broad ecopathological survey. A random stratified sample of 349 dairy farms, representing 25 % of producers registered for performance recording, was selected with a total of 16, 000 cows. Thorough audits recording 400 farming practices were made in each farm by 2 different surveyors during milking. The practices were recorded across four categories: Herd structure, Housing, Milking practices and Herd Management (including Nutrition). Our chosen variable was the geometric mean of the herd composite somatic cell count from the last three months compared to the 400, 000 cells/ml European threshold. The sample had a mean somatic cell count of 287, 000 cells/ml following a normal distribution between 73, 000 and 807, 000 cells/ml. From 19 risk indicators identified through univariate logistic analysis (p< 0. 15), half were related to milking practices and 5 were underlined by significant odds-ratios (OR) found through multivariate logistic analysis (p< 0. 05). Therefore, it was found that cubicle housing had the least risk (OR= 0. 59 compared with tightened stalls, OR= 0. 42 compared with straw stalls); Presence of a calving pen (OR= 0. 40), use of post-dipping (OR= 0. 50) had a positive impact; whereas <b>pre-dip</b> had a negative impact in our study (OR= 3) though it was not clear if this routine was performed correctly. Stripping also had a bad impact on milk quality whether it was systematic (OR = 1. 90) or occasional (OR = 2. 43). It was also found that farms with poor milking liner hygiene had more trouble (OR = 2. 34). The results were comparable to other ecopathological studies such as northern and southern American and European studies. This study is a prerequisite in operational veterinary advice in southern Belgium dairy farms, because it provides a cross-sectional study of dairy practices and states on major epidemiological risk factors in dairy management for this region.

Wood samples tested included three acacia and one eucalypts wood species which were grouped into sapwood and heartwood containing samples. Wood samples fastened with metal screws were freely suspended in glass jars that contained 25 ml of sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to keep the humidity rate above 90 %.

Corrosion rates of metal screws fastened in eucalypts wood sample as indicated by the screw-weight loss (i. e. 5. 8 %) was more severe than that fastened in acacia wood. Furthermore, corrosion rate of metal screws as fixed firmly in sapwood sample proceeded faster than that in heartwood. This might be caused by the higher moisture content in sapwood. On the other hand, corrosion rate of the screws as fastened in waterborne-preser vative-treated wood samples was greater than that in non-preser ved wood due to electrokinetic characteristics and ionic potential exhibited by the preser vative thereby intensif ying the screw-corrosion process.

These surface waves were found to have velocities which are significantly lower than the corresponding c - Si velocity, and, for samples of a given set, decreased with increasing porosity, ξ. Removal of the thin native oxide film present on low porosity p⁺ type samples by an HF dip, results in a 3 %- 6 % decrease in surface acoustic wave velocity compared to <b>pre-dip</b> values. Adsorbed water on the porous silicon surface appears to have no measurable effect on the surface acoustic wave velocity.

40|$|A stratified-random {{sample of}} 48 Ohio dairy herds {{participated in a}} 1 -year disease {{monitoring}} survey to study herd management and environmental conditions affecting udder infection and clinical mastitis incidence. The mean monthly bulk-tank somatic cell count {{was used as an}} indicator of overall udder infection. Clinical incidence was determined by monthly on-farm interviews with the dairy producers. Management and environmental conditions were assessed by direct observation as well as by personal interview of dairy managers. The final multivariable analysis-of-variance model of log bulk-tank somatic cell count had an R 2 value of 0. 43. Lower log bulk-tank somatic cell count was found in herds with hired milkers, a clean and dry cow exercise area, clean teats following milking and fewer milking cows. The number of months spent on pasture was also significant. The final model for clinical mastitis incidence had an R 2 value of 0. 38. Less clinical mastitis was found on farms where straw bedding was used, <b>pre-dip</b> was not used, where there were fewer cows, fewer person-hours per cow were spent milking cows, a greater percentage of calvings occurred in the designated calving facility, and cows spent fewer months per year on pasture. Other potentially important disease determinants could not be included in the final models because of limited sample size relative to the model degrees of freedom (six each).

PhysicsBibliography: p. 97 - 104 Brillouin {{spectroscopy}} Has {{been used}} to investigate the elastic properties of (111) -oriented π - Si samples formed from p- and p+ type c - Si substrates. In the frequency regime studied, Brillouin spectra of low porosity (28 %- 40 %) p+ samples consist of a single set of inelastic peaks due to the surface acoustic wave. These surface waves {{were found to have}} velocities which are significantly lower than the corresponding c - Si velocity, and, for samples of a given set, decreased with increasing porosity, ξ. Removal of the thin native oxide film present on low porosity p+ type samples by an HF dip, results in a 3 %- 6 % decrease in surface acoustic wave velocity compared to <b>pre-dip</b> values. Adsorbed water on the porous silicon surface appears to have no measurable effect on the surface acoustic wave velocity.

40|$|Purpose] Mastitis {{is a very}} {{important}} disease in dairy farming. In Ohotsuku, Japan, Staphylococcus aureus (SA) mastitis incidence increased after the introduction of anonymous post-dipping Iodine-based product A. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the association between the product A and the disease increase. [Materials and methods] The dairy cows monitoring data for 5 farms using product A and 4 farms using another anonymous Iodine-based product B in the dairy farms which belong to Ohotsuku Farmers’ Association and encountered with SA mastitis incidence were used for this analysis. Farming style (tie or free stall), pre-milking teat disinfectant (2 products) and post-dipping products were selected as explanatory variables. The incidence of SA mastitis on each teat between April 2005 and March 2007 was selected as a response variable. In univariate analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with Poisson errors were used for the explanatory variables. In multivariable analysis, as the incidence of SA mastitis on each teat could be affected by the intra-class correlation at two levels: animal and farm levels, robust variance using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) was performed in statistical software R 2. 13. 1. The explanatory variables with the p-values less than 0. 2 in the univariate analyses were selected for GEE and step-wise model simplification was performed. [Results] In univariate analysis, there was no significant difference in mean SA mastitis annual incidence per teat between tie (0. 025) and free stall (0. 028, p= 0. 53) or between two <b>pre-dipping</b> products (0. 022 and 0. 029, p= 0. 08). However, the mean annual incidence was significantly higher in teats which post-dipping product A was used (0. 035) than those which product B was used (0. 015, p< 0. 001). In multivariable analysis, only the use of post-dipping product A was significantly associated with the annual incidence (p< 0. 001). [Discussion] In the present study, only the post-dipping product was associated with the SA mastitis incidence among farming style, pre and post dipping products. Change of post-dipping product and economic evaluation after the intervention would be recommended to the farms with increased incidence...|$|R
40|$|A pele da teta é uma das principais fontes de contaminação microbiana do leite cru, além de ser uma fonte de infecção da glândula mamária. Este estudo comparou diferentes métodos de preparação do úbere, incluindo a participação do bezerro para estimular a descida do leite, em relação à contaminação microbiana da pele da teta. Um experimento com 36 vacas ordenhadas mecanicamente foi conduzido para comparar três procedimentos (A, B, C) de preparação do úbere. Duas tetas de cada vaca foram amostradas para contagem total de bactérias (CTB) e de coliformes, antes e após lavagem com água e secagem com papel toalha descartável (A); procedimento A, mais imersão das tetas em solução de iodo (4. 000 ppm) e secagem com papel toalha descartável (B); higienização com toalha de papel embebida em solução desinfetante contendo clorexidina (C). O segundo experimento incluiu 16 vacas ordenhadas manualmente, na presença do bezerro. Permitiu-se a cada bezerro mamar as quatro tetas por alguns segundos, de acordo com o manejo do rebanho. Amostras para bacteriologia de duas tetas de cada vaca foram coletadas, antes, após a mamada do bezerro, e após higienização semelhante ao procedimento C, citado acima. Os tratamentos foram analisados usando-se o teste não- paramétrico de Kruskal-Wallis, considerando-se os dados de tCTB após o uso de um dos métodos de preparação do úbere ou da mamada do bezerro. Usou-se a transformação das contagens bacterianas para a escala logarítmica em base 10, com a fórmula tCTB=log 10 (CTB+ 0, 5). Para os grupos A, B e C (primeiro experimento), os valores médios de diminuição de tCTB foram 1, 8, 2, 2 e 2, 4, respectivamente. No segundo experimento, as CTB's aumentaram significativamente (P The teat skin {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{microbial}} contamination of raw milk as well as a source of mastitis infection. This study assessed the microbial load of the teat skin following the application of the different practices for preparing the udder, including the use of calf suckling to stimulate the letdown of milk. Thirty-six cows milked by machine were included in one experiment. Two teats of each cow were sampled for bacteriology before and after using one of three methods of udder preparation, as follows: rinsing with water and drying with single paper towels (A); method A plus <b>pre-dipping</b> with an iodine teat dip (4, 000 ppm) and drying with single paper towels (B); wiping teats using a commercial wet non-woven wipe pre-soaked with a solution containing chlorexidine (C). The second experiment included 16 cows milked by hand. The calf of each cow was allowed to suck the four teats for a few seconds, and then two teats per cow were sampled for bacteriology. Samples were collected before, after calf sucking and following teat pre-milking treatment (as for group C, above). Statistical analysis was conducted on transformed (log 10) data with tTBC=log 10 (TBC+ 0. 5) using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Each treatment was analysed considering the difference in tTBC after the use of either method of preparation of the udder or calf sucking. For groups A, B and C (first experiment), tTBC values were reduced 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 4, respectively. In the second experiment, tTBC increased significantly (P< 0, 05) after calf sucking (from 3. 2 to 4. 3). After disinfection the tTBC was significantly reduced to 2. 0. These results show that: (a) teat rinsing with water and wiping dry reduces the number of microorganisms on the teat skin, but the reduction is significantly higher when teats are disinfected; (b) calf sucking before milking increases significantly the number of microorganisms on teat skin; (c) the number of microorganisms on teat skin can be reduced more than 10 times after calf sucking if teats are disinfected. Very low numbers or no growth of coliforms were observed in all cases...|$|R
40|$|Mastitis causes largest {{economic}} losses in dairy production. Sub-clinical mastitis is detected in 50 % of lactating cows in Lithuania. Curing effect is transient if major causes and factors of mastitis are not eliminated. Prophylactic measures are directed {{to strengthen the}} immune system of the cow and to define and to eliminate all factors causing mastitis. Bacteria are present on skin of the teat in the surroundings. Use of antiseptics of cow teats before and after milking {{is the most effective}} preventive procedure that can prevent from new mastitis cases. Antiseptic solutions help to fight most opportunistic and contagious bacterial infections causing mastitis. Teat antiseptics can reduce mastitis incidence by 50 to 75 %. It is recommended to use antiseptic solutions for udder and teats, as they improve physical condition of the udder and milk quality. Agents for udder and teat antiseptics contain bactericidal, skin protecting components in aqueous solution. Bactericidal activity is defined to kill germs during chemical and biological reactions. Active ingredients are iodoforms, chlorhexidins, sodium hypochloride, sodium chloride, lactic acid, hypochloric acid, antimicrobial proteins and fatty acids. Teat dipping reduces bacterial milk contamination, and spreading of pathogens on the teats during the milking. For the present moment this procedure is also used in Europe. Spraying teats with two different concentrations of iodine solution before and after the milking effectively reduces skin contamination with staphylococcal and colliform bacteria. Action of <b>pre-dip</b> and post-dip is similar. The aim of our investigation was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} antiseptic materials used before and after milking on bulk milk bacterial contamination, somatic cell count and incidences of sub-clinical mastitis. We selected in farm No. 1, cows with 500 000 103 /ml somatic cell count. In this farm antiseptic teat dipping was routinely used after milking. In this farm we also used disincentive wood shave for udder cleansing. Udders were cleansed before each milking using 5 to 10 g. disincentive wood shave soaked in water. No significant changes were observed after the use of this udder cleansing method. At the start of the experiment in Farm No. 1, total bacterial count was 57. 33 ± 9. 45 103 /ml. and 7 days following the treatment decreased to 49. 11 ± 9. 45 103 /ml. One month after the treatment total bacterial count was 43. 67 ± 7. 82 103 /ml (p> 0. 5). These changes in were not statistically significant. Somatic cell count was 507. 89 ± 47. 40 103 /ml. One month after the treatment somatic cell count was 199. 33 ± 41. 69 103 /ml (p> 0. 1). These changes in were not statistically In farm No. 2, no antiseptic substances were used before the experiment. Before each milking, udders were routinely cleaned with damp towels. At the start of the experiment, udders were cleansed with disincentive wood shave and teats were dipped following the milking. At the start of the experiment, the results were worse – total bacterial count increased, as well as somatic cell count. Microbial contamination of udder was higher at the start of the experiment, compared to the end. At the start of use of antiseptic substances, bacterial udder contamination significantly decreased, and this resulted in decreased milk bacterial contamination and milk somatic cell count. At the start of the experiment in Farm No. 1, total bacterial count was 46. 33 ± 8. 23 103 /ml. and 7 days following the treatment decreased to 40. 21 ± 7. 33 103 /ml. One month after the treatment total bacterial count was 35. 24 ± 7. 82 103 /ml (p> 0, 5). These changes in were not statistically significant. Somatic cell count was 340. 0 ± 36. 93 103 /ml. One month after the treatment somatic cell count was 122. 17 ± 12. 08 103 /ml (p> 0. 1). These changes in were not statistically Wood shave was used for udder cleaning in the farm. Many farms use this cleaning method for the present time. It is very effective to remove rests of bedding and manure from the teats. It is enough 5 to 10 g. of wood shave to clean udder ant teats. The shave can also be soaked with antiseptic solution. One more advantage is that teat cleansing with wood shave more intensively stimulates milk let-down. We, however, did not observe an increase in milk production during our experiment, but this cleansing method had positive effect reducing bacterial contamination of udder. Analysis data shows that antiseptic materials must be used before and after the milking, because teat canal is open 30 min. after the milking...|$|E
