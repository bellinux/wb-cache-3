According to Lopez, it is about when you are at a bad bad <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> and {{somebody}} comes in and makes you believe in love again. She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before".

Leto described [...] "Up in the Air" [...] as a passionate and energetic song that [...] "feels really free" [...] but also features the concept of constraint and tension, particularly evident in the line [...] "I'll wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love". Leto explained that the lyric plays on two different levels, giving a sexual connotation to the line, but also the idea of power and control. He further said that the song [...] "has to do with getting to a <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> where you're ready {{to let go of}} the past, embrace change and become more of who you really are".|$|E

[...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track.

5000|$|Terri Clark {{wrote the}} song while on {{vacation}} in Hawaii, describing it as [...] "the most personal song she'd ever written."

5000|$|On {{the meaning}} of the song, Meisner said in the {{documentary}} History of the Eagles: [...] "The line 'take it to the limit' was to keep trying before you reach a <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> where you feel you've done everything and seen everything, sort of feeling, you know, part of getting old. And just {{to take it to the}} limit one more time, like every day just keep, you know, punching away at it ... That was the line, and from there the song took a different course." ...|$|E

Using frameworks for reflection can help you {{to focus on what}} is important to you in the here and now. In this way, you can use your experience to apply ‘practical wisdom’ in new contexts, so that transitions become easier over time...|$|R

5000|$|Dana Stevens of Slate also praised {{both the}} leads, commenting that [...] "Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley {{have such a}} disarmingly direct and {{spontaneous}} connection as actors that Sutter and Aimee almost immediately come to seem like a couple you've known (or been part of) at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life...</b> The Spectacular Now captures the beauty and scariness and lacerating intensity of first love". Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman described it as [...] "one of the rare truly soulful and authentic teen movies." [...] He compared it favorably to Say Anything... and The Perks of Being a Wallflower, saying [...] "like them, it's a movie about {{the experience of being}} caught on the cusp and truly not knowing which way you'll land." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 26 January 1984, Siva Shankar {{was present}} at an annual Abhishekam for Lord Muruga of Ratnagiri temple, crying {{continuously}} for over an hour. Balamurugan Swami then wrote a note to Siva Shankar: “Within this month-end {{there will be a}} welcome turning <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> God’s blessings”. After reaching Chennai, that same night, (in the early hours, c. 3:30 AM) Siva Shankar reported that Raghavendra Swami of Mantralaya appeared physically before him, giving him a vision of his own dead body, by separating the body from the soul (out-of-body experience). This was the same experience Venkatraman had before he became Bala Ramana Maharishi. This experience is also predicted in the Siva Shankar's Sahadeva Nadi, which says [...] "The body and soul were separated and the soul saw the body.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Over my {{many years}} of learning, iterating, and teaching, I’ve arrived at the {{conclusions}} {{that the process of}} learning, as humans, can be abused, tuned, and scaled easily.There comes a specific <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> where you can reach or obtain near mastery of one specific subject. After that, there’s a base of knowledge that you can (and will) build analogies on. By doing so, you take one industry and mirror it into another industry.I would emphasize, you can not be a jack-of-all-trades without being a master of at least one.Perhaps it is social skill, doll making, mathematics, language, emotional awareness—you must be a master of at least one in order to be a jack of many others...Mastery of one trade can be converted into a catalyst for learning other fields. You have something to pull from, complex ideas you can pattern match, and metaphoric analogies that can complete a picture.The more you learn, the faster you learn.|$|E

5000|$|The song {{is about}} moments in one's life where quitting {{appears to be}} the only option. As Folds explains: Well, that's one of the images that hit me. It came from a guy who was riding the bus from college to work and he kind of was losing his shit at the time and he had the bus driver pull over and let him off and he ended up in Ireland trying to find U2. He's in and out of halfway homes and he's schizophrenic. What fascinated me was not that he was schizophrenic, but that at any <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> you can just quit. You can quit {{anything}} you want to. And I thought it was kind of dramatic, the idea of going, [...] "Stop the bus." [...] Everyone has to see you stop everything, and everybody has to stop with you and they let you off. I pulled the name Jackson from someone I knew who I thought worked too hard and the Cannery was a hosiery mill in North Carolina. So I just mixed the names up and I think the defining line in that song would be, [...] "When seconds pass slowly and years go flying by." [...] You know, just that every moment's a fucking drag and you look back and everything passed just in a second.|$|E

The guiding question was: At this <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> how do you feel? Tell me. Results. The elderly who were satisfied stated that this was due to the good relationship with their family, spouse, to the fact of having autonomy and respect from the society. Those who were shown to be dissatisfied reported lack of family support, physical limitations imposed by age and the presence of illnesses as the main causes. Conclusion.

40|$|You {{have reached}} that <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> where a change is needed. Perhaps {{you have been}} contemplating an upgrade to your skill set, a new degree or certificate, {{additional}} credentials or even a completely new career. The world of higher education has changed significantly even {{in the last few}} years and there are many more options for adult/returning students. Hybrid and online degrees and courses offer a particularly flexible alternative for those with jobs and family responsibilities or who are in rural areas not served by large universities. Savvy universities now recognize that women students want a sense of community in their courses and are looking for informal learning spaces, mentoring and support services as well as the opportunity to apply their skills and talents towards activities that contribute to the betterment of society as well as to increasing their incomes. This special session at InWIC is designed to offer insights, practical tips and encouragement to anyone who is thinking about – or in the process of – pursing additional education. The co-presenters will offer their personal experiences in navigating the financial, logistical and emotional/psychological issues involved in being an adult/returning student and will provide a number of useful resources for addressing these issues. The session will include time for participants to share their own experiences and to form a network for support in the future. Success is within your grasp, but in order to have smooth sailing, enjoy the view on the way down and not crash to the ground, you need a parachute – a plan for how you will address the risks, meet the challenges and maximize the opportunities and experiences that higher education presents. This InWIC session is intended to help you begin to prepare your plan...|$|E
