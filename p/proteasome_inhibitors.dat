Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E

500|$|Proteasome {{inhibition}} {{has different}} effects on apoptosis induction in different cell types.

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate whether proteasome activity is related with apoptosis in VSMCs by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Rat aorta smooth muscle cells were treated with TNF-α and <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> MG 132 and then cell death was determined by morphology, viability, and DNA fragmentation. MG 132 or TNF-α alone did not induce cell death. In contrast, co-treatment of TNF-α and <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> induced death and DNA degradation in VSMCs, suggesting <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> enhanced death activity of TNF-α. The death was not blocked by ascorbic acid but by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Both caspase- 3 and - 8 were activated during the death by the <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> and TNF-α. The death was effectively blocked by the caspase- 3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk, suggesting a role of caspase- 3 in the death. Nonetheless, there were no significant alterations in the level of Bcl- 2, Bcl-XL, Bax and Bak by the <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> nor any evidence of cytochrome (cyt) c release into cytosol from dying cells, suggesting that cyt c is not involved.

40|$|Oxidative stress, {{generated}} by chronic ethanol consumption, {{is a major}} cause of hepatotoxicity and liver injury. Increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals due to ethanol metabolism by CYP 2 E 1 is principally located in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria, which does not only injure liver cells, but also other vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} better treatment to enhance the antioxidant response elements. To date, there is no established treatment to attenuate high levels of oxidative stress in the liver of alcoholic patients. To block this oxidative stress, <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> treatment has been found to significantly enhance the antioxidant response elements of hepatocytes exposed to ethanol. Recent studies have shown in an experimental model of alcoholic liver disease that <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> treatment at low dose has cytoprotective effects against ethanol-induced oxidative stress and liver steatosis. The beneficial effects of <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> treatment against oxidative stress occurred because antioxidant response elements (glutathione peroxidase 2, superoxide dismutase 2, glutathione synthetase, glutathione reductase, and GCLC) were up-regulated when rats fed alcohol were treated with a low dose of PS- 341 (Bortezomib, Velcade®). This is an important finding because <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> treatment up-regulated reactive oxygen species removal and glutathione recycling enzymes, while ethanol feeding alone down-regulated these antioxidant elements. For the first time, it was shown that proteasome inhibition by a highly specific and reversible inhibitor is different from the chronic ethanol feeding-induced proteasome inhibition. As previously shown by our group, chronic ethanol feeding causes a complex dysfunction in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which affects the proteasome system, as well as the ubiquitination system. The beneficial effects of <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> treatment in alcoholic liver disease are related to <b>proteasome</b> <b>inhibitor</b> reversibility and the rebound of proteasome activity 72 h post PS- 341 administration...|$|R
