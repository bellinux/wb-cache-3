40|$|Objectives: The {{explosive}} {{and ongoing}} injecting drug use-related HIV- 1 epidemic in Vancouver continues to receive international attention. This {{study was conducted}} to determine how patterns of cocaine use influence the risk of HIV infection. Methods: The Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study is an open prospective cohort of injecting drug users that began in May 1996. At enrollment and at semi-annual follow-up visits an interviewer administers a detailed semi-structured questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine behavioral and drug use patterns reported in the 6 months prior to HIV seroconversion. Results: One-hundred and nine incident HIV infections have been observed during a mean follow-up of 31 months, from 940 HIV-seronegative participants. During the 6 months prior to seroconversion, predictors of HIV infection were injecting cocaine use [adjusted hazards ratio (AHR), 3. 72], incarceration (AHR, 2. 74), unstable housing (AHR, 2. 36), methadone maintenance treatment (AHR, 1. 98), and Aboriginal ethnicity (AHR, 1. 78). Injecting cocaine use was predictive of HIV infection in a dose-dependent fashion. Compared with infrequent cocaine users, participants who aver-aged more than three injections per day were seven times more likely to contract HIV. In addition, the time to HIV infection was accelerated among regular cocaine injectors independent of concurrent heroin use. Conclusions: Injecting cocaine use was a strong, dose-dependent predictor of HIV seroconversion in this <b>poly-drug</b> <b>using</b> population. Injection cocaine users remain particularly vulnerable to HIV infection and treatment options for cocaine dependenc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{on-going}} project aims {{to build}} an ontological model concerning recreational <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> and to use an agentbased simulation, SimUse, to test and verify related public policies. We consider drug-use (and even more so <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use)</b> to be a complex adaptive system {{that needs to be}} studied via a methodology able to describe such a dynamic and complex social phenomenon. To contextualize the complexity of <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> and highlight the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach to study this practice we will pay particular attention to justify our theoretical assertions and computational constructions by qualitative researches, statistical surveys and/or theoretical concepts. The description of the different levels composing the structure of drug use and the dynamics between these levels leads us to consider an ontological approach as the best way to capture and encapsulate <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use.</b> We will describe the global structure of our simulation via an UML diagram as well as the way we want to model the decision process concerning drug consumption. We finish with an illustration of tests that can be run with SimUse: this example presents results of different law enforcement policies and their consequences for decision-makers.

40|$|Magic mushrooms, {{more than}} any other psychoactive substance, are steeped in mythology. Since their (re) {{discovery}} by the West in the mid- 20 th Century they have been constructed as spiritual sacraments, recreational drugs, psychological tools and gateways to metaphysical realities (Letcher 2007). Each of these conceptions represents multiple and competing discourses which constitute magic mushrooms and the experiences they occasion. In this thesis I address how these multiple and competing discourses are utilised and negotiated by people who consume magic mushrooms in the contemporary social world. Data was generated for this study through active interviews, combing narrative and semi-structured styles, which were conducted in person, via Skype and by telephone. Twenty three participants (7 female, 16 male; aged 19 - 60) were recruited to the study representing varied styles and frequencies of magic mushroom use; from psychedelic enthusiast ‘psychonauts’ to more casual <b>poly-drug</b> users. <b>Using</b> Foucauldian Discourse Analysis I explore the discourses participants mobilised and negotiated in constructing accounts of the meanings surrounding magic mushrooms. Analysis focused upon three key aspects of magic mushrooms, their use and the experiences they occasion: ‘what magic mushrooms do’; how participants conceptualised the ways they ‘alter reality’, ‘what magic mushrooms are’; ‘natural’ drugs or beings with agency, and ‘what magic mushrooms are for’; recreation or spiritual improvement. In addition I explore the relationships between discourses; how magic mushroom users construct new and complex understandings by negotiating, wrestling, and playing with available discourses, to make sense of experiences which often appear ineffable and bizarre. In exploring these discourses and the relationships between them, participants constructed magic mushrooms in three broad ways: as ‘just drugs’ as ‘drugs of distinction’ and as ‘neo-shamanic sacraments’. I discuss these ways of conceptualising magic mushrooms in light of the dominant neo-liberal order and the limited potential of magic mushrooms to provide a counter-cultural alternative...|$|R
40|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a {{stimulant}} {{drug that}} produces effects similar to amphetamines (Campbell, Cline, Evans, Lloyd, & Peck, 1973). It {{has been sold}} legally in New Zealand {{in the form of}} 'party pills' since 2000. The legal status of BZP party pills has been debated in New Zealand as the media reported cases of apparent overdoses and adverse reactions leading to hospitalization (Brogden, 2005; Crewdson, 2007; Reiber, 2005; Rankin, 2006). Representatives of the BZP party pill industry publicly defended their product claiming that BZP party pills were reducing substance related harm by reducing illicit substance use (Bowden, 2007 b, p. 1). They also claimed that banning BZP would result in an increase in use of illicit substances, especially methamphetamine or 'P' (Barnett, 2007). The overall aim of this thesis is to test the claims that BZP party pills reduce substance related harm by reducing illicit substance use, and to identify potential outcomes of a BZP party pill ban. In addition, the perceived risks of party pill and other drug use will be examined. In chapter one I review key concepts relating to BZP party pill use: recreational drug use, harm reduction, and risk perception. In chapter two the history and New Zealand context of BZP party pills are reviewed. In chapter three, study one qualitatively analyzes BZP party pill marketing material in an attempt to describe the culture and discourse promoted by the BZP party pill industry. This analysis demonstrated that BZP party pills were primarily marketed as part of a recreational drug using culture. In chapter four, study two quantitatively investigated whether BZP party pill use was associated with reduced levels of illicit substance use in a sample (N= 796) of first year university students. This study also examined the relationship between risk perception and frequency of substance use. Study two demonstrated that BZP party pill users are generally recreational <b>poly-drug</b> users who <b>used</b> illicit substances equally as often as illicit users who did not use BZP party pills. BZP party pills did not appear to reduce illicit substance use, and therefore harm. For the majority of substances there was no significant relationship between risk and use behaviour. The legal status of substances appeared to be important when participants rated the risks of use. Legal substances (including BZP) tended to be rated as safer than illegal substances. In chapter five, study three qualitatively analyzed 60 interviews with regular BZP party pill users to identify potential outcomes of a BZP party pill ban. A combination of alternatives were likely to be used by BZP party pill users, primarily illicit substances, especially ecstasy, as well as alcohol, and black market BZP. However methamphetamine (P) was an unpopular alternative. Study three also analyzed how BZP party pill users assess {{the costs and benefits of}} BZP party pill use. Decisions to use BZP party pills relied heavily on the benefits of use, rather than the costs.

40|$|Crack cocaine first {{appeared}} in German drug markets during the mid- 1990 s. For several years the drug could only be found in Frankfurt and Hamburg, major cities with large open drug scenes and well-established transportation infrastructures (these cities contain the largest airport and the biggest harbor in Germany). More recently, however, crack cocaine {{has been found in}} other cities as well. Police and drug treatment service data suggest {{that there has been a}} continuous, although not dramatic, increase in its use. Crack use is typically part of a <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> pattern (used in combination with heroin, benzodiazepines, methadone and alcohol) in metropolitan areas. Most users are well known to the institutions providing counseling and basic care (contact and sleeping houses and methadone treatment centers), and to the police. In addition to well-known members of the visible/open drug scene, three other groups are using crack: marginalized juveniles, young male and female prostitutes and young migrants. At present there is no research data indicating whether these groups have established a stable pattern of use or if they are drifting into a <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> pattern.

40|$|Background: Among illicit drugs, the {{prevalence}} of amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use {{is second only to}} cannabis. Currently, there are no approved pharmacotherapies for ATS problems, but some face-to-face psychotherapies are effective. Web-based interventions have proven to be effective for some substance use problems, but none has specifically targeted ATS users. Objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of a Web-based intervention for ATS problems on a free-to-access site compared with a waitlist control group. Methods: We used a randomized controlled trial design. The primary outcome measure was self-reported ATS use in the past three months assessed using the Alcohol, Smoking, Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). Other measures included quality of life (EUROHIS score), psychological distress (K- 10 score), days out of role, <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use,</b> general help-seeking intentions, actual help-seeking, and "readiness to change". The intervention consisted of three fully automated, self-guided modules based on cognitive behavioral therapy and motivation enhancement. The analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis using generalized estimating equation models, with a group by time interaction as the critical assessment. Results: We randomized 160 people (intervention n= 81, control n= 79). At three months, 35 / 81 (43 %) intervention and 45 / 79 (57 %) control participants provided follow-up data. In the intervention group, 51 / 81 (63 %) completed at least one module. The only significant group by time interaction was for days out of role. The pre/post change effect sizes showed small changes (range d= 0. 14 to 0. 40) favoring the intervention group for <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use,</b> distress, actual help-seeking, and days out of role. In contrast, the control group was favored by reductions in ATS use, improvements in quality of life, and increases in help-seeking intentions (range d= 0. 09 to 0. 16). Conclusions: This Web-based intervention for ATS use produced few significant changes in outcome measures. There were moderate, but nonsignificant reductions in <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use,</b> distress, days partially out of role, and increases in help-seeking. However, high levels of participant attrition, plus low levels of engagement with the modules, preclude firm conclusions being drawn on the efficacy of the intervention and emphasize the problems of engaging this group of clients in a fully automated program...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The study regards n. 267 drug related deaths {{submitted}} to toxicological analyses for forensic purpose, since 2008 to 2012, at the Laboratory of Forensic Toxicology of the Second University of Napoli (SUN), Italy. Among the cases studied (94 % males and 6 % females) the 13. 1 % regards foreign citizens. METHODS: For each case autopsy findings and all drugs detected were recorded. In addition other epidemiological data such as age, race, gender, place and circumstance of death were also supplied. A systematic toxicological analysis (STA) for illicit drug, other pharmaceuticals, new psychotropic substances and ethanol {{has been applied}} on the specimens collected at autopsy and all positive results were confirmed by a quantitative analysis (GC/MS or LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Toxicological results shows that simultaneous use of multiple illicit drugs was responsible of the largest mortality rate (57. 7 %), in both males and females. In the <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> the cocaine was the most detected substance. The association of heroin/cocaine was identified in the 22. 5 % of deaths. The finding of only one drug was correlated with an opiate drug for the 14. 2 % and with cocaine for the 4. 5 % of cases. The distribution by age and gender demonstrates an increase in deaths among males aged over 30 years and among women older than 35 years. The territorial distribution of the deaths in the different surrounding areas and in the residential quarters of the Naples city demonstrates that the 76 % of deaths occurred in a place different from the usual residence. CONCLUSION: Results obtained demonstrate that prevails, at present, the need to specifically explore the changing patterns of <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> among addicts, because studying the prevalence of mortality subsequent to the consumption of a single illicit drug may be insufficient to guide preventive policies in public health...|$|E

40|$|There were 3, 316 {{healthcare}} interventions by the Merchants Quay Primary Health Care Services in 2012, in {{line with}} figures from the previous year. The healthcare service operated by Merchants Quay Ireland (MQI) {{in partnership with the}} HSE, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and SafetyNet provided medical, nursing, dental and counselling care to people affected by homelessness and drug use. In 2012, two sessional GPs dealt with around 1, 000 consultations or 83 per month. Some 509 unique clients utilised the GP service, presenting with a variety of acute and chronic illnesses, according to the MQI Annual Review 2012 launched recently by Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton TD. Some 735 counselling sessions were held in 2012, while a total of 1, 586 nursing interventions took place, or 132 per month. The drop-in nurse-led clinic provided a full range of primary health services such as wound care management, blood testing, sexual health, medication management and women’s and men’s health services. Mental health presentations ranged from acutely suicidal clients to those who needed to be referred back to services they have lost contact with. Referrals to tertiary services such as emergency departments and other hospitals and advocacy were {{a large part of the}} nursing role. According to MQI, <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> remained a prevalent trend with some 75 per cent of Needle Exchange users reporting use of multiple substances. A combination of heroin, benzodiazepines and alcohol was the most common presenting issue at MQI’s services nationwide in 2012. MQI Chief Executive Tony Geoghegan told IMT that proposals included in the Draft Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations 2013 “should make a difference” in terms of reducing availability of drugs such as benzodiazepines, but he said “treatment services have to adjust” to the complexities presented by <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use.</b> The needle exchange service in Dublin recorded over 20, 800 client visits, showing an increase of almost 2, 000 visits on 2011. There was also an increase of people from outside Dublin accessing MQI’s residential services. “Demand for our homeless and drugs services is growing, yet finances are contracting,” said Geoghegan. “We call on the Government to honour their commitment to social justice and maintain services that protect the most vulnerable men and women in Ireland. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} pathways ‘out of home ’ were identified, namely {{young people with}} a Care History, those having experienced an Abusive Family Situation, those affected by Family Conflict and those reporting ‘Problematic ’ Behaviour as teenagers. One-third of the sample reported a Care pathway into homelessness. This group was most strongly represented amongst those who were accessing adult hostel provision. There was considerable diversity {{in the range of}} accommodation types accessed by the young people, from that provided by social services to the private rented sector. A considerable number had spent time in prisons and/or in psychiatric hospitals. The under- 18 s did have access to age-appropriate accommodation but on reaching the age of 18 years many were forced to use adult hostels. The transition from children’s to adult’s services emerged as a critical marker of more persistent homelessness. High levels of mental health difficulties were reported by the study’s young people, from depression, loneliness and social isolation to self-injury, suicide attempts and suicidal ideation.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether use of crystal methamphetamine increases HIV risk behaviors beyond the {{risk associated with}} use of other recreational drugs among Hispanic {{men who have sex}} with men (HMSM). Design: We compared the sexual behaviors and psychosocial characteristics of non-recreational drug users (non-users), recreational drug users who did not use crystal (non-crystal drug users), and recreational drug users who used crystal (crystal users). Methods: We recruited 294 HMSMfrom Internet and 272 from community venues. Eligible men completed anACASI to assess socio-demographic factors, drug use, sexual behaviors and psychosocial factors and received $ 50. Results: In the multivariate model, crystal users were more likely than non-crystal drug users to have lower Hispanicism, higher attachment to the gay community, and history of suicide attempts. Crystal users were not significantly different from non-crystal drug users in number of sex partners; however, differences in unprotected receptive anal sex approached significance.

40|$|Introduction: Several {{studies have}} shown that {{individuals}} with drug dependence have poorer cognitive functioning in the domain of executive functions. Studies investigating cognitive impairments in people with <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> are limited. This study is designed to assess executive functions of patients with dual drug dependence (DDD) on opioid and (Amphetamine-Type Stimulants) ATS entering medication-assisted-treatment at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. Methodology: A total of n= 96 male respondents (n= 56 patients, and n= 40 control group) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Six neuropsychological tests (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, Trail Making Test, Raven’s Progressive Matrices, Digit Span Test, Digit Symbol Test, and Stroop Test) were administered. Findings: Results showed patients performed significantly worse in perceptual motor speed, and visual scanning measured by Trail Making Test Part A, cognitive flexibility measured by Trail Making Test Part B, mental processing speed measured by Digit Symbol Test, and response inhibition measured by Stroop Test, compared to those in the control group. Conclusion: Results suggests that perceptual motor speed, visual scanning, cognitive flexibility, mental processing speed, and response inhibition may be impaired in patients with dual drug dependence. Proper prevention and treatment interventions should consider addressing cognitive deficits for patients with dual dependenc...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Aim: The harmful {{consequences}} of amphetamine (including methamphetamine) misuse in Australia and internationally {{have been well}} documented. There has been surprisingly little exploration, however, {{of the role of}} opiate substitution therapy (OST), an evidence-based harm minimization strategy for opiate dependence, in eligible high-risk amphetamine users. Design and Methods: This survey study explored histories of substance use and dependence, and eligibility for OST, in a group of Queensland adult male ex-prisoners recently released into a residential supported parole program. Results: 57 % of participants were identified as high-risk amphetamine (HRA) users. Of these HRA users, 74 % were eligible for opiate substitution treatment under current Australian guidelines, and 59 % believed that suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone) maintenance would reduce their risks of going back to prison due to amphetamine use. Discussion and Conclusions: In recently released prisoners with a history of high-risk amphetamine use and opiate dependence, OST may be a strategy to reduce the harms of both opiate and amphetamine use. Further studies are needed to understand <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> in this population, and optimize the safety, effectiveness, and attractiveness of suboxone maintenance for these potential clients...|$|E

This analysis unveiled histories of <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> in seven of the cases under investigation. Moreover, the concentrations of morphine and codeine in the brain were also investigated, and the results were compared with the data obtained from the blood specimens. The concentration of morphine in blood ranged from 33 to 688 ng/mL, while the concentration of codeine ranged from 0 to 193 ng/mL. However, in the brain, the concentration of morphine was found to be between 85 and 396 ng/g, while the levels of codeine ranged from 11 to 160 ng/g. The codeine/morphine ratio in the blood ranged from 0. 043 to 0. 619; however, in the brain, the same ratio was found to be between 0. 129 and 0. 552.

40|$|Background: The {{transition}} out {{of prison}} {{is likely to be}} a challenging time for prisoners with intellectual disability (ID). However, little evidence exists to inform interventions for people with ID making this transition. In this study we aimed to describe social circumstances, patterns of substance use and substance-related harm in soon-to-be-released prisoners with ID. We compare this group with those without ID, to better understand how the healthrelated needs of this group compare with the 'mainstream' prison population. Methods: Data came from face-to-face, confidential interviews with 1325 adult prisoners in seven adult prisons in Queensland, Australia. Prisoners with ID were identified using the Hayes Ability Screening Index (HASI). We used cross-sectional data to examine (i) demographics and criminographics; (ii) social circumstances; and (iii) substance use and substance use related harm. We compared characteristics of those with and without ID using univariable logistic regression. Results: Prisoners with ID (n = 115) were more likely than their peers without ID to be male, to identify as Indigenous Australian, and to report low educational attainment (< 10 years) and preincarceration unemployment.

40|$|The {{development}} of new assessment and treatment protocols for Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) has been recently fostered by epidemiological data, which indicates that drug-related problems mainly peak in young age; moreover, there have been important changes in the phenomenon of drug addiction, which often involves early onset, <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> and the diffusion of new psychoactive drugs. An enhanced comprehension of the current manifestations of SUDs is the essential step to take, in order to inform and improve treatment programs targeting this clinical population. As a consequence, there is the strong need for assessment protocols that are age-appropriate and capable of addressing such a complex and multi-determined clinical condition. Reporting Adrian’s case, a young inpatient undergoing a residential community program, the present study illustrates the most salient features of SUD in young age. Secondly, the paper offers the opportunity to describe an innovative psychological assessment protocol (multi-focus, multi-informant, multi-method and longitudinal) and its connections with the clinical treatment level, over one-year long treatment. Thirdly, it allows some important considerations about which psychological domains and characteristics should be primarily considered by treatment programs targeting substance dependence for individuals in their teens or twenties...|$|E
40|$|Injecting {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{experience}} between 10 and 20 times higher mortality {{compared to the}} gen-eral population [1]. One of the {{main causes of death}} is overdose [2]. Commonly it is men in their early to mid- 30 s who have injected substances over many years who die from an overdose of injected heroin, often in combination with other substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines [3, 4]. Those who die from an overdose have often experienced previous non-fatal overdoses and are also likely to be out of treatment at the time of death [5 – 7]. The majority of these deaths occur at a residential address [8]. Certain factors, in combination with IV <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use,</b> increase vulnerability for drug-induced deaths. More frequent heroin use and heroin purity are two such factors, although purity is only found to have a moderate relationship to overdose [9, 10]. Homelessness or shelter use are other such factors [11, 12]. Also, recent prison release and dis-charge from drug-free in-patient treatment are particularly vulnerable times, since people are typ-ically in a state of low tolerance to opioids [13, 14]. Overall, there is a whole range of factors that alone or in combination increase the vulnerability for Diversity in causes and characteristics of drug-induced deaths in an urban settin...|$|E
40|$|Methods: We {{conducted}} a prospective, representative-sample nationwide study on morbidity related to 3, 4, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ‘ecstasy’) as determined from admissions to 5 geographically rep-resentative emergency departments (EDs) and from {{data from the}} poison information center (PIC). MDMA-related ED admissions were analyzed over a 7 -month period and the records of all PIC calls were reviewed. Results: There were 52 (age 15 – 44 years, 32 males) ecstasy-related ED admissions during the study period. Most (68 %) admissions presented to the ED at night, 52 % on weekends and 44 % consumed the drug at clubs and parties. Forty-six {{percent of the patients}} took between 1 / 2 to 3 tablets and 29 patients (56 %) had taken ecstasy before. Twenty-two subjects (42 %) reported <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use.</b> Fifteen subjects (29 %) required hospitali-zation, six of them (11 %) to the intensive care unit. The most common manifestations were restlessness, agita-tion, disorientation, shaking, high blood pressure, headache and loss of consciousness. More serious complications were hyperthermia, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, brain edema and coma. Conclusion: The image of ecstasy as a safe party drug is spurious. The results of this study confirm that the drug bears real dan-ger of physical harm and of behavioral, psychological and psychiatric disturbances...|$|E

40|$|The {{congruence}} between self reported {{drug use}} and urinalysis data among 89 consecutive opioid dependents at their first contact in an outpatient clinic was examined. For this purpose self reports of drug use within preceding 72 hr, laboratory analysis of urine samples by thin layer chromatography (TLC) were carried out for various drugs. The same samples were also confirmed by gas liquid chromatography (GL C). Many subjects reported concomitant <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use.</b> The base rate {{was found to be}} low for other drugs besides heroin. The conclusion could be dra wn more con vincingly as regard heroin use. Inaccuracy in self-report of drug use has been observed using GLC as a gold standard. The subjects {{are likely to be more}} accurate when they report abstinence than when reporting drug use. These results also suggest that clinicians should be cautious while prescribing agonist/ partial agonists especially based on only self-report for long term maintenance program, as many patients may not be really physiolologically dependent. Key words: Self-report, TLC, GLC, urine Reliance on self-report by drug users is the norm in treatment Centres. However, these are often inaccurate (Bale et al., 1981; Darke, 1998; Maddux & Desmond, 1975; Magura et al., 1987; Maisto et al., 1990; Sherman and Bigelow, 1992...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} drug use, injection practices, {{and sexual}} behaviour {{in a sample}} of 100 opioid users, {{both in and out of}} current opiate treatment. Approximately three-quarters of subjects reported that they had used more than one illicit substance in the month prior to being interviewed. Needle sharing was common, with 29 % of subjects having used a needle in the past month after it had been used by someone else, and 25 % having passed on a needle after they had used it. The level of condom use was low, with 66. 7 % of subjects never having used a condom with their regular partner in the month prior to interview, and 20. 7 % of subjects who had engaged in sex with a casual partner during this period not having used a condom. Variables which were predictive of HIV risk-taking behaviour in relation to needle use were <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use,</b> not being in current treatment, and level of heroin use. Only age was predictive of risky sexual behaviour, with younger subjects being associated with more risk-taking behaviour. It was concluded that while opiate treatment was associated with lower levels of risky injecting practices, there was no association between treatment and safer sexual practices. Given the importance of sexual transmission of HIV more attention needs to be given to the sexual risk-taking behaviour of intravenous drug users...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{protocol}} for an ongoing review. Brief Strategic Family Therapy is a manual-based family-oriented {{prevention and treatment}} intervention for young people’s drug use. BSFT is a problem focused family therapy, aiming at creating changes in interactions relevant to the identified problems within families, and in individual family members resisting changes. This review will specifically explore the family-based intervention Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) (Szapocznik, Hervis & Schwartz, 2003; Robbins & Szapocznik, 2000) as aggregated evidence for BSFT’s effects is needed. The review seeks to clarify {{the effects of the}} BSFT program for relevant groups of young people age 11 - 21. The review focus on young people enrolled in treatment for drug use, independent of how their problem is labeled. Enrolment in treatment means that the severity of the young person’s drug use has caused a significant adult close to the young person (teacher, parent, social services, school counselor, etc.) to require treatment. The intervention (BSFT) is delivered in outpatient treatment settings 3 to young people age 11 - 21 living with their family. The review will focus primarily on non-opioid drugs use. This review will be one in a series of reviews on manual-based family therapy interventions for young people in treatment for non-opioid drug use, and will consider <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use</b> if relevant...|$|E
40|$|AIMS – New {{trends in}} drug {{consumption}} reveal increasing polydrug use. Epidemiological indicators {{in the current}} use {{are based on the}} prevalence and the associated potential harm of a single “main” substance. We propose new indicators to evaluate frequency and potential harm of <b>poly-drug</b> <b>use.</b> The indicators are used to compare drug use among countries based on survey data on adolescents’ substance use in 38 European countries. METHODS – The approach is based on analysis of the frequency of use in the various population samples: lifetime use, twelve months use or last thirty days, depending on available data, and on the risk of harm for the substances used. Two indicators are provided: the frequency of use score (FUS) by summing the frequency of use of each substance, and the polydrug use score (PDS) that weight all the substances used by their risk. RESULTS – The indicators FUS and PDS were calculated and the distribution functions were used to characterise substance use across ESPAD countries. The analysis shows important differences in poly-substance use severity among countries presenting similar prevention policies. CONCLUSIONS – Systematic analysis of substance use and the related risk are of paramount interest. The proposed indicators are designed to better monitor and understand consequences of polydrug use and to measure the resulting risk at country or population level. The indicators may also be used to assess the effects of policy interventions...|$|E
