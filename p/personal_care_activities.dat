30|$|Our {{paper will}} be of {{interest}} to economists and policymakers given the current general interest in inequality, including in the field of health. Inequalities in health are increasing in Europe, leading to increased vulnerabilities in populations as well as increased differences in health behaviours and outcomes between population groups. Thus, there is an increasing interest of policy makers for health information, as shown by several projects initiated at the international level to analyse how health systems impact on inequality (see, for instance, the ‘Inequalities in health system performance and social determinants in Europe’ project being developed by the WHO/Europe, WHO/Europe Project). To the extent that leisure time has value (Kahneman et al, 2004; Kahneman and Krueger, 2006; Krueger, 2007, Sevilla et al., 2012), the evidence presented in this paper provides a promising line of research for understanding cross-country differences in well-being. Additionally, since unhealthy people work less and devote more time to <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities,</b> our results help to explain a possible source of income inequality, both at the individual and the country level.|$|E

40|$|Toothbrushing with toothpastes is an {{important}} <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activity</b> resulting in the removal of stains, food debris and plaque from our teeth. Furthermore fluoridated toothpastes protect our teeth against caries {{by means of the}} cariostatic fluoride action(s). Nearly all toothpastes contain abrasive systems. Toothpastes without abrasives leave stain problems at least in part of the population. This thesis deals especially with the abrasive effects from toothpastes on human enamel. As mentioned a small amount of abrasion is necessary for an optimum stain and plaque removal. However, toothpastes are used on two very different hard tissues: enamel and dentin. If the gingiva is not retracted the toothpaste will be in contact only with the enamel which covers the tooth crown. When the gingiva is retracted, as is often in case in the older part of the population, enamel is brushed by the toothpaste as well as cementum covering the root dentin. (the cement covers the dentin in a very thin layer and is easily removed by brushing; it is not discussed further.) Exposed dentin on the roots of our teeth is quite easily abraded. Therefore toothpaste producers test toothpastes on the abrasive sensitive dentin also because dentin abrasion is easy to measure. The simplicity of dentin abrasivity measurements combined with the fact that an abrasivity ratio between dentin and enamel has been presumed, has as a consequence that the number of toothpaste abrasivity studies on enamel is very limited.

40|$|Free time, that is, {{the time}} that remains at one's own {{discretion}} after conducting daily work and <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities,</b> has been previously recognized as a ‘primary good’ and an important welfare resource that provides opportunities for participation in social life and leisure. However, recent years have witnessed an increasing preoccupation with the phenomenon of time poverty, drawing attention to the distribution of free time {{and its relationship to}} structural and family circumstances. In this article we propose a novel approach to the measurement of time poverty and document its occurrence amongst British workers. In line with previous literature, a conceptualization of time poverty as a relative lack of free time resources vis-à-vis other members of the community is adopted. However, unlike previous empirical studies, we investigate the differential configuration of time poverty on weekdays and weekend days, alongside indicators of the quality of free time, taking into account insights from theoretical and empirical work within the field of the sociology of time. Our analysis of the 2000 UK Time Use Survey highlights class and gender inequalities that have been missed by previous measurement approaches and demonstrates that, overall, working women experience multiple and more severe free time constraints, which may constitute an additional barrier for their leisure and social participation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) is a major European Union reference source for comparative statistics on health status, health determinants and use of health care services. It is planned that EHIS will be conducted once every five years. The first wave of EHIS was launched under an informal agreement and implemented in 17 EU Member States and in Switzerland and Turkey between 2006 and 2009. The second wave of EHIS was completed under a European Parliament and Council regulation. Users should note that the United Kingdom opted {{out of the first}} wave and did not take part, so UK EHIS data exist only from Wave 2. This dataset contains only the UK responses to EHIS Wave 2. Further information about the survey may be found on the European Commission European Health Interview Survey webpage. Main Topics : Demographics, health status, diseases and chronic conditions, accidents and injuries, absence from work (due to health problems), physical and sensory functional limitations, <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities,</b> household activities, pain, mental health, health care, use of inpatient and day care, use of ambulatory and home care, medicine use, preventive services, unmet needs for health care, health determinants, weight and height, banded Body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity/exercise, consumption of fruit and vegetables, smoking, alcohol consumption, social support, provision of informal care or assistance. <br...|$|E

Six female patients under treatment of lymphedema due to surgical, radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic treatment of breast cancer, in the age group between 32 and 76 years (mean 54 years old, ± 31. 11) were selected. A compression sleeve of “gorgurão” (cotton-polyester material) was applied as a restrain mechanism. The occupational and daily <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities</b> evaluated were those common to all participants. These activities included washingup, cooking in a small pan, sweeping the floor using the affected arm, brushing the teeth, brushing the hair, washing small items of clothes, ironing clothes and making the bed. For statistical analysis, mean and standard deviation between resting pressures and minimum and maximum working pressures were determined. The two-tailed student t-test and variance analysis were used for repeated measurements. The Bonferroni limit was used in the analysis of the variables to calculate the alpha error, with a value of 5 %, considered statistically significant. All of the analyzed activities associated to the “gorgurão” compression sleeve generated both resting and working pressures (p < 0. 005). In conclusion, the occupational daily life tasks used in the present study generate resting and working pressures and can be used as a form of treatment of the lymphedema...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} national trends {{during the}} 1990 s in late-life difficulty and assistance with self-care activities. Among older Americans {{living in the}} community and experiencing difficulty with self-care activities, assistive-technology use increased substantially whereas use of <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> declined. Using a decomposition tech-nique, we demonstrate that these shifts in assistance toward technology account for half the {{decline in the number of}} people dependent on <b>personal</b> <b>care.</b> Key Words: Demography, Disability, Technology In recent years, the nation has experienced declines in the prevalence of late-life disability. Although measures vary, declines of 1 % to 2 % per year in one common indicator—the proportion of older people dependent on <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> in <b>activities</b> of daily living (ADLs) —were observed during the 1990 s (Freedman et al., 2004). Such trends are of particular interest because of their implica-tions for medical, social, and long-term-care services. Researchers have speculated that assistive technolo-gies have contributed to diminished dependence in late life (Freedman et al., 2004; Spillman, 2004). In this context, assistive technologies include both portable aids (e. g., canes and walkers) and environmental modifica-tions (e. g., grab bars and ramps) used to increase, maintain, or improve a person’s functional capabilities. Such technologies are widely used by people in late life, particularly for walking and bathing (Cornman, Freed-man, & Agree, 2005). Moreover, their use is associated with improved functioning and quality of life (Agree &...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We {{describe}} how paid and unpaid home care hours received by older unmarried Americans change {{in response to}} disability dynamics. We test whether responses to disability declines and improvements are symmetric; that is, we test whether reductions in care hours that are due to disability improvements are of similar magnitude to increases in care hours that are due to disability declines. Methods. Using a national sample of older unmarried Americans, we examine changes in total hours, paid hours, and unpaid hours of care in response to declines and improvements in <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> (<b>activities</b> of daily living, or ADLs) and routine care (instrumental ADLs, or IADLs) disability. We model changes in the total hours of care received {{in the past month}} and jointly model changes in unpaid and paid hours, using Tobit models. Results. Changes in the total hours of care received respond to both increases and decreases in the count of ADL limitations and appear close to symmetric. In contrast, responses to IADL disability dynamics appear to be far less symmetric: Although increases in the count of IADL limitations are met with substantial increases in the total hours of care, decreases are not met with correspondingly large declines in care. The same general pattern is found for unpaid and paid care, and for Medicaid-funded home care. Discussion. Disability and care are not static constructs in old age. Older unmarried persons experience worsening, stabilizing, and recovery of function, and their care hours change accordingly. Evaluations of home care programs must b...|$|E
40|$|Child {{welfare workers}} are {{routinely}} exposed to multiple traumatic events {{when working with}} children and families, and are at {{an increased risk of}} experiencing burnout and secondary trauma. Self-care is often recommended as a restorative or protective activity against the negative effects of working with traumatized individuals, although few studies have examined the benefit of self-care empirically. Trauma-informed self-care (TISC) includes being aware of one's own emotional experience in response to exposure to traumatized clients and planning/engaging in positive coping strategies, such as seeking supervision, attending trainings on secondary trauma, working within a team, balancing caseloads, and work-life balance. Compared with generic <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities,</b> TISC is likely to be especially relevant for child welfare workers. This study examined the role of TISC on compassion satisfaction, burnout and secondary trauma which was assessed by administering surveys to a sample of 104 child welfare case managers and supervisors. Almost one third of the sample reported high levels of burnout (29. 8 %) and secondary trauma (28. 8 %), and low levels of compassion satisfaction (31. 7 %). Results suggested that workers who engaged in higher levels of TISC experienced higher levels of compassion satisfaction and lower levels of burnout, although there was no relationship with secondary trauma. Findings provide preliminary evidence that TISC may be a beneficial practice to reduce risk of burnout and preserve workers' positive experience of their job, however workers experiencing secondary trauma are likely to need additional specialized intervention to assist them with their recovery. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Total US {{population}} {{estimates of}} complications {{of medical care}} have relied on extrapolations of state-specific estimates. Generalizability is suspect because findings are limited by geographical location or time. We describe {{the relationship between the}} annual prevalence of complications of medical care (CM) and socio-demographic characteristics in the adult US population. Methods We used data from the National Health Interview Surveys, annual nationwide surveys of the resident, civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States. The main outcome of interest was self-reported conditions from CMs (ICD- 9 996 - 999) and activity limitations that arise from such events. Univariate estimates and multivariably adjusted models accounting for selected socio-demographic characteristics and health status were derived. Results A total of 618, 167 reports of conditions from 313, 438 subjects 18 years and older from 1987 to 1994 were examined. In 1987, 830, 386 adults reported complications of medical care, increasing by about 40 % to 1, 174, 089 adults in 1994. Based on an extrapolation to the US adult population, rates increased by 25 % from 558 to 678 per 100, 000 during the same period. One-third reported onset a year prior to the interview; two-thirds visited a doctor six months prior; half experienced limitation in major activities; a quarter reported limitation in <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities.</b> In the two weeks preceding the interview, complications of medical care caused an average of 1. 72 days of restricted activity, 0. 79 days spent in bed, and 0. 58 days of work lost. Race modified the age-specific risk of these complications. Conclusions Complications of medical care impose heavier morbidity than previously considered with some indication that socio-demographic variables modify the risk for injuries. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine gender-specific models to {{determine}} whether different combinations of correlates are associated with male and female disablement, using a sample of non-institutionalized elderly persons in Egypt. Because women and men have different work, family, and household roles, as well as different health risks, it is reasonable to assume that there may be differing correlates for disablement for elderly males and females. The dichotomous dependent variable indicates problems, or the inability, in performing at least one of six activities of daily living (ADL). Of interest is the association of health, economic, and family variables, controlling for age. Logistic regression models are estimated for the total, male, and female samples. The results indicate that for males, having to stop working due to illness and having an unattended medical need are associated with higher odds for disablement as compared with females. Additionally, illiteracy increases the odds for male disablement, yet it has no effect on female disablement. Having experienced an injury in the past year is associated with disability for females, as is spending a lifetime in a rural setting and currently living in a fair to poor residence. Also for the females, increased number of living children significantly increases the odds for functional disability. Separate male and female models were estimated for each of the six ADL items. The trends indicated that the model covariates were more useful in modeling female disabilities in <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities,</b> rather than problems with eating and mobility. The health variables were significantly associated with most of the specific ADL problems for the males. elderly disability Egypt gender activities of daily living...|$|E
40|$|Background. Practicing {{activities}} improves recovery after stroke, {{but many}} people in hospital do little activity. Feedback on activity using an accelerometer is a potential method to increase activities in hospital inpatients. This study’s goal is to investigate the effect of feedback, enabled by a Smart watch, on daily physical activity levels during inpatient stroke rehabilitation and the short-term effects on simple functional activities, primarily mobility. Methods/design. A randomized controlled trial will be undertaken within the stroke rehabilitation wards of the 2 nd affiliated hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China. The study participants will be stroke survivors who meet inclusion criteria for the study, primarily: able to participate, {{no more than four}} months after stroke, and walking independently before stroke. Participants will all receive standard local rehabilitation and will be randomly assigned either to receive regular feedback about activity levels, relative to a daily goal tailored by the smart watch over five time periods throughout a working day, or to no feedback, but still wearing the Smart watch. The intervention will last up to three weeks, ending sooner if discharged. The data to be collected in all participants includes measures of: daily activity (Smart watch measure); mobility (Rivermead Mobility Index and ten metre walking time); independence in personal care (the Barthel ADL index); overall activities (the WHO Disability Assessment Scale, 12 -item version); and quality of life (the Euro-Qol 5 L 5 D). Data will be collected by masked assessors at baseline, three weeks or at discharge (whichever is the sooner); and a reduced data set at 12 weeks by telephone interview. The primary outcome will be change in daily accelerometer activity scores. Secondary outcomes are compliance and adherence to wearing the watch, and changes in mobility, independence in <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities,</b> and health-related quality of life.

40|$|This focused {{ethnography}} explores how {{the employees}} of assisted living give meaning to the term autonomy. Assisted living is a housing option for senior citizens who require some help with <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities,</b> but do not require the level of care provided in nursing homes. The philosophy of assisted living {{is based on the}} principles of autonomy, independence, and dignity. Autonomy is a complex concept that involves an interaction between two people: one making a choice and another respecting that choice. Because autonomy is relational, the employees who interact with the residents {{are in a position to}} enhance or thwart residents 2 ̆ 7 autonomy. There is little research on {{the employees of}} assisted living, particularly related to how they understand the concept of autonomy and how they respect residents 2 ̆ 7 autonomy. The purpose of this study is to understand how the employees of assisted living interpret the concept of autonomy. The following data collection methods were used: interviews with 27 staff members at two assisted living settings, observations in public places in the assisted living communities, and interviews with 11 residents at both settings. Five themes emerged: (1) Staff members 2 ̆ 7 perceptions that the mission of assisted living is to maximize physical independence; (2) Staff members 2 ̆ 7 perceptions that their role is to intervene in the residents best interests; (3) Staff members 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the residents as childlike and their adult children as primary decision-makers; (4) Staff members 2 ̆ 7 perception that they are responsible for ensuring the safety of the residents; and (5) The nature of congregate living arrangements.

This perception persists {{in spite of the}} fact that biomedical practitioners and research workers disagree about the nature and extent of disease and disability caused by schistosomes. This paper raises the question of whether S. mansoni should continue to be given priority as a public health problem in Gezira Province, Sudan. Biomedical and continuous observational data are blended with ethnographic information in order to develop a more integrated picture of the impact of S. mansoni on daily activity patterns among women. Research took place in one village in the Gezira/Managil irrigation scheme. The study is characterized by a small sample and a paired design. That is, 11 infected women were paired with 11 uninfected women. These women were engaged in agricultural activities in the cotton picking season and they were matched for a wide range of social and economic factors that might otherwise have affected their working activities. Observations were conducted on a minute by minute basis in the cotton fields. These data, in combination with ethnographic information and data indicating female productive output, showed that infection with S. mansoni significantly altered activity patterns in the cotton fields. That is, infected women (with an arithmetic mean egg output of 1958 eggs/g) attempted to pick as much cotton as possible in the shortest time period feasible in the morning. This pattern was partially repeated by infected women who returned to the fields in the afternoon. However, a significant number of infected women felt too weak to sustain this work regime and the economic implications of this finding are discussed. Finally, Fisher's exact probability test showed that infected women were significantly less likely to undertake <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities</b> between cotton picking sessions and this result suggests they may have been too tired and/or had a diminished perception of their own well-being. The implications of these results for public health policy in Gezira Province are discussed. S. mansoni disability women Sudan...|$|E
40|$|Background Australian {{residential}} aged care (RAC) {{homes are}} facing challenges of {{an increasing number}} of older people with complex care needs and a chronic shortage of skilled nursing staff to provide quality and efficient aged care services to these older people. Strategies like task re-allocation, process management and introduction of electronic information systems can be promising to overcome these challenges; however development of these strategies requires knowledge of nursing work activities and associate problems. Two important aged care services provided by nursing staff are personal care and nursing care. To date, there is little research on nursing work activities of providing these two types of care services and the challenges in the delivery of these services in RAC homes. Aims This research aimed to explore and describe nursing work activities of providing personal care and nursing care, identify the associated problems and explain the causes of these problems and their potential impacts in Australian RAC homes. Methods This research used time-motion observation method as the predominant data collection method. Structured and unstructured field notes, review of organisational documents and informal conversation with study participants were also used. Two types of data were collected. One was <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>activities</b> collected in two high-care units in two separate RAC homes in two cities. The other was nursing care activities collected in another two high-care units in one RAC home in a third city. Cultural-historical activity theory was used to conceptualise nursing work activities and the identified problems. Both quantitative and qualitative data analyses were performed. Results There were common work patterns of nursing staff in conducting personal care or nursing care activities in terms of their work processes and time usage. For personal care provision, no significant difference was found between the two units in 70 % of the nursing staff’s time. Significant differences between the two units were found in the time nursing staff spent on verbal communication, documentation and transit. For nursing care provision, no significant difference was found between the two units in all of the nursing staff’s time. Conclusion Providing quality and efficient aged care services requires solutions to the contradictions in the nursing activity system both within and outside RAC homes. This requires collaboration among RAC homes, pharmacies and IT companies in nursing work redesign, organisational process change and introduction of innovative information technology solutions that really support aged care services. These are the future directions of research with high potential to improve RAC services in Australia and over the world...|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} of work demands during workdays and sometime {{on the weekends}} can put more stress on individuals and lead to a higher need for recovery. Vacation is a prime candidate of a longer respite that can ensure a more complete recovery process because it allows individuals to temporarily take several days or weeks off without actively engaging in their job. This study thus intends to explore which activities are done upon vacation and how can they influence an individual 2 ̆ 7 s recovery experiences. By reviewing the theories related to recovery, vacation activities, and recreation opportunities, the study 2 ̆ 7 s conceptual model was developed to observe the association between activities and the recovery process. Resort vacation in Thailand however was chosen as a case for conducting the study because Thailand has been known as a popular tourist destination, featuring various attractive resorts located in different geographical areas and offering wide ranges of activities. Data obtained from 331 resort visitors in Thailand via offline and online platforms were analyzed using descriptive statistic, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), One-way between-groups Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), Multiple Regression Analysis (MLR), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and cluster analysis. Seven activity factors (Physical 2 ̆ 6 Outdoor Activities, Cultural 2 ̆ 6 City Interest, Online Media 2 ̆ 6 Entertainment, Social 2 ̆ 6 Non-exerting, Active Nature Pursuit, Personal Care, and Time for Myself) and four dimensions of recovery experiences (Psychological Detachment, Relaxation, Control, and Mastery) were identified. The positive effects were found among the six activity factors, except Personal Care, on the particular dimensions of vacation recovery experience. Interestingly, Physical 2 ̆ 6 Outdoor, Online Media 2 ̆ 6 Entertainment, and Social 2 ̆ 6 Non-exerting factor appeared to have negative effects on the different dimensions of vacation recovery experience as well. <b>Personal</b> <b>Care</b> <b>activities</b> were surprisingly found to present no significant effect on any dimension of vacation recovery experience. Such profound factors were then classified under Resource-Providing and Resource-Consuming Vacation Activities to differentiate {{the positive and negative}} effects that each activity category has on vacation recovery experience. Based on the cluster analysis, three groups of resort visitors (Activity doers, Socializers, and Relaxation seekers) were uncovered regarding to their preferred vacation activities, perceived vacation recovery experience, and demographics. Hence, the key findings bear empirical contributions to research scholars by providing a significant framework for further observation and clarification of the relationship between vacation recovery-related activities and the vacation recovery experience. This current study also offers managerial implications for practitioners in a more mindful approach when designing and developing vacation products in order to ensure an individual 2 ̆ 7 s optimal sense of recovery. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} use of nursing homes, formal <b>personal</b> <b>care,</b> {{informal}} <b>Activities</b> of Daily Living (ADL) assistance, and no care to identify racial differences in their use. Using the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey of both nursing homes and the community, multinominal logistic regressions controlled for predisposing, enabling, and need variables {{as well as other}} types of service use. Additional state-level variables make few changes in race/eth-nicity parameters, indicating that race/ethnicity are not simply proxies for state-level variables. Older African Americans are less likely to use nursing homes than similar whites, with the lower institutionalization replaced by a higher use of paid home care, informal-only care, and no care. This suggests that formal in-home community care is not fully compensating for the racial differences in nursing home use. Persistent effects of race/ethnicity could be the result of culture, class, and/or discrimination that may impair equitable access to services. RACIAL and ethnic minority older persons are increas-. ing in number rapidly, growing from 13 % of the total older adult population in 1990 to double that proportion by 2035 (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1996). This, combined with increasing life spans, will challenge our ability to pro-vide appropriate social and health services in the coming years (Torres-Gil, 1992).

40|$|Worldwide, {{immigrant}} workers {{are responsible for}} much of the care provided to elderly people who require assistance with <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> and with <b>activities</b> of daily living. This article examines the characteristics of immigrant home care workers, {{and the ways in which}} they differ from non-migrant care workers in Canada. It considers circumstances wherein the labor of care is framed by ethno-cultural diversity between client and worker, interactions that reflect the character of this ethno-cultural diversity, and the strategies employed by workers to address issues related to this diversity. Findings from a mixed methods study of 118 workers in the metropolitan area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, indicate that while the discriminatory context surrounding migrant home care workers persists, issues of ethno-cultural diversity in relationships are complex, and can also involve non-foreign born workers. Multi-cultural home care is not always framed in a negative context, and there often are positive aspects...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} on the care-giver burden experienced by adult children has typically focused on the adult child and parent dyad. This study uses information on multiple informal care-givers and examines how characteristics of the informal care-giving network affect the adult child's care-giver burden. In 2007, 602 Dutch care-givers who were assisting their older parents reported on parental and <b>personal</b> characteristics, <b>care</b> <b>activities,</b> experienced burden and characteristics of other informal care-givers. A path model was applied to assess the relative impact of the informal care-giving network characteristics on the care-giver burden. An adult child experienced lower care-giver burden when the informal care-giving network size was larger, when more types of tasks were shared across the network, when care was shared for a longer period, and when the adult child had no disagreements with {{the other members of}} the network. Considering that the need for care of older parents is growing, being in an informal care-giving network will be of increasing benefit for adult children involved in long-term care. More care-givers will turn into managers of care, as they increasingly have to organise the sharing of care among informal helpers and cope with disagreements among the members of the network. © 2010 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
