40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} design {{and implementation of the}} file system component of the Saguaro operating system for computers connected by a local-area network. Systems constructed on such an architecture have the potential advantage of increased file availability due to their inherent redundancy. In Saguaro, this advantage is made available through two mechanisms that support semi-automatic file replication and access: reproduction sets and metafiles. A reproduction set is a collection of files that the system attempts to keep identical on a "best effort" basis, relying on the user to handle unusual situations that may arise. A metafile is a special file that contains symbolic path names of other files; when a metafile is opened, the system selects an available constituent file and opens it instead. These mechanisms are especially appropriate for situations that do not require guaranteed consistency or a large number of copies. Other interesting aspects of the Saguaro file system design are also described. The logical file system forms a single tree, yet any file can be placed in any of the physical file systems. This organization allows the creation of a logical association among files that is quite different from their physical association. In addition, the broken path algorithm is described. This algorithm makes it possible to bypass elements in a path name that are on inaccessible physical file systems. Thus, any accessible file can be made available, regardless of the availability of directories in its <b>path.</b> <b>Details</b> are provided on the implementation of the Saguaro file system. The servers of which the system is composed are described individually and a comprehensive operational example is supplied to illustrate their interation. The underlying data structures of the file system are presented. The virtual roots, which contain information used by the broken path algorithm, are the most novel of these. Finally, an implementation of reproduction sets and metafiles for interconnected networks running Berkeley UNIX is described. This implementation demonstrates the broad applicability of these mechanisms. It also provides insight into the way in which mechanisms to facilitate user controlled replication of files can be inexpensively added to existing file systems. Performance measurements for this implementation are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Humans perform many {{activities}} indoors and they show a growing need for indoor navigation, especially in unfamiliar buildings such as airports, museums and hospitals. Complexity of such buildings poses many challenges for building managers and visitors. Indoor navigation services {{play an important}} role in supporting these indoor activities. Indoor navigation covers extensive topics such as: 1) indoor positioning and localization; 2) indoor space representation for navigation model generation; 3) indoor routing computation; 4) human wayfinding behaviours; and 5) indoor guidance (e. g., textual directories). So far, a large number of studies of pedestrian indoor navigation have presented diverse navigation models and routing algorithms/methods. However, the major challenge is rarely referred to: how to represent the complex indoor environment for pedestrians and conduct routing according to the different roles and sizes of users. Such complex buildings contain irregular shapes, large open spaces, complicated obstacles and different types of passages. A navigation model can be very complicated if the indoors are accurately represented. Although most research demonstrates feasible indoor navigation models and related routing methods in regular buildings, the focus is still on a general navigation model for pedestrians who are simplified as circles. In fact, pedestrians represent different sizes, motion abilities and preferences (e. g., described in user profiles), which should be reflected in navigation models and be considered for indoor routing (e. g., relevant Spaces of Interest and Points of Interest). In order to address this challenge, this thesis proposes an innovative indoor modelling and routing approach – two-level routing. It specially targets the case of routing in complex buildings for distinct users. The conceptual (first) level uses general free indoor spaces: this is represented by the logical network whose nodes represent the spaces and edges stand for their connectivity; the detailed (second) level focuses on transition spaces such as openings and Spaces of Interest (SOI), and geometric networks are generated regarding these spaces. Nodes of a geometric network refers to locations of doors, windows and subspaces (SOIs) inside of the larger spaces; and the edges represent detailed paths among these geometric nodes. A combination of the two levels can represent complex buildings in specified spaces, which avoids maintaining a largescale complete network. User preferences on ordered SOIs are considered in routing on the logical network, and preferences on ordered Points of Interest (POI) are adopted in routing on geometric networks. In a geometric network, accessible obstacle-avoiding paths can be computed for users with different sizes. To facilitate automatic generation of the two types of network in any building, a new data model named Indoor Navigation Space Model (INSM) is proposed to store connectivity, semantics and geometry of indoor spaces for buildings. Abundant semantics of building components are designed in INSM based on navigational functionalities, such as VerticalUnit(VU) and HorizontalConnector(HC) as vertical and horizontal passages for pedestrians. The INSM supports different subdivision ways of a building in which indoor spaces can be assigned proper semantics. A logical and geometric network can be automatically derived from INSM, and they can be used individually or together for indoor routing. Thus, different routing options are designed. Paths can be provided by using either the logical network when some users are satisfied with a rough description of the path (e. g., the name of spaces), or a geometric path is automatically computed for a user who needs only a detailed path which shows how obstacles can be avoided. The two-level routing approach integrates both logical and geometric networks to obtain paths, when a user provides her/his preferences on SOIs and POIs. For example, routing results for the logical network can exclude unrelated spaces and then derive geometric paths more efficiently. In this thesis, two options are proposed for routing just on the logical network, three options are proposed for routing just on the geometric networks, and seven options for two-level routing. On the logical network, six routing criteria are proposed and three human wayfinding strategies are adopted to simulate human indoor behaviours. According to a specific criterion, space semantics of logical nodes is utilized to assign different weights to logical nodes and edges. Therefore, routing on the logical network can be accomplished by applying the Dijkstra algorithm. If multiple criteria are adopted, an order of criteria is applied for routing according to a specific user. In this way, logical paths can be computed as a sequence of indoor spaces with clear semantics. On geometric networks, this thesis proposes a new routing method to provide detailed paths avoiding indoor obstacles with respect to pedestrian sizes. This method allows geometric networks to be derived for individual users with different sizes for any specified spaces. To demonstrate the use of the two types of network, this thesis tests routing on one level (the logical or the geometric network). Four case studies about the logical network are presented in both simple and complex buildings. In the simple building, no multiple paths lie between spaces A and B, but in the complex buildings, multiple logical paths exist and the candidate paths can be reduced by applying these routing criteria in an order for a user. The relationships of these criteria to user profiles are assumed in this thesis. The proposed geometric routing regarding user sizes is tested with three case studies: 1) routing for pedestrians with two distinct sizes in one space; 2) routing for pedestrians with changed sizes in one space; and 3) a larger geometric network formed by the ones in a given sequence of spaces. The first case shows that a small increase of user size can largely change the accessible path; the second case shows different path segments for distinct sizes can be combined into one geometric path; the third case demonstrates a geometric network can be created ’on the fly’ for any specified spaces of a building. Therefore, the generation and routing of geometric networks are very flexible and fit to given users. To demonstrate the proposed two-level routing approach, this thesis designs five cases. The five cases are distinguished according to the method of model creation (pre-computed or ’on-the-fly’) and model storage (on the client or server). Two of them are realized in this thesis: 1) Case 1 just in the client pre-computes the logical network and derives geometric networks ’on the fly’; 2) Case 2 just in the client pre-computes and stores the logical and geometric networks for certain user sizes. Case 1 is implemented in a desktop application for building managers, and Case 2 is realized as a mobile mock-up for mobile users without an internet connection. As this thesis shows, two-level routing is powerful enough to effectively provide indicative logical paths and/or comprehensive geometric paths, according to different user requirements on <b>path</b> <b>details.</b> In the desktop application, three of the proposed routing options for two-level routing are tested for the simple OTB building and the complex Schiphol Airport building. These use cases demonstrate that the two-level routing approach includes the following merits: • It supports routing in different abstraction forms of a building. The INSM model can describe different subdivision results of a building, and it allows two types of routing network to be derived – pure logical and geometric ones. The logical network contains the topology and semantics of indoor spaces, and the geometric network provides accurate geometry for paths. A consistent navigation model is formed with the two networks, i. e., the conceptual and detailed levels. • On the conceptual level, it supports routing on a logical network and assists the derivation of a conceptual path (i. e., logical path) for a user in terms of space sequence. Routing criteria are designed based on the INSM semantics of spaces, which can generate logical paths similar to human wayfinding results such as minimizing VerticalUnit or HorizontalConnector. • On the detailed level, it considers the size of users and results in obstacle-avoiding paths. By using this approach, geometric networks can be generated to avoid obstacles for the given users and accessible paths are flexibly provided for user demands. This approach can process changes of user size more efficiently, in contrast to routing on a complete geometric network. • It supports routing on both the logical and the geometric networks, which can generate geometric paths based on user-specific logical paths, or re-compute logical paths when geometric paths are inaccessible. This computation method is very useful for complex buildings. The two-level routing approach can flexibly provide logical and geometric paths according to user preferences and sizes, and can adjust the generated paths in limited time. Based on the two-level routing approach, this thesis also provides a vision on possible cooperation with other methods. A potential direction is to design more routing options according to other indoor scenarios and user preferences. Extensions of the two-level routing approach, such as other types of semantics, multi-level networks and dynamic obstacles, will make it possible to deal with other routing cases. Last but not least, it is also promising to explore its relationships with indoor guidance, different building subdivisions and outdoor navigation...|$|E

This paper presents all the damage points, and indicates which of the gaps might be “real ” (i. e., where one tornado ended and another tornado developed), as well as those gaps more likely to have been a continuous tornado. We speculate that path segments at the beginning of the potential damage path in eastern Shannon County, MO, and at the end o...|$|R
40|$|Road {{maintenance}} planning, {{an essential}} component of road asset management, preserves the integrity of road networks. Current state of the art pavement management systems exercise optimisation tools, pavement deterioration models, and intervention criteria to forecast the future maintenance requirements of a road network. However, using this current approach to pavement management, uncertainties associated with the failure of individual road sections may not always be accounted for explicitly, and therefore the susceptibility of a road network to failure is unknown. Predicting the probability of the end of life of a road pavement involves wholly understanding possible modes of failure and utilising suitable computational techniques, so that engineering knowledge can be well represented in data driven models. To this end, this thesis describes the development of a diagnostic approach that infers engineering knowledge into computational models, to quantify the probability and identify the most likely causes of failure of road pavements. To do so, this research developed a number of failure charts that capture engineering knowledge and present possible failure <b>paths,</b> <b>detailing</b> a set of factors contributing to failure. One technique, based on support vector machines, was identified as the most suitable for this research. The developed prototype system, consisting of a failure system for rutting, fatigue cracking, and shear, performed well in both the development phase and network testing of the system. A case study focusing on rural New Zealand roads was carried out, which demonstrated the use of this tool in network and project level applications. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} eight Digital Equipment Corporation Alpha {{workstations}} is interconnected with ATM to form a cluster with supercomputer power. For output, each workstation drives a single ``tile`` on an 8 -tile high-resolution frame buffer. A special purpose adapter is used to convert the workstation`s ATM format to the frame buffer`s HIPPI format. This paper discusses the rationale behind the workstation farm, and then describes the visualization output <b>path</b> in <b>detail.</b> To provide the system quickly, special {{emphasis was placed on}} making the design as simple as possible. The design choices are examined, and the resultant system is described. The oral presentation will include operational experiences...|$|R
