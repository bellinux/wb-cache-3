40|$|On-Chip" I_DDQ testing by the {{incorporation}} of Built-In Current (BIC) sensors has some advantages over "off-chip" techniques. However, the integration of sensors poses analog design problems which are hard to be solved by a digital designer. The automatic incorporation of the sensors using <b>parameterized</b> BIC <b>cells</b> could be a promising alternative. The work reported here identifies partitioning criteria to guide the synthesis of I_DDQ-testable circuits. The circuit must be partitioned, such that the defective I_DDQ is observable, and the power supply voltage perturbation is within specified limits. In addition to these constraints, also cost criteria are considered: circuit extra delay, area overhead of the BIC sensors, connectivity costs of the test circuitry, and the test application time. The parameters are estimated based on logical as well as electrical level information of the target cell library {{to be used in}} the technology mapping phase of the synthesis process.

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has improved clinical outcome, most ALL patients relapse following treatment with TKI due to the development of resistance.

Upon infection, {{the dynamics of}} lymphocyte populations are an aggregate of molecular processes that determine the activation, division, and longevity of individual cells. The timing of these single-cell processes is remarkably widely distributed with some cells undergoing their third division while others undergo their first. High cell-to-cell variability and technical noise pose challenges for interpreting popular dye-dilution experiments objectively. It remains an unresolved challenge to avoid under- or over-interpretation of such data when phenotyping gene-targeted mouse models or patient samples.

40|$|Detailed {{regional}} body wave tomographic inversion of the Western Pacific region has been performed using P and S travel times from common sources and receivers, with a joint inversion {{in terms of}} bulk-sound and shear wave-speed variations in the mantle. This technique allows {{the separation of the}} influence of bulk and shear moduli, and hence a more direct comparison with mineral physics information. The study region is <b>parameterized</b> with <b>cells</b> of side 0. 5 ‡ to 2 ‡ and 19 layers to a depth of 1500 km, {{while the rest of the}} mantle was parameterized with 5 U 5 ‡ cells with 16 layers between the surface and the core^mantle boundary. A simultaneous inversion is made for regional and global structures to minimize the influence of surrounding structures on the regional image. A nested iterative inversion scheme is employed with local linearization and three-dimensional ray tracing through the successive model updates. The results of the regional tomographic inversion reveal the penetration of a subducted slab below the 660 km discontinuity at the Kurile^Kamchatka trench, while flattening of slabs above this depth is observed in the Japan and Izu^Bonin subduction zones on both the bulk-sound and shear wave-speed images. The penetration of a subducted slab down to a depth of at least 1200 km is seen below the southern part of the Bonin trench, Mariana, Philippine, and Java subduction zones.

40|$|In {{variable}} {{grid spacing}} tomography the underground velocity distribution is <b>parameterized</b> with model <b>cells</b> of different sizes. This method can simultaneously {{take into account}} the spatially varying resolution inherent in most datasets. E. g., due to experimental design or logistic constraints, the shallow and deep subsurface velocity distribution may be very differently determined by the available data. The variable grid spacing tomography and regular grid spacing tomography are similar in most other aspects. There are two main differences between the variable grid spacing method and the regular grid spacing method. First, ray segments calculated in the forward model cells should be divided into the larger cells of the inversion model. Second, the smoothness constraint equations needed to inhibit wild velocity variations need to be modified where the cells change in size. In a synthetic checkerboard reconstruction test with differently sized checkers the variable grid spacing method recovers the small and large checkers better than the regular grid spacing method in both two and three-dimensional test cases. For a real dataset, the variable grid spacing method distinguishes two low velocity zones better than the regular grid spacing method. Finally, it can be concluded that when the effort is spent to identify the regions in a model with best data coverage, the variable grid spacing method can produce velocity images with higher fidelity than when a uniform cell size is used. Especially, in many cases this method can enhance the fidelity of the shallow subsurface velocity distribution. In addition, variable grid spacing tomography can reduce the underdetermined regions in an inverse problem when the data coverage is irregular...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2006. Large {{regions of}} {{subtropical}} stratocumulus clouds {{are responsible for}} significant net cooling in the earth's radiative budget. Stratocumulus are maintained by a complex interaction of processes on small scales (turbulent eddies) and mesoscales (10 - 100 km) that are not currently well represented in climate models. In northern-hemisphere stratocumulus, drizzle {{has been found to}} affect the boundary layer dynamics and cloud properties, but until recently, few observations had been obtained in the large, persistent southeast Pacific stratocumulus region. This study uses observations from the Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate (EPIC) 2001 stratocumulus cruise in the southeast Pacific, including data from scanning and vertically-pointing radars. Relationships are derived between rain rates and radar reflectivity, and areal-averaged rain-rates are obtained from scanning-radar data. While substantial drizzle falls from the clouds in this region (0. 2 - 2. 3 mm day- 1), about 70 % of it evaporates before reaching the surface. Stratocumulus have significant diurnal modulations, with boundary layer mixing and cloud thickness decreasing during the afternoon and increasing at night. Drizzle is most frequently observed in the early morning when clouds are typically thickest. Sizable drizzle cells could last about two hours, suggesting that moisture from sub-cloud evaporated drizzle recirculates back into the cloud layer. Southeast Pacific stratocumulus typically exhibit closed-cellular patterns in cloud structure, although open-cellular patterns are also common. Closed cells are mesoscale cloudy regions surrounded by thin breaks. They are characterized by a well-mixed boundary layer and little or no precipitation (rain rates 1 mm day- 1). Regardless of the overlying cloud patterns, drizzle cells have consistent vertical structures. They can be <b>parameterized</b> as overturning <b>cells</b> on 2 - 30 km horizontal scales, with convergence below cloud and divergence in the cloud layer. Regions of open-cellular cloud structure can appear within otherwise closed-cellular stratocumulus. Open-cellular regions frequently appear before sunrise, so drizzle is likely contributing to their formation. Because the cloud structure patterns impact the radiative properties of the stratocumulus sheet, future observations and modeling studies should further investigate their formation mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Compounds of the {{chemical}} formula M 2 SiO 4 with olivine-type structure are of fundamental importance for geologists and mineralogists {{because of the presence}} of a huge amount of the olivines in the earth's upper mantle. Here, M is mainly Fe, Mg and Mn with small amounts of Ni, Ca, Co and Zn in mixed crystals. Many studies provided abundant data on the olivine-type oxides, especially at or above room temperature and at high pressure. However, there is still a lack of information on the magnetic properties and the thermal evolution of the crystal structure below room temperature for some olivines. One of the less studied olivine-type silicates is the synthetic cobalt olivine, Co 2 SiO 4. The main goal of the present study is to determine precisely the changes in both the crystal and magnetic structures of Co 2 SiO 4 in a wide temperature range from 2. 5 K up to 500 K. Synthetic Co 2 SiO 4 has an orthorhombic crystal structure (space group Pnma, No. 62) and shows magnetic ordering below 50 K. Both single-crystal (2. 5 K - 300 K) and powder (5 K - 500 K) neutron diffraction were applied to determine precise crystal structure parameters. Lattice parameters were also determined by means of both high-resolution synchrotron and laboratory X-ray powder diffraction measurements between 15 K and 300 K. The orthorhombic symmetry with space group Pnma was found to be retained in the temperature range from 2. 5 K up to 500 K. In order to <b>parameterize</b> the <b>cell</b> parameters of Co 2 SiO 4 the molar specific heat was measured and fitted taking into account the Debye-Einstein lattice contribution, the magnetic part and the Schottky contribution. The unit cell volume was then fitted based on the specific heat data. There is a clear evidence of an anomalous thermal expansion related to the magnetic phase transition. This anomaly in the lattice parameters and the unit cell volume can be attributed to magnetostriction. Detailed symmetry analysis of the magnetic structure shows that it corresponds to the magnetic (Shubnikov) group Pnma, which allows the antiferromagnetic configuration (Gx,Cy,Az) for the 4 a site with inversion symmetry (Co 1 position) and (0,Cy, 0) for the 4 c site with mirror symmetry (Co 2 position). Magnetic anisotropy was studied by fitting the observed susceptibility curves above Neel temperature to the Curie-Weiss law, thus giving the Curie-Weiss temperatures and effective magnetic moments. The magnetic moments from the neutron diffraction data were found to be 3. 86 (5) Bohr magneton and 3. 37 (4) Bohr magneton for Co 1 and Co 2, respectively. These values are much higher than the spin-only one for high-spin Co 2 + (3 Bohr magneton) indicating the orbital contribution. This is in agreement with both magnetic susceptibility and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements. The accurate analysis of the neutron diffraction data as a function of temperature shows no change in the spin configuration in the whole temperature range of the magnetically ordered state. The magnetic structure of Co 2 SiO 4 has also been studied by means of polarized neutron diffraction on a single crystal. Measurements were made at temperatures of 70 K and 150 K in an external magnetic field of 7 T parallel to the b axis. This study of the magnetization induced by an applied field above T_N shows an anisotropy which is found to be rather small at high temperatures but becomes very strongly enhanced when approaching the ordering temperature. The refinement also revealed a non-negligible amount of magnetic moment on the three different oxygen positions which was interpreted as a delocalization of the magnetic moment from Co 2 + towards the neighbouring O due to the superexchange coupling. The electron-density distribution in Co 2 SiO 4 was studied by means of singlecrystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements at 12 K, 40 K and 300 K. The data were analysed using both Fourier and maximum-entropy methods. A tendency to an elongation of the valence electron density along the direction of the magnetic moments with decrease of temperature was found in agreement with an elongation of the magnetic ellipsoids obtained from polarized neutron flipping-ratio measurements. The assumption of a partly covalent character of the Co-O bonding was confirmed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{electrical}} behavior of lithium-ion batteries. The aim is to gain {{as much information as}} possible by only monitoring the current and voltage behavior of a battery without being able to look inside. For this, a model representation of the processes inside a lithium-ion battery is developed. For all important phenomena, the influence on the electrical voltage response is derived and merged into a mathematical framework. For parameter identification based solely on the voltage curve, these model equations must be simplified in order to obtain the necessary computation speed for a parameter estimation algorithm. The parameters whose sole influences on the electric behaviour can not be separated without changing the system are summarized so that a model with purely electrical quantities is derived. Using different methods, the model order is significantly reduced while minimizing the approximation error. The model thus transformed, based on the model equations of porous electrodes according to Newman, can even be used for voltage prognosis or for parameter tracking in onboard diagnostics. Furthermore, a method is presented with which the individual processes can be quantitatively measured and separated without destroying the battery cell. In total, more than sixteen different types of batteries were extensively measured within the scope of the work. On the basis of the findings derived from this, the development of the parameterization procedure was carried out. Thus, it is now possible to separate the individual processes occurring in the battery and to support a hypothesis of the assignment to positive and negative electrodes on the basis of several indicia. For this purpose, the alternating current electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and a correlation analysis are used to calculate the distribution function of the time constants (DRT) occurring in the impedance. Together with a series of tests with direct current excitation, a measuring method is obtained which, with the correct evaluation methodology, allows a broad characterization of the battery behavior. Finally, the described method is used in two studies. In the first, the possibilities of a current-voltage model derived from the measurements are demonstrated by fully <b>parameterizing</b> the battery <b>cell</b> of the first generation Mitsubishi iMiEV. The overvoltages of both electrodes can be viewed separately and the effects of so-called blend electrodes are also visible. The appendix of the work additionally includes the parameters of the cell of the first generation BMW i 3. The second study examines the changes in the model parameters during the cyclic aging of batteries. Further information on the assignment of the processes to the two electrodes is derived from this data. This precise knowledge of the composition of the voltage and the assignment of the overvoltages to the individual electrodes can in the future allow a completely new control of the operation of a battery. The prognosis quality of the condition and the remaining lifetime of the system will be improved significantly by applying the presented methods...|$|R
