5|$|In October 1940, {{development}} {{began to}} produce a vehicle {{in response to a}} long-standing requirement for an anti-aircraft vehicle to protect the U.S. Army's mechanized troop convoys from aerial attack. The first vehicle produced {{in the development of a}} half track with an anti-aircraft armament was the T1, which had two M2 machine guns on a Bendix machine gun mountas used on jeepson a 4×4 truck. The T1E1 had a <b>power-operated</b> Bendix mount, and the T1E2 a Maxson mount. The T1E3 had an electro-dynamic Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft-type turret. Evaluation of these test vehicles led to the T1E2 design being preferred. The T1E2 became the M16 Half-track by replacing the M33 with the M45 mount and the M2 Half-track chassis with the M3 Half-track chassis.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with <b>power-operated</b> turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E
25|$|All {{trains are}} fitted with <b>power-operated</b> sliding doors which are closed by the driver, but opened by passengers. The doors of newer model X'Trapolis 100 and Siemens trains are opened by a button, but the Comeng trains are opened using handles.|$|E
25|$|The H class {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to feature a mechanical stoker, and boasted many other modern features such as roller bearings, hydrostatically controlled load compensating brake gear on the tender, <b>power-operated</b> reversing gear, American-style bar frame construction, thermic siphons, and duplex blast pipes.|$|E
25|$|For 1961 the American line added a four-door station wagon, {{as well as}} a two-door {{convertible}} for {{the first}} time since 1954. It featured a <b>power-operated</b> folding top with roll-down door glass, rather than the fixed side-window frames of the original design. Passenger room increased from five to six.|$|E
25|$|A halakhically {{authorized}} Shabbat mode {{added to}} a <b>power-operated</b> mobility scooter may be used on the observance of Shabbat for those with walking limitations, {{often referred to as}} a Shabbat scooter. It is intended only for individuals whose limited mobility is dependent on a scooter or automobile consistently throughout the week.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptian Infantry Fighting Vehicle (EIFV), {{also known}} as Infantry Fighting Vehicle Light (IFVL), is an Egyptian {{modification}} of the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier. It is a hybrid, based on an enlarged M113 chassis equipped with the complete two-man <b>power-operated</b> turret of the M2 Bradley IFV. The EIFV is currently in service with the Egyptian Army.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the signals}} and points (UK term) or rail {{switches}} (US) are <b>power-operated,</b> {{it can be}} worthwhile to signal each line in both directions, so that the double line becomes a pair of single lines. This allows trains to use one track where the other track is out of service due to track maintenance work, or a train failure, or for a fast train to overtake a slow train.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} 1889 {{signal box}} {{was replaced with}} an electro-pneumatic <b>power-operated</b> box based on the Westinghouse system. Work started in October 1907 and it opened on 5 April 1908. It was built directly over the River Clyde, sitting between the two river bridges, above {{the level of the}} tracks. Inside was a frame of 374 miniature levers, making it the longest power frame ever built in Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Off Indicator: An {{illuminated}} off indication {{means the}} associated signal is showing a proceed aspect. These are mainly used at stations, {{for the benefit}} of the train-crew and platform staff. When the display is blank, it means that the associated signal is at danger. An illuminated indication CD (close doors) is an instruction to close the train's <b>power-operated</b> doors. An illuminated indication RA or R (right away) means that station duties are complete and the train may depart.|$|E
25|$|James Fields Smathers of Kansas City invented what is {{considered}} the first practical <b>power-operated</b> typewriter in 1914. In 1920, after returning from Army service, he produced a successful model and in 1923 {{turned it over to}} the Northeast Electric Company of Rochester for development. Northeast was interested in finding new markets for their electric motors and developed Smathers's design so that it could be marketed to typewriter manufacturers, and from 1925 Remington Electric typewriters were produced powered by Northeast's motors.|$|E
25|$|Another {{critical}} addition {{was the use}} of a <b>power-operated</b> stabilator, {{also known}} as the all-moving tail or flying tail, a key to supersonic flight control which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilot's control column. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure, which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early transonic flight was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An all-flying tail {{is considered to be a}} minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the transonic barrier safely without a loss of pilot control. The M.52 was the first instance of this solution, which has since gone on to be universally applied upon high-speed aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In larger {{operations}} such as Jubilee, Torch, Husky, and Overlord, LCAs {{were carried}} to invasion areas by Landing Ship Infantry (LSI). The location {{chosen for the}} LSI to stop and lower the LCA was a designated point inside the 'Transport Area' when the LSI was operating with a US Navy Task Force, or the 'Lowering Position' when with a Royal Navy Task Force. The transport area or lowering position was approximately 6–11 miles off shore (11 miles was amphibious doctrine for the USN by mid-war, while the RN tended to accept {{the risks associated with}} drawing nearer shore). Normally landing ships were fitted with heavy-duty <b>power-operated</b> davits. Early landing ships were fitted with Welin-McLachlin davits – these being generally in use in the Merchant Navy for standard 99 man lifeboats. As the weight of LCAs increased through the war (eventually approaching 14 tons) heavier davits were required. Later LSIs and those being refitted were provisioned with luffing davits of a crossbeam type. The davits themselves provided a demarcation between the responsibilities of the LSI crew (either Royal Navy or Merchant Navy) {{and the members of the}} LCA Flotilla.|$|E
500|$|Short-range {{air defence}} was {{provided}} by 73 Bofors 40 mm AA guns {{in a variety of}} mountings. Vanguard had ten sextuple-barrel <b>power-operated</b> mounts concentrated in the superstructure and stern, a twin-barrel mount on 'B' turret, and 11 <b>power-operated</b> single mounts on the upper deck and rear superstructure. All mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of +90°. The [...] gun fired a [...] shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] to a distance of [...] The gun's rate of fire was approximately 120 rounds per minute. Space was not available to stow the standard allowance of 1564 rounds per gun, and Vanguard only carried 1269 rounds per gun. Two of the single guns on the quarterdeck were removed in 1949 and five others during a major refit in 1954. All of her multiple Bofors mounts were removed at this same time.|$|E
500|$|The trials {{conducted}} by the NII VVS included engagements between the Tu-12 and the Soviet MiG-9 and Yak-23 jet fighters which were very useful in evaluating the offensive armament of the fighters, the defensive armament of the bomber and the proper tactics involved for both types of aircraft. The tests demonstrated the inferiority of the current [...] armament and meant that every Soviet bomber henceforth would have a defensive armament using <b>power-operated</b> turrets that carried 20mm or larger guns.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{defensive}} gun turrets, the initial loadout was a nose turret and rear turret, {{both of these}} being manually operated and mounting a single Vickers 0.303 machine gun. On the Whitley Mk III this arrangement was substantially revised: a new retractable ventral 'dustbin' position was installed mounting twin [...]303in (7.7mm) Browning machine guns, and the nose turret was also upgraded to a Nash & Thompson-built <b>power-operated</b> turret. On the Whitley Mk IV, the tail and ventral turrets were replaced with a Nash & Thompson <b>power-operated</b> turret mounting four Browning machine guns; upon the adoption of this turret arrangement, the Whitley became the most powerfully armed bomber in the world against attacks from the rear.|$|E
