There has been some exploration and pumping in the area, but it seems likely that there is far more. Some of these rock formations are in Zapatista held areas of the forest, but many geologists and the Mexican government have insisted there is little promise of oil in these areas. There is some contradicting data. The Zapatistas claim that the government is hiding the presence of oil in the area as they try to force them and the indigenous <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> them off the lands.|$|E
500|$|The use {{of torture}} and the {{negative}} portrayal of Muslims affected the decisions of some actors who intended to join the series. Janeane Garofalo, who portrayed Janis Gold on the series, initially turned down the role {{because of the way}} the series depicted torture, but later took up the role, saying that [...] "being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance." [...] Shohreh Aghdashloo, who portrayed Dina Araz, initially had reservations about taking on the role, as she initially felt that taking on the role of a Muslim terrorist would alienate <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> her as an activist, as she had spent many years in Iran advocating for women's rights and fought against the stereotyping of Muslim-Americans. However, she took on the role as she felt that people would understand that the show was fiction.|$|E

500|$|He {{released}} goalkeeper Brian Horne, who {{he described}} as a [...] "fat slob"; this {{proved to be an}} unpopular move with [...] "a lot of nasty <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> Hartlepool... who purport to support this club [...] would rather back fat professional players than people who really care about Hartlepool United". As his replacement he signed Stephen Pears from Liverpool, as well as young defenders Glen Davies and Chris McDonald, teenage winger David Clegg, Exeter City midfielder Mark Cooper, and Blackpool midfielder Chris Beech. Hartlepool started the 1996–97 campaign with wins over Colchester United and Fulham, but his playing career came to an end after the fifth game of the season, against Wigan Athletic, when he retired due to a persistent knee injury. He continued to bemoan refereeing decisions which seemed to consistently go against Hartlepool. This in turn led to continued punishments from the FA over his use of foul language towards officials. With his team on a poor run of results {{at the foot of the}} table, he left the club by mutual consent on 4 November 1996. His assistant Mick Tait led the club to a 20th-place finish, and organised a benefit match for Houchen against Middlesbrough, which raised £23,000.|$|E

2500|$|Internalized {{homophobia}} {{refers to}} negative stereotypes, beliefs, stigma, and prejudice about homosexuality and LGBT people {{that a person}} with same-sex attraction turns inward on themselves, {{whether or not they}} identify as LGBT. The degree to which someone is affected by these ideas depends on how much and which ideas they have consciously and subconsciously internalized. These negative beliefs can be mitigated with education, life experience and therapy, especially with gay-friendly psychotherapy/analysis. Internalized homophobia also applies to conscious or unconscious behaviors which a person feels the need to promote or conform to cultural expectations of heteronormativity or heterosexism. This can include extreme repression and denial coupled with forced outward displays of heteronormative behavior for the purpose of appearing or attempting to feel [...] "normal" [...] or [...] "accepted." [...] Other expressions of internalized homophobia can also be subtle. Some less overt behaviors may include making assumptions about the gender of a person's romantic partner, or about gender roles. Some researchers also apply this label to LGBT <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> [...] "compromise" [...] policies, such as those that find civil unions acceptable in place of same-sex marriage.|$|E
2500|$|Gillespie was criticised for {{defacing}} a Make Poverty History poster {{signed by}} all the acts at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005. Gillespie scribbled over this and wrote [...] "Make Israel History." [...] Gillespie later {{said that he did}} this in support of Palestine, and when questioned on whether he was anti-Semitic, he responded [...] "There's Israeli and Jewish <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> the Palestinian cause as well. We did a lot of work for the Hoping Foundation to raise money for children in the Palestinian refugee camps and the lady who got us involved is Bella Freud, Lucian Freud's daughter and Sigmund Freud's great granddaughter. They had to flee Austria to escape Nazi persecution, and she believes in the Palestinian cause. To say we're anti-Semitic is a smear, so you'd better watch what you're saying. Because you oppose one country's government's policies doesn't mean to say that you hate all the people from that country. I don't like Bush or Putin or Tony Blair, but I don't hate American, Russian or British people. Most people are just trying hard to get by." [...] In 2012 he stated that he believed the British coalition government were reactionary quasi-fascists. The statement was prompted by the use of Primal Scream's song [...] "Rocks" [...] at the Conservative Party Conference.|$|E

Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said [...] "Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim— though I know that plenty {{of people in this country}} think he is. And what if he were? The point I was making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don’t care what religion Obama is— nor should anyone else in America." [...] In her Los Angeles performance, Madonna dedicated her performance to Malala Yousafzai, a 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot by the Taliban for speaking out on her right to have an education.
