The disk is asymmetric: in {{the northeast}} direction {{it has been observed}} out to 1835 astronomical units from the star, while the southwest direction the extent is 1450 AU. The disk is rotating: the <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the northeast of the star is moving away from Earth, while the <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the southwest of the disc is moving towards Earth.|$|E

5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence {{of a gene}} (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E

Upgrades range from mere {{improvements to the}} longevity of R/C car <b>parts,</b> <b>to</b> all-out performance enhancements. A number of hobbyists create their own upgrades for sale via classifieds and online forums. Hobbyists choose to upgrade hobby-grade cars from plastic stock <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> aluminium <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> increase strength and the steering angle of the car.|$|R
5|$|Adams {{wrote the}} main parts of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect with actors Simon Jones and Geoffrey McGivern in mind. According to Jones, Adams telephoned {{him when he}} was writing the pilot to ask whether he would {{essentially}} play himself; Adams later stated that although Dent was not a portrayal of Jones, he wrote the <b>part</b> <b>to</b> play to Jones's strengths as an actor.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion {{got off to a}} slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|After Hurricane Ike hit Texas in September 2008, Galveston County {{officials}} {{offered a}} debris removal program to residents in unincorporated areas, including Bacliff.

5|$|After Pelacur, Sarumpaet {{began working}} on a film {{adaptation}} entitled Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). The film's production took three years, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> a lack of funding; the total budget was Rp.6.5 billion (US$800,000) Released on 30 April 2009, the film was well received both domestically and internationally. It was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but not nominated.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations to}} implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached. The expectation is that only Finland will utilise it, due, in <b>part,</b> <b>to</b> a requirement to contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time. Finland, {{as one of the}} strongest AAA countries, can raise the required capital with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from racing, {{he continued to}} work for Daimler-Benz as a salesman, targeting NATO troops stationed in Europe.

In early 1959, he became sick and developed signs of jaundice, which worsened despite treatment. Later in the year {{he was diagnosed with}} advanced cirrhosis. On 28 September 1959, in Kassel, Germany, he suffered liver failure and died, aged 58. He was buried in his home town of Lugano.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} Brazilian dreadnought, Minas Geraes, was launched, the Brazilian {{government}} began an extended campaign {{to remove the}} third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the Revolt of the Lash coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> lower bond rates {{that made it possible}} for the government to borrow the necessary money. Rio de Janeiro was laid down {{for the first time in}} March 1910.|$|E
5|$|After the season, disaffection {{within the}} Southern Conference {{prompted}} seven former members, including Maryland, {{to form the}} Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The schism was due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the ban on bowl participation, and the vast geographic dispersion of and disparity between the sizes of member schools. Clemson, another founding ACC member, had likewise been forced to play outside the Southern Conference in 1952.|$|E
5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead. After opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which represented the affected Wheeling Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the work delays.|$|E

5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> {{her ideas}} {{about the role of}} a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E
5|$|Around 956, Olaf, at Melkorka's urging, {{decided to}} go abroad to seek his fortune. Hoskuld was opposed and would not provide trade wares, and the {{property}} of Olaf's foster-father Thord was mostly in immobile goods and land. In <b>part</b> <b>to</b> arrange financing for his expedition, his mother Melkorka married Thorbjorn the Feeble, a farmer who had previously assisted her {{in the management of}} Melkorkustead.

5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> fallout from the Watergate scandal.|$|E

5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This was due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the fact that the set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly serving in the artillery or engineers and were assigned in most <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the task of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force would need to be raised.
