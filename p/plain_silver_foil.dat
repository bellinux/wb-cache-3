40|$|Efficient, stable {{catalysts}} {{with high}} selectivity {{for a single}} product are essential if electroreduction of CO 2 {{is to become a}} viable route to the synthesis of industrial feedstocks and fuels. A plasma oxidation pre-treatment of <b>silver</b> <b>foil</b> enhances the number of low-coordinated catalytically active sites, which dramatically lowers the overpotential and increases the activity of CO 2 electroreduction to CO. At − 0. 6 V versus RHE more than 90 % Faradaic efficiency towards CO was achieved on a pre-oxidized <b>silver</b> <b>foil.</b> While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed that oxygen species can survive in the bulk of the catalyst during the reaction, quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the surface is metallic under reaction conditions. DFT calculations reveal that the defect-rich surface of the plasma-oxidized <b>silver</b> <b>foils</b> in the presence of local electric fields drastically decrease the overpotential of CO 2 electroreduction...|$|R

40|$|The silver {{activation}} counters {{are commonly}} used for pulsed-neutron yield measurements especially in plasma focus devices. The counter normally consists of a Geiger-Muller tube along with <b>silver</b> <b>foils</b> and polyethylene (as a moderator), which is calibrated against an Am-Be radioisotope neutron source. The neutrons, after being slowed-down in the polyethylene, activate the <b>silver</b> <b>foils.</b> By measuring the foil activity with a Geiger-Muller counter, the neutron yield is determined. In the present paper, the activation counter’s calibration constant calculation using the MCNP 4 C code is explained. The calculated calibration constant is in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|In the Romanesque {{basilica}} S. Michele in Pavia {{there is}} a <b>silver</b> <b>foil</b> Crucifix {{that dates back to}} the XII century. During a precise restoration work carried out in 2003 the material was analyzed in order to obtain more precise information. In particular the analysis focused on the filling materials under the <b>silver</b> <b>foil</b> and on the characterization of their resins, which, according to the results, are colophony and beeswax. The filling material for the head is very probably the original one and its binder is wax, the filler of the body is different and very probably it was reintroduced during one of the previous restoration works on the crucifix, of which unfortunately we know nothing...|$|R
