As {{shown in}} this study, {{decreased}} <b>aeration</b> <b>rates</b> led to an increase of free mycelium in form of pellets or filaments and to higher mycotoxin concentrations. The optimal <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> {{was found to be}} 0.013 vvm in combination with an agitation rate of 900 rpm. A high agitation was necessary in combination with low <b>aeration</b> <b>rates</b> to prevent blocking of the air sparger due to fungal growth. For altersetin production a higher <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> (0.3 vvm) combined with lower agitation (100 rpm) was found to be optimal, but altersetin concentrations were not given for lower or higher agitation rates (Hellwig et al. 2002). Aflatoxin production with Aspergillus flavus was optimized by testing <b>aeration</b> <b>rates</b> at a constant stirring speed of 100 rpm (Hayes et al. 1966). The authors detected a nearly 20 fold increase in aflatoxin production when the aeration was enhanced from 0.6 vvm to 0.9 vvm. A further increase to 1.2 vvm resulted in decreasing aflatoxin concentrations. The effect of two <b>aeration</b> <b>rates</b> (0.5 vvm and 0.05 vvm) on fumonisin production in Fusarium proliferatum was studied by (Keller et al. 1997). The higher aeration with 0.5 vvm at an agitation with 500 rpm caused an increase of fumonisin production compared to the lower <b>aeration</b> <b>rate.</b> Although the comparability between all these studies is limited, it can be stated that the <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> has a considerable impact on fungal metabolites production. With respect to the optimal <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> for mycotoxin production a general statement cannot be given, but all studies found <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> below 1.0 vvm to be supportive for their processes, but for each process agitation has to be taken into account.

At constant stirrer speed of 150 rpm, the increase in <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> from 1 to 1. 5 LPM leads to proportional increase in peak Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) from 600 to 1000 mM L - 1 h.

The waste and wood chips as BA were composted in 300 L mechanically aerated reactors. The range of process conditions tested were: <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> from 1. 68 to 13. 04 L/h/kg of wet sludge; BA particle size distribution of < 10 mm, 10 - 20 mm and 20 - 30 mm, and; BA:PSS incorporation ratio of 0. 55 - 1. 11 (kg of wet wood chips/kg of wet sludge). The results showed that a high <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> and a high BA:PSS ratio produced a faster stabilization whereas BA of small particles size distribution increased the amount of biodegradable matter and slowed down stabilization. The composting temperature regime was positively correlated to O 2 consumption with a high BA:PSS ratio and a small BA particles size. A low <b>aeration</b> <b>rate,</b> without being O 2 limiting, optimized the composting process since too high or too low an <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> favored heat losses through respectively convection and water evaporation.

The objectives of this research were to examine the influence of the initial C/N value and <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> to the rate of co-composting process in reaching the C/N value that corresponds to SNI 19 - 7030 - 2004, and to characterize the compost produced. The research design used was factorial Complete Random Design (CRD) with two factors and two repetitions. The first factor was C/N value, consisted of 25; 30; 35 and the second factor was <b>aeration</b> <b>rate,</b> consisted of 0; 0, 4; 0, 8 L/min. kg of dry material. Composting was done using 30 L reactor by giving active intermittent aeration for 1 hour/day during the first 7 days of composting. Effects of initial C/N value and <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> were significantly different (P 0. 05) on pH value. Lower initial C/N value and higher <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> attained standard C/N value fastest. The best treatment based on the conformity with SNI 19 - 7030 - 2004 was initial C/N 25 with <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> 0, 8 L/minute. kg dry matter. The compost produced met the SNI standards in macro elements, trace elements,and other elements, but didnot qualify the pH value and moisture content...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{stimulating}} nitrification at low SRT by elevating pCO 2 during aeration is disclosed. The improvement on solids settling performance when elevated pCO 2 was supplied after 2 hours within the React cycle {{is consistent with}} the previous results that identified inorganic carbon as a potential remedy to poor settling and bulking sludge problems in activated sludge systems. Elevated pCO 2 increases the concentration of carbon dioxide and lowers the pH, which improve nitrification. The specific growth rate of nitrifying bacteria is sensitive to pCO 2, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO). The DO {{is a function of the}} <b>aeration</b> <b>rate.</b> Elevating the pCO 2 and lowering the <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> provides conditions for nitrification rates that are comparable to conventional systems. However, the lower <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> yields significant energy cost savings...|$|R
30|$|Different <b>aeration</b> <b>rates</b> {{have been}} recommended, such as 0.25  L min− 1  kg− 1  OM in the compost mixture of dairy manure and rice straw (Li et al. 2008), 0.62  L min− 1  kg− 1 Volatile Solids in the {{composting}} of vegetable and fruit wastes (Arslan et al. 2011) and 0.5  L min− 1  kg− 1 OM in the composting of chicken manure and sawdust (Gao et al. 2010). The <b>aeration</b> <b>rates</b> differed {{depending on the}} different materials being composted and the method of composting process. The objective of this work {{was to investigate the}} variations in physico-chemical properties, i.e., temperature, ammonia and carbon dioxide emissions, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), OM and the seed germination index (GI) of composting chicken manure mixed with sawdust and wood shavings under different <b>aeration</b> <b>rates</b> in a closed reactor system.|$|R
30|$|The {{multi-stage}} {{process was}} carried out according to our proposed stepwise aeration and agitation control strategy. The <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> was set at 6  L/min to achieve an <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> of 1.2 volumes of air per volume of liquid per minute (vvm), without agitation in stage I (0 – 48  h). The agitation rate was increased stepwise from 50 to 150 revolutions per minute (rpm) in stage II and subsequently kept constant at 200  rpm {{until the end of}} the fermentation. The <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> was set at 1.0 vvm from step II to step IV. Glucose (500  g/L stock solution) was fed into the fermentation broth during the entire fermentation process to maintain the glucose concentration at 5 – 20  g/L. Samples comprising 100  mL of the fermentation broth were taken periodically for further examination.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBioprocesses {{are often}} highly {{nonlinear}} due to process variability {{and complexity of}} biological systems. In this study, a series of batch experimental study was conducted on ethanol production using combined cassava and rejected mango fruits as a fermentation feedstock. The effects of pH and <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> were studied in the experiments. An advanced EMK model was developed to mathematically represent the simultaneous effects of pH and <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> on microbial kinetics for a highly nonlinear fermentation. The advantage of this proposed model is that it requires only small number of experimental runs to obtain a high-order order prediction response with an improved accuracy. The {{results showed that the}} model can fit the experimental data well within the given ranges of pH and <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> used in the study...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} {{variable}} mixing conditions arising from the different sets of <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> and stirrer speed on the ethanolic fermentation process, which utilizes the hydrolyzed cassava starch as carbon source. Interestingly, over the ranges of <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> and stirrer speed used in the study, the ethanol yield varied from 10 % to 85 % of theoretical maximum yield. Additionally over these experimental conditions, the selectivity of ethanol over glycerol varied from 3. 6 to 12. 3. One conclusion that {{can be drawn from}} this experimental study is that, the large variations in yield, selectivity and ethanol formation rate were more likely due to the different mixing conditions resulting from different values of <b>aeration</b> <b>rate</b> and stirrer speed, and less likely due to glucose and growth rates as previously reported...|$|R
