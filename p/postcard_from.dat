25|$|By 1971, {{when his}} daring, surreal opera, <b>Postcard</b> <b>from</b> Morocco, opened at Center Opera, Argento's {{national}} reputation was secure, in part {{thanks to a}} glowing review by the principal music critic of The New York Times. He eventually received commissions from New York City Opera, the newly formed Minnesota Opera, Washington Opera, and the Baltimore and St. Louis symphonies, among others. Argento also developed close professional relationships with several prominent singers, notably Frederica von Stade, Janet Baker, and Håkan Hagegård, tailoring some of his best-known song cycles to their talents.|$|E
25|$|Dominick Argento (born October 27, 1927) is an American {{composer}} {{known for}} his lyric operatic and choral music. Among his best known pieces are the operas <b>Postcard</b> <b>from</b> Morocco, Miss Havisham's Fire, The Masque of Angels, and The Aspern Papers. He also is known for the song cycles Six Elizabethan Songs and From the Diary of Virginia Woolf; the latter earned him the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1975. In a predominantly tonal context, his music freely combines tonality, atonality and a lyrical use of twelve-tone writing, though none of Argento's music approaches the experimental avant garde fashions of the post-World War II era.|$|E
500|$|Through much of 1970, Lennon had {{undergone}} primal therapy with Arthur Janov, {{a process that}} unearthed in him long-suppressed feelings of resentment and inadequacy relating to his childhood. For Lennon, according to author Peter Doggett, viewing the Beatles' film in this context [...] "felt like a <b>postcard</b> <b>from</b> a previous century: there he was, acting out the role that had become his life". He set about writing [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] as a sarcastic comment on his past. Lennon took the song's title from a catchphrase adopted by boxer Muhammad Ali, whom the Beatles had met in February 1964, shortly before filming A Hard Day's Night.|$|E

The track listing contained the radio edit of the track, a Soulshock & Karlin remix, and the B-side [...] "Outer Space Girls"—written by the group with Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard. The second version, released on a standard CD single, contained the radio edit, an orchestral version, and [...] "Walk of Life", a different B-side, written by the group with Absolute.

Every couple of years I'd get a <b>postcard</b> <b>from</b> the road – {{a picture of him}} standing next to a giant ice-sculpture of a crab, in Alaska. He was a very mysterious character. But I thought this was the right time to bring him in." [...] "The Next Messiah" [...] was influenced by her father. [...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your father might be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still trying to understand what happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened. But for some reason, these two people are so incredibly strange and funny and beautiful and messed up, that I want to keep writing about them... and maybe figure out who I am in the process." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "the main failure of Guest's {{otherwise}} excellent {{book is the}} absence of character: even his mother comes across rather as a history than a personality." [...] "My Life in Orange, though slightly patchwork in its construction, is an absorbing piece of writing, all the more compelling for begging as many questions as it answers and for the author's refusal to ask for pity," [...] wrote Geraldine Bedell in a review of the book in The Observer. Director of the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, Christopher Cook, characterized My Life in Orange as [...] "the most extraordinary account of his [...] childhood and the bravest writing I've read in ages". Sudipta Datta of the Indian Express described the book as [...] "a <b>postcard</b> <b>from</b> the past that the Osho ashram may not rave about." [...] Datta noted though that after having been angry with his mother and Rajneesh, Guest had reconciled with his family, reclaimed his childhood and come to see Rajneesh as [...] "a loveable rogue who got away with doing his own thing". Catherine A. Powers of The Boston Globe characterized the book as a [...] "moving, superbly written account of growing up in the midst of ... cruel madness". Michael E. Young of The Dallas Morning News gave the book a favorable review, and wrote: [...] "The book offers a glimpse into the thoughts of the followers, and examines the fine line between spirituality and insanity, between religion and cult." [...] Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times characterized the book as [...] "an intriguing and often humorous mix of straightforward 1980s nostalgia and cult delusion".|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a <b>postcard</b> <b>from</b> Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most {{beautiful}} and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. When I came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 30 April 2017 that EastEnders {{would make a}} [...] "subtle reference" [...] to Redwater in May, [...] "in a bid to keep the two shows in the same universe", revealing that Kat and Alfie have arrived in Ireland. The reference {{was made in the}} episode shown on 16 May 2017, two days before Redwater UK premiere, in which Kat's relative, Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner), receives a <b>postcard</b> <b>from</b> the pair. Redwater viewers noticed a continuity error in relation to this, as the flashback scene at the start of episode 1 is set in 1994, and then the story continues from [...] "21 years later", meaning it takes place in 2015, though Kat and Alfie left EastEnders in 2016 shortly after discovering that her son existed, and Stacey received the <b>postcard</b> <b>from</b> Kat in EastEnders in 2017. In Redwater, Kat refers to a postcard concerning her son dated from December 1983, though the EastEnders timeline gives her son's birth as being in February 1984. Additionally, Adam Postans from the Daily Mirror said that the details in EastEnders of how Kat discovers her son is in Redwater were either [...] "forgotten or abandoned" [...] as they are different in Redwater.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986 Plaza {{released}} a solo single, {{a cover of}} the 1960s Unit 4 + 2 song [...] "Concrete and Clay", which was a No.2 hit; the subsequent solo album, Plaza Suite, also charted. In 1991, during his sabbatical from Mental As Anything, Plaza collaborated with former member of Models, James Freud. As Beatfish, they released the self-titled album, Beatfish, {{which was one of}} the first Australian dance or house flavoured albums. Plaza's 1994 album Andy's Chest was composed almost entirely of Lou Reed covers. Another collaboration with Freud occurred in 1996 and resulted in the Hawaiian inspired Moondog project, with Plaza appearing on some tracks of the album <b>Postcard</b> <b>from</b> Hawaii.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1984, {{her version}} of [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] (their first single) was {{released}} and peaked just inside the UK Top 30.

Shaw embarked on two more successful university tours, and made appearances at Gay pride and Peace festivals.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of <b>Postcard</b> <b>from</b> Morocco in 1971, which had a {{libretto}} by Jon Donahue, the commissions given him were much larger. The University of Minnesota and Minnesota Opera together commissioned The Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe in 1975-76, with a libretto by Charles Nolte. As {{a result of that}} work, which received wildly enthusiastic reviews upon its premiere, the New York City Opera commissioned him. He composed [...] Miss Havisham's Fire (1977), with a libretto by Scrymgeour. Although not well received initially, Argento eventually revised it into a one-act monodrama entitled Miss Havisham's Wedding Night which Minnesota Opera premiered on May 1, 1981, at the Tyrone Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, conducted by Philip Brunelle. He revised Miss Havisham's Fire in 1995 and it has been successfully revived and performed since.|$|E
