50|$|Two-piece plain {{bearings}}, {{known as}} full bearings in industrial machinery, {{are commonly used}} for larger diameters, such as crankshaft bearings. The two halves are called shells. There are various systems used to keep the shells located. The most common method is a tab on the parting line edge that correlates with a notch in the housing to prevent axial movement after installation. For large, thick shells a button stop or dowel pin is used. The button stop is screwed to the housing, while the <b>dowel</b> pin <b>keys</b> the two shells together. Another less common method uses a <b>dowel</b> pin that <b>keys</b> the shell to the housing through a hole or slot in the shell.|$|R

40|$|Dowel Bar Inserters (DBI) are {{automated}} {{mechanical equipment}} that <b>position</b> <b>dowel</b> bars in Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) after concrete is placed. Compared to the alternative approach, which is using dowel baskets, DBIs offer advantages in cost {{and speed of}} construction. However, as dowel bars are not anchored to the subgrade similar to dowel baskets, there is a concern {{about the quality of}} dowel placement using this equipment. Improper placement of dowel bars can lead to reduced load transfer between slabs, which results in pavement distresses such as faulting and spalling at joints. To determine the accuracy of dowel placement by DBI, the Nebraska Department of Roads has used an MIT Scan- 2 device to scan the joints in projects where a DBI was used. This device uses a nondestructive magnetic imaging technique to capture the <b>position</b> of <b>dowel</b> bars inside the pavement. The aim of the this project is to analyze the MIT Scan- 2 data of the joints constructed using a DBI, and to compare them with the corresponding field performance data. This will allow us to judge if DBI is a reliable alternative for dowel placement, and to improve Nebraska’s current specifications for dowel placement tolerances. To meet the objectives, the MIT Scan- 2 data of scanned joints were initially compared with dowel placement specifications suggested by national agencies. It was observed that the longitudinal translation and rotation of dowels in a portion of scanned joints fell outside recommended tolerances. The longitudinal and vertical translation of the dowels were respectively higher and lower than the average values reported by a similar study (Khazanovich et al. 2009). MIT Scan- 2 data and field performance data were then compared to find any linkage between pavement distresses and dowel misalignment levels, enabling us to potentially improve Nebraska’s current specifications as well as conclude if any of the distresses were caused by low placement accuracy of the DBI. No linkage was found between pavement performance and dowel misalignment levels for over 220 joints that were investigated in this study. No transverse cracking was observed during field investigation, and the spalling at joints was likely {{to be the result of}} joint saw-cut operations. However, measured distress from joints with missing or completely shifted dowels show that high severity dowel misalignment has an adverse effect on joint performance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA double-layer {{structure}} model of pavements that considered interlayer contact status {{was established to}} manage the dowel-bar position deviation problem in rigid pavements. The deviation effect of three-dimensional positions, such as horizontal angle, vertical angle, and embedded depth, on joint load-transfer capacity was analyzed. A load-transfer capacity prediction model that considered <b>dowel</b> bar <b>position</b> deviation was established via ternary nonlinear regression. Load correction factor and its range were also proposed. This prediction model can effectively reflect the joint load-transfer capacity during <b>dowel</b> <b>position</b> deviation after verification via falling weight deflectometer testing. The horizontal angle of the dowel bar minimally affected joint load-transfer coefficient. By contrast, the joint load-transfer coefficient decreased almost linearly as the vertical angle increased. The coefficient reduced by approximately 12 % when the vertical angle was 15 °. Meanwhile, the load-transfer coefficient was maximized when a dowel bar was embedded {{in the middle of}} a surface. The coefficient would decline either upward or downward. The coefficient particularly decreased by 10 % when the position was 2 cm downward...|$|R
40|$|Engineered bamboo {{combines}} {{the benefits of}} a natural material with the advantages of a laminated composite, resulting in an efficient, light material well-suited to gridshell structures. Bamboo is a rapidly renewable material that can be harvested every 4 - 5 years. The round culm can either be used as is or it can be processed into a variety of laminated products. Engineered bamboo is currently promoted as a structural alternative to timber and glue-laminated timber, but also has potential in shell applications. In contrast to short fibre composites, engineered bamboo maintains fibre length and continuity within the raw material for exceptional mechanical properties. The composite section results in a high strength material in compression and tension, with bending properties comparable to timber products. The inherent flexibility of the material has advantages in comparison to timber, allowing for complex designs to be achieved. The present work explores the substitution of engineered bamboo in existing gridshells with a comparison to the original timber structure. As <b>dowelled</b> connections are <b>key</b> components at the boundary of gridshells, their potential for use with bamboo is also explored...|$|R
40|$|Most {{research}} {{studies in the}} portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement area focused on addressing distresses related to pavement structure itself. As a result, the design and construction of other structural elements of the concrete curb and curb and gutter (CCCG) system have been overlooked and not much {{research has been done}} in this area. Visual inspection of damaged CCCG systems was conducted in the field. All damaged CCCG systems were the TxDOT Type II system and almost all damaged CCCG systems were found at U-turn curbs due to excessive off tracking of traffic. Although geometric changes of the curb design are the fundamental solutions for the off tracking failure, such changes are not feasible in most cases due to economic and space limitations. Extensive finite element analysis was performed based on the new U-turn curb design of the TxDOT Houston district. The horizontal loading is the most critical loading condition to evaluate the structural adequacy of a CCCG system. The structural capacity of CCCG can be enhanced by increasing the curb width and/or by inserting the curb dowel further from the traffic face of CCCG. The use of the new U-turn curb design from the TxDOT Houston district is highly recommended for areas affected by the off tracking of heavy vehicles. It is recommended to <b>position</b> the curb <b>dowel</b> further from th...|$|R
40|$|Pavement joint {{movements}} and thermal stresses with seasonal and daily temperature variation are always {{one of the}} interesting topics in rigid pavement studies. In order to obtain the actual joint movement along with seasonal temperature changes, optical fibers were installed in the middle of concrete slabs during the re-construction process of some slabs at the taxiway N 1 of Chiang Kai-Shek (CKS) International Airport in Taiwan in January 2002. Taxiway N 1 is the primary taxiway which serves 42 % of the departure aircrafts and 18 % of the arriving aircrafts, approximate 26000 and 11100 operations annually each. Seven optical fiber sensors were embedded, in addition to the other 92 static and dynamic sensors, in four instrumented slabs. The 99 sensors are embedded in slabs # 3, # 5, # 6, and # 7. Slab # 6 is the main instrumented slab that includes most of the sensors (Figure 1). The embedded sensors include two types of static sensors, thermal and optical fiber sensors, and three types of dynamic sensors, H-bar strain gauges, gear <b>position</b> gauges, and <b>dowel</b> bar strain gauges. All data have been collected since January, 2002. The main objectives of this paper are to analyze the {{joint movements}} and stresses throughout the seasons and develop the prediction model of joint movements at different environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|A flume {{experiment}} {{is carried out}} to explore jamming of Large Woody Debris (LWD) in streams with complex morphology, occurring in mountain streams with in channel boulders or vegetation, in braided rivers or in floodplains during flood events. Non rooted, defoliated LWD is modeled using wood dowels and obstacles to motion are represented by vertical wood rods. Congested transport of LWD is simulated by insertion of a number (100) of <b>dowels.</b> The final <b>position</b> of the <b>dowels</b> is mapped and the observed jams are classified according to their size and position. The key member of each jam is identified and its trapping mechanism evaluated, either by leaning against a single obstacle or by bridging two obstacles. To mimic uncongested transport, the {{experiment is}} repeated for single pieces of wood, with subsequent removal. Longer dowels and shallower water result in shorter traveled distance. Wood pieces travel farther when congested transport is observed. The traveled distance of the wood pieces can be modeled using a Gamma distribution, for both congested and uncongested transport. Jams instead display Uniform traveled distance. The number of pieces displays an Exponential distribution. The degree of uniformity in space of jams and wood pieces is evaluated using a neighbor K statistic. Wood pieces show considerable clustering, while jams show sparse distribution. Eventually, the relationship between jams magnitude and position is explored, showing negative correlation. Model application is then discussed and some conclusions and future developments are outlined...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePrehension {{involves}} processing {{information in}} two hypothesized visuomotor channels: one for extrinsic object properties (e. g., the spatial location of objects) {{and one for}} intrinsic objects properties (e. g., shape and size). The present study asked how the two motor components that correspond to these channels (transport and grasp, respectively) are related. One way {{to address this question}} is to create a situation where unexpected changes occur at the input level of one of the visuomotor channels, and to observe how the movement reorganizes. If transport and grasp are independent components, then changing the object location, for example, should affect only the transport, not the grasp component. Subjects were requested to reach, grasp and lift as accurately as possible one of three dowels using the distal pads of the thumb and index finger. On certain trials, upon movement initiation towards the middle dowel, the dowel was made to instantaneously change its location to one of the two other positions, requiring the subject to reorient the hand to the new dowel location. Results consisted of comparing the movement characteristics of the transport and grasp components of these perturbed movements with appropriate control movements. Kinematics of the wrist trajectory showed fast adjustments, within 100 ms, to the change of <b>dowel</b> <b>position.</b> This duration seems to correspond to the minimum delay required within the visuomotor system for visual and/or proprioceptive reafferents to influence the ongoing movement. In addition, these delays are much shorter than has been found for conditions where object location changes before movement initiation (approximately 300 ms). The faster times may relate to the dynamic character of the deviant limb position signals, with the only constraint being the physiological delays for visual and kinaesthetic signals to influence the movement. A spatiotemporal variability analysis of the movement trajectories for non-perturbed trials showed variability to be greatest during the acceleration part of the movement, interpreted as due to control by a relatively inaccurate directional coding mechanism. Control during the deceleration phase, marked by low trajectory variability, was seen to be due to a sensorimotor process, using motor output signals, and resulting in an optimized trajectory supporting a successful grasp. Analysis of the grasp component of prehension showed that perturbing object location influenced the movement of the fingers suggesting a kinematic coupling of the two components. However, forthcoming work shows that, when object size changes, and location remains constant, there is a clear temporal dissociation of the two components of prehension.

40|$|Timber floor {{systems are}} often used as {{separating}} floors between dwellings in multi-storey buildings as they are a sustainable, economical, lightweight solution. However, compared to concrete floors, typical timber joist floor systems tend to provide lower impact sound insulation in the low-frequency range (below 200 Hz). The research in this thesis forms part of a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation {{to develop a new}} dowelled-joist timber floor using Swiss hardwood with the aim of improving the impact sound insulation below 200 Hz. This floor consists of dowel-connected joists that form an assembly which can then be connected to other assemblies using metal screws. It is sufficiently complex that numerical models are required to give insight into its dynamic response and its sound radiation; hence in this thesis, finite element models are developed and validated to carry out this modelling. Finite element models have been developed and validated against experimental modal analysis in terms of eigen-frequencies and mode shapes for individual beam assemblies and a complete dowelled-joist timber floor formed from three assemblies. Models of increasing complexity have been developed to find an approach that provides good agreement with experimental results. This has resulted in a model that use spring connections at the <b>dowel</b> <b>positions</b> combined with precise modelling of the boundary conditions at the two ends of the assemblies. Close agreement has been achieved between this model and results from experimental modal analysis with the differences between the eigen-frequencies in the majority of the mode pairs being less than 10 %. Close agreement has also been achieved in terms of modeshapes with MAC values greater than 80 % {{for the majority of the}} mode pairs. For sound radiation from a rectangular plate into a rectangular room, a finite element model has been developed for fluid-structure interaction. The finite element model has been validated against a normal mode model for both a 140 mm and 180 mm concrete plate. This validated approach to modelling has then been used to predict sound radiation from the dowelled-joist timber floor into a rectangular room. In order to accommodate a finite element model of the dowelled-joist floor which had ‘virtual gaps’ between the joists it was necessary to introduce a ‘transfer plate’ to transfer the motion from the dowelled-joist timber floor to the acoustic medium. This approach appears to be novel as no mention of it has been found in the literature. Use of this transfer plate was validated in terms of both vibration and sound radiation. Compared to the concrete floors the dowelled-joist floor was found to have significant sound radiation around the 16 Hz band (near the lowest eigen-frequency). The work carried out in this thesis will enable future research to make a more detailed assessment of the impact sound insulation for the dowelled-joist timber floor...|$|R
