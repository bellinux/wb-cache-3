40|$|Streams and {{groundwater}} {{of the greater}} <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound</b> Lowlands directly feed the larger water bodies of the region, including Lake Washington, Hood Canal, and <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound</b> itself. Therefore, stemming the flow of pollutants into streams {{and groundwater}}, and ensuring adequate recharge of groundwater, is vital to protecting the productivity of these ecologically and economically important <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound</b> water bodies. Most pollutants of <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound</b> streams are non point-sourced- meaning they cannot be definitively tracked back to a single, or several, polluters. Instead, the pollution comes {{as a result of}} a more difficult-to-control, amalgamation of human-induced factors. Research shows the main antagonists for nonpoint source pollution of water bodies in the <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound</b> region are chemical fertilizers, storm water runoff, dysfunctional (and even functional) septic systems, and urbanization ofonce rural areas. Indeed, the Governor's 2005 <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound</b> Partnership found that reducing and controlling non-point source pollution from these same antagonists to be one of the most pressing issues regarding the clean-up and revitalization of ailing <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound.</b> First understanding how these factors combine to pollute the streams that feed Hood Canal and <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound,</b> and then making some small investments and simple changes in the way we manage the water that flows from our property into these streams and groundwater, are significant steps toward alleviating the pressure of urbanization and pollution on the health of <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound</b> and the greater <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound</b> watershed. This paper surveys the ecological problems created by urbanization and conventional stormwater management in the <b>Puget</b> <b>Sound</b> region, and explores the feasibility of implementing raingardens, pervious pavement, and native plantings to facilitate stormwater runoff reduction and bioremediation.
