40|$|THE {{validity}} of contracts is not governed in Germany by a unitary rule. With respect to capacity and formalities the Introductory Law to the Civil Code lays down general provisions which are applicable to contracts. Article 7, paragraph 1, {{of this law}} provides that the capacity to do juristic acts shall be governed by the national law. The capacity to contract is to be determined, therefore, {{with reference to the}} national law of each of the contracting parties. The rule is laid down generally and controls irrespective of whether the party in question is a German or a foreigner. The national law determines whether a person is a minor and whether a married woman can contract without authorization from her husband. It determines also the method, if any, by which the capacity of a <b>person</b> <b>under</b> <b>disability</b> can be supplemented, as, for example, by authorization from his legal representative or a court of guardianship. The national law applies likewise to disabilities resulting from judicial action, such as the appointment of a guardian for a spendthrift; for, contrary to Anglo-American law, the effect of such an appointment is ubiquitous in its operation in continental countries. This assumes, of course, that the appointment of the guardian was validly made in accordance with the German principles of the conflict of laws...|$|E

A married woman could not historically act as next friend but this practice is no longer current, at least in the United States, where either or both of a minor's parents may act as next friend. (An exception is in divorce cases or other cases affecting child custody; in such cases courts often appoint a guardian or attorney (independent of the parents) to represent the child's interests, which may not be aligned with either parent's interests.) ...|$|R

50|$|In common law, a {{next friend}} (Law French prochain ami) {{is a person}} who {{represents}} another <b>person</b> who is <b>under</b> <b>disability</b> or otherwise unable to maintain a suit on his or her own behalf and who does not have a legal guardian. In England and Wales they are known as litigation friends. When a relative who is next of kin acts as a next friend for a person, that person is sometimes instead described as the natural guardian of the person. A next friend has full power over the proceedings in the action as if he or she were an ordinary plaintiff, until a guardian or guardian ad litem is appointed in the case; but the next friend is entitled to present evidence only on the same basis as any other witness.|$|R

40|$|International {{protection}} {{of persons with}} disabilities Summary The theme of this thesis is the {{protection of}} <b>persons</b> with <b>disabilities</b> <b>under</b> international law. In last decades {{there have been a}} dramatic shift in the perception of disability. It has changed from medical approach to the social model of disability, which is closely connected with the human rights perspective on the "disability rights". This paradigm shift has culminated in adoption of the United Nations Convention on the rights of people with disabilities. Violating of their human have several forms and is spreaded all over the world. Nevertheless, the number of them is still growing. According to the WHO estimations about 15 % of world population live with some form of disability and most of them in developing countries in the condictions of the lack of elementary resources and support. Relation between disability, discrimination, poverty nad social exclusion is thus more than clear. On the other hand, people with disabilities definitely do not present any kind of homogeneous group. Diversity of people with disabilities brings a serious challenge in the various forms of obstacles and barriers preventing them from full and equal enjoyment of their human rights and thus a wide range of measures necessary to eliminate them. The aim of this work [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the civil}} {{commitment}} arena, where a {{mentally ill person}} is allegedly {{a danger to the}} life or safety of themselves or of others and in need of in-patient care or treatment, there are two groups assigned to protect the people: one, the hospital presenter, who is responsible for investigating and presenting evidence and testimony at a hearing to secure admission to a psychiatric facility as an involuntary patient, the other, the lawyer, who represents and defends the allegedly mentally ill person from such involuntary civil commitment confinement. These are their stories. The attorney representing a mentally ill client at the involuntary admission hearing (IVA) often faces challenges in defining his role and responsibility toward his client and the community at large. There are occasions when a client 2 ÃÜ 7 s mental disorder makes it impossible to effectively communicate his desires and wishes to his lawyer. The client 2 ÃÜ 7 s ability to aid his attorney in preparing an adequate defense to the application for involuntary admission is severely compromised. There are occasions at the civil commitment hearing when the individual subject to the commitment is silent as a result of cognitive impairment, which places the attorney in the position of advocating a position without the input of the client. The hospital presenter who seeks the involuntary confinement into the psychiatric hospital is opposed by an attorney without clear instructions from the client as to how to proceed. This article will discuss and analyze the attorney 2 ÃÜ 7 s role in light of the silent or incapacitated mentally ill client. An historical perspective of the traditional role of counsel will be examined and compared with the guardian ad litem role. The American Bar Association (ABA) standards will be scrutinized to seek guidance in understanding the duty an attorney owes to competently represent his client and keep him informed as to the proceedings and abide by decisions made by the client in the legal proceedings at hand. When a client is a <b>person</b> <b>under</b> a <b>disability,</b> the role and responsibility of counsel are often complex and confused, thus this article will examine court decisions addressing the constitutional right to counsel, as well as seek guidance from state statutes addressing right to counsel at the civil commitment hearing as to the role of counsel at the hearing...|$|R

40|$|The central {{hypothesis}} {{is the assumption}} that changing social and economical conditions during the eighteenth and nineteenth century contributed to a rising segregation and stigmatization of <b>persons</b> with <b>disabilities.</b> <b>Under</b> the influence of industrialisation and medicalisation an evolution would have taken place from informal care from relatives to institutions. "Disabled people came to be regarded as a social and educational problem and more and more were segregated in institutions of all kinds. ‚Äù (Oliver 1990). This widely accepted view is tested using an as large as possible cohort of congenital deaf men and women across two generations (1750 - 1810 and 1830 - 1860) in East-Flanders. As part of a broader research, this paper focuses on preliminary results concerning social networks and the institutionalization of the deaf. To this end witnesses appearing in civil records of the deaf are examined. The extent to which the deaf were able to live an independent life, or otherwise were dependent on family members or institutions, is derived from residential information, available via civil registration and population registers. Questions as: To what extent did the deaf participate in a full-fledged manner in family and social life? In what manner did their social networks change {{in the course of the}} eighteenth and nineteenth century? And which (changing) role played institutions in the lives of the deaf? are the focal point of my contribution...|$|R
