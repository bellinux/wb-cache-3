50|$|LAPB has no master/slave node relationships. The sender {{uses the}} Poll bit in command frames {{to insist on}} an {{immediate}} response. In the response frame this same bit becomes the receivers <b>Final</b> <b>bit.</b> The receiver always turns on the <b>Final</b> <b>bit</b> in its response to a command from the sender with the Poll bit set. The P/F bit is generally used when either end becomes unsure about proper frame sequencing because of a possible missing acknowledgment, and {{it is necessary to}} re-establish a point of reference. It is also used to trigger an acknowledgment of outstanding I-frames.|$|R
5000|$|In ARM and ABM, the P bit {{forces a}} response. In these modes, the {{secondary}} need {{not wait for}} a poll to transmit, so need not wait to respond with a <b>final</b> <b>bit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A sixth single, [...] "Take Me Back to the Country", was {{released}} that same year, but is rarely known, {{and it was}} the <b>final</b> <b>bit</b> of promotion for this album. The single did not chart.|$|R

50|$|A <b>final</b> <b>bit</b> of code adds up {{the wires}} {{and other items}} needed for assembly, and prints these {{on the front of}} a listing. This lets the {{materials}} for boards to be assembled before a production run.|$|R
5000|$|The {{algorithm}} {{begins with}} the n+1 bit state [...] That is, the first n bits are each in the state [...] and the <b>final</b> <b>bit</b> is [...] A Hadamard transform is applied to each bit to obtain the state ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{operator}} {{can be used}} to set bits in a {{bit field}} to 1, by -ing the field with a constant field with the relevant bits set to 1. For example, [...] will force the <b>final</b> <b>bit</b> to 1 while leaving other bits unchanged.|$|R

50|$|McCain {{won every}} pre-election <b>poll.</b> The <b>final</b> 3 <b>polls</b> {{averaged}} McCain leading 50% to 40%.|$|R
5000|$|Numbers {{below are}} {{percentages}} of opinion <b>poll</b> responders; <b>final</b> tally projections {{are shown in}} italics.|$|R

50|$|Kerry won most pre-election <b>polling.</b> The <b>final</b> 3 <b>poll</b> average had Kerry leading 50% to 45%.|$|R
30|$|In this case, Q=W_N_u^(i_u)=W_N_u^(j_u). The <b>final</b> <b>bit</b> {{channels}} i and j {{are obtained}} as W_N^(i)=Q_N_l^(i_l) and W_N^(j)=Q_N_l^(j_l). Because W_N_l^(i_l)≽ W_N_l^(j_l) {{and the relationship}} between W_N_l^(i_l) and W_N_l^(j_l) is channel independent (the condition of this proposition), we can conclude that no matter what the condition of Q is, W_N^(i)≽ W_N^(j) holds.|$|R

50|$|Thermal {{protection}} systems and atmospheric friction {{have been used}} historically to reduce most of the kinetic energy {{that needs to be}} lost prior to landing, with parachutes and, sometimes, a <b>final</b> <b>bit</b> of retropropulsion used in the final landing. High-altitude high-velocity retropropulsion is being researched for future transport flights landing heavier cargos.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{processing}} parameters {{with the}} first two bits for the sampling rate, next bit flags 16-bit sample size on with off indicating 8-bit sample size, and the <b>final</b> <b>bit</b> flags stereophonic channels on with off indicating monaural only.

30|$|Encoding: The second {{component}} can {{be regarded}} as a discrete-to-binary mapping process, where the resultant index of each dimension is mapped to a unique n-bit binary codeword of an encoding scheme. Next, the codeword output of every feature dimension is concatenated to form the <b>final</b> <b>bit</b> string of a user. The discretization performance is finally evaluated in the Hamming domain.|$|R
50|$|Kerry {{won every}} single pre-election <b>poll.</b> The <b>final</b> 3 <b>poll</b> {{averaged}} Kerry leading 52% to 42% for Bush and 2% for Nader.|$|R
