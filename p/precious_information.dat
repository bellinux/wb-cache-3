25|$|The {{foundations}} for which ligand binding assay {{have been built}} {{are a result of}} Karl Landsteiner, in 1945, and his work on immunization of animals through the production of antibodies for certain proteins. Landsteiner’s work demonstrated that immunoassay technology allowed researchers to analyze at the molecular level. The first successful ligand binding assay was reported in 1960 by Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Solomon Berson. They investigated the binding interaction for insulin and an insulin-specific antibody, in addition to developing the first radioimmunoassay (RIA) for insulin. These discoveries provided <b>precious</b> <b>information</b> regarding both the sensitivity and specificity of protein hormones found within blood-based fluids. Yalow and Berson received the Nobel Prize in Medicine {{as a result of their}} advancements. Through the development of RIA technology, researchers have been able to move beyond the use of radioactivity, and instead, use liquid- and solid-phase, competitive, and immunoradiometric assays. As a direct result of these monumental findings, researchers have continued the advancement of ligand binding assays in many facets in the fields of biology, chemistry, and the like.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} the {{real-time}} reconstruction of plasma insulin concentration by using only blood glucose measurements is investigated. This is an interesting problem because the knowledge of the time course of the glucose and insulin concentrations in an individual provides <b>precious</b> <b>informations</b> concerning its health state, and may assume the role of a clinical instrument. For the purpose of the reconstruction of the insulinemia a dynamical model of the glucose-insulin homeostasis is required. The present work considers distributed delay models. Such models have been preferred in recent papers with respect to the standard Minimal Models, available in literature from 70 's, because they allow to couple the glucose and insulin dynamics in a unique extended system, whose solutions have been proven to be positive, bounded, and globally asymptotically stable around the basal values of the equilibrium point. Data are ac-quired according to the Intra Venous Glucose Tolerance Test (IVGTT). Simulation results are reported in order to validate the developed theory...|$|R

40|$|We discuss non-perturbative {{corrections}} to the neutrino sector, in {{the context}} of a D-brane Pati-Salam-like model, that can be obtained as a simple alternative to $SO(10) $ GUT's in theories with open and unoriented strings. In such D-brane models, exotic stringy instantons can correct the right-handed neutrino mass matrix in a calculable way, thus affecting mass hierarchies and modifying the see-saw mechanism to what we name exotic see-saw. For a wide range of parameters, a compact spectrum of right-handed neutrino masses can occur that gives rise to a predictive scenario for low energy observables. This model also provides a viable mechanism for Baryon Asymmetry in the Universe (BAU) through leptogenesis. Finally, a Majorana mass for the neutron is naturally predicted in the model, leading to potentially testable neutron-antineutron oscillations.

40|$|Circulating analytes {{used in the}} {{exploration}} of thyroid function are TSH and free thyroid hormones (FT 4 and FT 3). TSH is used as first line analysis in diagnosis because a normal value excludes almost always a thyroid dysfunction. However in the follow up of a treatment for hypo- or hyperthyroidism, free hormones are to be determined since TSH reaction is delayed and does not reflect precisely the restoration of euthyroidism. The measurement of anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-TPO) will show {{the presence of an}} autoimmune thyroiditis and that of thyroid stimulating antibodies (TSI) will establish the diagnosis of Graves' disease. The measurement of circulating thyroglobulin has no place in the diagnostic of thyroid dysfunction nor in the evaluation of a goitre but it is now the golden standard in the follow up of patients with a differentiated thyroid cancer after surgery and radioiodine ablation in patients without antithyroglobulin antibodies. Echography is the first line examination to evaluate thyroid morphology. It shows tiny thyroid nodules and gives <b>precious</b> <b>informations</b> on their structure, as well as paremchymatous diffuse abnormalities associated with thyroiditis. Thyroid scintigraphy with 99 mTc allows establishing the functional characteristics of thyroid nodules (warm or cold) and to precise the origin of a thyrotoxicosis (autonomous toxic nodule vs Graves-Basedow, sub acute or silent thyroiditis). Whole body scintigraphy is mandatory after radioiodine treatment with 131 I in order to visualize possible metastasis and establish their avidity for iodine.
