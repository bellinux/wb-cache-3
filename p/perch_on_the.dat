5|$|The red-billed chough's food {{consists}} {{largely of}} insects, spiders and other invertebrates {{taken from the}} ground, with ants probably being the most significant item. The Central Asian subspecies P. p. centralis will <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> backs of wild or domesticated mammals to feed on parasites. Although invertebrates make {{up most of the}} chough's diet, it will eat vegetable matter including fallen grain, and in the Himalayas has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn. In the Himalayas, they form large flocks in winter.|$|E
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E

25|$|After {{one term}} as mayor, Clark {{narrowly}} defeated incumbent Republican Senator James H. Duff in the 1956 Senate election. Clark {{earned a reputation}} as a strong supporter of civil rights and worked to appoint liberal committee members from his <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Steering Committee. Clark narrowly won re-election in 1962 but was defeated in 1968 by Congressman Richard Schweiker. His defeat is generally credited to his support of gun control and opposition to the Vietnam War. After leaving office, Clark became a professor at Temple University.|$|E
25|$|Refurbishment {{of power}} {{generation}} and transmission systems at Black Eagle Dam began in 2010. In June of that year, PPL Montana initiated a $55 million effort to replace {{overhead power lines}} connecting the dam to the area's electric grid. The new power lines (which replaced equipment more than 80 years old) were more widely spaced apart, to permit large birds to pass safely through or <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> power lines. PPL also said it was replacing the electrical substation next to the dam's powerhouse. Both projects {{are expected to be}} complete in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Within two weeks, road watch {{reconnaissance}} teams {{began to}} report heavy inbound communist traffic. By mid-May, {{it was known}} that three PAVN battalions were en route from Vietnam with orders to retake Muang Soui. Enemy troops were also being withdrawn from their probe against the guerrilla main bases to pressure the Hmong guerrillas. A pincer attack on Phonsavan was threatened, with prongs poised south and northeast of the town. On 21 May 1969, the PAVN 174th Regiment knocked the irregulars from their <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill north of town. The next day, one company of the paratroopers tried to recapture the hill while the other held the town. On 23 May, the PAVN overran Phonsavan and the paratroopers withdrew, having suffered 200 casualties. However, even as Vang Pao gave back some of his gained ground to his enemies, the USAF followed up on Raindance with Operation Stranglehold.|$|E

25|$|Male territories {{occur in}} light {{gaps in the}} forest, {{including}} treefalls and trails, and are almost nonexistent in areas of uninterrupted forest. Approximately half of these territories are solitary, of which males tend to be attracted to treefalls which have more potential territory sites. Each territory usually consists of a <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trunk of a tree about 0.5 to 1.5 m above the ground, on which the male is displayed, and a route which the male “patrols” {{to and from the}} perch. Perches are normally located on tree trunks located on the edge of treefalls. Patrol routes normally extend out into the whole open treefall space. However, it has been noted that territories don’t contain flowering plants, sources from which to collect aromatic material (such as tree wounds), nest sites, or nest-building materials. Males also had a preference for use straight, smooth-barked trees about 5 to 10cm in diameter, with an unobstructed view from the perch site. Studies have also shown that perches for E. imperialis were almost always in the shade receiving between 27.8 and 92.9 lux on sunny days and 14.8 to 46.4 lux on overcast days.|$|E
500|$|The grassy {{expanse of}} the newly {{developed}} Columbia Park {{turned out to be}} an ideal habitat for gophers and quickly attracted and maintained a gopher population of more than 600 animals. The gopher holes made it impossible to use the fields to play sports. The gopher population was so large that an [...] "exceptionally sized" [...] hawk could <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the KNX antenna and repeatedly swoop down, snatch a gopher, and fly back to the top of the antenna to consume. Other animals also survived on the gophers.|$|E
500|$|In Slavic mythology, the sparrowhawk, {{known as}} krahui or krahug, {{is a sacred}} bird in Old Bohemian songs and lives in a grove of the gods.

500|$|The {{white-naped xenopsaris}} feeds on insects, but no studies have yet {{been done on}} the diet of adults. Chicks in the nest are fed {{grasshoppers}} from the family Acrididae, mantidflies, praying mantises and mosquitoes. Adults typically hunt singly or sometimes in pairs, and breeding pairs can often be observed hunting well apart from each other. They are shy, generally quiet and inconspicuous. They typically hunt from a <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{outer edge of the}} foliage of trees, watching for prey and then launching themselves [...] to snatch prey off leaves. They also strike from a hovering position above foliage, and may chase prey acrobatically for some distance. They often feed near the ground and sometimes take prey from the ground as well as from vegetation.|$|E
500|$|In hotter weather, double drummers <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper {{branches}} of trees, while on overcast or rainy days, {{they may be}} found lower down on trunks near the ground. Double drummers on tree trunks are skittish, and can fly off en masse if disturbed. Relative to other Australian cicadas they have excellent perception, fly at a moderate cruising speed of , with a similarly moderate maximum speed of , and are exceptionally adept at landing. The double drummer {{has been known to}} fly out to sea, effectively on a one-way trip as their bodies have later been found washed up on beaches. A swarm of double drummers were reported [...] off the coast of Sussex Inlet in January 1979, in and around the boat of a local fisherman.|$|E
500|$|Flows in {{the river}} are swelled by {{discharges}} from several sewage treatment works. The three largest are at Princes Marsh, Petersfield and Ambersham, {{all of which have}} outflows between [...] per day, with another three discharging between [...] per day at Rogate, Coultershaw and Fittleworth. The entire river, including parts of some of its tributaries, is designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance by the local authorities through which it flows, in recognition of its value for wildlife. The upper reaches of the Rother are important for their fish populations of brown trout, grayling, juvenile sea trout, and the spawning and early development of salmonids. There are also populations of bullhead, eel, lamprey, minnow and stone loach. There has been some concern about declining fish stocks, thought to be partly caused by soil erosion, leading to silt and sediments being deposited on the river bed, which has been exacerbated by low flows {{in the river}}. Parts of the lower river support the same types of fish, but there are areas, particularly immediately upstream of weirs, where the major species are bream, pike and roach, with chubb, dace and <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lowest reaches. In order to assist the movement of fish along the river, particularly those that migrate to the headwaters to spawn, fish passes have been constructed around the gauging stations. The only known population of native white clawed crayfish in Sussex is located in {{the upper reaches of the}} Rother.|$|E

2500|$|Ornithophily or bird {{pollination}} is the pollination {{of flowering}} plants by birds. This coevolutionary association {{is derived from}} insect pollination (entomophily) and is particularly well developed {{in some parts of}} the world, especially in the tropics and on some island chains. The association involves several distinctive plant adaptations forming a [...] "pollination syndrome". The plants typically have colourful, often red, flowers with long tubular structures holding ample nectar and orientations of the stamen and stigma that ensure contact with the pollinator. Birds involved in ornithophily tend to be specialist nectarivores with brushy tongues, long bills, capable of hovering flight or are light enough to <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flower structures.|$|E
2500|$|The tripodfish Bathypterois grallator uses tactile and mechanosensory cues to {{identify}} food; it apparently {{does not have}} special visual adaptations to help it find food in the low-light environment. When the fish is perched with its long rays on the ocean floor, it can get food without even seeing it. The tripodfish’s mouth ends up {{at just the right}} height to catch shrimp, tiny fish, and small crustaceans swimming by. They seem to prefer to <b>perch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mud using much elongated fin rays in their tails and two pelvic fins to stand, facing upstream into the current to ambush with the pectoral fins turned forward so [...] the outthrust projecting fins resemble multiple antennae. The fish senses objects in the water with its front fins. [...] These fins act like hands. [...] Once they feel prey and realize it is edible, the fins knock the food into the fish’s mouth. [...] The fish faces into the current, waiting for prey to drift by.|$|E
