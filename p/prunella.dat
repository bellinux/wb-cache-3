40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the in-vivo anti-tumour activity of Spica <b>prunellae</b> extract, and to preliminarily explore the possible mechanism of in-vivo anti-tumour effect of Spica <b>prunellae</b> extract. Tumour inhibition rate and tumour apoptosis-related protein status were determined using the mice model of transplanted T lymphoma cell EL- 4 tumour, and by immunohistochemical method. The results revealed that Spica <b>prunellae</b> extract showed certain tumour inhibitory effect, and compared with the model group. Tumour weight in Spica <b>prunellae</b> high-dose group was highly significantly different (P< 0. 01). Tumour weight in Spica <b>prunellae</b> medium-dose group was also significantly different (P< 0. 05) compared with the model group. Spica <b>prunellae</b> high-dose group enabled the high expression of Bcl- 2 protein (47. 54 %) and low expression of Bax protein (13. 14 %). The study concluded that Spica <b>prunellae</b> extract has certain in vivo anti-tumour effect, which may be achieved through regulation of apoptosis related proteins.

5|$|Whalebone was foaled in 1807 out of {{the mare}} Penelope, who was a {{daughter}} of <b>Prunella.</b> He raced for six years and won the Derby in 1810.

5|$|The {{accentors}} are {{a family}} of small ground-living insectivorous birds, {{most of which are}} found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the dunnock is a lowland species. Their relationships with other bird families are uncertain. All accentors are placed in a single genus, <b>Prunella,</b> but within that genus, the Siberian accentor is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian accentors. These are of comparable in size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 phylogenetic study indicates that the closest relative of the Siberian accentor is actually the physically dissimilar Japanese accentor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Spica <b>Prunellae</b> {{has long}} {{been used as a}} signifi-cant {{component}} in numerous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas to clinically treat cancers. Previously, Spica <b>Prunellae</b> was shown to promote cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. To further elucidate the precise mechanism of its tumoricidal activity, the effect of the ethanol extract of Spica <b>Prunellae</b> (EESP) on the proliferation of human colon carcinoma HT- 29 cells was elucidated and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. The proliferation of HT- 29 cells was evaluated using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl-thiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and colony formation analyses. The cell cycle was determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with propidium iodide (PI) staining. The mRNA and protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4) and cyclin D 1 was examined using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. EESP was observed to inhibit HT- 29 viability and survival in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, EESP treatment blocked G 1 /S cell cycle progres-sion and reduced the expression of pro-proliferative cyclin D 1 and CDK 4 at the transcriptional and translational levels. Altogether, these data suggest that the inhibition of cell prolif-eration via G 1 /S cell cycle arrest {{may be one of the}} mechanisms through which Spica <b>Prunellae</b> treats cancer...|$|R

5|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{a significant}} predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64.8million bird deaths each year. A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds {{each year in the}} United States. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat. In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (<b>Prunella</b> modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher A. J. Ayer was a pupil at Ascham St Vincent's School in Carlisle Road. The artist Eric Ravilious grew up, {{was educated}} and taught in Eastbourne. In {{addition}} to Orwell, Connolly, Beaton, Maxwell and Longhurst {{listed on the}} St Cyprian's School blue plaque, the writers Alaric Jacob, E. H. W. Meyerstein and Alan Hyman also attended that school. The biographer and historian Philip Ziegler was a pupil as was the music historian Dyneley Hussey and politician, historian and diarist Alan Clark. Other politicians were Richard Wood who had lost both legs in the war, and David Ormsby-Gore later ambassador to the USA. Artists Cedric Morris and David Kindersley also attended the school as did military figures such as General Sir Lashmer Whistler and Major General Henry Foot VC. Pupils with sporting connections include the amateur jockey Anthony Mildmay and Seymour de Lotbiniere Director of Outside Broadcasts at the BBC. Jagaddipendra Narayan was a reigning Maharaja of Cooch Behar while at the school. Other former pupils include the war-blinded life peer Lord Fraser and the submarine commander Rupert Lonsdale. NASA aerospace engineer Bruce Woodgate, who attended Eastbourne Grammar School, was the principal investigator and designer of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, which was installed on the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a novel polysaccharide, PSP- 2 B, was {{isolated}} from aqueous extracts of <b>Prunellae</b> Spica by direct ultrafiltration membrane separation and gel chromatography purification. PSP- 2 B is a partially sulphated polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 32 kDa. Its sulfate content is 10. 59 % by elemental analysis. The major sugars comprising PSP- 2 B are arabinose, galactose and mannose, {{in addition to}} small amounts of glucose and uronic acids. The framework of PSP- 2 B is speculated to be a branched arabinogalactomannan, and the side chains are terminated primarily by the Araf residues. PSP- 2 B also contains 2. 98 % protein. PSP- 2 B exhibits activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV), with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of approximately 69 mu g/mL for HSV- 1 and 49 mu g/mL for HSV- 2. However, PSP- 2 B demonstrated no cytotoxicity even when its concentration was increased to 1600 mu g/mL, suggesting that it has potential as an anti-HSV drug candidate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{capillary}} electrophoresis (CE) procedure {{has been developed}} for the separation of 25 inorganic and organic acid anions using a buffer system consisting of 15 mM tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane, 3 mM 1, 2, 4 -benzenetricarboxylic acid, 1. 5 mM tetraethylenepentaamine (TEPA) and 20 % methanol with pH adjusted to 8. 4. A good separation of organic acids extracted from a mixture of Chinese traditional medicine (TCM) containing three herbs, Flos chrysthemi, Spica <b>prunellae,</b> and Folium mori was obtained using the procedure developed with satisfactory working range (0. 20 - 77 mg/g), low detection limit (90 - 190 μg/g), and good repeatability (relative standard deviation 4. 47 - 6. 99 %, n = 4). A satisfactory extraction of organic acids was achieved within 20 min using 0. 1 m NaOH. The addition of TEPA to provide a reduced compounds electroosmotic flow (EOF) environment was shown to remove interfering organic compounds extracted from TCM. The applicability of using organic acids as markers for determining the mixing ratio of constituent herbs for a TCM mixture was investigated using a three-component mixture with a 1 : 1 : 1 mixing ratio. A satisfactory mixing ratio of 1. 04 : 1. 09 : 0. 98 was obtained using the methodology developed based on organic acids as markers. The application of our method for determining more complicated TCM mixtures has been discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
