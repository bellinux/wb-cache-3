40|$|In the Narcea Antiform, both Ediacaran upper {{volcanic}} {{series and}} volcanic clasts in the overlying Cambrian micro-conglomerates, show geochemistry between those of calc-alkaline and alkaline {{series in the}} TAS diagram, and a mainly calc-alkaline trend in the Zr/TiO 2 -Nb/Y diagram. However, zircons reveal a common high temperature nature of the crystals and have overall characteristics typical of alkaline magmas. Such an apparent contradiction {{can be interpreted as}} a result of a change in the tectonic conditions. This would account for the mixed characteristics of rocks having a calc-alkaline geochemical signature but with an alkaline mineral assemblage. Moreover, zircon morphology has turned out to be an interesting clue to resolve the petrographical and geochemical discrimination in low-grade metamorphosed <b>paleovolcanic</b> <b>rock...</b>|$|E
