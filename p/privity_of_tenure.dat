It calls for a re-consideration of the rule {{along the lines of the}} Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 (UK) which presages a relaxation of the current restrictions upon refusal of consent to assignments of lease but without any residual liability in the immediate assignor of the lease remaining.

40|$|<b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> {{contract}} {{has lately}} been criticized in several European jurisdictions, particu-larly {{due to the}} onerous consequences it gives rise to in arrangements typical for the modern exchange such as chains <b>of</b> contracts. <b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> contract is a classical premise of contract law, which prohibits a third party to acquire or enforce rights under a contract to which {{he is not a}} party. Such a premise is usually seen to be manifested in the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract developed under common law, however, the jurisdictions of continental Europe do recognize a corresponding starting point in contract law. One of the traditional industry sectors affected by this premise is the construction industry. A typical large construction project includes a contractual chain comprised of an employer, a main contractor and a subcontractor. The employer is usually dependent on the subcontractor's performance, however, no contractual nexus exists between the two. Accordingly, the employer might want to circumvent the <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract in order to reach the subcontractor and to mitigate any risks imposed by such a chain of contracts. From this starting point, the study endeavors to examine the concept <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> con-tract in European jurisdictions and particularly the methods used to circumvent the rule in the construction industry practice. For this purpose, the study employs both a com-parative and a legal dogmatic method. The principal aim is to discover general principles not just from a theoretical perspective, but from a practical angle as well. Consequently, a considerable amount of legal praxis as well as international industry forms have been used as references. The most important include inter alia the model forms produced by FIDIC as well as Olli Norros' doctoral thesis "Vastuu sopimusketjussa". According to the conclusions of this study, the four principal ways to circumvent <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract in European construction projects include liability in a chain of contracts, collateral contracts, assignment of rights as well as security instruments. The contempo-rary European jurisdictions recognize these concepts and the references suggest that they {{are an integral part of}} the current market practice. Despite the fact that such means <b>of</b> circumventing <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract raise a number of legal questions and affect the risk position of particularly a subcontractor considerably, it seems that the impairment of the premise <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> contract is an increasing trend in the construction industry...|$|R

2500|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, one {{squatter}} {{may or may}} {{not pass}} along continuous possession to another squatter, known as [...] "tacking". Tacking is defined as [...] "The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; esp., the adding of one's own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous adverse possession for the statutory period." [...] There are three types <b>of</b> Privity: <b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> Contract; <b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> Possession; and <b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> Estate. [...] One of the three types <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> is required in order for one adverse possessor to [...] "tack" [...] their time onto another adverse possessor in order to complete the statutory time period. One way tacking occurs is when the conveyance of the property from one adverse possessor to another is founded upon a written document (usually an erroneous deed), indicating [...] "color of title." [...] A lawful owner may also restart the clock at zero by giving temporary permission for the occupation of the property, thus defeating the necessary [...] "continuous and hostile" [...] element. Evidence that a squatter paid rent to the owner would defeat adverse possession for that period.|$|R
