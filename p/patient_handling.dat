40|$|BACKGROUND Long waiting {{times for}} {{emergency}} care are {{claimed to be}} caused by overcrowded emergency departments and non-effective working routines. Teamwork has been suggested as a promising solution to these issues. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of teamwork in a Swedish emergency department on lead times and patient flow. METHODS The study was set in an emergency department of a university hospital where teamwork, a multi-professional team responsible for the whole care process for a group of patients, was introduced. The study has a longitudinal non-randomized intervention study design. Data were collected for five two-week periods during a period of 1. 5 years. The first part of the data collection used an ABAB design whereby standard procedure (A) was altered weekly with teamwork (B). Then, three follow-ups were conducted. At last follow-up, teamwork was permanently implemented. The outcome measures were: number of <b>patients</b> <b>handled</b> within teamwork time, time to physician, total visit time and number of <b>patients</b> <b>handled</b> within the 4 -hour target. RESULTS A total of 1, 838 patient visits were studied. The effect on lead times was only evident at the last follow-up. Findings showed that the number of <b>patients</b> <b>handled</b> within teamwork time was almost equal between the different study periods. At the last follow-up, the median time to physician was significantly decreased by 11 minutes (p[*]=[*] 0. 0005) compared to the control phase and the total visit time was significantly shorter at last follow-up compared to control phase (p[*]=[*]< 0. 0001; 39 minutes shorter on average). Finally, the 4 -hour target was met in 71 % in the last follow-up compared to 59 % in the control phase (p[*]=[*] 0. 0005). CONCLUSIONS Teamwork seems to contribute to the quality improvement of emergency care in terms of small but significant decreases in lead times. However, although efficient work processes such as teamwork are necessary to ensure safe patient care, it is likely not sufficient for bringing about larger decreases in lead times or for meeting the 4 -hour target in the emergency department.

Clinical Cases: We present three cases of male <b>patients</b> <b>handled</b> by our neurosurgery service with traumatic pneumorrhachis patients, which were managed in a conservative manner, with control images. Conclusions: pneumorrhachis has traditionally been classified as internal if air is present in the subdural or subarachnoid space and external if the air is located at the epidural level. We propose a classification in degrees (Moscote-Agrawal-Padilla) which is more practical from the clinical and radiological point of view...|$|R

40|$|The {{reversed}} gastric tube is advocated as {{a technique}} {{to be used in}} all patients who have carcinomas of the esophagus, whether the lesion is located in the upper, middle or lower esophagus. The tube, constructed out of the greater curvature of the stomach and supplied by the gastroepiploic vessels, invariably has adequate length and sufficient blood supply to heal per primum or to close anastomotic leaks spontaneously when they occur. Since the procedure requires a celiotomy and an incision in the neck, the presence and extent of metastatic disease below the diaphragm and above the clavicle can be evaluated. With prompt resumption of eating, the patients' nutritional status rapidly improves so that they can maintain weight during postoperative irradiation or further surgical procedures, e. g. esophagectomy. It is also effective as a palliative procedure since the <b>patients</b> <b>handle</b> their saliva and other secretions adequately after the procedure...|$|R
40|$|A {{two year}} old male, {{castrated}} English Bulldog, {{was presented to}} Cornell University Hospital for Animalâ€™s Emergency Service for lethargy, vomiting, inappetance, and diarrhea in May of 2010.

Decreased lung sounds were noted on auscultation, particularly on the right. Intestinal loops could not be abdominally palpated, and his abdomen appeared grossly small. Based on orthogonal thoracic radiographs, a diagnosis of a Peritoneopericardial Diaphragmatic Hernia (PPDH) was made. The presenting clinical signs and diagnosis of a PPDH warranted surgery. This case was found to be unique and complicated at surgery because not only did the pericardial sac contain an entire length of jejunum and {{a small portion of the}} quadrate lobe of the liver, but there was also a foreign body in the ileum within the pericardial space.

50|$|A common set {{up among}} {{hospitals}} in Australia is {{seen at the}} Royal Adelaide Hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. At the RAH the orderly service is contracted to Spotless, a national corporation. There are around 80 orderlies employed by Spotless at the Royal Adelaide alone. Here, they are tasked with the movement of patients and equipment between wards and departments, the movement of patients from ambulances in triage, the movement of patients from MedStar retrieval helicopters that land at the hospital, the movement of deceased patients to the mortuary and various other tasks. They respond to every MET (medical emergency team) call that originates within the hospital to provide extra oxygen and so that the patient is able to be moved to another area (such as the intensive care unit) as soon as is required. The orderlies are dispatched using pager-radio combos. Some orderlies are stationed at particular departments such as radiology and theatre/recovery but most are in the 'pool' and are dispatched throughout the hospital. In The Royal Brisbane and Womans Hospital in Queensland, orderlies are called patient support officers or PSOs. Controversially, PSOs are required to do all cleaning within the hospital, leading to an outcry from staff that the practice is unsafe because PSOs have to not only clean, but also {{take care of the}} <b>patient</b> <b>handling,</b> leading to a possible increase in the spread of infection.|$|E
