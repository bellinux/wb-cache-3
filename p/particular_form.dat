5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a <b>particular</b> <b>form</b> of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E
5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a <b>particular</b> <b>form.</b> Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of worship of a more benign form of Kaali, as Daksinakali, is often attributed to Krishnananda Agamavagisha. He was a noted Bengali leader of the 17th century, author of a Tantra encyclopedia called Tantrasara. According to hearsay - Kaali appeared {{to him in a}} dream and told him to popularize her in a <b>particular</b> <b>form</b> that would appear to him the following day. The next morning he observed a young woman making cow dung patties. While placing a patty on a wall, she stood in the alidha pose, with her right foot forward. When she saw Krishnananda watching her, she was embarrassed and put her tongue between her teeth. Krishnananada took his previous worship of Kali out of the cremation grounds and into a more domestic setting. Krishnananda Vagamavagisha was also the guru of the Kaali devotee and poet Ramprasad Sen.|$|E

5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any <b>particular</b> <b>form</b> represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Throughout this process, {{every time}} the soul {{associates}} itself with a <b>particular</b> <b>form,</b> it collects through this medium impressions of the gross world. When the impressions through association with a <b>particular</b> <b>form</b> have been exhausted, the soul dissociates from that form.

While the soul is no longer in search of a better medium, it has to go through numerous human forms, until these impressions gathered through evolution are weakened and finally exhausted.|$|E
