Gosse was given the task of recovering the device intact and dived the next day to remove the primer, with improvised tools, rendering the device safe. During this procedure he heard a loud noise which, upon examination after the mine was brought to land, was found to have been caused by the detonator firing as the primer was removed. He later defused two similar mines which were posing a danger to shipping, on both occasions the detonator fired before the mine reached the surface.|$|E
40|$|Underground {{longwall}} mining of coal causes large scale disturbance {{of the surrounding}} rock mass. The disturbance can increase the rock mass permeability through a reduction on the stress as well as formation of new fractures in the rock. Methane gas contained in the disturbed rock mass can migrate towards the low <b>pressure</b> <b>mine</b> workings and present an explosion hazard. This paper describes {{the application of a}} finite difference program to develop a geomechanical model that predicts permeability changes within the rock mass. The calculated permeabilities are used as input to a reservoir simulator that models methane desorption from the coal matrix, methane release from the rock layers and flow towards the mine excavations. The model also considers the basic characteristics of the mine ventilation network. The geomechanical model uses empirical relationships between fracture permeability and stress to calculate permeability changes around a longwall face. The extent of rock failure is determined using a strain softening model that considers both rock matrix and bedding plane failure. The cave rock (gob) is modeled as a compressible, granulated material. The calculated horizontal and vertical permeabilities around the longwall face are averaged and used as one of the inputs to the reservoir model. The reservoir model was developed and calibrated against records of methane flow at a study mine in southwestern Pennsylvania. Good correlation between actual gas production and model outputs has been achieved. The modeling approach provides a basis for estimating methane inflow and optimizing control measures...|$|E
40|$|Geopolymerization {{has been}} {{considered}} as a new technology to replace the ordinary Portland cement in construction industry. It provides an option to manage the industry waste and byproducts like fly ash, mine tailings. At the same time, the CO₂ emissions can be reduced about 80 % {{compared to that of}} ordinary Portland cement. The present research includes three main parts. First part is applying mine tailings as construction materials using geopolymerization method. The study is focused on efficiently activating mine tailings, reducing alkali consumption, decreasing curing time and improving compressive strength. We investigate the activation temperature effects, the impacts of additives and effects of forming pressures. The results show that a 40 MPa unconfined compressive strength (UCS) can be achieved with the geopolymerization samples after mine tailings are activated by sodium hydroxide at 170 °C for 1 hour with the addition of calcium hydroxide and alkali dissolved aluminium oxide, further compressed with a 10 MPa forming pressure and finally cured at 90 °C for 3 days. To elucidate the mechanism for the contribution of additives to geopolymerization, microscopic and spectroscopic techniques including scanning electron microscopy/ energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are used to investigate the micro/nanostructure and the elemental and phase composition of geopolymerization specimens. The stress-strain behavior was also characterized. The results shows that the mechanical behavior is similar with that of concrete and the dynamic modulus is 22 GPa, which is comparable with that of concrete. The Young's modulus of geopolymer product was also calculated and the value is in the range of 2. 9 to 9. 3 GPa. The findings of the present work provide a novel method for the geopolymerization of mine tailings as construction materials. Second section is applying fly ash as a high strength water-resistant construction material. Through the present investigation, a procedure has been studied. The experiment results indicate that the concentration of NaOH, water content, and curing condition can significantly affect the mechanical property of geopolymer matrix. At the same time, the chemical composition, especially the Si/Al ratio and calcium content, is also an important factor during geopolymerization. XRD results show that the amorphous feature can be observed for both high and low calcium fly ash. It is the key of the success of geopolymerizaton due to its high reactivity. XRD, FTIR and SEM tests were performed to study how experiment conditions and the properties of fly ash affect geopolymerization. The obtained compressive strength of the geopolymerization product can reach above 100 MPa. The stress-strain behavior was also characterized. The results shows that the dynamic modulus is 36. 5 GPa. The product obtained from the present work shows very high water resistance without losing any compressive strength even after a one month soaking time. Third part is applying the mixture of class C fly ash and mine tailings as construction materials. Through the present investigation, a protocol has been set up. The experiment results of the present work also help set up the working conditions such as activation temperature and time, the concentration of NaOH, the addition of Ca(OH) ₂, forming <b>pressure,</b> <b>mine</b> tailing to class C fly ash weight ratio, curing temperature and curing time. To elucidate the mechanism for the contribution of additives to geopolymerization, microscopic and spectroscopic techniques such as SEM/EDX, X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy were used to investigate the micro/nanostructure and the elemental and phase composition of geopolymerization composite. The obtained compressive strength of the geopolymerization product can reach above 60 MPa. The stress-strain behavior of the geopolymer matrix of the mixture of mine tailing and fly ash were also characterized and the results show that the mechanical behavior {{is similar to that of}} concrete with a 24 GPa dynamic modulus. The Young's modulus of geopolymer product was also calculated and the value is in the range of 4. 0 to 13. 5 GPa. The findings of the present work provide a novel method for the geopolymerization of the mixture of mine tailings and class C fly ash as construction materials, such as bricks for construction and road pavement...|$|E

50|$|A more drastic {{method is}} simply to run a ship through the minefield, letting other ships safely follow the same path. An early example of this was Farragut's actions at Mobile Bay during the American Civil War. However, as mine warfare became more {{developed}} this method became uneconomical.This method was revived by the German Kriegsmarine during WWII. Left with a surfeit of idle ships due to the Allied blockade, the Kriegsmarine introduced a ship known as Sperrbrecher ("barrage breaker"). Typically an old cargo ship, loaded with cargo that made her less vulnerable to sinking (wood for example), the Sperrbrecher was run ahead of the ship to be protected, detonating any mines that might be in their path. The use of Sperrbrecher obviated the need to continuous and painstaking sweeping, but the cost was high. Over half the 100 or so ships used as Sperrbrecher were sunk during the war. Alternatively, a shallow draught vessel can be steamed through the minefield at high speed to generate a pressure wave sufficient to trigger mines, with the minesweeper moving fast enough to be sufficiently clear of the pressure wave so that triggered mines do not destroy the ship itself. These techniques are the only publicly known to be employed way to sweep <b>pressure</b> <b>mines.</b> The technique can be simply countered by use of a ship-counter, set to allow {{a certain number of}} passes before the mine is actually triggered. Modern doctrine calls for ground mines to be hunted rather than swept. A new system is being introduced for sweeping <b>pressure</b> <b>mines,</b> however counters are going to remain a problem.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{distribution}} {{law of the}} abutment pressure before and behind the working face, the calculation model of the coal floor stress was established and {{the distribution}} law of the floor stress along with the advance of face was analyzed. The results show that, in working face ahead, the vertical stress and horizontal stress have generally increased, and the vertical stress is more than horizontal stress, and floor rock strata is in compression bending state with mining influence. Then {{in the rear of}} working face, the vertical stress and horizontal stress have generally reduced to less than the original rock stress, and horizontal stress is more than vertical stress. Thus rock bottom is in reverse curving condition, and upward migration of the strata causes the floor drum. Such results can provide theoretical basis for water inrush with <b>pressure</b> <b>mining</b> and treatment of the floor drum of the working face...|$|R
