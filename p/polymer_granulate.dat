40|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the main groups named as examples in the ZTV bit, various stabilised substances were studied in the laboratory in the present study. The products selected were first described, then their effect on a B 65 road construction bitumen was studied in order to, finally, investigate their influence on the mechanical behaviour of sample bodies from a stone mastic asphalt mixture. The following substances were studied: cellulose fibre, mineral fibre, cellulose fibre granulate, powder 1, powder 2, modified filler, foam mortar granulate, special filler, <b>polymer</b> <b>granulate.</b> As far as possible, an additive-free mixture {{was included in the}} studies in each case for comparison.

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} industry, many product characteristics are of one-sided tolerances. The process capability indices Cpu (u, v) and Cpl (u, v) {{can be used}} to measure process performance. Most research work related to capability indices assumes no gauge measurement errors. This assumption insufficiently reflects real situations even when advanced measuring instruments are used. In this paper we show that using a critical value without taking into account these errors, severely underestimates the α-risk which causes a less accurate testing capacity. In order to improve the results we suggest the use of an adjusted critical value, and we give a Maple program to get it. An example in a <b>polymer</b> <b>granulates</b> manufactory is presented to illustrate this approach...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{humidity}} on the charge accumulation of <b>polymer</b> <b>granulates</b> shaken vertically in a stainless steel container. The setup allows to control the humidity level from 5 % to 100 %RH while performing automated charge measurements in a Faraday cup directly connected to the shaking container. We find that samples of approximately 2000 polymer spheres become highly charged at low humidity levels (< 30 %RH), but acquire almost no charge for humidity levels above 80 %RH. The transition between these two regimes does depend on the material, as does {{the sign of the}} charge. For the latter we find a correlation with the contact angle of the polymer with only very hydrophilic particles attaining positive charges. We show that this humidity dependence of tribo-charging can be used to control segregation in shaken binary mixtures. Comment: 8 Pages, 7 Figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of different polyethylenes, LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE, {{with and without}} antioxidants and at different oxygen concentrations in the <b>polymer</b> <b>granulates</b> have been studied in extrusion coating processing. The degradation was followed by On Line Rheometry, Size Exclusion Chromatography, Surface Oxidation Index measurements, and GC-MS Chromatography. The degradations starts in the extruder where primary radicals are formed which are subject the auto oxidation when oxygen is present. In the extruder, cross-linking and chain scission reactions are dominating at low and high melt temperatures, respectively, for LDPE, and chain scission is over all dominating for the more linear LLDPE and HDPE resins. Additives such as antioxidants react with primary radicals formed in the melt. Degradation {{taking place in the}} film between the die orifice and the quenching point is mainly related to the exposure time to air-oxygen. Melt temperatures above 28...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{plasticizing}} of polymers for micro-injection molding {{has been}} proposed and studied for its unique potential in materials and energy-saving. In our previous work, we have demonstrated {{the characteristics of the}} interfacial friction heating mechanism in ultrasonic plasticizing of <b>polymer</b> <b>granulates.</b> In this paper, the other important heating mechanism in ultrasonic plasticizing, i. e., viscoelastic heating for amorphous polymer, was studied by both theoretical modeling and experimentation. The influence mechanism of several parameters, such as the initial temperature of the polymer, the ultrasonic frequency, and the ultrasonic amplitude, was investigated. The results from both numerical simulation and experimentation indicate that the heat generation rate of viscoelastic heating can be significantly influenced by the initial temperature of polymer. The glass transition temperature was found to be a significant shifting point in viscoelastic heating. The heat generation rate is relatively low at the beginning and can have a steep increase after reaching glass transition temperature. In comparison with the ultrasonic frequency, the ultrasonic amplitude has much greater influence on the heat generation rate. In light of the quantitative difference in the viscoelastic heating rate, the limitation of the numerical simulation was discussed in the aspect of the assumptions and the applied mathematical models...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prepare and {{evaluate}} controlled release tablets of Diltiazem by a wet granulation method using Ethyl cellulose and Ethylene vinyl acetate as a retardant and chloroform (solvent for the <b>polymer)</b> as <b>granulating</b> fluid. The <b>polymers</b> were used at 2, 5 and 10 % concentrations in the formulae. Diltiazem release from the matrix tablets was slow and spread over a period of 12 h depending on the type of the polymer and its concentration. Based on values of correlation coefficient the drug release was found to be by diffusion mechanism following zero order kinetics. From „n ‟ values, tablets prepared with Ethylene vinyl acetate and ethyl cellulose followed Fickian and non-fickian diffusion mechanisms respectively. Among all the formulations CRF 4 exhibited better controlled release for 12 hours, when compared to marketed tablets...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to prepare extended release tablet containing matrix granules of Desvenlafaxine succinate monohydrate and to study its in vitro release and in vivo absorption. The design of dosage form was performed by choosing hydrophilic hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC K 100 M), sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose (Blanose), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and lactose monohydrate polymers as matrix builders and polyvinyl pyrolidine (Kollidon K 30) as <b>granulating</b> <b>polymers.</b> Granules were prepared by composing drug with HPMC K 100 M, sodium CMC, MCC and lactose monohydrate by spray drying method. Optimized formulation of Desvenlafaxine succinate monohydrate was formed by using 20 % HPMC K 100 M, 26. 6 % MCC, 6. 6 % of sodium CMC (Blanose), 13. 3 % of lactose monohydrate and 5 % ratio of Kollidon K 30 as binder. Tablets were compressed with free flowing optimized granules of uniform drug content. This extended the release period up to 24 h in vitro study. Similarity factor and mean dissolution time were also reported to compare various dissolution profiles. The network formed by HPMC, MCC and Blanose had been coupled satisfactorily with the controlled resistance. Biopharmaceutical study of this optimized dosage form in rabbit model showed 24 h prolonged drug release in vivo. A close correlation (R 2 = 0. 9833) was established between the in vitro release and the in vivo absorption of drug. The results suggested that wet granulation with spray dried technique, is a suitable method to formulate sustained release Desvenlafaxine succinate monohydrate and it can Perform therapeutically better than conventional immediate release dosage form...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} was aimed to formulate and evaluate pH and time-dependent multiparticulate systems for colon-targeted drug delivery of celecoxib (CXB) with maximum drug absorption, reduced peak plasma fluctuations, and minimum potential side effects. Multiple unit delayed release {{systems of the}} drug in MCC (Avicel &# 174; PH- 102) grade were prepared using polymethacrylate polymers (Eudragit &# 174; L- 100 and RSPO) as a granulating binder by the extrusion-spheronization technique and characterized for their shape, size, size distribution, friability, density, and moisture content. In vitro release studies were performed in 0. 1 N HCl, for first 2 h then further performed in phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8) for 24 h. The resulting pellets were prepared by extrusion spheronization using different grades of polymethacrylate <b>polymers</b> as a <b>granulating</b> binder, showing a substantial decrease in drug release in initial 5 h (16. 28 - 16. 7 &#x 0025;) and releasing most of the drug in 12 - 24 h. The geometric and arithmetic mean diameter ranged from (490 to 780 &# 901;m) and (636 to 734 &# 956;m), respectively. The minimum to maximum range for circularity, elongation and rectangle {{were found to be}} (0. 847 &# 177; 0. 009 to 0. 965 &# 177; 0. 078), (1. 036 &# 177; 0. 057 to 1. 185 &# 177; 0. 023), and (0. 724 &# 177; 0. 041 to 0. 791 &# 177; 0. 047) respectively showing the proper shape and size of the pellets. The content of CXB in the prepared pellets was observed between 98. 70 and 99. 47 &#x 0025; justifying the uniform drug distribution. The in vitro dissolution studies showed that the retardant effect in initial 5 h and most of the drug release in 24 h depended on the ratio and concentration of different grades of methacrylate polymers used in the formulation.
