50|$|Mechanical alloying/milling (MA/MM) {{performed}} in a high-energy ball mill such as a shaker mill or <b>planetary</b> <b>mill</b> will also induce severe plastic deformation in metals. During milling, particles are fractured and cold welded together, resulting in large deformations. The end product is generally a powder that must then be consolidated in some way (often using other SPD processes), but some alloys {{have the ability to}} consolidate in-situ during milling. Mechanical alloying also allows powders of different metals to be alloyed together during processing.|$|E
50|$|Milling is {{the process}} by which {{materials}} are reduced from a large size to a smaller size. Milling may involve breaking up cemented material (in which case individual particles retain their shape) or pulverization (which involves grinding the particles themselves to a smaller size). Milling is generally done by mechanical means, including attrition (which is particle-to-particle collision that results in agglomerate break up or particle shearing), compression (which applies a forces that results in fracturing), and impact (which employs a milling medium or the particles themselves to cause fracturing). Attrition milling equipment includes the wet scrubber (also called the <b>planetary</b> <b>mill</b> or wet attrition mill), which has paddles in water creating vortexes in which the material collides and break up. Compression mills include the jaw crusher, roller crusher and cone crusher. Impact mills include the ball mill, which has media that tumble and fracture the material. Shaft impactors cause particle-to particle attrition and compression.|$|E
50|$|Aside from common {{ball mills}} {{there is a}} second type of ball <b>mill</b> called a <b>planetary</b> ball <b>mill.</b> <b>Planetary</b> ball <b>mills</b> are smaller than common ball mills and mainly used in {{laboratories}} for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A <b>planetary</b> ball <b>mill</b> consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:-2 or 1:-1 or else).The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the <b>planetary</b> ball <b>mill.</b>|$|R

Since the samples could be milled and enzymatically treated using the same media, loss of the biomass due to washing was effectively eliminated. In contrast, conventional sodium hydroxide and soaking in aqueous ammonia (SAA) processes showed a loss of 34. 2 % and 14. 8 %, respectively. Furthermore, milling produced significantly lower concentrations of soluble phenolics than the alkali treatments. Using a bioluminescent bioreporter strain that is sensitive to these phenolics, neither of the milled samples elicited a response while the sodium hydroxide and SAA samples led to a 25. 8 and 4. 7 -fold induction, respectively.

Moreover, using this pretreatment process resulted in the production of only 0. 072 +/- 0. 003 g/L soluble phenolic compounds, a concentration that was not inhibitory towards Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. As the milling was performed in a compatible buffer (50 mM acetate, pH 4. 8), the enzymatic hydrolysis step was initiated by simply adding the cellulase cocktail powder directly to pretreated biomass without washing the biomass or exchanging the buffer, resulting in a glucose yield of 31 g/L (84. 02 %).

40|$|When welding bridge {{structures}} {{automatic welding}} under a gumboil layer with metal chemical additive (MCA) is widely {{applied in the}} modern bridge building. MCA consists of a chopped welding wire (granulated material), which is powdered by modifying chemical additive of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) in the cylindrical mixer «drunk cask». Chemical composition of all welding materials including welding wire, gumboil, electrodes, are strictly normalized and controlled. However, the existing technology of producing MCA doesn’t allow precise controlling of its structure under working conditions and that causes {{an impact on the}} stability of welded connections properties. Therefore the aim of this work is to develop a technology to produce stable MCA structure. The paper compares the existing and proposed manufacturing techniques of the metal chemical additive (MCA) which is applied in automatic welding of butt connections for bridge structures. It is shown that production of MCA in a high-energy <b>planetary</b> <b>mill</b> provides more stable structure of the additive introduced into a welded joint. The granulometric analysis of the powder TiO₂ showed that when processing MCA in a <b>planetary</b> <b>mill</b> TiO₂ particles are crashed to nanodimensional order. This process is accompanied by crushing of granulated material too. The proposed method for production of MCA in a <b>planetary</b> <b>mill</b> provides stronger cohesion of dioxide with the granulate surface and, as a consequence, more stable MCA chemical structure. Application of MCA which has been mechanical intensified in a <b>planetary</b> <b>mill,</b> increases stability of mechanical properties, if compare with applied technology, in single-order by breaking point and almost twice by impact viscosity...|$|E
