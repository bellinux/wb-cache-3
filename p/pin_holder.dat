Material and Methods: A hundred and eight patients scheduled to undergo craniotomy were randomly divided into three groups. Patients whose conditions of their current medication that might affect the stability of hemodynamic were excluded. Gr. F (n= 36) received 2 mcg/kg fentanyl i. v. 5 min. before placement of MSP, group B (n= 36) after induction the skin areas for the each pin were infiltrated with 3 ml 0. 5 % bupivacaine. After an interval of 3 min the pins were inserted. In gr FB (n= 36) both methods were applied together. All patients were given a TIVA with propofol and fentanyl.

40|$|N/AIn this work, {{precipitation}} hardening (PH) stainless steel was plasma nitrided at low temperatures 400 oC and 425 oC for 15 h. The wear and corrosion-wear behaviour of the untreated and nitrided specimens were investigated under both dry sliding and wet sliding (in 3 % NaCl solution) conditions, using both one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) reciprocating motions. The 2 D motion was realised by reciprocating the sample stage {{as the primary}} motion {{and at the same}} time reciprocating the ball (<b>pin)</b> <b>holder</b> at a high frequency and small amplitude as the secondary motion. The results show that 2 D sliding has significant effects on the wear behaviour of the test specimens. Under dry condition, 2 D sliding leads to a significant increase in wear volume by 70 % to 230 %. Nitriding is very effective in increasing dry sliding wear resistance of the steel under both 1 D and 2 D conditions, with 400 oC nitriding being the most effective. Under corrosion-wear (tribocorrosion) condition in 3 % NaCl solution, 2 D sliding leads to a more significant drop in open circuit potential (OCP) and a more significant increase in anodic current than 1 D sliding. While under 1 D sliding condition, nitriding is effective in reducing material removal by tribocorrosion, under 2 D sliding condition, the effectiveness of nitriding is dependent on nitriding temperature. Nitriding at 425 oC results in accelerated material removal during 2 D sliding in the corrosive solution. The mechanisms of material removal are discussed in terms of the structures of the nitride layers and their electrochemical response to the corrosive solution...|$|E

40|$|Hot {{extrusion}} {{of aluminum}} is widely practiced in industries for economic production of structural components. The surface finish and tolerance of the extruded components, both from design and aesthetic requirement, are important parameters. Hot extrusion involves forcing of aluminum {{in the form}} of a billet at a predetermined temperature through a shaped opening called die. Attempts, over time, are made to evolve the die profile to produce quality components. The main geometric feature of the die enables it in imparting plastic deformation and subsequent surface generation of the extrudate. The surface of extrudate is generated on the portion of the die called bearing channel or die land. Aluminum metal which moves relative to bearing channel experiences a different state-of-stress as it passes through the bearing channel. At the entry side of the bearing channel, the stress is compressive which is large in magnitude and this magnitude of compressive stress gets diminished as metal moves towards exit side and eventually becomes zero at the exit. Temperature gradients and its distribution along the bearing channel, similar to stress gradient, are reported. Literature reports formation of the transfer layer on the bearing channel. The transfer layer is of two distinctive types, the one near entry side which virtually leads to contact between aluminum and die steel and the other nearer to exit side which isolates aluminum from die steel. The understanding of the mechanism of formation of transfer layer is most important since it is instrumental in determining the surface finish of the extruded component. All of the previous studies were conducted either in an actual extrusion press or using an instrumented extrusion press in the laboratory. The variables during these experiments could be the temperature of billet, extrusion ratio and speed of ram. Conducting these experiments using extrusion press is expensive and time consuming. To do experiments where the condition in a bearing channel can be simulated would be useful in conducting a more comprehensive study. To simulate the condition in the bearing channel a high temperature vacuum based pin-on-disc machine is designed and built. The fact that in a bearing channel there is virtually metal to metal contact with minimal or no chance of any intervening oxide layer, necessitated studies to be conducted under vacuum. A pin-on-disc test conducted under vacuum and high temperature would almost simulate condition on a bearing channel. Using this specially designed and built experimental setup the parameters influencing the transfer layer formation, temperature, sliding speed, load on the specimen, vacuum level and surface characteristics of the die are studied. Another feature of the test rig is that the configuration of pin and disc setup is vertical, which is different from regular pin on disc tribo-system, where pin and disc are held in horizontal configuration. The advantage of holding in vertical configuration is to eliminate the possibility of trapping the debris which alters the existing friction force and conditions. The test rig is constructed using a cylindrical shell and a matching dome shell. The test rig, to facilitate the isolation of the instrumentations used to measure the forces and wear from the heat source is partitioned into two portions. The cylindrical bottom compartment called test chamber and dome shaped top compartment called sensor chambers are separated by a plate. On the plate in the sensor chamber, a load-cell to pickup friction force, a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) to measure linear wear and loading lever mechanisms for imparting normal load and measuring friction force are fitted. The lever mechanism, in particular the one which magnifies the normal load is designed to conserve the space in the vacuum chamber. Housing the instrumentation inside the vacuum chamber thereby reducing the number of ports required to sense mechanical signals, increases the efficiency of the pumping system. The cylindrical shell of the testing chamber is a double walled structure and water cooled in order to prevent the exposer of sensors to higher testing temperature. Rubber ‘O’ rings are used, wherever it is required to seal the vacuum. The necessary temperature required at the contact interface in the testing chamber is obtained by an electric resistance furnace, which is configured in such a way in the chamber that the heat generated is completely directed to the area where pin and disc are positioned. The interface temperature is monitored using a chromal-alumal thermocouple which is fixed very close to sliding interface on the <b>pin</b> <b>holder.</b> The power input to the furnace is controlled using PID (proportional integral derivative). The required sliding speed is achieved with the help of direct current (DC) servomotor. The shaft on which the disc or ring is fixed is connected to a timer-pulley. The timer-pulley in turn is connected to servomotor through a timer-belt. The diameter ratio of the driving pulley and driven -timer-pulley is selected in such a way that the rpm of driven-pulley is reduced by four times and the torque increased by four times resulting in a more stable mechanical input to the sliding pair. The necessary high vacuum level in the test chamber is created by using rotary pump and diffusion pump combination. Following tests are carried out. 1. Compression test: The strain rate response of aluminum (6060) under compressive state of loading is studied at strain rates 10 - 3 s- 1, 10 - 2 s- 1, 10 - 1 s- 1, 1 s- 1, 10 s- 1 and 102 sand temperature ranging from 573 to 823 K. The compression specimen is machined out of homogenized aluminum alloy (6060) cast ingots. True stress and true strain are estimated from load-displacement data of compression test. The true stress and true strain data are made use of in predicting the friction coefficient and sliding mode during sliding of aluminum relative to die steel at various temperature and other independent variables in vacuum. 2. The tensile test: A series of tensile tests at different temperatures and 10 - 1 s- 1 strain rate are conducted. The temperatures employed are from 423 K to 723 K. True stress, true strain, ultimate tensile strength and total percentage of elongation are estimated using load displacement data. The estimated ultimate tensile strength and total percentage of elongation are used for qualitatively explaining the morphology of transfer layer formed in the sliding experiments under different independent variables like temperature, speed, normal load, and surface texture of steel surface. 3. Adhesion test: The interaction at different temperature between the die steel (H 11) and aluminum (6060) pair under static load is studied by conducting test in vacuum. The pin is made of homogenized aluminum and disc is made of die steel whose surface is generated by polishing on diamond paste until the average surface roughness (Sa) is of the order of 0. 1 microns. The test temperatures are varied from 423 to 723 K. The result is used in qualitatively explaining the morphology of transfer layer formed during sliding of aluminum and die steel pair in vacuum at various temperature, speeds and, normal load. 4. Sliding experiment: Steel pin and aluminum disc Pin on disc experiments are conducted at different temperatures in vacuum of the order of 4 X 10 - 4 Pa. The experiments are conducted employing factorial design. The temperature, speed and load are the experimental parameters. The pin and disc are respectively made out of die steel and aluminum. Experiments are carried out with normal loads 20 N, 40 N, 63 N, 80 N, and 100 N and speeds 0. 1 ms- 1, 0. 3 ms- 1, 0. 5 ms- 1, 1. 0 ms- 1, and 1. 5 ms- 1 and with temperature over a range from 423 to 773 K. The sliding distance covered is 500 meters. The friction force during sliding is monitored and used for estimating friction coefficient. Scanning electron microscopic study is carried out on surface, subsurface, wear track. The results, specifically, the friction coefficient and morphology of transfer layer are used to evaluate the influence of independent parameters on transfer mechanisms. The data generated from subsurface study and compression tests are used for estimating friction coefficient using Rigney’s plastic deformation model at 0. 1 ms- 1. 5. Sliding experiment: aluminum pin and Steel disc The experiments reported in the previous paragraph where aluminum disc is slid against die steel pin had developed only the stresses of the order 16 MPa. The estimated magnitude of stress level on bearing surface of extrusion die by various methods including numerical analysis is found to be more than 16 MPa. In order to achieve a higher magnitude of stress and preserve the transfer layer mechanism, sliding an aluminum pin over the part of the textured surface of die steel ring is carried out. The changed boundary condition resulted in a nominal stress of 28 MPa which is comparatively more at 723 K. The experiments are conducted employing factorial design. The other advantage of doing these experiments is that the effect of texture on the die surface can be studied by sliding aluminum pin over various surfaces. Thus temperature and surface texture are the experimental parameters for the present test. Different textured die steel surface is generated by machining process like, milling, electro discharge machining (EDM), wire electro discharge machining, silicon carbide slurry polishing, silicon carbide wheel grinding, CNC-milling and diamond paste polishing. Thus surfaces are basically of two types 1) with a lay on the surface and 2) a random surface. The tests are conducted at ambient temperature, 423, 573, 673, and 723 K with a normal load of 56 N and speed of 0. 129 ms- 1. The morphology of transfer layer on the die steel ring is studied in scanning electron microscope. The friction coefficient is estimated from monitored friction force. The average surface roughness (Sa), results of compression test, and transfer layer are made use of to identify the sliding mode. The sliding of aluminum pin on diamond polished surface showed interesting results. Hence, another series of experiments using only diamond polished surface are conducted. The surface roughness of the steel surface achieved is 0. 05 micro-meters. The load is 47 N and speed is 0. 043 ms- 1. The morphology of transfer layer and pin surface is studied using a Scanning Electron Microscope. Results of compression and tensile test: The flow stress is found to decrease with increase in compression test temperature. The SEM micrograph indicates large amount of fragmentation of harder phase with increase in strain rate at all temperature except for 423 K. The fractured surface under tensile loading shows both intergranular and transgranular failure. Results of adhesion test: The area covered by the material transfer is found to increase with increase in temperature. The test can be used, to study the adhesive tendency between two pair of contacting surfaces. The area covered by the material transfer is found to be maximum at 723 K. Results of sliding of die-steel pin on aluminum disc in vacuum: 1. The ANOVA (analysis of variance) results indicate the existence of transition speed of about 0. 5 ms- 1, more than which the friction coefficient was found constant. The extrusion speeds employed in industries are in the range of 0. 1 ms- 1 to 1. 7 ms- 1 and the transition speed found in the present study is within this range. 2. The magnitude of friction, with a few exceptions, is found to be independent of temperature and sliding speed when the sliding speed is 0. 5 ms- 1 and above. The invariance of friction coefficient with temperature and sliding speed beyond 0. 5 ms- 1 is beneficial in that it will not lead to any instability like stick-slip or squeal. 3. Though both ambient temperature and speed influence the morphology of transfer layer and friction coefficient, speed is found to be dominant according to statistical analysis. 4. The observed dependency of friction coefficient and morphology of transfer layer on test temperature and normal load is attributed to decrease in flow stress and increase in friction factor ‘m’, a ratio of interfacial shear stress to shear yield stress of the softer material. Though ANOVA shows the significance of speed and not that of temperature, the observed dependence of friction coefficient on temperature is attributed to the enhanced effect of adhesion at elevated temperature observed in the adhesion test. 5. The state of stress at the contacting surface is found to control the morphology of transfer layer. When the normal load exceeded 40 N, it gave rise to higher magnitude of stress state at the contacting surface, resulting in formation of continuous transfer layer and hence the higher magnitude of friction coefficient. 6. Plastic deformation model based on Rigney’s approach for estimating friction coefficient can be used. The estimated friction coefficient is on the higher side. Hence, any design of equipments based on the Rigney’s plastic deformation model is a conservative design. 7. There appears to be a close relation between the morphology of wear track and quantity of wear-loss. The formation of debris and rough track, primarily for low temperature sliding indicate larger magnitude of wear-loss. The parameters, which bring about increased ductility of aluminum as observed in the case of higher temperature of sliding, results in reduced wear-loss due to large scale smearing and back transfer of material. The results of sliding of aluminum pin on die-steel ring in vacuum: 1. The mode of sliding changes from adhesive to abrasive mode depending on depth of penetration, tan(θ) where θ is the base angle of the conical asperity and average roughness parameter Sa,all of them in turn depend on morphology of die steel surface and test temperature. 2. The friction coefficient and morphology of transfer layer are found to depend on the mode of sliding. The sub-surface plastic deformation, which characterizes the friction coefficient and morphology of transfer layer, is dependent on temperature of sliding. 3. The sliding experiment is capable of simulating the stress state on the bearing channel of the die; elucidating evolution of transfer layer, with change in operating parameters. 4. The ANOVA has clearly indicated the significance in friction coefficient at different temperatures and surface textures. In addition, the complex comparison below and above homogenization temperature (573 K) has indicated significance in friction coefficient and thereby recognizing the importance of extrusion of aluminum at a temperature where it is in a single phase. Also, ANOVA indicates the dependency of both friction coefficient and transfer layer on the texture, i. e. either a lay or random. The results of sliding aluminum pin on diamond polished die steel ring: 1. Shearing of the cold welded junction is a probable mechanism involved in the formation of transfer layer up to 423 K. 2. The transgranular and intergranular mode of fracture are identified to be the two possible modes of fracture of the asperity at temperatures greater than 573 K. The large ductility of the aluminum alloy facilitated smearing resulting in a continuous transfer layer at temperatures greater than 573 K. 3. The formation of a continuous transfer layer at temperatures greater than 573 K is responsible for the observed high friction coefficient at these temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy observations of the fracture surfaces of the tensile test specimen revealed fracture to be a combination of both transgranular and intergranular modes...|$|E

Peptides are synthesized from their carboxyl termini using Fmoc-amino acid derivatives. After completion of the synthesis and cleavage of all side-chain-protecting groups, the peptide array on the membrane is incubated with the potential interaction partners to identify their target sequences. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** *Buffer salts and ingredients should be of biochemical grade. * 1. Acetic acid - Acetylation mix - Acid aluminum oxide - Alkaline phosphatase (AP) -conjugated detection antibodies - AP-conjugated streptavidin - Bromophenol blue indicator stock solution - Chemiluminescence detection kit (e. g., ECL western blotting detection reagents; Amersham Biosciences) (optional; see Step 31) - Citrate-buffered saline (CBS) - Color developing solution (CDS) - Deprotection mix - DIC (N,N′-Diisopropylcarbodiimide), ≥ 98 % - DMF - *DMF should be free of contaminating amines and thus of the highest affordable purity (e. g., peptide synthesis grade from Biosolve BV). Purity can be checked by adding 10 μl of bromophenol blue indicator stock solution to 1 ml of DMF. If the resulting color is yellow, the batch can be used without further purification. Be sure to check each new batch. * - Ethanol, technical grade (95 %) (optional; see Step 12) - Fmoc-AA stock solutions - *Fmoc-amino acid (Fmoc-AA) derivatives of all 20 L-amino acids as well as β-alanine and other special amino acid derivatives are available from several suppliers at sufficient quality (Novabiochem/Merck Biosciences or Bachem). The side-chain-protecting groups should be Cys(Acm) or Cys(Trt), Asp(OtBu), Glu(OtBu), His(Trt), Lys(Boc), Asn(Trt), Gln(Trt), Arg(Pmc), Ser(tBu), Thr(tBu), Trp(Boc), and Tyr(tBu). HOBt-esters of these amino acid derivatives must be prepared in NMP for use throughout in spotting reactions. Dissolve 1 mmol of each Fmoc-AA in 5 ml of NMP containing 0. 25 M HOBt to give 0. 2 M Fmoc-AA stock solutions. These are kept in 10 -ml plastic tubes that are closed tightly, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at - 70 °C. For use in coupling reactions with amino acid mixtures at randomized positions in the peptide sequences, combine equal aliquots of Fmoc-AA stock solutions for the respective amino acids to be incorporated, dilute with twofold volume of NMP to give 66 mM solutions, and store as described above*. - Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated detection antibodies - N-Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), anhydrous (ISOCHEM) - *Store tightly closed at room temperature in a dry place*. - Immun-Star Chemiluminescent Kit (No. 170 - 5018, Bio-Rad) - Membrane blocking solution (MBS) - Methanol, technical grade (95 %) (optional; see Step 12) - 1 -Methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP) - *For use {{in the preparation of}} Fmoc-AA stock solutions, NMP should be of the highest purity available. Amine contamination can be checked by adding 10 μl of bromophenol blue indicator stock solution to 1 ml of NMP. If the resulting color is yellow, the NMP can be used without further purification. Most commercial products, however, are not acceptable. To purify an unsuitable batch, treat 1 liter of NMP with 100 g of acid aluminum oxide overnight under constant vigorous shaking at room temperature. The next day, retest the purity; a 1 -ml aliquot should give a yellow BPB test. Filter the slurry through a bed of dry silica gel (for flash chromatography, Mallinckrodt Baker BV) in a closed glass filter funnel (slight nitrogen pressure can speed up the process, but is not necessary). Divide the clear liquid into 100 -ml portions and store tightly closed at - 20 °C*. - Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - Piperidine mix - Special chemical derivatives - *Free thiol functions of cysteine may be problematic because of post-synthetic uncontrolled oxidation. To avoid this, Cys may be replaced by Ser, Ala, or α-aminobutyric acid (Abu). Alternatively, choose the hydrophilic Cys(Acm) and leave protected. For the simultaneous preparation of peptides of different size with free amino termini, couple their terminal amino acid residues as αN-Boc derivatives so that they will not become acetylated during the normal elongation cycle. Boc is then removed during the final side-chain de-protection procedure*. - Stripping mix A (SM-A) - Stripping mix B (SM-B) - Transfer buffer for western blotting - Tris-buffered saline (TBS) without phenol red - T-TBS (TBS buffer plus 0. 05 % Tween 20) - Tween 20 ### Equipment *All equipment used for membrane synthesis and regeneration should be resistant to organic solvents. Glassware or polypropyleneware should be exclusively used in all steps involving organic solvents. Standard micropipetting tips (Gilson, Eppendorf) can be employed. * 1. 3 MM paper (Whatman) - Blotting apparatus (e. g., Biometra-Fast-Blot) - Digital recording device - *Scanner or CCD camera for documentation of signal patterns on membranes plus analysis software for quantification of signals. In case of radioactive or chemiluminescence detection, autoradiography films can be used. * - Dispensers, adjustable from 5 ml to 50 ml for DMF and alcohol containers - Flat glass tray to hold at least one membrane - Flat reaction/washing troughs with a tightly closing lid made of chemically inert material (glass, Teflon, polypropylene) with dimensions slightly larger than the membranes used - Hair dryer, hand-held with cold-air function - Microfuge tubes, 1. 5 ml (e. g., Eppendorf, safe twist) and appropriate racks as reservoirs for amino acid solutions - Nitrocellulose membrane suitable for electro-transfer (e. g., Protan Nitrocellulose Transfer Membrane; Schleicher & Schuell) - Pencil (lead type H or 2 H) for marking membranes - Plastic bags and sealing device - Polystyrene plates (12 × 12 cm) with covers, as used in cell culture - Rocking platform - Sonication bath with temperature control - SPOT membranes: - *AC-S 01 type amino-PEGylated membranes (AIMS-Scientific-Products GmbH) are recommended and available from several suppliers (Hartmann Analytic GmbH; Rapp Polymere GmbH; Intavis AG). Ready-to-use membranes in an 8 × 12 format with 96 spots of βAla anchors are available from Sigma-Genosys*. - *The ASP 222 instrument requires a special format of membrane with perforations for the <b>holder</b> <b>pins</b> on the robot. These are available only from Intavis AG* - SPOT synthesis kit (Sigma-Genosys) - *Software for the generation of peptide lists and pipetting protocols is included in the Sigma-Genosys synthesis kit and the operation software of the spotting robot. A freeware package is also available from the authors (frank@gbf. de) *. - Spotting robot, model ASP 222, or MultiPep peptide synthesizer with spotting tray (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG) Previous Section ### METHOD *All volumes given below are for one standard AC-S 01 paper sheet of 8 × 12 cm and must be adjusted for more sheets, or other paper qualities and sizes. Unless otherwise stated, washes and incubation steps are carried out in sealed troughs at room temperature with gentle agitation on a rocking platform. Solvents and solutions are decanted after the time indicated. During incubations and washes, the troughs are closed with a lid*. **Stage 1 : Preparative Work** 1. Generate a list of peptides to be prepared. Multiple lists can be combined on a single membrane to fill up a complete array. The peptides can be separated after synthesis by simply cutting the membrane into appropriate sections. - *Cutting lines between sections can be marked out on the membrane in pencil*. - Select the appropriate array(s) for the chosen experiment according to number, spot size, and scale required. - *For manual spotting, use an 8 × 12 format (spot distance, 9 mm; spot volume, 0. 5 μl for array generation and 0. 7 μl for elongation cycles). An array of 17 rows with 25 spots each (spot distance 4 mm, volume 0. 1 μl for array generation and 0. 2 μl for elongation cycles) is recommended for the ASP 22 *. - Calculate the required volumes of Fmoc-AA solutions for each derivative and cycle. - *Remember that a triple coupling procedure may be necessary, and that each vial should contain a minimum of 50 μl. Consider, for example, a list of peptides that requires alanine for 26 peptides at cycle 1 on a 17 × 25 array. This cycle will require 26 (peptides) × 0. 2 (μl per elongation) × 3 (couplings) = 15. 6 μl of Fmoc-Ala stock solution. Therefore, you will take the minimum of 70 μl of stock solution for this vial. The SPOT software can perform this calculation*. - Label a set of 1. 5 -ml microfuge tubes with derivative and cycle code (e. g., A 1), and distribute the Fmoc-amino acid stock solutions according to the calculated volumes required. Snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at - 70 °C. **Stage 2 : Generation of the SPOT Array** 5. Mark each membrane used with a pencil label (e. g., a number or letter at the right bottom edge) for proper orientation and tracking throughout the synthesis process. For manual synthesis, mark the spot positions on the membranes with pencil dots, and place the membrane in the reaction trough. For automated synthesis, fix membranes on the platform of the spot robot. 6. Take a 100 -µl aliquot of the Fmoc-βAla stock from the freezer and bring it to room temperature. Add 1 μl of BPB stock and 4 μl of DIC. Mix, and leave for 30 minutes. Spot aliquots (0. 5 μl for 8 × 12 array, or 0. 1 μl for 17 × 25 array) of this solution on all positions of the chosen array|$|R
