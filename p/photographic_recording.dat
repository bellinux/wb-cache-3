50|$|The first Indian film {{released}} in India was Shree Pundalik a silent film in Marathi by Dadasaheb Torne on 18 May 1912 at 'Coronation Cinematograph', Bombay.

50|$|Because of {{the many}} {{variables}} in the combined electronic/photographic process, the quality of such recordings often leaves much to be desired. Defects often encountered in <b>photographic</b> <b>recording</b> include relatively poor image resolution; a compressed brightness range often limited by kinescope display technology to a brightness ratio of about 40:1; nonlinearity of recordings, as exemplified by lack of gradation in both the near-white and near-black portions of the reproduced pictures; and excessive image noise due to film grain and video processing artifacts. The final signal-to-noise ratio is often less than 40 dB, {{especially in the case}} of 16 mm film.|$|E

5000|$|The National Buildings Record (NBR), an {{independent}} body, {{was set up}} in 1940 under the inspiration of Walter Godfrey, its first Director [...] "to meet the dangers of war then threatening many buildings of national importance". Between the declaration of war in 1939 and the first London air-raids in 1940 many moveable works of art, archives and antiquities were evacuated to the relative safety of the countryside. For example, the contents of the National Gallery were taken to country houses, slate mines and quarries in Wales [...] However, buildings could not be protected in this way, so steps were taken to collect architectural plans, drawings, photographs and other records. The RCHME worked closely with the NBR to carry out the extensive <b>photographic</b> <b>recording</b> of the towns in the eastern and southern counties at risk from enemy action.|$|E

50|$|Holography is {{the science}} and {{practice}} of making holograms. Typically, a hologram is a <b>photographic</b> <b>recording</b> of a light field, rather than of an image formed by a lens, and {{it is used to}} display a fully three-dimensional image of the holographed subject, which is seen without the aid of special glasses or other intermediate optics. The hologram itself is not an image and it is usually unintelligible when viewed under diffuse ambient light. It is an encoding of the light field as an interference pattern of seemingly random variations in the opacity, density, or surface profile of the photographic medium. When suitably lit, the interference pattern diffracts the light into a reproduction of the original light field and the objects that were in it appear to still be there, exhibiting visual depth cues such as parallax and perspective that change realistically with any change in the relative position of the observer.|$|E
50|$|He {{established}} the Applied Optics laboratory at IIT Madras {{and began working}} on variety of topics like Fourier transformation in partially coherent light, wave propagation in atmosphere and fibers, holography, speckle phenomenon etc. He proposed several methods to increase dynamic range and efficiency of holograms, the use of computer-generated hologram (CGH) for testing the aspherical surfaces. Sirohi proposed an algorithm for fast writing of the CGH. He applied holography for non-destructive testing and presented techniques for fringe control in real-time. Optical components like multi-function lenses were fabricated using holography, which were used in interferometers for measurements. He also started to work on speckle phenomenon and speckle interferometry using <b>photographic</b> <b>recording.</b> During this period he invented several techniques for the measurement of angles, parallelism, displacement, slope and curvature of plates and beams subjected to loads, contouring and multiplexing. For {{the first time in}} India, he started the experimental activity in speckle metrology using electronic recording. A new method of spatial phase shifting was investigated and introduced in electronic speckle pattern interferometry. Speckle shear interferometry is applied for the NDT of tubes, pressure vessels and other components and systems. He is internationally known for the work on Optical Metrology.|$|E
50|$|Abreu {{was born}} in São Paulo, Brazil, and {{obtained}} his M.D. in medicine at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 1914.Shortly afterwards, he travelled to France, where he first worked {{in the service of}} Dr. Louis Gaston, at the Nouvel Hôpital de la Pitié, in 1915. Charged with photographing surgical pathology specimens, Abreu quickly developed new and better devices and methods for this. In 1916, Abreu started to work at the Hôtel-Dieu and had his first contact with medical radiography, which had been discovered by the German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen just 20 years before. He became the director of the laboratory of radiology of the hospital in substitution to the previous director, Dr. Jean Guilleminot, who was conscripted to fight in the First World War. It was in this position, by suggestion of Guilleminot, that Abreu became interest in fluorography, or the <b>photographic</b> <b>recording</b> of fluoroscopic x-ray images of the lungs. He soon was able to perceive the immense diagnostic value of these images for tuberculosis and other pulmonary affections, and he began his photographic studies of the lungs in 1918, now at the Laennec Hospital (also in France).|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Prevention and Wound Care Center was {{established}} in 2003 in order to assist the hospital and the local demand of patients who had leprosy and present or presented some kind of dermatological ulceration. The <b>photographic</b> <b>record</b> database is an important tool for monitoring {{the evolution of the}} wound, which aims to document the state of the wound before and after procedures or the use of dressings curatives, as a data source on the care provided to the chronic wound carrier as well as an object of teaching and research. Objectives: To create a database of <b>photographic</b> <b>records</b> of patient injuries of evolving character, so that such injuries can be assessed with the passing of time and according to the treatment. Results: A database containing <b>photographic</b> <b>records</b> of the patients was created and organized in folders and subfolders in a simple manner with ease of access and understanding. Conclusion: The <b>photographic</b> <b>record</b> in the database substantially improves monitoring and treatment of patients with chronic skin lesions...|$|R

Detractors argue that Dadasaheb Phalke’s Raja Harishchandra, which was released nearly a year later, is more deserving of the title of the first Indian film. However, other writers, film critics and historians like Firoze Rangoonwalla, Arnab Jan Deka, Patrick Robertson, Sanjit Narwekar {{have argued that}} Dadasaheb Torne was indeed the father of Indian cinema, as his first directed and produced feature film Pundalik was officially released on 18 May 1912, almost one year before Phalke's Raja Harischandra, released on 3 May 1913. Arnab Jan Deka published a research paper with the title Bharatiya Chalachitrar Janak Bhatawdekar aru Torne (Fathers of Indian Cinema Bhatawdekar and Torne) in the daily newspaper Dainik Asam on 27 October 1996. Books on cinema like Guinness Book of Movie Facts & Feats, A Pictorial History of Indian Cinema and Marathi Cinema : In Perspective support the evidence produced by Arnab Jan Deka in his research paper.|$|E
50|$|He studied {{physics at}} the University of Graz, where he {{received}} his doctorate in 1872. After doctorate, {{he worked at the}} grammar school in Klagenfurt, then in Trieste, and in 1875 he came to the Imperial and Royal Naval Academy in Rijeka for professors of physics and mechanics and leader physics laboratory; From 1880 he has also run a meteorological station. Rijeka Academy then was one of the top higher education and research institutions of Austria-Hungary, with carefully selected staff and excellently equipped. At the request of E. Mach, who has not managed to experimentally prove his theory shockwave, Salcher in 1886 with the help of collaborators Sandor Riegler, who was then a professor of chemistry and {{physics at the}} Rijeka Higher Commercial School, conceived the experiment and the world's first spent ultrafast <b>Photographic</b> <b>recording</b> of a phenomenon accompanying a fly grenade flight through the air. The recording was done by the method invented in 1859-64. Developed by August Toepler, Salcher's professor from Graz. A short exposure was achieved using an electric spark, and a total of 80 shots were recorded. The results of that experiment Salcher, in collaboration with E. Macho, published in 1887 in the paper Fotografsko bilježenje pojava u zraku uzrokovanih projektilima (Photographische Fixirung der durch Projectile in der Luft eingeleiteten Vorgänge).|$|E
