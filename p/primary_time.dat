50|$|The Seventh Doctor {{first met}} Klein in the audio story Colditz. She was a {{scientist}} from an alternate time line, {{a version of}} the 1960s where the Nazis had won World War II. The Doctor erased that time line, but Klein became trapped in the <b>primary</b> <b>time</b> line. Eventually, the Doctor discovered her again, in A Thousand Tiny Wings, and took her with him. However, she stole the TARDIS and created multiple alternate time lines. In The Architects of History, the Doctor, with help from the Time Lords, repaired the damaged course of time and erased Klein from history. Afterward, he visited Klein - the version who was raised in the <b>primary</b> <b>time</b> line - who had no recollection of her alternate life or travels with the Doctor. This new current version of Klein works at UNIT as their Scientific Advisor, a position previously held by the Third Doctor.|$|E

Turbidity and TSS removal efficiencies in the primary sedimentation can be due to high concentration of suspended solids in the raw wastewater (Chong et al. 2009).|$|R

50|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>time</b> {{standard}} in the U.S. is currently NIST-F1, a laser-cooled Cs fountain, {{the latest in a}} series of time and frequency standards, from the ammonia-based atomic clock (1949) to the caesium-based NBS-1 (1952) to NIST-7 (1993). The respective clock uncertainty declined from 10,000 nanoseconds per day to 0.5 nanoseconds per day in 5 decades. In 2001 the clock uncertainty for NIST-F1 was 0.1 nanoseconds/day. Development of increasingly accurate frequency standards is underway.|$|E
