50|$|Because {{principles}} of analysis and individualism create obstacles for {{the understanding of}} mind and science, social theory has sought to escape these limitations and find a method of social study that respects the integrity of social wholes. Unger offers a suggestion of how analytic and individualist ideas can be overthrown, and he explains why some efforts to do so (such as structuralism) have failed. As Unger explained earlier in Knowledge and Politics, analysis and individualism reflect belief in the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation,</b> while synthesis and collectivism reflect a belief in totality. Modern social theory has repeatedly tried to formulate a plausible account {{of the idea of}} totality; examples of these efforts include Chomsky’s linguistic theory, gestalt psychology, structuralism, and Marxism. But these efforts have often stumbled in defining exactly what the difference is between wholes and parts, and exactly what the idea of “part” means if it is something different in kind from the totality. Unger explains that the two main interpretations of the principle of totality are structuralism and realism. Structuralism finds it useful to regard certain things as totalities, but it errs in its conventionalist attitude toward totality; it doubts whether totalities correspond to real things. Realism is a more promising approach to totality because it regards unanalyzable wholes—totalities—as real things. But realism, too, falls short of the mark because it fails to resolve the antinomy of theory and fact.|$|E

To gain further insight into the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation,</b> we have investigated the induction of beta-sheet secondary conformation from disordered native peptide sequences through lipidation, in 1 - 2 % hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Several parameters, such as type and number of lipid chains, peptide sequence, peptide length and net charge, were explored keeping the ratio peptide/HFIP constant. The resulting lipoconjugates were characterized by several physico-chemical techniques: Circular Dichroism (CD), Attenuated Total Reflection InfraRed (ATR-IR), Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy and Electron Microscopy (EM). Our data demonstrate the generation of beta-sheet aggregates from numerous unstructured peptides under physiological pH, independent of the amino acid sequence. The amphiphilicity pattern and hydrophobicity of the scaffold were found to be key factors for their assembly into amyloid-like structures...|$|R

Although Kamin and Omari make several valid points and identified an ‘‘anomalous’ ’ finding in two samples (that Blacks averaged greater head circumference than Whites), in the main their review is highly misleading. We find, among other things, that Kamin and Omari: (1) ignored the relation between brain size and IQ established by magnetic resonance imaging and the race dierences in brain size established by MRI, autopsies, and endocranial volume; (2) erred in attributing to arithmetic errors and uncontrolled dierences in sex ratio the dierences in head size found from birth to age seven in the National Collaborative Perinatal Project; (3) neglected data showing that young Black girls mature faster than White girls which explains why Black girls sometimes average cranial sizes {{equal to or greater}} than their White age peers; and (4) seized upon ad hoc ‘‘alternative’’ findings and explanations for particular studies.

Before any criticism may be made, or improvewent suggested, {{a review of the}} existing state of the law is essential. Part I of this thesis therefore contains a statement of the law as it is today in the United Kingdom. First the income tax provisions which affect husband and wife are discussed dealing separately with the general rule, its three statutory exceptions, and {{the beginning and end of}} marriage. The income tax provisions as they affect children are then summarised and the capital taxes are reviewed. Part II then considers a number of studies and criticisms which have been made concerning the United Kingdom system dealing separately with the three main <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation,</b> accountability and allowances. Part III summarises the manner in which the family unit is taxed in some other countries so that any helpful comparisons may be utilized; here the tax provisions are related to the legal systems in which they operate and separate consideration is therefore given to the common law jurisdictions, the civil code jurisdictions and the Scandinavian jurisdictions and a relationship between the property laws and the tax laws is noted. Finally, Part IV analyses the deficiencies of the United Kingdom system and contains recommendations for its reform. The conclusion is reached that husband and wife should no longer be deemed to be one person for tax purposes but should be treated in all respects as two individuals and that some recognition should be given by the tax system to the fact that children are separate individuals too.

Adverse selection costs are often contingent on ex post publicly observable and contractible state variables such as exchange rates. In such cases, debt contracts are dominated by currency swaps and optimal securities, in general, are derivative contracts that are contingent on state variables that influence adverse selection costs.

40|$|Wideband {{technologies}} in the unlicensed spectrum can satisfy the ever-increasing demands for wireless bandwidth created by emerging rich media applications. The key challenge for such systems, however, {{is to allow}} narrowband technologies that share these bands (say, 802. 11 a/b/g/n, Zigbee) to achieve their normal performance, without compromising the throughput or range of the wideband network. This paper presents SWIFT, the first system where high-throughput wideband nodes are shown in a working deployment to coexist with unknown narrowband devices, while forming a network of their own. Prior work avoids narrowband devices by operating below the noise level and limiting itself to a single contiguous unused band. While this achieves coexistence, it sacrifices the throughput and operating distance of the wideband device. In contrast, SWIFT creates high throughput wireless links by weaving together non-contiguous unused frequency bands that change as narrowband devices enter or leave the environment. This design <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> cognitive <b>aggregation</b> allows SWIFT to achieve coexistence, while operating at normal power, and thereby obtaining higher throughput and greater operating range. We implement SWIFT on a wideband hardware platform, and evaluate it {{in the presence of}} 802. 11 devices.

A consideration of the influence of location on real estate value in a spatial unit, and a description of spatial units with a sufficient number of attributes to determine a connection between the value of these attributes and the average price of real estate in a spatial unit, are important tasks in modelling a system of mass real estate valuation.

40|$|Social computation, {{whether in}} the form of {{searches}} performed by swarms of agents or collective predictions of markets, often supplies remarkably good solutions to complex problems. In many examples, individuals trying to solve a problem locally can aggregate their information and work together to arrive at a superior global solution. This suggests that there may be general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> information <b>aggregation</b> and coordination that can transcend particular applications. Here we show that the general structure of this problem can be cast in terms of information theory and derive mathematical conditions that lead to optimal multi-agent searches. Specifically, we illustrate the problem in terms of local search algorithms for autonomous agents looking for the spatial location of a stochastic source. We explore the types of search problems, defined in terms of the statistical properties of the source and the nature of measurements at each agent, for which coordination among multiple searchers yields an advantage beyond that gained by having the same number of independent searchers. We show that effective coordination corresponds to synergy and that ineffective coordination corresponds to independence as defined using information theory. We classify explicit types of sources in terms of their potential for synergy. We show that sources that emit uncorrelated signals provide no opportunity for synergetic coordination while sources that emit signals that are correlated in some way, do allow for strong synergy between searchers. These general considerations are crucial for designing optimal algorithms for particular search problems in real world settings. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure; In H. Liu, J. J. Salerno, and M. J.

According to the competitive exclusion principle in ecology, HPV types that have lower transmission probabilities and shorter durations of infection should be outcompeted by more virulent types. This, however, is not the case, as numerous HPV types co-exist, some which are less transmissible and more easily cleared than others. This paper examines whether this exception to the competitive exclusion principle {{can be explained by}} the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> infection with HPV types, which results in patchy spatial distributions of infection, and what implications this has for the effect of vaccination on multiple HPV types. A deterministic transmission model is presented that models the patchy distribution of infected individuals using Lloyd’s mean crowding. It is first shown that higher aggregation can result in a reduced capacity for onward transmission and reduce the required efficacy of vaccination. It is shown that greater patchiness in the distribution of lower prevalence HPV types permits co-existence. This affirms the hypothesis that the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> HPV types provides an explanation for the violation of the competitive exclusion <b>principle.</b> Greater <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> lower prevalence types has important implications where type-specific HPV vaccines also offer cross-protection against non-target types.
