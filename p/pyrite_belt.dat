50|$|Turdetani, Roman and Arab {{peoples left}} behind several markers in the lands, {{although}} its settlements were primarily {{the consequence of}} Lusitanian castros that dotted the landscape. With the arrival the Romans in the Iberian peninsula, the region of Castro Verde began to be settled by shepards and farmers.

50|$|The South Portuguese Zone now forms a thin {{triangle}} on {{the south}} end of Portugal.Only rocks from the Upper Devonian to Carboniferous are found in the south Portuguese Zone.

5000|$|With {{more than}} 80 known deposits, the Iberian <b>Pyrite</b> <b>Belt</b> became {{an area of}} {{intensive}} mining of sulphide ore since the Chalcolithic era. The Aljustrel camp consists of six separate orebodies (Estação, Feitais, Algares, Moinho, São João and Gavião) that lie on the limbs of four main SWverging folds: the Feitais anticline (towards the northeast), the Central anticline, the São João sincline and the southwestern anticline. The Aljustrel Group structures are truncated and rejected by a major northeast-southwest fault (the Messejana fault). It terminates in the northwest with a hidden by tertiary cover and constitutes the Paleozoic basement where the main two Gavião orebodies occur, with 30 MT of total massive sulfides.|$|E
50|$|The territory's mineral wealth {{made it an}} {{important}} strategic region during the early metal ages, {{and one of the}} first objectives of the Romans when invading the peninsula was to access the mines and other resources. After the Second Punic War, from 29 BC to 411 AD, Rome governed the Iberian peninsula, expanding and diversifying the economy, and extending trade with the Roman Empire. Indigenous peoples paid tribute to Rome through an intricate web of alliances and allegiances. The economy experienced a major production expansion, profiting from some of the best agricultural lands under Roman hegemony and fueled by roads, trade routes, and the minting of coins, which eased commercial transactions. Lusitania developed, driven by an intensive mining industry; fields explored included the Aljustrel mines (Vipasca), São Domingos, and Riotinto in the Iberian <b>Pyrite</b> <b>Belt,</b> which extended to Seville, and contained copper, silver, and gold. All mines belonged to the Roman Senate, and were operated by slaves.|$|E
50|$|The soils {{within the}} {{municipality}} are considered poor, having a reduced capacity to support agriculture, and thus limiting its productive use historically. The subsoils are made-up of essentially granular schists, greywacke, sandstone, {{and in some}} areas quartzite, as well as rare volcanic metamorphic particulates with reduced permeability. Further, the municipality of Castro Verde is crossed by the Iberian <b>Pyrite</b> <b>Belt,</b> composed of a massive volcanogenic sulfide deposit (VMS) associated with the polymetallic flanks of volcanic cones {{in the form of}} pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena and cassiterite, that begins in Aljustrel, spreads through the lower Alentejo and extends into southern Spain. At a time when Portugal was separated by the sea {{from the rest of the}} Iberian Peninsula, a series of events connected to active and hydrothermal volcanism, lead to the formation of the volcano-sedimentary Pyrite complex (when the landmass of Portugal collided into the Iberian peninsula). Castro Verde lies on one of the most important extractive deposits in Europe, that is responsible for sustaining the economy of the region, albeit an area with elevated risk of erosion. Mining activity, as a consequence, dates back thousands of years, with the remains of Roman mining structures identifying the importance of this area to the expansion of Roman metallurgy. In addition to sulfide ore, this southern area of Lusitania, was an abundant source of other minerals, such as gold, silver, copper, tin, lead and iron.|$|E

40|$|Volcanic-hosted, massive sulfide {{deposits}} of Zn-Pb-Cu type were derived either from seawater-dominated, buoyant fluids that built mounds on the seafloor, e. g., the ores of the Hokuroku Basin, Japan, or from saline fluids that reversed buoyancy on mixing with seawater and filled basins on the seafloor, e. g., several ores of the Iberian <b>pyrite</b> <b>belt</b> and the Mount Read province in Tasmania. The Hokuroku ores formed above subduction zones during protracted periods of regional extension, but both the Iberian <b>pyrite</b> <b>belt</b> and the Mount Read province formed under extensional stress during continent-continent (Iberia) or arc-continent (Mount Read) collision and orogenesis. In the Iberian <b>pyrite</b> <b>belt</b> oblique convergence resulted in transcurrent faulting, {{and this may}} also be the case for the Mount Read province.
