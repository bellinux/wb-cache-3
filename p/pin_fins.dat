The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the effects of dimple depth and duct converging angle on the endwall heat transfer and friction factor in this <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> wedge duct. Design/methodology/approach - The study is carried out by using the numerical simulations. The diameter of dimples is the same as the <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> diameter with an inline manner arrangement in relation to the <b>pin</b> <b>fin.</b> The ratio between dimple depth and dimple diameter is varied from 0 to 0. 3 and the converging angle is ranging from 0 ° to 12. 7 °. The Reynolds number is between 10, 000 and 50, 000. Results of the endwall Nusselt number, friction factor, and flow structures are included. For convenience of comparison, the <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> wedge duct with a converging angle of 12. 7 ° without dimples is considered as the baseline. Findings - It is found that the dimples can effectively enhance the endwall heat transfer due to the impingement on the dimple surface, reattachment downstream the dimple and recirculation in front of the <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> leading edge. By increasing the converging angle, the heat transfer is also increased but with a large friction factor penalty. In addition, the heat transfer enhancement for deep depth cases is 1. 57 times higher than that of the low depth case. The thermal performance indicates that the intensity of heat transfer enhancement depends upon the dimple depth and converging angle.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} thermo-economic performance over four micro <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> heat sinks of different spacing and shapes was conducted. Unit cost per product exergy, relative cost difference, and exergo-economic factor were utilized {{to evaluate the}} thermodynamic performance. The effect of working fluid on thermo-economic performance was also investigated using R- 123 and water as working fluids. Unit costs per product exergy were obtained to evaluate and compare the costs of products (total exergy change between exit and inlet streams) in micro <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> heat sinks at fixed mass flow rate and fixed pressure drop. The results of thermo-economic analysis were compared {{to the results of}} a past exergy performance study. Important differences were observed and unveiled between the results of exergy and exergo-economic performances. It was found that the unit cost of exergy change decreased as the electrical power was increased and the relative cost difference became close to unity at high electrical powers. Moreover, high exergo-economic values were obtained at low electrical powers while f had a small value at high electrical powers. When looking at the effect of the working fluid, lower cost per Watts of the products was obtained with R- 123 compared to water at both fixed mass flowrate and pressure drop. No significant effect of <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> spacing on the unit cost of exergy change was observed at fixed mass flowrate, while higher unit costs were recorded at fixed pressure drop for scarcely packaged <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> heat sinks. Finally, the unit cost of exergy change was found to be independent on <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> shape at fixed mass flowrate, whereas at fixed pressure drop, the hydrofoil based <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> heat sink had higher unit costs compared to flow separation promoting ones. ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{enhanced}} endwall heat transfer for flow past non conducting <b>pin</b> <b>fin</b> arrays. The {{aim is to}} resolve {{the controversy over the}} heat transfer that is taking place from the endwall and the pin surface. Various parameters were studied and results were obtained. Our results are found to be consistent with some of the results that have been previously published. The results were surprisingly found to be dependent on the height of the <b>pin</b> <b>fin...</b>|$|R
