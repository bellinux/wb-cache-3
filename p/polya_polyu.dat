40|$|Elucidation of the {{molecular}} aspects of small molecule-RNA complexation is of prime importance for rational RNA targeted drug design strategies. Towards this, {{the interaction of}} the cytotoxic plant alkaloid sanguinarine to three double stranded ribonucleic acids, poly (A). poly(U), poly(I). poly(C) and poly(C). poly(G) was studied using various biophysical and thermodynamic techniques. Absorbance and fluorescence studies showed that the alkaloid bound cooperatively to these RNAs with binding affinities of the order 104 M� 1. Fluorescence quenching and hydrodynamic studies gave evidence for intercalation of sanguinarine to these RNA duplexes. Isothermal titration calorimetric studies revealed that the binding was characterized by negative enthalpy and positive entropy changes and the affinity constants derived were in agreement with the overall binding affinity values obtained from spectroscopic data. The binding of sanguinarine stabilized the melting of <b>poly(A).</b> <b>poly(U)</b> and poly(I). poly(C) and the binding data evaluated from the melting data were in agreement with that obtained from other techniques. The overall binding affinity of sanguinarine to these double stranded RNAs varied in the order, <b>poly(A).</b> <b>poly(U)</b> 4 poly(I). poly(C) c poly(C). poly(G). The temperature dependence of the enthalpy changes afforded negative values of heat capacity changes for the binding of sanguinarine to <b>poly(A).</b> <b>poly(U)</b> and poly(I). poly(C), suggesting substantial hydrophobic contribution in the binding process. Further, enthalpy-entropy compensation phenomena was also seen in <b>poly(A).</b> <b>poly(U)</b> and poly(I). poly(C) systems that correlated to the strong binding involving a multiplicity of weak noncovalent interactions compared to the weak binding with poly(C). poly(G).

Base-dye interactions prevail at high RNA/dye ratio and binding isotherms analysis reveals that both dyes bind to Poly(A) -Poly(U) {{according to the}} excluded site model (n = 2).

Kinetic, CD and spectrofluorometric experiments reveal that this process requires that coralyne (D) binds to duplex. The resulting complex (AUD) reacts with free duplex giving triplex (UAUD) and free poly(A); moreover, ligand exchange between duplex and triplex occurs. A reaction mechanism is proposed and the reaction parameters are evaluated. For CD/CP> 0. 8 poly(A) •poly(U) does not disproportionate at 25 °C and dye intercalation into AU to give AUD is the only observed process. Melting experiments as well show that coralyne induces the duplex disproportionation. Effects of temperature, ionic strength and ethanol content are investigated. One concludes that triplex formation requires coralyne be only partially intercalated into AUD. Under suitable concentration conditions, this feature favours the {{interaction of}} free AU with AUD to give the AUDAU intermediate which evolves into triplex UAUD and single-stranded poly(A).

40|$|Ten inbred {{strains of}} mice were immunized with the double {{stranded}} polyribonucleotide complex polyguanylic. polycytidylic acid [poly(G). poly(C) ]. While some immunogenic properties of this duplex were {{comparable to those}} of other nucleic acids antigens, differences were also noted. High (SJL/J, BALB/c), low (DBA/ 2, AKR) and intermediate responders were observed; these differences were not abolished by adsorption of the duplex to MBSA. This pattern of immune response is distinct both from that observed with two other synthetic polyribonucleotide double helices [poly(A). poly(U) and poly(I). poly(C) ] and with single stranded DNA. The anti-poly(G). poly(C) activity was localized in the 7 S region, whether the sera came from high or low responders, from mice immunized with or without a carrier, after one or several injections. In contrast with anti-poly(A). poly(U) sera which do not react with poly(G). poly(C), anti-poly(G). poly(C) exhibited <b>poly(A).</b> <b>poly(U)</b> binding activity; no clear relationship between the two activities, however, could be demonstrated. Thus a series of immunological properties differentiates poly(G). poly(C) not only from the natural polydeoxyribonucleotide single stranded DNA, but also, and more unexpectedly, from two other double stranded polyribonucleotide complexes. These observations suggest that the mechanism controlling the antibody response to poly(G). poly(C) differs from that regulating <b>poly(A).</b> <b>poly(U)</b> and/or poly(I). poly(C), and are to be connected {{with the fact that the}} anti-poly(G). poly(C) antibodies occurring in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus did not correlate with the antibody activities directed toward the other duplexes...|$|E

Anti-RNA antibodies found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are immunochemically different from those found in scleroderma in that, instead of being uniformly specific to uracil, they are markedly heterogeneous and may react with uracil, uridine and/or UMP. SLE sera frequently react with <b>poly(A)</b> - <b>poly(U),</b> indicating also their ability to recognize the double helical structure of double-stranded RNA. Thirty-seven scleroderma and thirty-four SLE sera from as many patients with either of these conditions were tested against HSA-coupled, uridine-containing monophosphoric dinucleotides in an attempt to characterize further their anti-RNA antibodies. Scleroderma sera were found to react primarily with dinucleotides in which uridine was the base proximal to the carrier protein and, except for sera that also contained antibodies to adenosine which reacted with UpA, they failed to react with dinucleotides in which uridine was in a terminal position only. Reaction with dinucleotides in which uridine was proximal to the carrier protein could be inhibited by uracil but not by the corresponding terminal base. Some lupus sera were found to react with both dinucleotides that contain the same bases in opposite sequence, e. g. ApU and UpA, while others were found to react with only one of the sequences. They were also found to react more frequently with dinucleotides in which HSA was coupled to a base other than uridine, suggesting that the reaction is primarily due to anti-DNA antibodies. Because immunization with dinucleotides coupled to protein prepared by the same method we have used, yields higher specificity to the base attached to the carrier protein, our findings suggest that, in scleroderma, a single event, akin to that of immunization with a purified antigen, gives rise to the anti-RNA antibodies, whereas in systemic lupus erythematosus there is a considerably wider immunological aberration...|$|R

Rrp 12 p also showed robust in vitro binding to a pre-rRNA transcript, in addition to <b>poly(A)</b> and <b>poly(U).</b> We propose that Rrp 12 p binds to the RNA components of the pre-ribosomes and promotes export of both subunits via its interactions with the nucleoporins and Gsp 1 p...|$|R
40|$|A micro-method for the {{determination}} of the electrophoretic profile of the various poly(A) -containing RNA species in a RNA sample was developed. The method is simple to carry out and allows for great reproducibility. It combines the resolving power of electrophoresis in agarose with the specificity of binding of <b>poly(A)</b> to <b>poly(U)</b> -containing glass-fibre filters. It consists of the following steps. (1) The molecules in an RNA sample are first separated according to their molecular weight by electrophoresis in agarose, at low ionic strength. 2. The molecules thus seperated are then submitted to a second electrophoresis in 'binding buffer' in a direction perpendicular to the first one. In the course of this electrophoresis the poly(A) -containing RNA species are seperated from other RNA species as they bind to a poly(U) -containing glass-fibre filter which is placed across the electrophoresis path. The method was used to determine the electrophoretic profile of Rhynchosciara salivary-gland messenger RNA. It was found that the population of messenger RNA in the gland is dominated by forms moving as 18 and 158 S peaks, but there is also polydisperse RNA with slower mobility...|$|R
40|$|Protein B 23 is an {{abundant}} nucleolar protein and a putative ribosome assembly factor which possesses an intrinsic ribonuclease activity. In the current work, {{the effects of}} RNA sequence and secondary structure on the cleavage preference by protein B 23 were studied. Protein B 23 ribonuclease preferentially cleaved the single-stranded homopolymers <b>poly(A),</b> <b>poly(U)</b> and poly(C). However, double-stranded co-polymers and poly(G) were resistant to cleavage. No base specificity was observed with an oligoribonucleotide substrate. The action of protein B 23 ribonuclease on different regions of pre-rRNA was studied using transcripts synthesized in vitro from cloned rDNA segments. Although no specific cleavages were detected in transcripts containing sequences from the 5 ' external transcribed spacer or the first internal transcribed spacer, the enzyme preferentially cleaved the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS 2) approximately 250 nt downstream from the 3 '-end of 5. 8 S rRNA. Preferential cleavage was retained when the transcript was extended by 100 nt at the 3 '-end, but abolished in a transcript lacking this cleavage site. Furthermore, this site was not susceptible to cleavage by RNase A or RNase T 1. These results, {{in conjunction with the}} sub-nucleolar localization of the protein with elements of the processing machinery, suggest that the protein B 23 endoribonuclease could play a role in pre-rRNA processing in ITS 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{monoclonal}} anti-dsRNA antibody J 2 binds double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) in {{an apparently}} sequence-nonspecific way. The mAb only recognizes antigens with double-stranded regions {{of at least}} 40 bp and its affinity to <b>poly(A)</b> <b>poly(U)</b> and to dsRNAs with mixed base pair composition is about tenfold higher than to poly(I) poly(C). Because no specific binding site could be determined, the number, the exact dimensions, and other distinct features of the binding sites on a given antigen are difficult to evaluate by biochemical methods. We therefore employed scanning force microscopy (SFM) as a method to analyze antibody-dsRNA interaction and protein-RNA binding in general. Several in vitro-synthesized dsRNA substrates, generated from the Dictyostelium PSV-A gene, were used. In addition to the expected sequence-nonspecific binding, imaging of the complexes indicated preferential binding of antibodies {{to the ends of}} dsRNA molecules as well as to certain internal sites. Analysis of 2, 000 bound antibodies suggested that the consensus sequence of a preferential internal binding site is A 2 N 9 A 3 N 9 A 2, thus presenting A residues on one face of the helix. The site was verified by site-directed mutagenesis, which abolished preferential binding to this region. The data demonstrate that SFM can be efficiently used to identify and characterize binding sites for proteins with no or incomplete sequence specificity. This is especially the case for many proteins involved in RNA metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The avian {{reovirus}} {{non-structural protein}} sNS {{has previously been}} shown to bind single-stranded (ss) RNA in vitro in a sequence-independent manner. The {{results of the present}} study further reveal that sNS binds <b>poly(A),</b> <b>poly(U)</b> and ssDNA, but not poly(C), poly(G) or duplex nucleic acids, suggesting that sNS has some nucleotide-sequence specificity for ssRNA binding. The current findings also show that sNS is present in large ribonucleoprotein complexes in the cytoplasm of avian reovirus-infected cells, indicating that it exists in intimate association with ssRNAs in vivo. Removal of RNA from the complexes generates a sNS protein form that sediments between 4 ? 5 and 7 S, suggesting that RNA-free sNS associates into small oligomers. Expression and purification of recombinant sNS in insect cells allowed us to generate specific antibodies and to perform a variety of assays. The results of these assays revealed that: (i) RNA-free sNS exists as homodimers and homotrimers; (ii) the minimum RNA size for sNS binding is between 10 and 20 nt; (iii) sNS does not have a preference for viral mRNA sequences; and (iv) its RNA-binding activity is conformation-dependent. Baculovirus expression of point and deletion sNS mutants in insect cells showed that the five conserved basic amino acids that are important for RNA binding and ribonucleoprotein-complex formation are dispersed throughout the entire sNS sequence, suggesting that this protein binds ssRNA through conformational domains. Finally, the properties of the avian reovirus protein sNS are compared with those of its mammalian reovirus counterpart...|$|E
40|$|Encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus RNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} {{was expressed}} in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), which allowed easy purification of the fusion protein by affinity chromatography on immobilized glutathione. Inclusion of a thrombin cleavage site between the GST carrier and the viral enzyme facilitated {{the release of}} purified mature EMC virus RNA polymerase from the GST carrier by proteolysis with thrombin. The purified recombinant enzyme has a molecular mass of about 52 kDa and is recognized by polyclonal immune serum raised against a peptide sequence corresponding to the C-terminal region of the protein. The recombinant enzyme comigrates with immunoprecipitated EMC virus RNA polymerase from infected mouse L 929 cell extracts when run in parallel lanes on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. The enzyme exhibits rifampin-resistant, <b>poly(A)</b> -dependent <b>poly(U)</b> polymerase activity and RNA polymerase activity, which are both oligo(U) dependent. Template-size products are synthesized in in vitro reactions with EMC virus genomic RNA or globin mRNA. The availability of recombinant EMC virus RNA polymerase in a purified form will allow biochemical analysis of {{its role in the}} replication of the virus as well as structure-function studies of this unique class of enzyme...|$|R

J. - DOCTORAL THESIS - FUNCTION OF MAGNESIUM IONS IN THE FORMATION OF BIOLOGICALLY-ACTIVE NUCLEIC ACIDS STRUCTURES ____________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACT Interaction of {{magnesium}} ions, the divalent ions {{with the highest}} concentration inside living cells, with the key biomolecules of nucleic acids was studied with aim to find out structural details of the interaction mechanism and effect of the magnesium ions presence on the nucleic-acid structure and structural transitions. Raman spectroscopy {{was chosen as the}} main experimental method, some complementary measurements of UV absorption spectra were also performed. Basic analyses of the spectral series obtained as a function of temperature and/or for various concentrations of Mg 2 + ions were done by means of factor analysis. Where possible the factor analysis outputs were used for fits of appropriate thermodynamic equations. For the studies, various nucleic-acid molecular models were employed, in particular complementary RNA homopolynucleotides <b>polyA</b> and <b>polyU,</b> DNA homopolynucleotides polydA and polydT and RNA 14 -mer oligonucleotide representing the apical hairpin of the TAR segment of HIV- 1 genomic RNA. We have confirmed via Raman spectroscopy that magnesium ions added to a solution of polyA-polyU [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Binding of two 9 -O-(ω-amino) {{alkyl ether}} berberine analogs BC 1 and BC 2 to the RNA triplex <b>poly(U)</b> (•) <b>poly(A)</b> (*) <b>poly(U)</b> was studied by various biophysical techniques. Berberine analogs bind to the RNA triplex non-cooperatively. The {{affinity}} of binding was remarkably high by about 5 and 15 times, respectively, for BC 1 and BC 2 compared to berberine. The site size for the binding was around 4. 3 for all. Based on ferrocyanide quenching, fluorescence polarization, quantum yield values and viscosity results a strong intercalative binding of BC 1 and BC 2 to the RNA triplex has been demonstrated. BC 1 and BC 2 stabilized the Hoogsteen base paired third strand by about 18. 1 and 20. 5 °C {{compared to a}} 17. 5 °C stabilization by berberine. The binding was entropy driven compared to the enthalpy driven binding of berbeine, most likely due to additional contacts within the grooves of the triplex and disruption of the water structure by the alkyl side chain. Remarkably higher binding affinity and stabilization effect of the RNA triplex by the amino alkyl berberine analogs was achieved compared to berberine. The length of the alkyl side chain influence in the triplex stabilization phenomena...|$|R
