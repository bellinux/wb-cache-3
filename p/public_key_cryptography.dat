When using OFDM over a {{wireless}} channel the broadcast nature of the channel exposes transmission to eavesdropping. Securing communication links from eavesdropping is commonly done by implementing enciphering and deciphering algorithms in software, and is usually detached from the physical layer of communication. Prominent methods rely on <b>public</b> <b>keys</b> <b>cryptography</b> such as RSA [1], or symmetric cryptography with a common secret, such as the US National Data Encryption Standard (DES) [2]. There are some encryption methods which rely on the physical layer of communication for their implementation, such as spread spectrum Frequency Hopping (FH) and Direct Sequence (DS) [3]. In FH and DS a key has to be generated and distributed securely between the communicating parties. The key is used to set the FH hopping pattern or DS spreading sequence. Prominent key distribution methods rely on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm [4]. Encryption, decryption, and key distribution impose overheads on data throughput, energy consumption, memory space, and computation power.

Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor's algorithm applies, like the McEliece cryptosystem based on a problem in coding theory. Lattice-based cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, which would break many lattice based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem. It has been proven that applying Grover's algorithm to break a symmetric (secret key) algorithm by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2n/2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2n in the classical case, meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have the same security against an attack using Grover's algorithm that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see Key size).

500|$|The {{notion of}} using <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptography</b> for data {{kidnapping}} attacks {{was introduced in}} 1996 by Adam L. Young and Moti Yung. Young and Yung critiqued the failed AIDS Information Trojan that relied on symmetric cryptography alone, the fatal flaw being that the decryption key could be extracted from the Trojan, and implemented an experimental proof-of-concept cryptovirus on a Macintosh SE/30 that used RSA and the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) to hybrid encrypt the victim's data. Since public key crypto is used, the cryptovirus only contains the encryption key. The attacker keeps the corresponding private decryption key private. Young and Yung's original experimental cryptovirus had the victim send the asymmetric ciphertext to the attacker who deciphers it and returns the symmetric decryption key it contains to the victim for a fee. Long before electronic money existed Young and Yung proposed that electronic money could be extorted through encryption as well, stating that [...] "the virus writer can effectively hold {{all of the money}} ransom until half of it is given to him. Even if the e-money was previously encrypted by the user, it is of no use to the user if it gets encrypted by a cryptovirus". They referred to these attacks as being [...] "cryptoviral extortion", an overt attack that {{is part of a larger}} class of attacks in a field called cryptovirology, which encompasses both overt and covert attacks. The cryptoviral extortion protocol was inspired by the forced-symbiotic relationship between H. R. Giger's facehugger and its host in the movie Alien.|$|E
