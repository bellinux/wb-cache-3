500|$|Voice coach John Quinlan was {{impressed}} by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, [...] "He has far more voice than <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either". [...] As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby, but later believed that Tony Bennett was [...] "the best singer in the business". [...] Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had [...] "perfected the art of intimacy." [...] According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a [...] "fairly rangy voice", [...] remarking that [...] "His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint". Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was [...] "virtually undetectable", with his diction becoming [...] "precise" [...] and articulation [...] "meticulous". His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to [...] "toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric". [...] Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would [...] "take a musical phrase and play {{it all the way}} through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars." [...] Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone, and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.|$|E

He can score quickly at times but it is his way {{of being able to}} read situations that sets him apart. ... He knows when to grind it out or move up through the gears. Some <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> could move through the gears quicker when batting, and that is probably a fair argument on occasions, but the majority of the time he knows what he can do at the crease and believes South Africa {{have a better chance of}} winning if he stays there.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015 he {{repeated}} this anecdote {{during an interview}} with the BBC on refugees. When asked if the Dalai Lama could be a woman he answers [...] "Yes". Recalling again an interview in Paris of the possibility [...] "I mentioned, Why not? The female biologically [...] more potential to show affection and compassion...therefore I think female should take more important role and then - I told the reporter - if a female does come her face should be very, very attractive." [...] The interviewer Clive Myrie then asked if a female Dalai Lama must be attractive, he followed up, [...] "I mean. If female Dalai Lama come, then that female must be attractive. Otherwise not much use." [...] Myrie replied [...] "You're joking, I'm assuming. Or you're not joking?" [...] to which The Dalai Lama insisted [...] "No. True!". The Dalai Lama then pointed to his own face, stating that to some <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is very attractive and continued to laugh.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the notoriety}} {{surrounding}} how {{the band was}} signed with Durst, the band is often asked regarding their relationship with him. Scantlin criticized Durst {{in an interview in}} 2004 with Canada's Chart magazine. He stated, [...] "He doesn't write our songs, he doesn't produce our songs, he doesn't do anything for us. He doesn't do our videos anymore. He doesn't do anything for this band. I don't know what he's doing, I don't know what the guy's like. All I know is that he's like Mr. Hollywood guy, Mr. Celebrity. Like, 'I don't hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities'. Every single fucking interview I've ever fucking done, I get asked about that fucking guy..." [...] He added, [...] "And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual... <b>People</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> writes music with me or something. He does not do that. I just don't get it. We have nothing in common. He doesn't even call us, he has his assistant call us to congratulate us on our record. Yeah, that's how pathetic he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said she, {{interrupting}} him. [...] "Papa {{is accused}} of stealing money. He did not steal it, but <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> did. And then we are so very poor." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{gave her}} facile {{masculine}} advice. She {{was to put}} off her mother's stay. She was to tell Carrie {{to go to the}} deuce. For these valuable revelations she thanked him, and they ambled into the familiar gossip of the Bunch. Of what a sentimental fool was Carrie. Of what a lazy brat was Pete. Of how nice Fulton Bemis could be--"course lots of <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a regular old grouch when they meet him because he doesn't give 'em the glad hand the first crack out of the box, but when they get to know him, he's a corker." ...|$|R

60|$|It is most {{dangerous}} nowadays for a husband {{to pay any}} attention to his wife in public. It always makes <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> beats her when they're alone. The world has grown so suspicious of anything that looks like a happy married life.|$|R

6000|$|MRS DUBEDAT. He {{is perhaps}} {{sometimes}} weak about women, because they adore him so, and are always laying traps for him. And of course {{when he says}} he doesnt believe in morality, ordinary pious <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> must be wicked.

This did amaze her, and for a moment I {{thought she was going to}} cry; but she was not in the habit of doing much of that sort of thing, and presently she laughed. 'Monsieur Isadore,' she exclaimed, 'working in the garden and washing pots and pans! Why, don't you know some <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is almost as good as our head chef Leonard?' ...|$|E
25|$|Bennington {{suffered}} {{sexual abuse}} from an older male friend {{when he was}} seven years old. He was afraid {{to ask for help}} because he did not want <b>people</b> to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was gay or lying, and the abuse continued until the age of 13.|$|R

5000|$|Despite Roy's initial [...] "creepy" [...] persona, viewers were {{eventually}} shown a different {{side to the}} character. He was converted from a creep to an eccentric; a quiet and shy intellectual man, with few social skills and a penchant for trivial information, but underneath it all, a man with [...] "a heart of gold". He {{has been described as}} compassionate, moral, sensitive and full of integrity; taking in waifs and strays and helping his neighbours whenever possible. Commenting on his character, Neilson has said, [...] "Roy is absolutely his own person and hugely honourable. Some <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> simple. He's not. He's a very complex man with hidden depths. And there's lots more to explore...There's something tragic about Roy. I think there is a big black cloud that follows him around and one day it is going to really dump on him." ...|$|R

The London <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will be off Falmouth in four days' time. He wants me to join his liner there {{and go on to}} Cherbourg and Paris. He's arranged that. He is the sort of man who can arrange things like that. There'll be someone at Falmouth to look after us and put us aboard the liner. I must wire them where I can pick up a telegram to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know as I'd say he {{was such}} a whale of a scholar. I've always had a {{suspicion}} he did a good deal of four-flushing about that. He likes to have <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> keeps up his French and Greek and Lord knows what all; and he's always got an old Dago book lying around the sitting-room, but I've got a hunch he reads detective stories 'bout like the rest of us. And I don't know where he'd ever learn so dog-gone many languages anyway! He kind of lets people assume he went to Harvard or Berlin or Oxford or somewhere, but I looked him up in the medical register, and he graduated from a hick college in Pennsylvania, 'way back in 1861!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Old Mother Nature. [...] "Many <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is {{and often}} he is called Shrew Mouse. But {{this is a}} great mistake. It is the result of ignorance. It seems strange to me that people so often know so little about their near neighbors." [...] She looked at Happy Jack Squirrel as she said this, and Happy Jack looked sheepish. He felt just as he looked. All this time the eyes of every one had been searching this way, that way, every way, for Teeny Weeny, for Old Mother Nature had promised to try to have him there that morning. But Teeny Weeny was not to be seen. Now and then a leaf on the ground close by Old Mother Nature's feet moved, but the Merry Little Breezes were always {{stirring}} up fallen leaves, and no one paid any attention to these.|$|E

6000|$|... 'To be {{so easily}} deceived. Think: it is lamplight; and your sight is weak at present; and... Well, I have no reason for being {{anything}} but candid now, God knows! So I will tell you.... My husband was younger than myself; and he had an absurd wish to make <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had married a young and fresh-looking woman. To fall in with his vanity I tried to look it. We were often in Paris, and I became as skilled in beautifying artifices as any passee wife of the Faubourg St. Germain. Since his death I have kept up the practice, partly because the vice is almost ineradicable, and partly because I found that it helped me with men in bringing up his boy on small means. At this moment I am frightfully made up. But I can cure that. I'll come in to-morrow morning, if it is bright, just as I really am; you'll find that Time has not disappointed you. Remember I am as old as yourself; and I look it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then," [...] said Mr. Corbridge, {{his eyes}} {{beginning}} to sparkle, [...] "I {{may as well}} talk plainly to you. My associates and myself have considered this matter very carefully. At first we thought that if this fellow should tell his story we would simply pooh-pooh the whole of it, and let <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was a little touched in his mind, which would be so natural a conclusion that everybody {{might be expected to}} come to it. But as we have determined to dematerialize him, his disappearance would bring suspicion upon us, and we might get into trouble if he should be considered a mere commonplace person. So we decided to speak out plainly, say what we had done, and {{what we were going to}} do, and thus put ourselves at the head of the spirit operators of the world. But we are not yet ready to do anything or to make our announcements, and if he had held his tongue we might have given him a pretty long string." ...|$|E
6000|$|She faced him squarely. [...] "No, he {{has been}} the real thing. He kept a saloon--when I first knew him, but he gave it all up for me. I wouldn't promise to marry him till he did. Everybody out there knows his career, and most <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> got his money underhand, but he tells me he didn't, and I take his word. Every dollar he spends on me or on our home comes out of some mines he owns. I told him I wouldn't touch a dollar of the saloon money--and I won't. Some folks think I don't care, but I do. I don't like the saloon business, and he got out and he's livin' {{straight}} now, as straight as any man. It's pretty hard on him, too, though he won't admit it. He must get awful sick of sittin' round the way he does. I tell him he needn't cut out all his old cronies on my account. He says he ain't sufferin', but it's like shuttin' a bronco up in the corral and lettin' the herd go back into the hills." ...|$|E
