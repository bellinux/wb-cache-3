This church {{is one of the}} oldest building in the valley still standing and still in use. Between 1895–99 the church was moved down to its present site on Holland Loop Road where it has served the community till this day. It is currently known as Bridgeview Community Church (since the 1920s). A newer building was built in 1986 where services are now being held every Sunday. The original church is currently under restoration and will continue to be as the builders back then said; [...] "A <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> or children and grandchildren to worship".|$|E

Henry Clay Merriam [...] northwest of Spokane, at the junction of the Columbia and Spokane Rivers, to protect {{the construction of the}} Northern Pacific Railway and secure a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> settlement. By June 30, 1881, the railway reached the city, bringing major European settlement to the area. [...] The city of Spokan Falls (the [...] "e" [...] was added in 1883 and [...] "Falls" [...] dropped in 1891) was officially incorporated as a city of about 1,000residents on November 29, 1881.

Rima, F.R. Moore, George A. Davis, and W.C. Gray, all serving without pay. The marketing campaigns of transportation companies with affordable fertile land to sell along their trade routes lured many settlers into the region they dubbed [...] "Spokane Country".|$|E

500|$|In March 1629, King Charles {{dissolved}} Parliament, beginning {{eleven years}} of rule without Parliament. [...] This action apparently raised new concerns among the company's principals; in their July meeting, Governor Matthew Cradock {{proposed that the}} company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony. [...] It also worried Winthrop, who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament. [...] He wrote, [...] "If the Lord seeth it wilbe good for us, he will provide a shelter & a hidinge <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> and others". [...] During the following months, he became more involved with the company, meeting with others in Lincolnshire. [...] By early August, he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration and, on 12 August, he circulated a paper providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration. [...] His name appears in formal connection with the company on the Cambridge Agreement, signed 26 August; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non-emigrating shareholders of the company.|$|E

Because by that time we'd become obsessed with change, and the great thing was that we were also able to create a pastoral side of Led Zep. Jimmy was listening to Davey Graham and Bert Jansch and was experimenting with different tunings, and I loved John Fahey. So it was a very natural <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to go to.|$|E

2500|$|The 1880 Dodge City census {{revealed}} that Masterson was then living with one Annie Ladue, age 19, who {{was described as}} his [...] "concubine". City Marshal James Masterson, Bat's younger brother, was listed on the same census as living with Minnie Roberts, age 16, also quaintly described as a concubine. Not long after this census was taken, Bat Masterson received a telegram from Ben Thompson asking Bat to save Ben's troublesome brother, Billy Thompson, from almost certain lynching in Ogallala, Nebraska. Billy Thompson had shot the thumb off a man named Tucker, who – despite missing a digit – managed to fire back and seriously wound Billy. Masterson took Billy Thompson out of Ogallala by a midnight train bound for North Platte, Nebraska. In North Platte, Masterson was provided with assistance by no less a personage [...] than William F. [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] Cody, who promptly offered to help. According to Masterson, both Billy Thompson and he [...] "were given a royal welcome and were immediately taken in charge by Colonel Cody, who found a safe <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to remain until he could outfit us for the trip {{across the country to}} Dodge City." [...] The finale of the Billy Thompson episode was reported in the Dodge City Times, which noted that [...] "W.B. Masterson arrived from a visit to Ogallala, this week. He says Nebraska is dry and many people are leaving the state. He came by wagon, and was accompanied by 'Texas Billy' Thompson. The latter has recovered from his wounds." ...|$|E

Then he departed again to bring three carved stools of red wood which he <b>placed</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> I looked at mine and knew it again by the carvings. It was the same on which I had sat when first I met Zikali. At length he spoke in his deep, slow voice.|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} The {{objective of}} this paper is to present the implications of the contraction of space and time on individuals' relationships with them.   According to us, the contraction of space results in an excess of space and leads to its temporalization. In a similar manner, the contraction of time results in an excess of time : time which is more and more disorganized. An opposition is thus made between modern, ordered time, and postmodern "patchwork time". This contraction of space and time leads to a rise in anxieties and a certain quest for eternity, itself associated with the renewal of different forms of tribal organization. Facing this twofold movement of contraction, <b>places,</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> represent a <b>place</b> of refuge <b>for</b> individuals. Our proposition is that three different types of places be distinguished according to the level of exposure to real space-time and the role played by the individual's body...|$|R
