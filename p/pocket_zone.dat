The pegmatites of San Diego County, California, are part of the Mesozoic Peninsular Ranges Batholith of southwestern California and Baja California, Mexico. Three LCT- pegmatites were studied. The pegmatites have texturally, mineralogically, and chemically distinct footwalls, pegmatitic zones, and central pocket zones. Tourmaline shows enrichment in incompatible Li from the wall zones towards the pocket indicating that the dikes crystallized inward from the wall rock contact, with the line rock crystallizing until the melt reached fluid saturation, at which point, fluid and melt separated to form the pegmatite and the pockets, respectively. Li was strongly partitioned in favor of the fluid. The isotopic composition of tourmaline is reflective of the medium from which it crystallized and is controlled by the coordination of Li in that medium. ⁷Li prefers sites with smaller coordination numbers and stronger bonds while ⁶Li fractionates into weaker sites with higher coordination numbers. Tourmaline in the pegmatitic zone is isotopically heavier than that in the <b>pocket</b> <b>zone,</b> suggesting that ⁷Li was enriched in the melt and that the bonds of Li in the melt are stronger than the hydrated bonds of Li in the fluid. The [sigma] ⁷Li values in tourmaline crystallized in the pocket are similar to those in the line rock tourmaline, which is consistent with the accumulation of the bulk of the initial Li that was in the original melt in the pocket fluid, as this would result in little change in the isotopic composition of the Li...|$|E
40|$|Using angle-resolved photoemission {{spectroscopy}} (ARPES), {{we studied}} {{the effect of}} the impurity potential on the electronic structure of FeTe 0. 5 Se 0. 5 superconductor by substituting 10 % of Ni for Fe, which leads to an electron doping of the system. We could resolve three hole <b>pockets</b> near the <b>zone</b> center and an electron <b>pocket</b> near the <b>zone</b> corner in the case of FeTe 0. 5 Se 0. 5, whereas only two hole <b>pockets</b> near the <b>zone</b> center and an electron <b>pocket</b> near the <b>zone</b> corner are resolved in the case of Fe 0. 9 Ni 0. 1 Te 0. 5 Se 0. 5, suggesting that the hole pocket having predominantly the xy orbital character is very sensitive to the impurity scattering. Upon electron doping, the size of the hole pockets decreases {{and the size of the}} electron pockets increases as compared to the host compound. However, the observed changes in the size of the electron and hole pockets are not consistent with the rigid-band model. Moreover, the effective mass of the hole pockets is reduced near the zone center and of the electron pockets is increased near the zone corner in the doped Fe 0. 9 Ni 0. 1 Te 0. 5 Se 0. 5 as compared to FeTe 0. 5 Se 0. 5. We refer these observations to the changes of the spectral function due to {{the effect of the}} impurity potential of the dopants...|$|R
40|$|Angle-resolved photoemission {{spectroscopy}} of Ca 10 (Ir 4 As 8) (Fe 2 _xIrxAs 2) 5 {{shows that}} the Fe 3 d electrons in the FeAs layer form the hole-like Fermi <b>pocket</b> at the <b>zone</b> center and the electron-like Fermi <b>pockets</b> at the <b>zone</b> corners as commonly seen in various Fe-based superconductors. The FeAs layer is heavily electron doped and has relatively good two dimensionality. On the other hand, the Ir 5 d electrons are metallic and glassy probably due to atomic disorder related to the Ir 5 d orbital instability. Ca 10 (Ir 4 As 8) (Fe 2 _xIrxAs 2) 5 exhibits a unique electronic state where the Bloch electrons in the FeAs layer coexist with the glassy electrons in the Ir 4 As 8 layer.

40|$|Due to its {{excellent}} {{growth rate}} and productivity, Gmelina arborea (Roxb.) {{is widely used}} for commercial reforestation in Costa Rica. However during the lumber drying process, the wooden boards show non-uniform values of final moisture content (MC). The low uniformity in final MC {{is caused by the}} presence of "wet pockets", originated during the growing process of the tree. During the wood drying process, the regions with wet <b>pockets</b> present <b>zones</b> with a high MC, which are hard to detect with traditional methods for MC measurements. This article shows {{that it is possible to}} detect and to set the limits of the presence of wet wood in Gmelina arborea boards using scanning computed tomography (CT-scanning), a technique applied in medical diagnostic. ...|$|R

However, there are <b>pockets</b> of eutrophication <b>zones.</b> Bogs dominate the basin area, which causes flow of humic substances {{into the lake}} water.

Other parameters of chemical and physical properties of the lake waters measured relate to transparency (in meters), pH value, dissolved oxygen, COD, and concentrations of chlorophyll, nitrogen and phosphorus.|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{a recent}} {{experiment}} of Song et al. [Science 332, 1410 (2011) ], we theoretically study the spin dynamics, charge dynamics, and point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy (PCARS) of two-band iron-based superconductors of a possible extended s_±-wave pairing symmetry. We {{consider the case of}} a dominant s_± gap blended by a secondary extended s component in which gap nodes can develop in the Fermi <b>pockets</b> near <b>zone</b> corner and/or boundary. Due to the strong nesting effect associated with nodal regions, dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities can exhibit strong peaks at momenta near (±π/ 2, 0), (±π,±π/ 2), as well as (±π, 0) in the unfolded Brillouin zone. For PCARS, considering an anisotropic band effect induced by an applied voltage, [100] differential conductance can exhibit a V-shape behavior manifesting a gap node occurring in such direction. It is highly suggested that the above features can be experimentally investigated to help sorting out the pairing symmetry of iron-based superconductors...|$|R

For thin films we observe a 3 D Fermi surface with an electron pocket at the Brillouin zone center and hole <b>pockets</b> at the <b>zone</b> vertices. Superlattices with thick nickelate layers present a similar electronic structure. However, as {{the thickness of the}} LaNiO 3 is reduced the superlattices become insulating.

40|$|We have {{performed}} high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on heavily electron-doped non-superconducting (SC) BaFe$_{ 1. 7 }$Co$_{ 0. 3 }$As$_ 2 $. We {{find that the}} two hole Fermi surface <b>pockets</b> at the <b>zone</b> center observed in the hole-doped superconducting Ba$_{ 0. 6 }$K$_{ 0. 4 }$Fe$_ 2 $As$_ 2 $ are absent or very small in this compound, while the two electron pockets at the M point significantly expand due to electron doping by the Co substitution. Comparison of the Fermi surface between non-SC and SC samples indicates that the coexistence of hole and electron pockets connected via the antiferromagnetic wave vector is essential in realizing the mechanism of superconductivity in the iron-based superconductors.

40|$|Tourmalines {{from the}} Naipa Li-Cs-Ta {{granitic}} pegmatite group and metasomatized adjacent host rock {{were analyzed by}} electron microprobe to establish their chemical evolution within the zoned pegmatites, to distinguish between magmatic and hydrothermal tourmalines, and to explain their mode of formation and {{the origin of the}} individual crystal zoning. A compositional trend beginning with magmatic schorl from the line rock, schorl, elbaite and ‘fluor-elbaite’ from the inner intermediate <b>zone</b> and <b>pockets</b> in this <b>zone,</b> followed by elbaite and ‘fl uor-elbaite’ from core zones record a differentiation sequence, but Ca content increases in this sequence. These tourmalines formed from a strong fractionation of an (Na, Al, Li, B) -rich pegmatite, which had Ca at the time of emplacement. ‘Fluor-liddicoatite’ occurs in pockets from the core zones. The most calcic composition corresponds to (Ca 0. 80 Na 0. 18 0. 02) ∑ 1. 0 (Li 1. 81 Al 1. 14 Mn 0. 03 Fe 0. 02) ∑ 3. 0 Al 6 (Si 5. 89 Al 0. 11) ∑ 6. 0 O 18 (BO 3) 3 (OH 3. 27 F 0. 73) ∑ 4. 0. ‘Fluor-liddicoatite’ formed because Ca conservation and migration took place in the magma. Schorl crystals from the line rock are oscillatory zoned, indicating that crystal growth rates were faster than cations could diffuse through liquid. Some individual crystals of schorl and ‘fl uor-elbaite’ or only of ‘fluor-elbaite’ from the inner intermediate <b>zone</b> and <b>pockets</b> in this <b>zone</b> show progressive zoning, attributed to fractional crystallization. Other crystals of ‘fluor-elbaite’ from these <b>pockets</b> and core <b>zone</b> are reversely zoned due to nucleation and growth of evolved cores followed by back-reaction with the more primitive bulk magma. The main substitution mechanism in schorl and ‘fluor-elbaite’ is (Li 1. 5 Al 1. 5) (Fe 2 +) - 3 at the Y site, which is controlled by fractional crystallization, but the (Al) (NaR 2 +) - 1 substitution is also important. The (Ca 0. 5 0. 5) Na- 1 substitution occurs in ‘fluor-liddicoatite’. Hydrothermal ‘fl uor-elbaite’ from replacement units in the inner intermediate zone is Fe-, Na- and Ca-poor. The two coupled substitutions (Li 1. 5 Al 1. 5) (Fe 2 +) - 3 at the Y site and (Al) (NaR 2 +) - 1 took place. Hydrothermal fluor-dravite from the metasomatized chlorite phyllite adjacent to the granitic pegmatite group resulted from the mixing of magmatic-hydrothermal fl uids carrying Na, Al, Fe, Li, F and B with a meteoric fl uid that has interacted with this Fe-Mg-bearing pelitic country rock. The main substitution in this tourmaline is FeMg– 1. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} {{comprehensive}} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy {{study of the}} tridimensional electronic bands in the recently discovered Fe selenide superconductor (Tl,Rb) $_y$Fe$_{ 2 -x}$Se$_ 2 $ ($T_c= 32 $ K). We determined the orbital characters and the $k_z$ dependence of the low energy electronic structure by tuning the polarization and {{the energy of the}} incident photons. We observed a small 3 D electron Fermi surface pocket near the Brillouin zone center and a 2 D like electron Fermi surface <b>pocket</b> near the <b>zone</b> boundary. The photon energy dependence, the polarization analysis and the local-density approximation calculations suggest a significant contribution from the Se 4 $p_z$ and Fe 3 $d_{xy}$ orbitals to the small electron pocket. We argue that the emergence of Se 4 $p_z$ states might be the cause of the different magnetic properties between Fe chalcogenides and Fe pnictides. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Post-industrial riverfronts in the ‘Rust-Belt’ {{region of}} the United States have faced the {{consequences}} of [de]industrialization, including massive ecological disturbances. The Lower Cuyahoga River in Cleveland started facing those consequences when it was modified in the 1800 s. The river channel was radically re-engineered with an aim to ease the movement of ships upstream and economize the businesses in that region. On occasion, the river caught fire due to the heavy oil wastes discharged by the industries. Subsequently the river’s health deteriorated affecting the aquatic habitat and the riverfront landscapes. The purpose of this thesis is to suggest how the lost river ecology of the Lower Cuyahoga River in Cleveland might be recovered by establishing habitat <b>pockets</b> and <b>zones</b> that support aquatic life. Landscape solutions are proposed to improve the water quality by reducing contaminants that are carried into the river by overland flow. These interventions would allow {{for the creation of}} public amenities along the riverfront, and reintegration of the fragmented post-industrial fabric. The infrastructure along the riverfront has a strong correlation with the health of the river, thus adaptive-reuse of existing infrastructure is a major strategy explored in this thesis. Because this design thesis also focuses on the deteriorating ecological health of the river, it proposes test sites for the decontamination and oxygenation of water to support fish habitat. Vacant and contaminated sites are considered centers for treating the harmful chemicals present in the landscape, carried into the river with overland flow. Based on the planning vision for this district of the city, it is possible that, in future, opportunities will become available to return the river to its pre-industrial profile...|$|R
40|$|We {{constructed}} {{an effective}} tight-binding model with five Cr 3 d orbitals for LaOCrAs according to first-principles calculations. Basing on this model, we investigated possible superconductivity induced by correlations in doped LaOCrAs using the functional renormalization group (FRG). We {{find that there}} are two domes of superconductivity in electron-doped LaOCrAs. With increasing electron doping, the ground state of the system evolves from G-type antiferromagnetism in the parent compound to an incipient s_±-wave superconducting phase dominated by electron bands derived from the d_ 3 z^ 2 -r^ 2 orbital as the filling is above 4. 2 electrons per site on the d-orbitals of Cr. The gap function has strong octet anisotropy on the Fermi <b>pocket</b> around the <b>zone</b> center and diminishes on the other pockets. In electron over-doped LaOCrAs, the system develops d_x^ 2 -y^ 2 -wave superconducting phase and the active band derives from the d_xy orbital. Inbetween the two superconducting domes, a time-reversal symmetry breaking s+id SC phase is likely to occur. We also find s_±-wave superconducting phase in the hole-doped case.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a topological nodal-line (TNL) semimetal phase in ZrSiS has invigorated the study of other members of this family. Here, we present a comparative electronic structure study of ZrSiX (where X = S, Se, Te) using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations. Our ARPES {{studies show that the}} overall electronic structure of ZrSiX materials comprises of the diamond-shaped Fermi pocket, the nearly elliptical-shaped Fermi pocket, and a small electron <b>pocket</b> encircling the <b>zone</b> center (Γ) point, the M point, and the X point of the Brillouin zone, respectively. We also observe a small Fermi surface pocket along the M-Γ-M direction in ZrSiTe, which is absent in both ZrSiS and ZrSiSe. Furthermore, our theoretical studies show a transition from nodal-line to nodeless gapped phase by tuning the chalcogenide from S to Te in these material systems. Our findings provide direct evidence for the tunability of the TNL phase in ZrSiX material systems by adjusting the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength via the X anion.

40|$|Topological Dirac semimetals with {{accidental}} band touching between conduction and {{valence bands}} protected by time reversal and inversion symmetry {{are at the}} frontier of modern condensed matter research. Theoretically one can get Weyl and/or nodal-line semimetals by breaking either one of them. Most of the discovered topological semimetals are nonmagnetic i. e respect time reversal symmetry. Here we report the experimental observation of a topological nodal-line semi metallic state in GdSbTe using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our systematic study reveals the detailed electronic structure of the paramagnetic state of GdSbTe. We observe the presence of multiple Fermi surface pockets including a diamond-shape, an elliptical shape, and small circular <b>pockets</b> around the <b>zone</b> center and high symmetry M and X points of the Brillouin zone (BZ), respectively. Furthermore, we observe {{the presence of a}} Dirac-like state at the X point of the BZ. Interestingly, our experimental data shows a robust Dirac like state both below and above the magnetic transition temperature (T_N ~ 13 K). Having relatively higher transition temperature, GdSbTe provides an archetype platform to study the interaction between magnetism and topological states of matter. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Membrane inlet mass {{spectrometry}} (MIMS) {{was used to}} monitor continuously and simultaneously the concentrations of dissolved gases (O 2, CO 2, CH 4) within the treatment bed of a willow vegetation filter treating leachate at a landfill site in mid Wales. The distribution of dissolved gasses within the bed was shown to be highly heterogeneous at the small spatial scale with considerable variation between vertical profiles measured simultaneously at different locations. In general, aerobic conditions were observed above the water table with reduced levels of oxygen and increasing levels {{of carbon dioxide and}} methane below it. Distinct pockets of oxygen (up to 200 μM) were observed in anaerobic <b>zones</b> and <b>pockets</b> of reduced oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide were observed in the aerobic <b>zone.</b> <b>Pockets</b> of methane were observed in some profiles coexisting with up to 200 μM oxygen at 5 cm depth. These observations confirm the hypothesis that micro-sites exists within the soil/root matrix where aerobic organic matter decomposition and anaerobic processes such as methanogenesis can occur in relatively close proximity to each other. We hypothesise that the distribution of dissolved gases is determined by rapid diffusion of air maintaining aerobic conditions above the water table, removal of oxygen by microbial processes creating anaerobic conditions below the water table and the distribution of willow roots in the soil which create local aerobic zones by oxygen release...|$|R
40|$|The latest {{discovery}} of high temperature superconductivity signature in single-layer FeSe {{is significant because}} {{it is possible to}} break the superconducting critical temperature ceiling (maximum Tc~ 55 K) that has been stagnant since the {{discovery of}} Fe-based superconductivity in 2008. It also blows the superconductivity community by surprise because such a high Tc is unexpected in FeSe system with the bulk FeSe exhibiting a Tc at only 8 K at ambient pressure which can be enhanced to 38 K under high pressure. The Tc is still unusually high even considering the newly-discovered intercalated FeSe system A_xFe_{ 2 -y}Se_ 2 (A=K, Cs, Rb and Tl) with a Tc at 32 K at ambient pressure and possible Tc near 48 K under high pressure. Particularly interesting is that such a high temperature superconductivity occurs in a single-layer FeSe system that is considered as a key building block of the Fe-based superconductors. Understanding the origin of high temperature superconductivity in such a strictly two-dimensional FeSe system is crucial to understanding the superconductivity mechanism in Fe-based superconductors in particular, and providing key insights on how to achieve high temperature superconductivity in general. Here we report distinct electronic structure associated with the single-layer FeSe superconductor. Its Fermi surface topology is different from other Fe-based superconductors; it consists only of electron <b>pockets</b> near the <b>zone</b> corner without indication of any Fermi surface around the zone center. Our observation of large and nearly isotropic superconducting gap in this strictly two-dimensional system rules out existence of node in the superconducting gap. These results have provided an unambiguous case that such a unique electronic structure is favorable for realizing high temperature superconductivity...|$|R

Three sites {{near the village of}} Port Graham were also sampled for comparison. Concentrations of over 120 organic and metallic contaminants were analyzed. Ambient toxicity was assessed using two bioassays. A detailed benthic community condition assessment was performed. Habitat parameters (e. g. depth, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, sediment grain size, and organic carbon content) that influence species and contaminant distribution were also measured at each sampling site. The following is the synopsis of findings • Sediments were mostly mixed silt and sand with <b>pockets</b> of muddy <b>zones.</b> Organic compounds (PAHs, DDTs, PCBs, chlorinated pesticides) were detected throughout the bay but at relatively low concentrations. With some exceptions, metals concentrations were relatively low and probably reflect the input of glacial runoff. • Homer Harbor had elevated concentrations of metallic and organic contaminants. Concentrations of organic contaminants measured were five to ten times higher in the harbor sites than in the open bay sites. Tributyltin was elevated in Homer Harbor relative to the other areas. • There was no evidence of residual PAHs attributable to oil spills, outside of local input in the confines of the harbor. • The benthic community is very diverse. Specific community assemblages were distributed based on depth and water clarity. Species richness and diversity was lower in the eastern end of the bay {{in the vicinity of the}} Fox River input. Abundance was also generally lower in the eastern portion of the study area, and in the intertidal areas near Homer. The eastern portions of the bay are stressed by the sediment load from glacial meltwater. • Significant toxicity was virtually absent. • The benthic fauna at Port Graham contained a significant number of species not found in Kachemak Bay. • Selected metal concentrations were elevated at Port Graham relative to Kachemak Bay, probably due to local geology. Organic contaminants were elevated at a site south of the village...|$|R
40|$|In {{carbonate}} rocks, {{especially in}} those with high primary porosity such as most Cenozoic carbonates, the interaction between deeply derived rising flow through sub-vertical fracture-controlled conduits and intrastratal matrix flow of shallower systems can invoke mixing cor- rosion and result in prominent speleogenetic effects. This paper outlines a conceptual model of such interaction and provides instructive field examples of relevant morphological effects from two different regions within the Prichernomorsky (north Black Sea) basin, where karst features are developed in lower Pliocene, Eocene and Paleocene limestones. In the Crimean fore-mountain region, extensive steep to ver- tical limestone scarps formed through recent exposure of hypogenic fracture-controlled conduits provide outstanding possibilities to directly examine details of the original karstic porosity. The morphological effects of the conduit/matrix interaction, documented in both caves and exposed scarps, include lateral widening of sub-vertical conduits within the interaction intervals (formation of lateral notches and niches) {{and the development of}} side bedding-parallel conduits, <b>pockets</b> and vuggy-spongework <b>zones.</b> Natural convection circulation, invoked by interaction of the two flow systems, spreads the morphological effects throughout the conduit space above the interaction interval. Where the interaction of the two flow systems is particularly strongly localized, such as along junctions of two vertical fracture sets, the resultant morphological effect can take the form of isolated chambers. The variety of speleogenetic features developed through the conduit/matrix interaction, can be broadly grouped into two categories: 1) variously shaped swells of the major fracture conduit itself (morphological fea- tures of its walls – niches and pockets), and 2) features of the vuggy-spongework halo surrounding the conduit. This halo includes clustered and stratiform cavities, spongework zones and lateral side conduits. The speleogenetic features due to conduit/matrix flow interaction, especially the halo forms, often demonstrate distinct asymmetry between opposite walls of the conduits. The prominent phenomenon of the vuggy-spongework halo around fracture-controlled conduits has important hydrogeological implications. A comparison of karst features in different regions and rock formations clearly shows that in spite of some distinctions imposed by local structural, sedimentological and paleo-hydrogeological peculiarities, hypogenic speleoforms in limestones of different age and of different degree of diagenetic maturity demonstrate remarkable similarities...|$|R
40|$|A {{baseline}} environmental {{characterization of}} the inner Kachemak Bay, Alaska was conducted using the sediment quality triad approach based on sediment chemistry, sediment toxicity, and benthic invertebrate community structure. The study area was subdivided into 5 strata based on geophysical and hydrodynamic patterns in the bay (eastern and western intertidal mud flats, eastern and western subtidal, and Homer Harbor). Three to seven locations were synoptically sampled within each stratum using a stratified random statistical design approach. Three sites {{near the village of}} Port Graham and two sites in the footprint of a proposed Homer Harbor expansion were also collected for comparison. Concentrations of over 120 organic and metallic contaminants were analyzed. Ambient toxicity was assessed using two amphipod bioassays. A detailed benthic community condition assessment was performed. Habitat parameters (depth, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, sediment grain size, and organic carbon content) that influence species and contaminant distribution were also measured at each sampling site. Sediments were mostly mixed silt and sand; characteristic of high energy habitats, with <b>pockets</b> of muddy <b>zones.</b> Organic compounds (PAHs, DDTs, PCBs, cyclodienes, cyclohexanes) were detected throughout the bay but at relatively low concentrations. Tributyltin was elevated in Homer Harbor relative to the other strata. With a few exceptions, metals concentrations were relatively low and probably reflect the input of glacial runoff. Relative to other sites, Homer Harbor sites were shown to have elevated concentrations of metallic and organic contaminants. The Homer Harbor stratum however, is a deep, low energy depositional environment with fine grained sediment. Concentrations of organic contaminants measured were five to ten times higher in the harbor sites than in the open bay sites. Concentration of PAHs is of a particular interest because of the legacy of oil spills in the region. There was no evidence of residual PAHs attributable to oil spills, outside of local input, beyond the confines of the harbor. Concentrations were one to ten times below NOAA sediment quality guidelines. Selected metal concentrations were found to be relatively elevated compared to other data collected in the region. However, levels are still very low in the scale of NOAA’s sediment quality guidelines, and therefore appear to pose little or no ecotoxicity threat to biota. Infaunal assessment showed a diverse assemblage with more than 240 taxa recorded and abundances greater than 3, 000 animals m- 22 in all but a few locations.

40|$|Complex oxides {{provide a}} {{platform}} for designing new functional material systems and manipulating {{the properties of the}} existing ones thanks to a vast array of their tunable and exotic ground states. The interactions between the internal degrees of freedom in such systems often cannot be fully accounted for by modern theory, and it is necessary to directly probe the electronic structure underlying a complex phase to reveal its nature. The emergent properties of ruthenates are particularly tunable, as evidenced by their wide variety of electronic and magnetic instabilities including unconventional superconductivity, metamagnetism and formation of electronic liquid crystalline states, ferro- and antiferromagnetism, and spin-glass behavior. Some of these phases occur in closely related compounds, or are switchable within the same compound by a small external perturbation, such as pressure, strain or magnetic field. This dissertation presents direct measurements of the electronic structure in Ba$_ 2 $RuO$_ 4 $ and BaRuO$_ 3 $, close analogues of the spin-triplet superconductor Sr$_ 2 $RuO$_ 4 $ and ferromagnetic SrRuO$_ 3 $, respectively, using a unique integrated oxide molecular-beam epitaxy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. This approach allows us to access compounds that have no stable bulk form and deliberately manipulate their electronic properties via epitaxial strain and dimensionality confinement. We first discuss the ARPES measurements of Ba$_ 2 $RuO$_ 4 $ and Sr$_ 2 $RuO$_ 4 $. By varying the amount of biaxial in-plane strain through epitaxial stabilization on different substrates, we reveal a systematic evolution of the Fermi surface and quasiparticle mass enhancements. We reveal a topological transition in the circular electron Fermi <b>pocket</b> centered at <b>zone</b> center as a function of strain and cation size. Near the topological Lifshitz transition, we observe clear signatures of quantum criticality. The quasiparticle mass enhancements are found to increase rapidly and monotonically with increasing Ru-O bond distance. By next studying atomically thin films of BaRuO$_ 3 $ we are able to directly see how the dimensional confinement drives the transition from a ferromagnetic ground state to a strongly fluctuating paramagnetic state. Our results provide new insights into the physics of perovskite ruthenates and demonstrate the possibilities for using epitaxial strain and dimensional confinement as disorder-free means of manipulating emergent properties and many-body interactions in correlated quantum materials. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|R
40|$|Several {{quarries}} in the Murge {{area were}} studied {{to comprehend the}} karstification processes of the Apulia carbonate platform. The selected outcrops are of different age and depositional setting. Two quarries consist of sub- to peritidal cycles that are Aptian in age. Two other quarries consist of Cenomanian rudist banks topped by a paleosol and overlain by Senonian peritidal beds. Stable isotopes were used to correlate between the different quarries, detect the karstification influence zone within the host rock and understand the specific diagenetical products that are present (speleothems, hardgrounds, …). Micrite samples were analyzed to assess the original stable isotope signature during sedimentation and the overprinting by recrystallization related to meteoric water infiltration. Stable isotope results plot in a narrow δ 18 O-range (- 4, 5 ‰ to - 2, 5 ‰) but in a wide δ 13 C-range (- 5, 5 ‰ to + 3, 5 ‰), reflecting meteoric diagenetic overprinting. Results from different outcrops plot in different clusters. The Cenomanian rudist banks from different outcrops plot {{in exactly the same}} range. Results of the subtidal versus the peritidal Aptian cycles are separated by a δ 13 C-shift of - 1, 5 ‰. In the Cenomanian outcrops several hardgrounds occur. Stable carbon-isotope profiles across hardgrounds show a local positive excursion of + 1, 5 ‰ due to early marine cementation, and can be correlated accurately between the outcrops. A paleosol separates the Cenomanian from the Senonian deposits. A distinct negative δ 13 C-excursion occurs at this level and relates to soil-forming diagenesis. The overlying Senonian deposits are 2 ‰ δ 13 C more depleted than the Cenomanian rudist banks. Due to the impermeable nature of the paleosol, the Cenomanian deposits were protected from meteoric fluids that could only penetrate where the paleosol was breached by fractures. Several series of samples were taken at the same stratigraphic level, but at increasing distance from karst pockets. The carbon stable isotope results of these samples revealed an influence zone smaller than 1 m around the karst <b>pockets.</b> Inside this <b>zone</b> a decrease in δ 13 C of 1, 4 ‰ occurs that fades away exponentially from the karst cavity. Diagenetic features such as cements and speleothems were analyzed to reveal different phases of cementation and the influence of flow rate within dissolutional cavities (karst pockets, vugs, …). The δ 18 O results of the cements cover the same range as the micrite samples. The δ 13 C range stretches from - 11, 5 ‰ to + 3, 0 ‰. The sampled speleothems have different morphologies (stalactite, euhedral crystals, crust, …), but their isotopic signature is identical. Therefore they likely precipitated from the same fluid but in different regimes (phreatic, vadose,…). The results of the cements generally plot in 2 groups. One group occurs close to the original limestone micrite composition. These calcite cements relate mainly to precipitates that formed early inside fenestrae and molds, after the dissolution of (aragonitic) bioclasts. However, this phase does not occur in all molds. The second group of cements plot close to the speleothem cluster, but is less δ 13 C depleted. The latter precipitated from the same fluids as the speleothems but underwent more rock-water interaction. Because these cements precipitated inside small vugs and molds, flow rate likely was lower, when compared to flow rates inside large karst cavities and more interaction with the host rock was possible. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{approach in the}} study of karstified carbonate reservoirs is applied by Eni E&P on different reservoir analogue outcrops. The study of the relationships between the sedimentary framework, tectonic evolution and subaerial exposure characteristics in three-dimensional outcrops in Apulia is a key to interpret and forecast the porosity-permeability properties distribution in Southern Italy’s carbonate reservoirs. Since the Upper Cretaceous the Apulia carbonate platform underwent several phases of exhumation and karstification with the creation of vugs and caverns in different shapes and sizes. Apart from the duration of exposure and intensity of sea-level fall, the distribution as well as the organisation of the karst cavities are influenced by several factors. The aim {{of this study is to}} define the dominant factors for the observed karst types. Sedimentological (depositional environment, bedding texture) and diagenetic (small scale dissolution, stylolites, cementation, fracturing) aspects have been studied in the field, hand samples and thin sections. Mechanical stratigraphic analyses has been performed on different structural datasets (fracture orientation, length, opening) obtained by field measurements, high resolution photography and LIDAR acquisition. Karstification phenomena have been described based on field characteristics and controlling parameters were explored. Cement phases and (paleo-) speleothems were sampled and their stable isotope composition was determined. To refine the relative stratigraphic setting of the outcrops studied, chemostratigraphic and biostratigraphic analyses have been carried out. For this study, 4 quarry outcrops are studied and sampled in the Murge area. In these quarries, the limestones of the Apulia platform cover a range from Aptian to Senonian in age. Two of the quarries are located close to the coast near the towns of Trani and Bisceglie and consist of Aptian inter- and subtidal mud- to wackestones. The Cavallerizza and Barile quarries are located 20 km inland and consist of Cenomanian rudist dominated subtidal mudstone. Towards the top of these mudstones a well-developed paleosol occurs overlain by Senonian peritidal deposits. Stable C- and O-isotope measurements combined with biostratigraphical data allowed to position the different outcrops in a stratigraphical framework. Hardgrounds preserved their original signature better due to early marine cementation and are a tool for outcrop correlation. A paleosol separates the Cenomanian from the Senonian deposits. A distinct negative δ 13 C-excursion occurs at this level and relates to soil-forming diagenesis. The overlying Senonian deposits are 2 ‰ δ 13 C more depleted than the Cenomanian rudist banks. Due to the impermeable nature of the paleosol, the Cenomanian deposits were protected from meteoric fluids that could only penetrate where the paleosol was breached by fractures. Around karst <b>pockets</b> an influence <b>zone</b> is present that extends 1 m in the host rock. Within this zone δ 13 C-depletion of 1, 4 ‰ is observed, which fades out exponentially with distance from the karst cavity. Due to lower water-rock interaction, calcite precipitation within large vugs and karst cavities has more depleted δ 13 C signatures than in smaller pores (e. g. : molds). Porosity measurements revealed porosity is present on a wide spectrum. Porosity of the host rock is high (up to 25 %) but is mainly limited to microporosity and molds. Karstification and solution enlarged fractures add ca. 5 %. The latter pores make up a well connected pore network. Total porosity can thus attain 30 %. Based on fracture orientation data extracted from LIDAR scans different orientation clusters were observed between fractures that were karstified and fractures that were not karstified, which thus postdate karstification. The clusters of karstified fractures are related to the compression of the southern Apennines and were dissolution enlarged during the uplift caused by bulging of the Apulia platform (Pleistocene). This main karstification phase occurred prior to Late-Pleistocene deposition and before orthogonal fracture sets formed, which are not karstified. Mechanical stratigraphy was used to calculate the fracturing within different sedimentary layers. Several mechanical units were defined and a characteristic relation was found between unit thicknesses and fracture intensity. Fracture intensity increases if layer thickness decreases. In some of the quarries sedimentary cycles were clearly present. These could then also be observed in fracture intensity logs. The degree of karstification within a mechanical unit is inversely proportional to the respective fracture intensity. Several karstification types are recognized in the Murge area. Paleokarstification comprises small scale bioclasts dissolution and karstification of the loose sediments below hardgrounds. When the karst cavity exceeded the maximum span for the hardgrounds they collapsed and filled the void. For the “Subrecent” karst that formed during the Pleistocene three concepts are proposed. 1) Karst cavities are formed below an impermeable paleosol along fractures that crosscut this paleosol. These fractures are the main infiltration paths for meteoric fluids to reach the rock below. 2) In layered rocks karstification is controlled by fracture intensity of the layers (mechanical stratigraphy). Karstification mainly occurs in layers where fracture intensity is low and fluid flow is focussed through only few fractures. 3) The normal faults in the area are preferential pathways for meteoric fluids. The footwall of normal faults is readily affected by karstification. Fluids that pass through normal faults can be injected into mechanical stratigraphic controlled karst features. In this study, the combination of several techniques led to the conclusion that karstification in the Murge area is mostly controlled by fracturing. The fractures are the result of the tectonic regime implied by the southern Apennines orogeny, by forming compressional conjugate fracture sets, normal faults and dextral transpressional fractures. Mechanical stratigraphy is a tool to examine the fracture intensity within layers and mechanical units. The thickness of mechanical units is inverse proportionally related to the fracture intensity which then controls the amount of karstification within that unit. status: publishe...|$|R
