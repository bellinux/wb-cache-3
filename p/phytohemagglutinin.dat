50|$|Expression is {{induced by}} <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> in human {{lymphocytes}} and by serum stimulation of arrested fibroblasts. Translocation of the protein from the nucleus to mitochondria induces apoptosis. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified.|$|E
50|$|Raw kidney beans, and, to {{a lesser}} extent, some other such beans as broad beans or fava beans, contain the toxin <b>phytohemagglutinin.</b> Boiling destroys this toxin, but the far lower {{temperature}} of a slow cooker does not. This means that dry beans must be boiled at 100 C for at least 30 minutes prior to slow cooking, or, alternatively, they must be soaked in water overnight, after which the water must be discarded, and the beans must then be boiled for at least 10 minutes. Even a few beans can be toxic, and beans can {{be as much as}} five times more toxic if cooked at 80 C than if eaten raw, so adequate pre-boiling is vital, and indeed crucial, to avoid <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> poisoning.|$|E
50|$|ConA is a {{lymphocyte}} mitogen. Similar to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> (PHA), it is {{a selective}} T cell mitogen relative to {{its effects on}} B cells. PHA and ConA bind and cross-link components of the T cell receptor, {{and their ability to}} activate T cells is dependent on expression of the T cell receptor.|$|E
50|$|Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA, or <b>phytohemagglutinin)</b> is a lectin {{found in}} plants, {{especially}} certain legumes. PHA actually {{consists of two}} closely related proteins, called leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and PHA-E. The letters E and L indicate these proteins agglutinate erythrocytes and leukocytes. Phytohaemagglutinin has carbohydrate-binding specificity for a complex oligosaccharide containinggalactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes nerve {{growth factor}} IB {{that is a}} member of the steroid-thyroid hormone-retinoid {{receptor}} superfamily. Expression is induced by <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> in human lymphocytes and by serum stimulation of arrested fibroblasts. The encoded protein acts as a nuclear transcription factor. Translocation of the protein from the nucleus to mitochondria induces apoptosis. Location is on the same strand as C12orf44, spans 8097 bp.|$|E
50|$|Following {{table lists}} {{selected}} nutrients in kidney beans {{to show the}} effect of sprouting. Raw kidney beans contain high amounts of the toxin <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> the US Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature long enough to completely destroy the toxin. Nutrients are calculated for 100 gms of non-water components to take {{the water out of}} equation since after sprouting beans absorb lot of water.|$|E
50|$|Raw {{kidney beans}} contain {{relatively}} high amounts of <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> {{and thus are}} more toxic than most other bean varieties if not pre-soaked and subsequently heated to the boiling point for at least 10 minutes. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature long enough to completely destroy the toxin. Cooking at the lower temperature of , such as in a slow cooker, can increase this danger and raise the toxin concentration up to fivefold. Canned red kidney beans, though, are safe to use immediately.|$|E
50|$|Interferon gamma (IFNγ) is a {{dimerized}} soluble cytokine that is {{the only}} member of the type II class of interferons. The existence of this interferon, which early in its history was known as immune interferon, was described by E. F. Wheelock as a product of human leukocytes stimulated with <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> and by others as a product of antigen-stimulated lymphocytes or tuberculin-sensitized mouse peritoneal lymphocytes challenged with PPD; the resulting supernatants were shown to inhibit growth of vesicular stomatitis virus. Those reports also contained the basic observation underlying the now widely employed interferon gamma release assay used to test for tuberculosis. In humans, the IFNγ protein is encoded by the IFNG gene.|$|E
50|$|The legume lectins (or L-type lectins) are {{a family}} of sugar binding {{proteins}} or lectins found in the seeds and, in smaller amounts, in the roots, stems, leaves and bark of plants belonging to the Fabaceae family. The exact function of the legume lectins in vivo is unknown but they are probably involved {{in the defense of}} plants against predators. Related proteins in other plant families and in animals have also been found. They have been used for decades as a model system for the study of protein-carbohydrate interactions, because they show an amazing variety of binding specificities and are easy to obtain and purify. Over the years, aquite impressive amount of structural data has been gathered. Well-studied members of this protein family include <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> and concanavalin A.|$|E
5000|$|Cystathionine, an {{intermediary}} product of this biochemical pathway, is secreted in urine. This process can effectively {{lead to the}} depletion of vital protective reserves of the sulfur amino acid cysteine and thereby making Vicia sativa seed a dangerous component in mixture with other toxin sources. The Spanish pulse mix [...] contains common vetch and bitter vetch in addition to vetchling (Lathyrus cicera) seeds; it can be fed in small quantities to ruminants, but its use as a staple food will cause lathyrism even in these animals. Moreover, common vetch as well as broad bean - and probably other species of Vicia too - contain oxidants like convicine, isouramil, divicine and vicine in quantities sufficient to lower glutathione levels in G6PD-deficient persons to cause favism disease. At least broad beans also contain the lectin <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> and are somewhat poisonous if eaten raw. Split common vetch seeds resemble split red lentils (Lens culinaris), and has been occasionally mislabelled as such by exporters or importers to be sold for human consumption. In some countries where lentils are highly popular - e.g., Bangladesh, Egypt, India and Pakistan - import bans on suspect produce have been established to prevent these potentially harmful scams.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{of human}} {{subjects}} {{with a history}} of leishmania infection suggest that modulation of CD8+ suppressor T cells is, at least partly, mediated by cytokines. Leishmania specific CD4+ helper T cells predominate in adults with strong protective immunity (skin-test positive with no history of clinical infection). When added to autologous leishmania infected macrophages these T cells cause parasite death and secretion of large amounts of interferon-gamma and lymphotoxin. CD8+ T suppressor cells predominate in patients with no protective immunity (visceral leishmaniasis patients). When added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated after successful treatment, these T cells inhibit interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation and increase interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 secretion. A soluble factor(s) generated by antigen or <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> stimulation of leishmania-specific CD4+ helper T cells from skin-test positive adults killed CD8+ T cells but not CD4+ helper T cells when added to culture media. Soluble factors generated by antigen stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from skin-test positive adults prevented CD8+ suppressor T cell mediated increases in interleukin-10 secretion. These findings suggest that antigen stimulation of CD4+ helper T cells results in production of cytokines that kill or down regulate CD8+ T suppressor cells. Once the leishmania infection has been eliminated and leishmania antigens are gone, CD8+ T suppressor cells down-regulate CD4+ T helper cells. Isolation of cytokines that inhibit and kill CD8+ T suppressor cells might be useful in treating diseases that involve immune suppression such as leishmaniasis, AIDS, and certain cancers.|$|E
40|$|The {{stage of}} {{development}} and age were found to effect the responsiveness of dog T-lymphocytes to <b>phytohemagglutinin.</b> T-lymphocytes from beagles 0 to 4 weeks of age showed significantly less response to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> (P < 0. 001) than T-lymphocytes from these same dogs at 6 to 12 weeks of age. Peak response to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> occurred between 6 weeks to 6 months of age, after which {{there was a significant}} correlation (P < 0. 02) between increase in age and decrease in <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> responsiveness...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phytohemagglutinin</b> and the lectin-related {{proteins}} {{present in}} bean seeds are toxic to monogastric animals {{and lower the}} nutritional value of beans. Since these antimetabolites are present in substantial amounts, a breeding program aimed to the removal of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> was developed. The character “absence of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> ” was transferred into a bean cultivar by backcrossing. The lines obtained maintained the agronomic performance of the recurrent parent. Preliminary results show that removal of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> results in a higher true protein digestibility. Further modification {{in the composition of}} the lectin-related protein family is now under way...|$|E
40|$|Lymphocytes {{incubated}} with <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> or concanavalin A {{develop the}} capacity to stimulate autologous lymphocyte transformation. This is not attributable to residual mitogen contaminating the lymphoblastic cell preparation as: (a) the dissociation of mitogen from the lymphoblastic cell preparation increases the degree of stimulation observed and (b) the kinetics of lymphocyte transformation stimulated by phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphoblasts {{is different from that}} stimulated by <b>phytohemagglutinin.</b> The appearance of the stimulatory determinants on lymphocytes exposed to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> precedes morphological transformation...|$|E
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study the mechanism of infectious bursal disease virus induced suppression of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Infectious bursal disease virus inoculation of one week old chicks resulted in significant suppression of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> stimulation {{during the first three}} days after inoculation as demonstrated by a whole blood assay. Mild thymic necrosis was seen on day 3. Hematological changes during this time consisted of increased numbers of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes in infected chickens. Absolute monocyte counts remained elevated even after <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> stimulation had returned to normal. Furthermore, even after a 72. 3 % reduction in the monocyte population in leukocyte preparations, there was still marked viral induced suppression of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> stimulation. An elevation in the absolute number of circulating large immature lymphocytes correlated with suppression of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> stimulation. Sera from infected and control chickens depressed <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> stimulation of lymphocytes from control chickens at the 5 and 10 % concentration. At the 1 % concentration, inhibiton by control sera was considerably less than the inhibition by infected sera. The relationship between these findings and the mechanism of viral induced suppression of T-lymphocyte function is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In BALB/c mice {{previously}} inoculated intraperitoneally with an immunogenic {{dose of the}} T-independent antigen type III pneumococcal polysaccharide, the {{intravenous administration}} of the T-cell activating agent <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> P causes a pronounced {{increase in the number}} and relative proportion of immunoglobulin G-producing cells. These results, detected by a modified hemolytic plaque assay, were supported by finding increased levels of serum immunoglobulin G anti-type III pneumococcal polysaccharide in the treated mice. A comparable stimulation of immunoglobulin G antibody-producing cells was not induced in <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> P-treated nude mice, indicating that the change in class of the predominant antibody is attributable to the activation by the <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> P of a T-cell population. Under the conditions of these experiments, <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> P also promotes a progressive suppression of the antibody-forming cells during the response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcal {{peptidoglycan}} can modulate in vivo and {{in vitro}} antibody responses {{and is a}} B-cell mitogen. The effect of in vivo peptidoglycan treatment on the subsequent in vitro mitogenic responsiveness of mouse splenocytes to <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, and lipopolysaccharide was studied by measuring changes in deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. Injection of peptidoglycan caused a 100 % increase in responsiveness to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> and pokeweed mitogen and a 45 % increase in responsiveness to concanavalin A. Responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide was decreased by 40 %. Increased <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> and decreased lipopolysaccharide responses were not due {{to changes in the}} kinetics of the response or optimal concentrations of these mitogens. Increased responsiveness to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> lasted for 2 weeks after peptidoglycan injection. Neither increased background deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis nor changes in the proportion of T cells after peptidoglycan treatment fully accounted for the changes in responsiveness to the mitogens. In vitro costimulation with peptidoglycan and <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> lipopolysaccharide, concanavalin A, or pokeweed mitogen resulted in interference of the response. Cell separation experiments indicated that peptidoglycan-induced modulation of mitogenic responsiveness was mediated by B lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|In {{studies of}} 13 normal adults to {{determine}} the blood cell types responsible for interferon production induced by <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> the following observations were made. (a) In cultures containing 96 - 100 % pure macrophages derived from blood monocytes, no interferon was detected in either the presence or the absence of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> for up to 92 hr. (b) In cultures of 99. 5 - 100 % pure lymphocytes, low levels of interferon were detected in the presence, {{but not in the}} absence, of <b>phytohemagglutinin.</b> (c) An average fivefold increase in interferon titers occurred when pure lymphocytes were combined with the macrophages in culture with <b>phytohemagglutinin.</b> The peak response of interferon occurred at 68 hr after the initiation of the combined cultures. For maximum response, <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> was required {{for the duration of the}} culture, and both cell types in association were necessary. Medium from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated macrophages or lymphocytes could not substitute for the corresponding intact cell. However, frozen-thawed macrophages in combination with lymphocytes and <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> produced an intermediate interferon response. An increase in either cell type produced an increased response in the range studied: lymphocytes, 0. 45 - 1. 8 × 106 per ml; and macrophages, 0. 5 - 2. 1 × 105 per ml. Syngeneic fibroblasts, HeLa cells, or mouse macrophages could not substitute for the human macrophages in the combined cultures with <b>phytohemagglutinin.</b> (d) Although all cultures producing interferon showed some degree of transformation (thymidine- 3 H incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid), no direct correlation between the degree of phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte transformation and the interferon titers was observed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phytohemagglutinin</b> is able {{to trigger}} {{interferon}} synthesis in spleen cell cultures from nude (nu/nu) mice as effectively as in splenic cell cultures from haired, control (nu/+), thymus-bearing mice. A minor theta-bearing cell population present in the spleen of nude mice appears essential to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> interferon production, although cooperating cells are also required. The properties of nude mouse <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> interferon are indistinguishable from those displayed by the interferon induced in thymus-bearing mouse spleen cell cultures. Both interferons are unstable at pH 2 and cannot be neutralized by an antiviral interferon serum; hence, their characteristics correspond to those described for type T interferon. As {{in the case of}} viral interferon, pretreatment of L cells with nude <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> interferon induced specific enhanced phosphorylation of a 67, 000 -molecular-weight protein in vitro when cell extracts were incubated with double-stranded RNA and gamma-[32 P]ATP...|$|E
40|$|With {{the use of}} the cytochemical stain for {{horseradish}} peroxidase of Graham and Karnovsky (1966. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 14 : 291), conjugates of {{horseradish peroxidase}} with ricin, wheat germ agglutinin, and <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> were employed for the morphologic demonstration of d-galactose (ricin), N-acetylglucosamine (wheat germ), and N-acetylgalactosamine (<b>phytohemagglutinin)</b> containing moieties on the surface of unfixed, or paraformaldehyde-fixed rat lymphoid cells. D-Galactose, or d-galactose containing disaccharides inhibited the interaction between ricin peroxidase and lymphoid cell surface; also, N-acetylglucosamine inhibited the wheat germ peroxidase-lymphoid cell interaction, but N-acetylgalactosamine failed to inhibit the reaction between <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> peroxidase and the surface of lymphoid cells...|$|E
40|$|Ricin, a galactose-binding lectin with potent {{cytotoxic}} activity, {{was used}} to select a clone of Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered plant lectin-binding properties. The clone (15 B) is 80 -fold less sensitive to the toxic action of ricin than the parent line. In the absence of ricin, it grows both in monolayer and suspension culture with a normal generation time. Plating efficiency, however, is significantly reduced. Relative to the parent cells, its binding of the Ricinus communis lectins, Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinating <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> Abrus precatorius <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> and soybean <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> is less than 7 %, while binding of lentil <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> wheat-germ agglutinin, and mushroom <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> is 17 %, 40 %, and 109 %, respectively. In contrast, its concanavalin A binding is increased by 70 %. Consistent with these alterations, crude membrane preparations of the 15 B cells were found to contain the same sugars as the parent-cell membranes but in different proportions. The 15 B membranes have 28 % less sialic acid, 38 % less N-acetylglucosamine, 49 % less galactose, {{the same amount of}} N-acetylgalactosamine, and 53 % more mannose than the membranes of the parent cells...|$|E
40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cells, monocytes-macrophages and T-cells were stimulated with human recombinant interferon-gamma, interferon-alpha and <b>phytohemagglutinin.</b> The culture supernatants were analyzed for tryptophan, kynurenine, 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid, anthranilic acid and neopterin by high performance liquid chromatography. Tryptophan was decreased {{and the four}} other compounds were increased in supernatants of {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear cells activated by interferon-gamma (250 U/ml), interferon-alpha (10. 000 U/ml) and <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> (1 microgram/ml). After splitting of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} by adherence, the monocytes and macrophages but not the T-cells degraded tryptophan upon stimulation by interferon-gamma in a dose dependent manner. Supernatants of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> stimulated but not of resting T-cells were found to induce tryptophan degradation by macrophages, the active principle being neutralized by an antiserum for interferon-gamma. Thus <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> acts by activating T-cells to release interferon-gamma which in turn induces macrophages to degrade tryptophan. In all experiments the appearance of neopterin in the culture media was correlated to the observed tryptophan degradation...|$|E

40|$|Trypsin {{treatment}} of human erythrocytes releases a soluble glycopeptide which binds to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> and abolishes the erythroagglutinating and lymphocyte-stimulating properties of this molecule. The glycopeptide has been purified by alkaline borohydride treatment, proteolytic digestion, gel filtration, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The most highly purified glycopeptide has a molecular weight of about 2, 000. The specificity for binding to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> {{resides in the}} oligosaccharide portion of the molecule with the determinant sugar being a galactose residue which is penultimate to a N-acetylneuraminic acid in some chains and uncovered in others. The glycopeptide is about 3, 000 times more potent than either N-acetylgalactosamine or galactose in inhibiting the mitogenic response of lymphocytes induced by <b>phytohemagglutinin...</b>|$|E

Retinoic acid had to be added not later than 2 h after <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> to elicit the potentiation. Retinyl acetate also poten-tiated ornithine decarboxylase induction caused by <b>phytohemagglutinin.</b> Both of these retinoids augmented ornithine decarboxylase induction caused by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. The half-life of ornithine decarboxylase activity estimated after addition of actinomycin D was longer in cells treated with <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> or phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate together with retinoic acid than in cells treated with the mitogen alone. The half-life after addition of cycloheximide was not affected by retionic acid.

40|$|The {{amount of}} HL-A antigens {{present on the}} {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes of a single human donor was increased about 11 -fold after stimulation with <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> and 36 -fold after transformation with Epstein-Barr virus. This increase applied to all four HL-A specificities of these cells. The response to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> was dependent on dose and was first observed at 12 hr of incubation. Measurements {{of the amount of}} surface membranes by geometry, by radioiodinatable surface proteins, and by 5 '-nucleotidase (5 '-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase, EC 3. 1. 3. 5) assay all indicated that the enhanced representation of HL-A antigens after stimulation by <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> or transformation by Epstein-Barr virus must be due to an increase in the density of these antigens on the cell surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{moderate}} protein deficiency on the in vitro response of spleen cells to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> in A/Jax mice were studied. The response of spleen cells from protein-deficient mice to <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> {{was found to}} be enhanced as compared with that of cells from control animals. Since inadequate development or function of suppressor cells in the protein-deficient mice offered a possible explanation for the enhanced lymphoproliferative activity, cocultures of spleen cells from protein-deficient and control animals were tested for their responses to <b>phytohemagglutinin.</b> Suppression of [3 H]thymidine incorporation was detected in coculture of 25 % mitomycin-treated spleen cells from control animals and 75 % spleen cells from protein-deficient mice.

40|$|Several clones of Chinese hamster ovary cells {{resistant}} to the cytotoxicity of the <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> from Phaseolus vulgaris show decreased binding of 125 I-labeled <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> and contain decreased levels of a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine [...] glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (EC 2. 4. 1. 51; UDP- 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose:glycoprotein 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-glucosyltransferase) activity when compared to wild-type cells. The decrease in transferase activity varies from 45 % to 96 %, depending on the exogenous acceptor used in the enzyme assay. No differences between lectin-resistant and wild-type cells were noted for several other glycosyltransferases. The absence of a particular N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in the lectin-resistant cells apparently results in defective glycosylation of lectin-binding glycoproteins on the cell surface. A phytohemagglutinin-resistant clone which shows decreased binding of 125 I-labeled <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> but does not exhibit the enzyme deficiency has also been isolated...|$|E
40|$|Rapidly labeled polyribosomal RNA rich in poly(A) {{has been}} {{isolated}} from cultures of highly purified human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Messenger RNA function for this RNA {{is suggested by}} its ability to direct [3 H]Met-tRNA binding to ribosomes and incorporation of amino acids into protein in a cell-free preparation. <b>Phytohemagglutinin</b> and low concentrations of dibutyryl cAMP (40 nM) increase poly(A) -rich RNA synthesis 40 % within 2 hr, and 100 - 300 % by 12 hr; the percent poly(A) content {{and the size of}} the poly(A) -rich portion remain constant. Higher concentrations of dibutyryl cAMP (1 nM), which prevent morphological transformation of lymphocytes by <b>phytohemagglutinin,</b> inhibit synthesis of poly(A) -rich RNA in phytohemagglutinin-treated lymphocytes without damaging cells. Cortisol (0. 1 mM), which also prevents lymphocyte transformation, inhibits poly(A) -rich RNA synthesis by 80 %.

40|$|Administration of BCG {{by various}} dosage {{schedules}} suppressed adjuvant disease in rats. BCG administration produced an initial increase, {{followed by a}} depression, of the <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> response of purified blood lymphocytes. An increase in absolute and relative numbers of bursa-equivalent (B) -cells followed BCG administration, concurrent with {{a decrease in the}} <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> responsiveness. With adjuvant alone, there was a diminution in <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> response and an increase in number of B-cells; the latter occurred immediately after adjuvant injection and also when the generalized disease appeared. When both BCG and adjvant were present, parallel increases of <b>phytohemagglutinin</b> responsiveness and B-cell numbers resulted. The pattern of tissue localization of radioactively labeled thoracic duct cells from normal or BCG-treated donors given to normal, BCG-treated, adjuvant-injected, and BCG-treated + adjuvant-injected syngeneic recipients indicated significantly greater homing to the thymus and decreased localization to the bone marrow when BCG had been given to either donors or recipients. When labeled thymus cells were used, only the decreased bone marrow localization was noted. These observations suggest that the suppressive effect of BCG may be mediated through modification of the lymphocyte recirculation pattern, possibly resulting from alterations in lymphocyte recognition sites...|$|E
