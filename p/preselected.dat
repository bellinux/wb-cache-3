5|$|Chase {{personally}} selected {{all of the}} show's {{music with}} producer Martin Bruestle and music editor Kathryn Dayak, sometimes also consulting Steven Van Zandt. The music was usually selected once the production and editing of an episode was completed, but on occasion sequences were filmed to match <b>preselected</b> pieces of music.|$|E
5|$|Gillard sought Labor Party {{preselection}} {{twice for}} {{seats in the}} House of Representatives during the early 1990s; however, she {{did not succeed in}} either attempt. In 1995, Gillard took a leave of absence from Slater & Gordon to contest the 1996 federal election. Gillard stood as a Senate candidate, having been <b>preselected</b> for the third position on Labor's ticket, although she was not elected to the position.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce <b>preselected</b> drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E

50|$|By 2010 the UNOS KPD {{program had}} {{completed}} its first swap and the NEPKE and PDN programs folded due to funding issues and increased regulatory requirements imposed on U.S. KPD programs by CMS and UNOS. During this time, the NKR developed the first donor <b>preselect</b> system that allowed donors {{to be accepted}} or declined before a match was offered. This innovation {{was taken from the}} brokerage industry, essentially porting the limit order concept to KPD. The <b>preselect</b> concept eliminated the need to use supercomputers for match runs because the number of valid one-ways was dramatically reduced. The donor <b>preselect</b> concept developed by the NKR was quickly copied by other major KPD programs and changed the nature of the mathematics needed to support KPD by dramatically reducing the number of one-way match possibilities.|$|R
5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into <b>preselected</b> parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1999, Warnock {{announced}} her departure {{at the next}} election for personal reasons, and threw her support behind former Town of Vincent mayor John Hyde, {{a member of the}} Centre faction of the Labor Party who had the support of the Left faction and some Centre members of Parliament. However, the key Centre unions had backed former ministerial adviser Adele Farina for the post, and Labor's affirmative action policy for candidates in winnable seats meant that failing to pick a female candidate would risk sitting male MPs. A week later, the Centre faction openly split, with a breakaway group endorsing Hyde. On 5 November, Farina withdrew from the contest, leaving Hyde to be <b>preselected</b> unopposed ahead of the 2001 election. He maintained the seat for Labor at the election, becoming the first openly gay man to sit in the Western Australian parliament.|$|E

In the end the Greens did not run a candidate. However, {{by the end of}} December, the Australian Women's Party had <b>preselected</b> candidate Pauline Woodbridge from the Northern Queensland Domestic Violence Resource Centre, whilst the North Queensland Party advocating a separate state, the right-wing Australians Party, a nude beach campaigner from Surfers Paradise, two independents seeking the legalisation of marijuana, another advocating the rights of subcontractors against failed construction companies and one desiring a new power station had also announced their candidacy in the race. On 12 January 1996, the ballot was drawn with a record 12 candidates, most of whom were independents.|$|E

25|$|One of Marks's first {{challenges}} was {{to phase}} out double transposition ciphers using keys based on <b>preselected</b> poems.

40|$|International audience— We present our {{exploratory}} {{work for}} situation <b>preselecting</b> in interactive applications, {{assuming that the}} application is an Interactive Adaptive System based on a sequence of contextualized "situations". Each situation confines activities and interactions related to a common context, resources and system actors. When one situation is completed, the system has to determine {{which is the best}} following one. We introduce in this paper a new <b>preselecting</b> method that identifies possible next situations among all available situations. We propose a strategy using Naïve Bayes based on the analysis of the sets of available traces (the past of users). Combining all obtained results, we get a set of situations, called set of alternatives {{that can be used in}} any decision algorithm. We demonstrate our approach on a case study based on Tamagotchi game...|$|R
