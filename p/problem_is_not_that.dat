6000|$|Let me {{take one}} example which may mark out {{the outline of}} the contention. Open the nearest comic paper and let your eye rest lovingly upon a joke about a mother-in-law. Now, the joke, as {{presented}} for the populace, will probably be a simple joke; the old lady will be tall and stout, the hen-pecked husband will be small and cowering. But for all that, a mother-in-law is not a simple idea. She is a very subtle idea. The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> she is big and arrogant; she is frequently little and quite extraordinarily nice. The problem of the mother-in-law is that she is like the twilight: half one thing and half another. Now, this twilight truth, this fine and even tender embarrassment, might be rendered, as it really is, by a poet, only here the poet would have to be some very penetrating and sincere novelist, like George Meredith, or Mr. H. G. Wells, whose [...] "Ann Veronica" [...] I have just been reading with delight. I would trust the fine poets and novelists because they follow the fairy clue given them in Comic Cuts. But suppose the Professor appears, and suppose he says (as he almost certainly will), [...] "A mother-in-law is merely a fellow-citizen. Considerations of sex should not interfere with comradeship. Regard for age should not influence the intellect. A mother-in-law is merely Another Mind. We should free ourselves from these tribal hierarchies and degrees." [...] Now, when the Professor says this (as he always does), I say to him, [...] "Sir, you are coarser than Comic Cuts. You are more vulgar and blundering than the most elephantine music-hall artiste. You are blinder and grosser than the mob. These vulgar knockabouts have, at least, got hold of a social shade and real mental distinction, though they can only express it clumsily. You are so clumsy that you cannot get hold of it at all. If you really cannot see that the bridegroom's mother and the bride have any reason for constraint or diffidence, then you are neither polite nor humane: you have no sympathy in you for the deep and doubtful hearts of human folk." [...] It is better even to put the difficulty as the vulgar put it than to be pertly unconscious of the difficulty altogether.|$|E
50|$|As Thoreau sees it (once he {{gets the}} review behind him and starts letting his own {{philosophy}} take center stage) the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> we have not applied sufficient energy and technology to put our great schemes into action, but {{that we have not}} energetically applied ourselves to improve our schemes.

Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ, for instance, held that one must not use parchments written by, or eat meat {{slaughtered}} by, believers in Kabbalah because these are dedicated to Zeir Anpin (one of the partzufim of the 10 sephirot), a concept apparently distinct from the Unfathomable Almighty Creator.|$|E

Stunned by the sudden rush of oil money, the president Carlos Andrés Perez believed Venezuela’s prosperity was in sight. The best known sayings were “La Gran Venezuela,” Venezuelans “sow the oil” to fight poverty. And to guarantee this, nationalization of Venezuela’s oil industry seemed natural. Since 1976, the oil industry has been fully nationalized, {{with the creation of}} Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Ever since then, the whole country has taken “control” over their oil industry.|$|R

50|$|In {{an article}} for Gamasutra, Nathan Toronto criticizes {{real-time}} strategy games for too often having only one valid means of victory — attrition — comparing them unfavorably to real-time tactics games. Players' awareness {{that the only way}} for them to win or lose is militarily makes them unlikely to respond to gestures of diplomacy. The result is that the winner of a real-time strategy game is too often the best tactician rather than the best strategist. Troy Goodfellow counters this by saying that the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> real-time strategy games are lacking in strategy (he says attrition is a form of strategy), rather it is that they too often have the same strategy: produce faster than you consume. He also states that building and managing armies is the conventional definition of real-time strategy, and that it is unfair to make comparisons with other genres.|$|E
5000|$|In most but not {{all modern}} states the {{constitution}} has supremacy over ordinary statutory law (see Uncodified constitution below); in such states when an official act is unconstitutional, i.e. {{it is not a}} power granted to the government by the constitution, that act is null and void, and the nullification is ab initio, that is, from inception, not from the date of the finding. It was never [...] "law", even though, {{if it had been a}} statute or statutory provision, it might have been adopted according to the procedures for adopting legislation. Sometimes the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> a statute is unconstitutional, but the application of it is, on a particular occasion, and a court may decide that while there are ways it could be applied that are constitutional, that instance was not allowed or legitimate. In such a case, only the application may be ruled unconstitutional. Historically, the remedy for such violations have been petitions for common law writs, such as quo warranto.|$|E
5000|$|For example, when Peter says [...] "I {{promise to}} do the dishes" [...] in an {{appropriate}} context then he thereby does not just say something, and in particular he does not describe what he is doing; rather, in making the utterance he performs the promise; since promising is an illocutionary act, the utterance is thus a performative utterance. If Peter utters the sentence without the intention to keep the promise, or if eventually he does not keep it, then although something is not in order with the utterance, the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> the sentence is false: it is rather [...] "unhappy", or [...] "infelicitous", as Austin also says {{in his discussion of}} so-called felicity conditions. In the absence of any such flaw, on the other hand, the utterance is to be assessed as [...] "happy" [...] or [...] "felicitous", rather than as [...] "true". Austin dropped this distinction in favour of a distinction between explicit performatives ("I promise it will never happen again") and primary or implicit performatives ("It will never happen again," [...] functioning as a promise).|$|E
40|$|Does {{having a}} mental disorder, in general, affect whether someone is morally {{responsible}} for an action? Many {{people seem to}} think so, holding that mental disorders nearly always mitigate responsibility. Against this Naïve view, we argue for a Nuanced account.

Even when all reasonable theories agree about what's relevant to responsibility, the ways mental illness can affect behavior are so varied that a more nuanced approach is needed...|$|R

5000|$|MPs on {{the foreign}} affairs {{committee}} also asked the government to [...] "assess" [...] the supply of weapons by Saudi Arabia to Syrian rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. But the report found no [...] "conclusive proof" [...] {{that it has been}} used for internal repression, and said there would be [...] "significant costs for the UK-Saudi relationship" [...] by ending sales. MPs described Saudi Arabia as [...] "part of the problem as well as part of the solution" [...] in counter-terrorism co-operation. The government was urged to try to [...] "improve the monitoring of the funding flowing from Saudi Arabia to organisations with an extremist message" [...] and to ensure that its [...] "legitimate promotion of religious values does not inadvertently contribute to the furtherance of extremism." [...] It was also asked to give an [...] "assessment of the situation and the actions it is taking to monitor Syrian rebel groups that are receiving funding and arms from Saudi Arabia, and its efforts to engage with the Saudi authorities regarding any concerns about them." [...] The foreign affairs committee report noted: [...] "Democratic governments such as the UK face a challenge in trying to reconcile their liberal constituencies at home with the need to maintain relationships with undemocratic and conservative regimes that are important to their interests on a regional and global level.' Another section asserted: 'We understand that to encourage a government such as that of Saudi Arabia towards reform, a combination of private and public pressure is required. By their very nature, private conversations are difficult to explain publicly. However, we are particularly concerned that some witnesses not only disagreed with UK policy but appeared to disbelieve the government's account of its private conversations with Saudi Arabia on reform. The government appears to have a credibility problem and must do more to explain its policies and consider where it can point to specific progress {{as a result of its}} human rights work." [...] Richard Ottaway, the foreign affairs committee chairman, said: [...] "The government is correct to focus on what is constructive and achievable by working with the leadership in both states, but it cannot simply ignore the charges of hypocrisy and criticism levelled against the UK. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office must find new ways to explain the UK's approach, to highlight its successes, and to present a more coherent strategy of engagement with these important allies." [...] A spokesperson for The Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) said:"Unfortunately it looks as though arms company and establishment interests reached into the heart of this inquiry. The foreign affairs committee is giving cover to the UK government as it continues the policy of pandering to despicable regimes in its desire to drum up sales for firm BAE Systems.' Ann Feltham from CAAT added [...] "The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> the UK government is failing to explain its approach to Saudi Arabia to the UK public; it is the approach itself that is the problem. The government needs to put human rights at the heart of its policy towards Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, not the interests of the arms companies. Otherwise it is a betrayal of those protesters who seek human rights and democratic freedoms.|$|E
