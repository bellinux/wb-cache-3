40|$|Adaptive cable-driven {{parallel}} robots are {{a special}} subclass of cable-driven systems {{in which the}} locations of the <b>pulley</b> <b>blocks</b> are modified {{as a function of the}} end-effector pose to obtain optimal values of given performance indices within a target workspace. Due to their augmented kinematic redundancy, such systems enable larger workspace volume and higher performance compared to traditional designs featuring the same number of cables. Previous studies have introduced a systematic method to optimize design and trajectory planning of the moving pulley-blocks for a given performance index. In this paper, we study the motions of the <b>pulley</b> <b>blocks</b> that optimize two performance indices simultaneously: stiffness and dexterity. Specifically, we present a method to determine the <b>pulley</b> <b>blocks</b> motions that guarantee ideal dexterity with the best feasible elastic stiffness, as well as those that guarantee isotropic elastic stiffness with the best feasible dexterity. We demonstrate the proposed approach on some practical cases of planar adaptive cable-driven parallel robots...|$|R
50|$|The Hampton Loade Ferry is a {{reaction}} ferry, propelled {{by the river}} current. An overhead cable is suspended across the river, and the ferry is tethered by a second cable, to a <b>pulley</b> <b>block</b> that runs on the suspended cable. To operate the ferry it is angled into the current, causing the current to move it across the river.|$|E
50|$|The {{foresail}} {{was set on}} {{the port}} side of the topan and the mainsail on the starboard side of the agung. A relatively small jib was set on the bowsprit. All bedars, even those up to or more than 80 feet were steered by a tiller with a <b>pulley</b> <b>block</b> system easing the strain on a conventional rudder hinged on the stern post. This tiller was operated from within the round cabin (cup) on the dandan platform over the stern. The hold stored cargo.|$|E

The becket hitch, in contrast, fixes a rope to a closed eye or hook. [...] In this instance, a becket means the eye or hook of a <b>pulley</b> <b>block,</b> an eye {{in the end of}} a rope, or a rope handle on a sailors sea chest.|$|E
50|$|In 1798, {{during a}} dinner conversation, Brunel learnt of the {{difficulties}} that the Royal Navy had in obtaining the 100,000 <b>pulley</b> <b>blocks</b> that it required each year to fit out its ships. Each of these was being made by hand. Brunel quickly produced an outline design of a machine that would automate the production of <b>pulley</b> <b>blocks.</b> He decided to sail to England and put his invention before the Admiralty. He sailed for England on 7 February 1799 with a letter of introduction to the Navy Minister, and on 7 March his ship, Halifax landed at Falmouth.|$|R

50|$|During construction, on 26 January 1833, two {{workers were}} killed when a 70-foot crane {{constructed}} to install the roof trusses broke and the <b>pulley</b> <b>block</b> failed. John Heap died instantly and Win. Badger died {{a few days later}} from his injuries. They were buried in St Philip's churchyard and a memorial, consisting of a pillar base made by one of the workmen for the Town Hall, was dedicated to them. Architect Charles Edge was commissioned in 1835 to repair weaknesses to the design of the building. He was also commissioned for the extension of the building in 1837 and again in 1850.|$|E
50|$|Massey’s was not {{the only}} {{sounding}} machine adopted during the nineteenth century. The Royal Navy also purchased a number of Peter Burt’s buoy and nipper device. This machine was quite different from Massey’s. It consisted of an inflatable canvas bag (the buoy) and a spring-loaded wooden <b>pulley</b> <b>block</b> (the nipper). Again, the device was designed to operate alongside a lead and line. In this case, the buoy would be pulled behind the ship and the line threaded through the pulley. The lead could then be released. The buoy ensured that the lead fell perpendicular to the sea floor even when the ship was moving. The spring-loaded pulley would then catch the rope when the lead hit the sea bed, ensuring an accurate reading of the depth.|$|E
50|$|A jigger {{works like}} a <b>pulley</b> <b>block,</b> but in reverse. Rather than turning an easy pull on a rope into a {{powerful}} lift, the jigger uses the powerful force of a hydraulic ram, but limited in how far it can travel, to pull a long length of chain. The chain is looped several times lengthwise around the ram cylinder, running {{over a number of}} pulleys at each end. When the cylinder moves, the pull {{on the end of the}} chain is multiplied by the number of loops. The force of the jigger's pull is reduced similarly, according to how many times the chain was looped. As the cylinder had adequate power to begin with, and could simply be made larger in diameter when needed, this was not a significant limit on the jigger's force.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mathematical}} model of loaded <b>block</b> <b>pulley</b> trolley movement was developed based on Lagrange equation {{of the second}} genus. The differential equations of loaded trolley motion were given along with the relations for viscoelastic <b>block</b> <b>pulley</b> characteristics based on empirical observations. It was shown that the modeling <b>block</b> <b>pulley</b> dynamics could be substantially simplified by means of universal program complexes when considering the mass variation and the rope rigidity of <b>block</b> <b>pulley</b> negligible by changing its length. It was demonstrated that the loaded <b>block</b> <b>pulley</b> model could be geared as a subsystem for the computer dynamic model of lifting crane, when executing the axial force of upper <b>block</b> <b>pulley,</b> the movement of exit rope section and the rope tension force at this section by means of subsystem output parameters.

50|$|At {{the top of}} {{the plane}} the incline chain/rope passed {{underground}} and into a pit where it was wound one and a half turns around a horizontal drum 14 ft in diameter. The groove in the drum for the chain/rope was lined with wooden blocks with the grain facing outwards to increase the friction. Above this groove there was an integral brake wheel about 5 in wide. A wrought iron (or steel) band brake encircled this, which almost made a 360° arc of contact with the brake wheel, and this was lined with wooden blocks with the grain facing inwards to increase the friction. The band brake was anchored to the back wall of the pit and at the front, one end was cranked upwards and the other end was cranked downwards. The upward crank was attached above the fulcrum of the brake lever and the downward crank was attached below the fulcrum. The brake lever was about 15 ft long and it extended into the hut at {{the top of the}} tower. In spite of the large mechanical advantage provided by the brake lever, the brakeman was unable to apply the brake unaided. To further increase the mechanical advantage, a <b>pulley</b> <b>block</b> was fitted to the lever and the brakeman used this to apply the brake.|$|E
