5|$|On September 9, 2014, it was {{announced}} that a follow-up television series had been given a pilot commitment at Fox. Max Borenstein wrote the script and served as executive producer alongside Spielberg, Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank. The series was envisioned to be set 10 years after the film, and focused on a male <b>precog</b> who teams up with a female detective to find a purpose to his gift. On February 13, 2015, Daniel London and Li Jun Li joined the cast. On February 24, 2015, Laura Regan was cast as Agatha Lively, replacing Samantha Morton, who was said to have been offered to reprise the role. In March 2015, Stark Sands and Meagan Good landed the lead roles with Sands playing the role of Dash, one of the male precogs, and Good playing Lara Vega, a detective haunted by her past, who works with Dash to help him find a purpose for his gift, Li Jun Li plays Akeela, a CSI technician, Daniel London reprised his role as Wally the Caretaker from the original film and Wilmer Valderrama was cast as a police detective. The show was picked up to series by Fox on May 9, 2015, and made its broadcast debut on September 21, 2015. However, the show was cancelled on May 13, 2016 by Fox.|$|E

500|$|The {{plot of the}} 2002 {{science fiction}} neo-noir film Minority Report {{concerns}} itself {{with a number of}} themes. The film's plot centers around a trio of psychics called [...] "precogs", who see future images called [...] "previsions" [...] of crimes yet to be committed. These images are processed by [...] "Precrime", a specialized police department, which apprehends the criminals based on the precogs' [...] The cast includes Tom Cruise as Precrime officer John Anderton, Colin Farrell as Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer, Samantha Morton as the senior <b>precog</b> Agatha, and Max von Sydow as Anderton's superior Lamar Burgess. The film is a combination of whodunit, thriller, and science fiction.|$|E

5000|$|In some of Philip K. Dick's stories, mutant humans called <b>precogs</b> can {{foresee the}} future (ranging from days to years). In the story called The Golden Man, an {{exceptional}} mutant can {{predict the future}} to an indefinite range (presumably up to his death), and thus becomes completely non-human, an animal that follows the predicted paths automatically. <b>Precogs</b> also play {{an essential role in}} another of Dick's stories, The Minority Report, which was turned into a film by Steven Spielberg in 2002.|$|R
500|$|Buckland {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} the ending, but blamed Frank. He felt {{that given the}} water theme, and closely tied together tragic parent-child theme, Anderton should have ended the film by taking Agatha in his care if Spielberg wanted a happy ending. Especially since [...] "Anderton kidnaps Agatha from the <b>precog</b> pool just as his son was kidnapped from a swimming pool" [...] and because Anderton could act as a [...] "substitute parent for Agatha, and Agatha...a substitute child for Anderton." [...] This opportunity is missed however, when the precogs are sent to the remote island, and Anderton reunites with his wife; an ending which Buckland finds more [...] "forced" [...] than the [...] "more authentic" [...] path he feels he noticed.|$|E
500|$|Minority Report is a 2002 American neo-noir {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg and {{loosely based on}} the short story {{of the same name}} by Philip K. Dick. It is set primarily in Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia in the year 2054, where [...] "PreCrime", a specialized police department, apprehends criminals based on [...] provided by three psychics called [...] "precogs". The cast includes Tom Cruise as Chief of PreCrime John Anderton, Colin Farrell as Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer, Samantha Morton as the senior <b>precog</b> Agatha, and Max von Sydow as Anderton's superior Lamar Burgess. The film combines elements of tech noir, whodunit, thriller and science fiction genres, as well as a traditional chase film, as the main protagonist is accused of a crime he has not committed and becomes a fugitive. Spielberg has characterized the story as [...] "fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot". The film's central theme is the question of free will versus determinism. It examines whether free will can exist if the future is set and known in advance. Other themes include the role of preventive government in protecting its citizenry, the role of media in a future state where technological advancements make its presence nearly boundless, the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor, and Spielberg's repeated theme of broken families.|$|E
500|$|Buckland {{describes}} the film's 14 minute opening sequence as the [...] "most abstract and complex of any Spielberg film." [...] The first scene is a distorted <b>precog</b> {{vision of a}} murder, presented out of context. The speed {{of the film is}} sped up, slowed, and even reversed, and the movie [...] "jumps about in time and space" [...] by intercutting the images in no discernible order. When it ends, it becomes clear that the scene was presented through Agatha's eyes, and that this is how previsions appear to her. Fellow scholar Nigel Morris called this scene a [...] "trailer", because it foreshadows the plot and establishes the type of [...] "tone, generic expectations, and enigmas" [...] that will be used in the film. The visions of the pre-cogs are presented in a fragmented series of clips using a [...] "squishy lens" [...] device, which distorts the images, blurring their edges and creating ripples across them. They were created by a two-man production team, hired by Spielberg, who chose the [...] "layered, dreamlike imagery" [...] based on some comments from cognitive psychologists the pair consulted. In the opening's next scene, Anderton is [...] "scrubbing the images", by standing like a composer (as Spielberg terms it), and manipulating them, while Jad assists him. Next the family involved in the murder in Agatha's vision is shown interacting, which establishes that the opening scene was a prevision. The picture then cuts back to Anderton and the precogs' images, before alternating between the three. The opening is self-contained, and according to Buckland acts merely as a setup for numerous elements of the story. It lasts 14 minutes, includes 171 shots, and has an average shot length of five seconds as opposed to the 6.5 second average for the entire film. The opening's five-second average is attained despite [...] "very fast cutting" [...] in the beginning and ending, because the middle has longer takes, which reach 20 seconds in some instances. Spielberg also continues his tradition of [...] "heavily diffused backlighting" [...] for much in the interior shots.|$|E
5000|$|Each of {{the three}} <b>precogs</b> generates its own report or prediction. The reports of all the <b>precogs</b> are {{analyzed}} by a computer and, if these reports differ from one another, the computer identifies the two reports with the greatest overlap and produces a [...] "majority report", taking this as the accurate prediction of the future. But the existence of majority reports implies {{the existence of a}} [...] "minority report". In the story, Precrime Police Commissioner John A. Anderton believes that the prediction that he will commit a murder has been generated as a majority report. He sets out to find the minority report, which would give him an alternate future.|$|R
5000|$|Order of Witnesses: A {{group of}} telepaths and <b>precogs</b> {{gathered}} in the Savage Land that awaited the arrival of Rachel Summers. Ultimately massacred by Diamanda Nero. Diogenes Chang, {{a member of the}} Order, helped Rachel found Clan Askani.|$|R
5|$|After Burgess's death, the PreCrime {{system is}} shut down. All the prisoners are unconditionally pardoned and released, {{although}} they are kept under occasional surveillance. Anderton and Lara are soon {{to have a new}} child together. The <b>Precogs</b> are sent to an undisclosed location to live their lives in peace.|$|R
500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The <b>precog</b> Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the biggest one of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Morton {{took on a}} part in Steven Spielberg {{science fiction}} thriller Minority Report, {{opposite}} Tom Cruise. In the film, set in a future where a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes, Morton played Agatha, a senior <b>precog.</b> Although critics felt she was [...] "slightly typecast" [...] in her role of [...] "feral, near-mute victim", Minority Report was a critical success and grossed US$358 million, emerging as Morton's highest-grossing film until Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016). She won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Empire Award for Best British Actress. Morton followed with the title role in the drama Morvern Callar, where she [...] played a grieving young woman from Scotland who decides to escape to Spain after the suicide of her boyfriend. The film was given an UK limited theatrical release in November 2002, to largely favorable reviews. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers stated that Morton [...] "fills this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling". She earned the Best Actress Award at the 5th British Independent Film Awards and the 7th Toronto Film Critics Association Awards.|$|E

500|$|Since the {{disappearance}} of his son Sean, PreCrime Captain John Anderton has both separated from his wife Lara and become a drug addict. While United States Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer is auditing the program, the <b>Precogs</b> generate a new prediction, saying Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours. Anderton does not know Crow, but flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt. Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman, the creator of PreCrime technology. She reveals that sometimes, one of the <b>Precogs,</b> usually Agatha, has a different vision than the other two, a [...] "minority report" [...] of a possible alternate future; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system's credibility. Anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence.|$|R
5000|$|Blindfold's precognitive {{abilities}} are neutralized {{while in the}} presence of Destiny, another precognitive (and vice versa). Destiny explains that this is because two <b>precogs</b> in close presence to one another [...] "are like two magnets pressed together positive pole to positive pole" [...] and will negatively affect one another's precognitive abilities and powers.|$|R
500|$|Kowalski {{feels the}} {{isolation}} of the <b>precogs</b> ensures that they see their visions merely as facts, and removes them from having to justify them. The precogs' ignorance of the results of their visions prevents them from knowing the effectiveness of the program. He feels the PreCrime officers are thus more qualified to evaluate their efficacy [...] "than the <b>precogs</b> themselves." [...] In the December 2003 edition of the academic journal Film Criticism, scholar Mark Garrett Cooper moved past that point by asserting that not only have the <b>precogs</b> [...] "yet to fully understand" [...] their visions, but that the process by which the images are interpreted makes it so that no one individual could understand them without the use of the apparatus. The machinery is so effective and precise according to Cooper however, that the [...] "omnipresent system effectively makes capture more certain than the crime." [...] When the system targets Cruise, instead of fleeing, he remains in the vicinity in the belief that the system will, in its inexorable logic, correct itself. The apparatus is considered so infallible according to Cooper that Cruise knows once he is cleared by it, his life can immediately return to normal. In this respect, Cooper feels that [...] "far from indicting a security state, the film legitimates one." [...] Gareth Higgins argues that [...] "he government is playing God, using an all-seeing eye to prevent murder." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Sands {{was cast}} in the NBC pilot Salvation. This was not picked up to series. Sands {{was cast in}} FOX's pilot, Minority Report, as Dash, a <b>precog.</b> The series premiered on September 21, 2015.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the short}} story, Anderton seeks the precogs {{to hear their}} [...] "minority reports". In the movie, Anderton kidnaps a <b>precog</b> in order to {{discover}} his own [...] "minority report" [...] and extract the information for a mysterious crime.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>precog</b> {{with heavy}} burden {{of seeing the}} murders of others who seeks to stop the {{wrongful}} deaths. During his precognitive visions Dash sees the fractions of the murders, the horror, as described by Wally with the victim and the murder.|$|E
5000|$|Philosophy {{professor}} Michael Huemer says [...] "that {{the only}} way the otherwise predetermined future seen by the <b>precogs</b> can be averted, we are led to believe, is by the influence of the <b>precogs</b> themselves." [...] He argues that their [...] "knowledge of their would-be future" [...] enables them to make changes to prevent its occurrence. This means that Howard Marks, the arrested potential killer from the film's opening scene, is destined to his fate and no action he could undertake would change it. Individuals with minority reports however, have a chance to change their futures according to Huemer, and since there was no minority report (i.e.; no possible alternative fate) for Anderton, he could only change his future by having access to the <b>precogs</b> visions. Huemer compares the humans situation to that of a robot; since a robot controls itself, but has a set number of programmed actions, its fate falls within those actions. It lacks free will {{in the sense that it}} cannot choose any action outside of its programming, even if one may exist. He also considers a decaying atom which has a 50% chance of survival within the next hour, since the atom has no actions which it can undertake to change those odds, its fate is pure chance. Thus he believes a person needs a set of options, the knowledge of those options, and the ability to choose between them to have free will.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of three apparent minority reports suggests {{the possibility of}} three future time paths, all existing simultaneously, any of which an individual could choose to follow or be sent along following an enticement (as in Anderton's being told {{he was going to}} murder an unknown man). In this way, the time-paths overlap, and the future of one is able to affect the past of another. It is in this way that the story weaves a complicated web of crossing time paths and makes a linear journey for Anderton harder to identify. It is the theory of multiple futures which allows the <b>precogs</b> of Precrime to be of benefit, because if only one time-path existed, the predictions of the <b>precogs</b> would be worthless, since no possibility would exist of altering the future. Precrime is based on the notion that once one unpleasant future pathway is identified, an alternative, better one can be created with the arrest of the intended perpetrator.|$|R
5|$|Witwer, {{studying}} Crow's death, suspects Anderton {{is being}} framed. He examines the footage of Lively's murder and finds {{there were two}} attempts on her life, the first having been stopped by PreCrime but the second, occurring minutes later, having succeeded. Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess, but Burgess responds by killing Witwer using Anderton's gun. With the <b>Precogs</b> still offline, the murder is not detected.|$|R
50|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly how old Al is. Early {{in the first}} ongoing Deadpool series in the 1990s, Al refers to herself as a sexagenarian but she later claims to {{remember}} Flapper-dresses (popular in the 1920s) and was later referred to by Montgomery Burns, a <b>precog</b> at Landau, Luckman & Lake, as a septuagenarian.|$|E
5000|$|Older than Arthur and Dash {{as well as}} <b>precog,</b> Agatha acts {{an older}} sister, {{protector}} and sounding board for the brothers. Agatha's visions allows her to [...] "become the person" [...] whose murder she is predicting. Experiencing an empathic bond with the person in her visions, Agatha's visions are the most traumatizing as she experiences the death itself.|$|E
5000|$|Precogs are mutants, {{identified}} talents further {{developed in}} a government-operated training school [...] - [...] for example, one <b>precog</b> was initially diagnosed as [...] "a hydrocephalic idiot" [...] but the <b>precog</b> talent was found under layers of damaged brain tissue. The precogs are kept in rigid position by metal bands, clamps and wiring, strapping them into special high-backed chairs. Their physical needs are taken care of automatically and Anderton claims {{that they have no}} spiritual needs. Their physical appearance is distorted from an ordinary human, with enlarged heads and wasted bodies. Precogs are [...] "deformed" [...] and [...] "retarded" [...] as [...] "the talent absorbs everything"; [...] "the esp-lobe shrivels the balance of the frontal area". They do not understand their predictions; only through technological and mechanical aid can their nonsense be unravelled. The data produced does not always pertain to crime or murder, but this information is then passed on to other agencies.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{said that}} the arrest of criminals before {{they have a chance}} to commit their crimes in the movie had some {{real-world}} background in post-9/11 America, saying that [...] "e’re giving up some of our freedom so that the government can protect us." [...] The future world in Minority Report of retinal scans, robotic human inspectors, and intrusive, individualized, public advertising arrived in American theaters as the country was debating how much governmental intrusion into personal matters was necessary to ensure safety of its citizens. Spielberg said he would be against a PreCrime system if it were ever possible, as he believes that if it did exist, those in control of it would undoubtedly abuse its powers. Kowalski questions what the benevolent <b>precogs</b> in the film could become in the hands of those who trained their skills for political intrigue. Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl asserts that in a political context, PreCrime may be seen [...] "a metaphor for racial profiling, and one could view the liberation of the <b>precogs</b> as the end of a form of slavery." ...|$|R
5000|$|Three mutants, {{known as}} [...] "precogs", have precognitive {{abilities}} {{by which they}} can see up to two weeks into the future. The <b>precogs</b> are strapped into machines, nonsensically babbling as a computer listens and converts this gibberish into predictions of the future. This information is then transcribed onto conventional punch cards which are ejected into various coded slots: when cards are produced, they appear simultaneously at Precrime and the army headquarters, {{in order to prevent}} systemic corruption.|$|R
5000|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the <b>precogs</b> visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the <b>precogs</b> only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|R

50|$|The {{story is}} set on a separatist Earth colony where the society is {{becoming}} dominated by mutants with psionic abilities.

5|$|Anderton {{goes to a}} {{black market}} doctor for a risky eye {{transplant}} {{so as to avoid}} the citywide optical recognition system. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the system, as the <b>Precogs</b> operate as a group mind. Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow, but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively, a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049.|$|R
5000|$|Cooper {{discusses}} how {{he feels}} Minority Report emphasizes the future importance over the control of imagery. According to him, the images captured from the <b>precogs</b> visions in the film bestow power on those who control their processing. He says the film warns viewers that those who control images must be carefully overseen so as to prevent the abuse of power, and that the film presents [...] "governance as a problem of image arrangement." [...] The film also presents a future world where government probes use advanced media technology to monitor its citizenry. Cooper says the quandary arises when the film intimates that there were will be no way to escape the media industry's omnipotence in the future, {{while at the same}} time defending [...] "the need for image manipulating institutions." [...] He feels that this logically raises another issue in that the same concern could be leveled towards image-makers such as DreamWorks, and he says the [...] "film's virtue lies in provoking this question." [...] He notes that the film's tranquil ending concludes with the Andertons looking out into a peaceful exterior with only rain visible, and the <b>precogs</b> reading in their isolated, idyllic farm, and both families apparently free of electronic surveillance.|$|R
50|$|John A. Anderton is {{the protagonist}} of The Minority Report. At first, he is highly insecure, {{suspicious}} of those closest to him - his wife, his assistant Witwer. He has complete faith in the Precrime system and its authority over individuals and their freedom of choice. The poor living condition of the <b>precogs</b> and the imprisonment of would-be criminals are necessary consequences {{for the greater good}} of a safe society. When his own autonomy comes under attack, Anderton retains this faith and convinces himself that the system has somehow been corrupted.|$|R
