40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the performance of the}} separating system of a self–propelled <b>peanut</b> <b>harvester</b> by analyzing the relationship between a shaking screen and rotational speeds of winnowing. The shaking screen was manufactured to have rotational speeds of 370, 470, 570 rpm and winnowing was manufactured to have rotational speeds of 1, 500, 1, 760, 2, 020 rpm by adjusting the pitch circle diameter of each pulley. The sample was prepared based on the yields of an actual self–propelled <b>peanut</b> <b>harvester</b> and analyzed with Statistical Analysis Software after measuring the weight of peanuts and stems. The stem separation ratio was high as 95. 3 % when rotational speeds were 570 rpm (shaking screen) and 2, 020 rpm (winnowing). The peanut loss ratio was low as 0 % when rotational speeds were 370 rpm (shaking screen) and 1, 500 rpm (winnowing). The results indicated that the stem separation ratio was improved with high rotational speeds of shaking screen and winnowing; the peanut loss ratio was reduced with low rotational speeds of shaking screen and winnowing. However, the rotational speed of winnowing did not influence on the peanut loss ratio; as a result, separation performance was improved with low rotational speed of shaking screen and high rotational speed of winnowing. Low rotational speed of shaking screen, however, may cause congestion during process, thus follow–up studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} a DEM (Discrete Element Method) model through {{test results}} and analysis {{results for the}} simulation of the conveying performance of the separating system in a <b>peanut</b> <b>harvester.</b> With the validated DEM model, analysis under three conditions of slope angle of separating system compare with horizon (– 7 °, 0 °, and 7 °) was also conducted to examine the conveying performance. From the comparison between the test results and simulation results, the conveying performances of 0 ° and 7 ° were observed {{to be the same}} at the initial period and completion period; however, the gradient of 0 ° and 7 ° from the simulation were higher than the ones from the test by 8. 9 % (0 °) and 9. 2 % (7 °). The higher gradient means that the transport performance is better. The gradient of – 7 ° from the simulation was higher than the one from the test by 3. 6 %, and the amount of the peanuts from the simulation was larger than the test by 500 g at the initial period of 5 seconds. The higher gradient of the simulation was due to the losses at the collecting part as 3. 4 % (0 °), 3. 1 % (7 °), and 2. 0 % (– 7 °). The error in the amount of the peanuts (500 g) at the initial period of 5 seconds with – 7 ° was due to the initial input difference between the test and simulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Picking peanuts {{is the key}} {{operational}} link and {{the core}} technology of <b>peanut</b> combine <b>harvester.</b> On the basis the theoretical analysis of picking mechanism and structural parameters of the half-feed picking roller, and combined with the picking performance experimental, the structural parameters of the picking blades and blades quantity of picking roller were studied. The results show that: when the straight-shaped blade is picking, the picking force is strong, the broken branch and seedling phenomenon is serious, peanut broken rate and peanut with handle rate are higher; the arc-shaped blade reduced peanut damage, and effectively reduced {{the rate of the}} peanut with handle. The picking blade radian has a large impact to the peanut broken and loss rate. When the blade radian is 70 ° and the blade radius is 35 mm, total loss rate is the lowest on the picking segment of the blade. The blade quantity has significant influence to the peanut broken and loss rate. The peanut broken rate of the 8 blades is 2 to 3 times of the 4 and 6 blades; the picking net rate of the 4 blades is much lower than 6 and 8 blades. The self-design the picking roller is 6 arc-shaped blades, the blade radius is 35 mm, and the blade radian is 70 °. The study provides the design basis for the research and development of the half-feed peanut picking device...|$|R
