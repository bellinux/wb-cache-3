40|$|Summary. Nowadays, a {{transportation}} industry creates {{a lot of}} metal scrap because production and use of cars are on the increase worldwide. This {{is based on the}} fact that increase in the production of cars increases usage of aluminium alloys in transportationapplications. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the production of components from <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and increase their replacement with secondary—recycled—aluminium alloys because the production of recycled aluminium alloys is less expensiveand less energy-intensive than the creation of new aluminium alloy through the electrolysis. In addition, the recycled aluminium alloys have comparable microstructural parameters and properties as the same primary aluminium alloys...|$|E

The reason for that is the creation of an additional net surplus of the added value commenced from the production of wrought alloys. However, the replacing even a minor part of <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> in wrought <b>alloys</b> with recycled counterpart originated from lower grades of scrap (typically scrap contaminated with various non-metallic impurities) without influencing {{at the same time the}} quality of the alloy is very demanding from metallurgical point of view. Developing a more complete understanding of the compositional tolerances in wrought <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is still under investigation of many academicals and industrial projects.

40|$|Recycling play a {{key role}} on saving of natural {{resources}} and on reducing pollution. The recycling of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is also cost-effective, since it reduce the material cost and creates a considerable energy-saving. The use of recycled Al alloys (usually called secondary) has improved in recent years also because of their comparable mechanical properties with <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> During the production of secondary <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> the scrap are mixed regardless of their specific chemical composition, and then master alloys or pure elements are added to the molten metal. Furthermore, certain impurity elements are either difficult or expensive to remove, and their role in mechanical properties can be important. Due to the presence of these additional trace elements, a number of complex intermetallic phases can therefore form in multi-component Al-Si alloys. Mechanical and physical properties of alloys and castings are strongly related to sizes, morphologies and distribution of these intermetallic phases, which are in turn a function of alloy composition and cooling rate. The Al–Si based alloys are transversally used in different foundry processes. Among all the technologies, high-pressure die-casting (HPDC) represents the most common process to produce automotive components by secondary Al–Si alloys because it allows one to increase the production by lowering the cycle time and to obtain economically components with complex geometries and high quality surface. The effects of trace elements and intermetallics phases on features of aluminium castings are still not fully understood, especially when components are made by means of HPDC process. The motivation of the research presented in this doctoral thesis was, therefore, to fill this gap in knowledge. The study has aimed at understanding the influence of various trace elements on the microstructure and mechanical properties of secondary die-cast <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> and, in particular, on secondary AlSi 9 Cu 3 (Fe) die-cast alloys. A literature review and a sufficient background of previously reported results on the influence of trace elements on the features of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> as well as the formation of intermetallic phases were carried out. It was found that the mechanical and microstructural analysis generally referred to primary cast Al alloys with low concentration of trace elements outside of those studied. Furthermore the samples were usually produced on gravity die-cast, while some intermetallics phases were frequently observed in high-pressure die-casting, where higher cooling rates and different feeding conditions exist. Special attention has been given to: The effects of Bismuth addition on secondary die-cast aluminium alloys: Bismuth substitute the lead in free-cutting wrought Al alloys, and this is leading to a steady increase of Bi content in secondary Al alloys due to the recycling process. The nucleation temperature of primary Fe-rich intermetallic compounds, as function of Fe, Mn and Cr content and cooling rate: Fe-rich phases have a high specific gravity and tend to segregate to the bottom of aluminium melts and holding furnaces. These phases form primary solid particles, generally called sludge, thus reduce the effective capacity of the furnace. The influence of Fe, Mn and Cr addition, separately or in combination, on the microstructural and mechanical characteristics of secondary die-cast aluminium alloys: sludge crystals are hard and brittle compact inclusions which can compromise the machining operations, with a considerable effects on the cutting tool life, and even more degrade the mechanical and physical properties of the component. As recycling of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> becomes more common, sludge will be a problem of increasing importance due to the concentration of Fe, Mn and Cr in the scrap cycle...|$|R
40|$|Starting from {{existing}} challenges and limitations in light metal recycling (in particular <b>aluminium</b> and magnesium <b>alloys),</b> this PhD thesis aims {{to address these}} and explore new opportunities by sustainable metal management and solid-state recycling (SSR) methods. This PhD also quantifies the potential environmental benefits of the explored strategies and SSR techniques by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). More specifically: During pyro-metallurgical recycling of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> the refining/melt purification options of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> restricted by thermodynamic barriers, are very limited compared to other base metals such as steels. As the removal from the melt of most elements is problematic, {{it is crucial to}} control their concentration in the scrap streams prior to remelting. Thus, scrap sorting is important to avoid additional (eventually impossible) refining, quality degradation (down-cycling), and dilution of the residual elements with <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> addition. It is therefore described that establishing of well-optimised, harmonised recycling loops is of prime importance from an environmental perspective. Based on these arguments, Chapter 2 addresses this issue by developing a decision support model that aids in the direction of environmental conscious metal clustering. It aims: i) to express and quantify in a LCA framework, dilution and quality losses that occur during open loop recycling, and ii) to determine the optimal material input for the recycling process based on the input/output metal composition. By compositionally closing the recycling loops, it is feasible to minimise primary resource addition (<b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> and <b>alloying</b> elements) by maximising the scrap utilisation. A multi-objective optimisation approach (goal programming) is selected as the most appropriate method to prioritise the optimisation goals. After performing the environmental modelling of the secondary aluminium production as a reference route, Chapter 3 moves on to ‘meltless’ or ‘solid state recycling’ techniques for high grade aluminium production scrap. This approach is studied to achieve a significant material and energy savings by omitting/bypassing the conventional recycling step. Annually more than 40 % of liquid aluminium is scrapped during the initial production-fabrication-manufacturing steps. Especially for fine form scrap from material removal processes, their very high surface-to-mass ratio results in significant unrecoverable oxidation losses during remelting. In this context, this work investigates the applicability of Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) as an alternative SSR technique for <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> chips (Chapter 3). This allows the direct fabrication of bulk, near-net shape and semi-finished products directly from machining chips. The improved consolidation achieved via SPS is associated with the combined action of plastic deformation and the electric field during SPS processing. Microstructural investigations as well as the mechanical behaviour of the SPS blanks confirm successful solid state chips welding. Furthermore, this work also investigates applications of SPS in scrap consolidation and binding. Chapter 4 examines the use of atomised aluminium powder as a binding material/matrix for the machining chips. Chapter 5 describes the consolidation via SPS of larger scrap types (sheet metal scrap). After developing a reliable SPS route for SSR of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> scrap, Chapter 6 analyses the environmental performance of the SPS route along with major SSR routes for <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> (recycling via hot extrusion and via screw extrusion). For this reason a LCA study was conducted where the examined SSR routes are compared with their corresponding remelting routes as reference. Mg alloys confront similar challenges in recycling as <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Taking also into account the wide range of magnesium applications and their higher scrap value compared to aluminium scraps; Chapter 7 focuses on broadening the material palette of SSR via SPS into Mg alloys. In this respect, this work studies the consolidation of machining chips for two Mg systems (i. e., pure Mg and AZ 31 Mg alloy). This includes the microstructural evolution in different metal recycling steps (initial ingot, chips, SPSed samples) as well as the mechanical behaviour of the recycled samples versus their parent material. Finally, the conclusions, the contributions to {{the state of the art}} as well as proposed future research topics are discussed in Chapter 8. nrpages: 180 status: publishe...|$|R

In this study, A 319 cooling slope rheocasting billets were produced in order to obtain near spherical morphology of <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> phase. The change in the α-Al morphology upon the cooling slope casting was remarkable and the dendritic microstructure was almost replaced by α-Al globules and rosettes.
