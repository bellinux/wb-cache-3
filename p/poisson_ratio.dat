50|$|The Poisson's {{ratio of}} a stable, isotropic, linear elastic {{material}} will {{be greater than}} −1.0 or less than 0.5 because of the requirement for Young's modulus, the shear modulus and bulk modulus to have positive values. Most materials have Poisson's ratio values ranging between 0.0 and 0.5. A perfectly incompressible material deformed elastically at small strains would have a Poisson's ratio of exactly 0.5. Most steels and rigid polymers when used within their design limits (before yield) exhibit values of about 0.3, increasing to 0.5 for post-yield deformation which occurs largely at constant volume.

The larger the shear modulus, the greater the ability for a material to resist sharing forces. Therefore, the shear modulus is a measure of rigidity. Shear modulus is related to bulk modulus as 3/G [...] 2B(1 − 2v)(1 + v), where v is the Poisson’s ratio, which is typically ~0.1 in covalent materials.

This research focuses on design of auxetic materials {{in order to enhance}} and control mechanical properties. Mechanical design of auxetic structures has been developed for both high and low stiffness applications. For high stiffness applications, auxetic structures were designed to be used for making auxetic materials. Among several auxetic structures, re-entrant structures have been selected due to their potential of modeling auxetic materials. The basic mechanical properties and impact characteristics have been determined using analytical and numerical methods. The analytical formulation has been validated by finite element analysis whereas the numerical results have been corroborated against experimental results. For validation, the basic mechanical properties and energy absorption capacity have been compared accordingly to subsequently carry out further analyses. As additional results, dynamic analysis of viscoelastic structures under impact loading was also demonstrated to examine the amount of impact resistance. For low stiffness applications, negative <b>Poissons</b> <b>ratio</b> polyurethane foam was precisely fabricated through a modified fabrication process which later involved experimental works to measure and control the mechanical properties. The effects of fabrication parameters namely hydraulic pressure, heating temperature and time on auxeticity of specimens have also been investigated.

In addition to this, energy absorption capability of auxetic foam was measured by using a high speed camera and falling weight system.
