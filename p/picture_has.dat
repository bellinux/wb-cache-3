5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E
5|$|Ten Dollar Bill (also {{referred}} to as The Dollar Bill) is a 1956 proto-pop art lithographic drawing by Roy Lichtenstein. Considered to {{be a combination of}} Americana art and cubism, the work is {{referred to}} as the beginning to Lichtenstein's work on pop art. Twenty-five editions of the lithograph were made by Lichtenstein, which were exhibited at several galleries. The piece is based on the design for the ten-dollar bill and has influenced several of Lichtenstein's later works. The <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> received generally favorable reception from critics, and is considered to be one of the best artistic portrayals of currency.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{depiction of}} the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows {{the church of the}} abbey much as it is today, {{with the exception of the}} high vault of the south transept still present. The <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.|$|E

5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere. However, it was revealed prior to broadcast {{that there would be}} a time jump in the episode. After it was announced that Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set picture on Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to the unwanted release of spoilers, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room, in which there was a picture of Robbins alive on the screen. The <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> since been taken down.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on the moose {{and the second is}} of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> become too commercialized.|$|E

The long-run prospects for growth remain favorable. The inflation rate is low and stable, with projections for continued low levels over the next 2–3 years.|$|E
25|$|The game {{continued}} to spread throughout England and, in 1751, Yorkshire is first {{mentioned as a}} venue. The original form of bowling (i.e., rolling the ball along the ground as in bowls) was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball and study variations in line, length and pace. Scorecards began to be kept {{on a regular basis}} from 1772 and since then an increasingly clear <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> emerged of the sport's development.|$|E
25|$|After her marriage, Dolores {{adopted the}} severe {{masculine}} style of dress and hair popular at that time, appearing in Eve, The Lady's Pictorial in 1925 {{in a suit}} jacket and tie. The mannish appearance, uncharacteristic (in photographs) half-smile, and the knowing look in the <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> caused later commentators to wonder whether Dolores was signalling {{that she was a}} lesbian, but {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that she was and her appearance at this time may simply have been a fashion statement. The photograph appeared, slightly changed, on the cover of Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins of a Modern English Lesbian Culture by Laura Doan in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Because the Mona Lisas poplar support expands and {{contracts}} {{with changes in}} humidity, the <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the Mona Lisa was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This flexible frame, which is used {{in addition to the}} decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after {{it was found that the}} beechwood had been infested with insects. In 2004–05, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.|$|E
25|$|After {{claims of}} two miraculous {{incidents}} in 1696 {{with the mother}} in the picture allegedly shedding real tears, Emperor Leopold I ordered it brought to St. Stephen's Cathedral, {{where it would be}} safe from the Muslim armies that still controlled much of Hungary. Upon its arrival after a triumphal five-month journey in 1697, Empress Eleonora Magdalena commissioned the splendid Rosa Mystica oklad and framework (now one of several) for it, and the Emperor personally ordered the icon placed near the High Altar {{in the front of the}} church, where it stood prominently from 1697 until 1945. Since then, it has been in a different framework, above an altar under a medieval stone baldachin near the southwest corner of the nave – where the many burning candles indicate the extent of its veneration, especially by Hungarians. Since its arrival the <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> not been seen weeping again but other miracles and answered prayers have been attributed to it, including Prince Eugene of Savoy's victory over the Turks at Zenta few weeks after the icon's installation in the Stephansdom.|$|E
25|$|Papak's <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> {{been drawn}} on both Shapur's coins and later Ardashir's; {{in the picture}} of the Papak drawn on Shapur's coins, he wears a wig {{dissimilar}} to normal Parthian and local Persian shahs and only Shapur has worn a royal wig. According to royal reports, it was Papak who overthrew Gochihr and appointed Shapur instead of him. Ardashir refused to accept Shapur's appointment and removed his brother and whoever stood against him and then minted coins with his face drawn on them and Papak's behind them. Papak's picture on Ardashir-Papak coins, wears a wig similar to those of local Persian shahs in contrast to his picture in Shapur-Papak coins. According to the descriptions given on Papak's pictures on the coins, it is probable that the determining role of Ardashir depicted in leading the rebellion against the central government is the product of later historical studies. It is probable that Papak had united most of Pars under his rule by the time; since his picture exists on Ardashir's coins too.|$|E

500|$|The <b>picture</b> <b>has</b> been parodied several times, {{including}} {{for advertising}} [...] (1994). This {{led to the}} 1998 Second Circuit fair use case Leibovitz v.

500|$|The lyric [...] "shake {{it like a}} Polaroid picture", {{along with}} the song's {{commercial}} success, helped to revitalize the Polaroid Corporation.

Vigorously shaking the film may actually distort the image by causing the film to separate prematurely and creating blobs in the final image.
