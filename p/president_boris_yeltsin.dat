5|$|In early 1996 a {{group of}} Moscow academics, journalists and intellectuals {{suggested}} that Vladimir Bukovsky should run for President of Russia as an alternative candidate to both incumbent <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> and his main challenger Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. However, no formal nomination process was initiated.|$|E

Article 71 of the Constitution of Russia permits titles, orders and medals to be presented by the government, and Article 89 gives the Russian president power to create state awards. This is the highest honour that can be presented by the Russian president to a citizen.|$|E

The treaty guaranteed the right to freely choose their citizenship for all residents of the former Estonian SSR.|$|R
5|$|In June 1992, American President George H. W.

This agreement called {{for setting up}} a short, joint space project, during which one American astronaut would board the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts would board a Space Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Russian <b>president</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> {{disclosed}} five top-secret memos {{dating from}} {{a few weeks after}} the downing of KAL007 in 1983. The memos contained Soviet communications (from KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov and Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov to General Secretary Yury Andropov) that indicated that they knew the location of KAL007's wreckage while they were simulating a search and harassing the American Navy; they had found the sought-after cockpit voice recorder on October 20, 1983 (50 days after the incident), and had decided to keep this knowledge secret, the reason being that the tapes could not unequivocally support their firmly held view that KAL007's flight to Soviet territory was a deliberately planned intelligence mission.|$|E
5|$|The Bure family made {{precious}} watches for the Russian tsars from 1815 until 1917, and Bure {{was named}} after his great-grandfather, a watchmaker to Tsar Alexander III. As craftspersons to the imperial family, the Bures were granted noble status. After Bure sustained his first serious knee injury in 1995, he pursued the watchmaking business during his rehabilitation period {{in an attempt to}} revive the family business. Fifty replicas of the same watches his ancestors made for the Russian imperial family were made and sold at US$30,000 each. Bure presented three of the gold replicas to Russian <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov.|$|E

5|$|After Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev became {{leader of}} the Soviet Union and began a process of de-Stalinisation, citing Lenin's writings, {{including}} those on Stalin, to legitimise this process. When Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of glastnost and perestroika, he too cited these actions as a return to Lenin's principles. In late 1991, amid {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, Russian <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> ordered the Lenin archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History, at which it was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. These were declassified and made available for scholarly study. Yeltsin did not dismantle the Lenin mausoleum, recognising that Lenin was too popular and well respected among the Russian populace for this to be viable.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 1992, Russian <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> in a {{goodwill}} {{gesture to}} South Korea {{during a visit}} to Seoul to ratify a new treaty, released both the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of KAL007. Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant magnetic heading instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, or, if it had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7½-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian <b>president</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E

5|$|The first manned mission flown from an {{independent}} Kazakhstan was Soyuz TM-14, launched on 17 March 1992, which carried the EO-11 crew to Mir, docking on 19 March before {{the departure of}} Soyuz TM-13. On 17 June, Russian <b>President</b> <b>Boris</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> and US President George H. W. Bush announced what would later become the Shuttle-Mir programme, a cooperative venture which proved useful to the cash-strapped Roskosmos (and led to the eventual completion and launch of Spektr and Priroda). EO-12 followed in July, alongside a brief visit by French astronaut Michel Tognini. The following crew, EO-13, began preparations for the Shuttle-Mir programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft, Soyuz TM-16 (launched on 26 January 1993), which was equipped with an APAS-89 docking system rather than the usual probe-and-drogue, enabling it to dock to Kristall and test the port which would later be used by US space shuttles. The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station's longitudinal axis, in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called Rezonans conducted on 28 January. Soyuz TM-15, meanwhile, departed with the EO-12 crew on 1 February.|$|E
