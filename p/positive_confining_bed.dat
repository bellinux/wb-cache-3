Plants {{grown in the}} confined and the combined beds produced the earliest tomatoes. During the first five weeks of harvest, approximately 18 % of the fruits produced in <b>confined</b> <b>beds</b> developed blossom end rot. This disorder was hardly developed in the other growing systems. After five weeks of harvest, these differences in fruit production were unchanged or even increased. Plants grown in the <b>confined</b> <b>beds</b> produced significantly less fruit load compared with the other bed types, especially in 2003. Application of supplemental fertilizer did not significantly increase the fruit production in any year...|$|R
30|$|For reasons above, {{vertical}} discretization of {{both the}} reservoir and the <b>confining</b> <b>beds</b> is also implemented by subdividing them into multiple layers. Minimum layer thickness is 0.5  m and is gradually increased away from the aquifer–aquitard boundary to 140  m in the <b>confining</b> <b>beds</b> and 5  m in the reservoir. After refinement, the base model consists of 37 slices and 36 layers, respectively, and has more than 900 thousand nodes and 1.75 million elements.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a Miocene sequence stratigraphic framework using data from recently drilled boreholes in the New Jersey Coastal Plain. Sequences are shallowing upward, unconformity-bounded units; fine-grained shelf and prodelta sediments grade upward to delta front and shallow-marine sands, corresponding to confining bed-aquifer couplets. By dating Miocene sequences using Sr-isotope stratigraphy, and mapping with borehole data and geophysical logs, we can predict the continuity and effectiveness of the <b>confining</b> <b>beds</b> and aquifers. The following are illustrated on a 904 ~ 11 basinward dip section: (1) the composite <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> is comprised of the KwO and lower Kwla (ca. 23. 8 - 20. 5 Ma) sequences downdip at Atlantic City, and the Kw 1 b, Kw 1 a and older sequences updip (ca. 69. 3 - 20. 6 Ma), and is continuous {{throughout most of the}} coastal plain; (2) the major confined aquifer, the Atlantic City 800 -foot sand, is comprised of the upper Kwla and Kwlb sequences (ca. 20520. 2 Ma) and is an areally continuous sand that is interconnected with the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer system updip of Mays Landing; (3) the <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> above the Atlantic City 800 -foot sand is comprised of the Kw 2 a, Kw 2 b, and Kw 3 sequences (18. 1 - 13. 3 Ma) and is an extensive <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> that pinches out updip. These sequences and aquifer-confining bed couplets are linked to global sea-level changes evinced by the S”O record. We conclude that sequence stratigraphy is a powerful tool when applied to regional hydrogeologic problems, although basinal tectonic differences and localized variations in sediment supply can affect aquifer thickness and permeability...|$|R

40|$|The Green River-Moab area {{encompasses}} about 7, 800 {{square kilometers}} or about 25 {{percent of the}} Paradox basin. The entire Paradox basin {{is a part of}} the Colorado Plateaus that is underlain by a thick sequence of evaporite (salt) beds of Pennsylvanian age.

The upper Mesozoic sandstone aquifer, probably is the most permeable hydrogeologic unit of the area and is the subject of this investigation. The principal component of groundwater outflow from this aquifer probably is subsurface flow to regional streams (the Green and Colorado Rivers) and is about 100 million cubic meters per year. All other components of outflow are relatively small. The average annual recharge to the aquifer is about 130 million cubic meters, of which about 20 million cubic meters is from local precipitation.
