2500|$|Workability is {{the ability}} of a fresh (<b>plastic)</b> <b>concrete</b> mix to fill the form/mold {{properly}} with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of hydration) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles. [...] Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.|$|E

40|$|Till to now, the {{relative}} practical importance of <b>plastic</b> modified <b>concrete</b> {{is restricted to}} its use as a building material for redevelopment and restoration. Polymer modified structural concretes were without significance. The author puts the practical assessment of <b>plastic</b> modified <b>concretes</b> by an extensive investigation of materials on a new basis. The main aspects of investigation are: (a) advantages of <b>plastic</b> modified <b>concretes</b> with respect to tightness and resistance in comparison to conventional concretes; (b) Looking for further properties {{with respect to the}} assessment; (c) increase of plant safety or increase of the lifetime of a construction by modification of plastic concrete; (d) economical solution of <b>plastic</b> modified <b>concretes.</b> The author investigates two systems, a styrene-acrylate dispersion and an epoxy resin, consisting of an epoxy resin component and a special hardener. During the experiments, the composition and the amount of plastic was varied in comparison to a reference concrete without addition of plastics. The properties of green concrete and solid concrete can carefully be directed by addition of polymers. Both polymer modified concretes have a softer consistence which increases with increasing amount of plastics. The styrene-acrylate dispersion causes a higher liquefying effect than the epoxy resin. This effect increases with increasing amount of <b>plastics</b> in the <b>concrete.</b> A decrease of the relation water/cement at constant processibility is possible. Polymer addition reduces the concrete strength. No decisive variations of strength could be observed in the range of tensile strength. Only the styrene-acrylate modified concrete shows some increase in strength. Both types of concrete have a sufficient resistance against frost and deicing salt. <b>Plastic</b> modified <b>concretes</b> are more chemical resistant in comparison to non-plastic modified concrete. The chemical resistance depends on the polymer substance, contamination liquid and the amount of plastics added. Due to the addition of plastics, the penetration depths of liquids into the concrete can be reduced. <b>Plastic</b> modified <b>concrete</b> can be used in the range of construction according to environmental production because these substances are a good alternative to steel or concretes with coatings. With addition of plastics, safe and economical concentrations are possible.

5000|$|Though {{hardened}} concrete appears solid, {{it is actually}} highly porous, having small capillaries resulting from the evaporation of water beyond that required for the hydration reaction. A water to cement ratio (w/c) of approximately 0.42 (this means 42 parts water for every 100 parts cement) is required for all the cement particles to hydrate. Water beyond that is surplus and is {{used to make the}} <b>plastic</b> <b>concrete</b> more workable or easily flowing or less viscous [...] Most concrete has a w/c of 0.45 to 0.60, which means there is substantial excess water that will not react with cement. Eventually the excess water evaporates, leaving little pores in its place. Environmental water can later fill these voids. During freeze-thaw cycles, the water occupying those pores expands and creates stresses which lead to tiny cracks. These cracks allow more water into the concrete and the cracks enlarge. Eventually the concrete spalls - chunks break off. The failure of reinforced concrete is most often due to this cycle, which is accelerated by moisture reaching the reinforcing steel. Steel expands when it rusts, and these forces create even more cracks, letting in more water.|$|E
