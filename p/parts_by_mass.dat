One way in which progesterone helps to alleviate some of this excitotoxicity is by blocking the voltage-dependent calcium channels that trigger neurotransmitter release.

40|$|This book is an {{examination}} of how American mass media, including advertising, presents Otherness - anyone or anything constructed as different from an established norm - in terms of gender, race, sex, disabilities, and other markers of difference. Using a mythological lens, the book looks {{below the surface of}} media content to explore the psychological, social, and economic underpinnings of a system of beliefs that result in prejudice, discrimination, and oppression. Designed to raise awareness of the foundations of historically-based inequities in the American social, cultural, and economic milieu, the author shows how inequalities are maintained, at least in <b>part,</b> <b>by</b> <b>mass</b> media, popular culture, and advertising representations of Otherness. The book aims to increase awareness of stereotyping in the media, and expose how the construction of people as Others contributes to their marginalization.

A modified precipitation method, {{carried out in}} an emulsion system, was used for monodisperse silica synthesis, while magnesium silicate was precipitated in a traditional water system. Functionalization of the obtained inorganic supports was performed with selected alkylsilanes: one newly synthesized, 3 -(2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5 -octafluoropentyloxy) propyltriethoxysilane (OPF), and two commercial, octadecylsilane (ODS) and octyltriethoxysilane C 14 H 32 O 3 Si (OCS), in amounts of 3, 5, or 10 weight <b>parts</b> <b>by</b> <b>mass</b> of SiO 2. It was determined how the chemical modification of the silica or magnesium silicate surface affected its physicochemical properties. The dispersive characteristics of both unmodified and functionalized silica-based systems were evaluated.

The parameters of porous structure of the prepared systems were evaluated {{on the basis of}} BET equation as well as nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. Wettability tests as well as elemental analysis of the obtained inorganic oxide hybrids were also performed.

40|$|AbstractThe posttranslational {{modifications}} induced on PKC isozymes as {{result of}} their activation were investigated. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations followed by Western blot analysis demonstrated that all PKC isozymes expressed in rat hepatocytes are modified by tyrosine nitration and tyrosine phosphorylation in different ways upon exposure of cells to a direct PKC activator (TPA), or to an extracellular ligand known to activate PKC-dependent pathways (epinephrine). Our data demonstrate {{for the first time}} that all PKC isozymes are also dynamically modified by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc); the presence of this modification was confirmed in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> FT-ICR <b>mass</b> spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, the O-GlcNAc modified Ser or Thr were mapped at similar positions in several PKC isozymes. The biochemical meaning of these posttranslational modifications was investigated for PKC alpha and delta. It was found that the PKC phosphorylation status of both isozymes in tyrosine and serine residues seems to regulate directly the enzyme activity since catalytic inactivation correlate with dephosphorylation of Ser at the C-terminus autophosphorylation sites of each PKC isozyme, and with an increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation. Whereas none of the other posttranslational modifications showed per se a direct effect in PKC delta activity, increased tyrosine nitration and O-GlcNAc modifications correlate negatively with PKCα activity...|$|R
