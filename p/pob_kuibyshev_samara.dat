5|$|His {{greatest}} {{and most}} famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer {{wrote the first}} three movements in Leningrad and completed the work in <b>Kuibyshev</b> (now <b>Samara)</b> {{where he and his}} family had been evacuated.

The symphony was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States. The most compelling performance was the Leningrad premiere by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city. The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play a musical instrument to perform the symphony.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid the same [...] "error" [...] which they thought the leaders of the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy had made, Archbishop Nikola did not ordain any new bishops single handedly - not until the {{conversion}} of another bishop from the Russian Orthodox Church, Stephan (Rastorguev), in September 1929. Four more bishops were ordained in subsequent years. Like many other Christian Churches in Soviet Russia, the Old-Orthodox Church suffered heavy persecution from atheistic authorities. One of the outcomes of these conditions was the frequent migration of the see of its first hierarch: Moscow (1924-1955); <b>Kuibyshev</b> - now <b>Samara</b> (1955-1963); Novozybkov (in Bryansk region) (1963-2000).
