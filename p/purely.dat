5|$|As {{with the}} k-type section, the image {{impedance}} of the m-type low-pass section is <b>purely</b> real below the cut-off frequency and <b>purely</b> imaginary above it. From the chart {{it can be}} seen that in the passband the closest impedance match to a constant pure resistance termination occurs at approximately m = 0.6.|$|E
5|$|Complex: These viruses {{possess a}} capsid that is neither <b>purely</b> helical nor <b>purely</b> icosahedral, {{and that may}} possess extra {{structures}} such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century the Drapers shut the Mercers {{out of the}} trade and make the Shearmen <b>purely</b> subcontractors, {{creating}} an effective monopoly.|$|E

5|$|Vicars' Close, in Wells, Somerset, England, {{is claimed}} to be the oldest <b>purely</b> {{residential}} street with original buildings surviving intact in Europe.|$|E
5|$|After his injury-hit Caribbean sojourn, Davidson had the 1955–56 season, {{which was}} <b>purely</b> domestic, to force {{his way back}} into the {{national}} team for the 1956 tour of England. Johnston had also retired, leaving an extra vacancy for a pace bowler.|$|E
5|$|Although Jews are an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} {{defined by the}} Nazis on <b>purely</b> racial grounds. The Nazi Party viewed the Jewish {{religion}} as irrelevant, persecuting Jews in accordance with antisemitic stereotypes of an alleged biologically determined heritage. Defining Jews as the chief enemy, Nazi racial ideology was also used to persecute other minorities.|$|E
5|$|Although {{continental}} fashions in needlework {{were adopted}} in England, {{a number of}} popular styles were <b>purely</b> English in origin, including the embroidered linen jackets of {{the turn of the}} 17th century, stumpwork, and art needlework.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{division}} was intended <b>purely</b> as an administrative convenience, local authorities gradually gained more {{influence over the}} schools they aided, {{in part because of}} the schools' weak financial position during the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Banksy's {{installments}} {{are located}} {{all across the}} five boroughs, with some being <b>purely</b> multimedia exhibits. On 6 October, {{as a way to}} have made an installment in Dumbo, Brooklyn, a primary arts district of the city, Banksy posted a video featuring the Walt Disney character Dumbo being shot down by Syrian rebels, the meaning behind which puzzled many.|$|E
5|$|Diving may be {{performed}} for various reasons, {{both personal and}} professional. Recreational diving is <b>purely</b> for enjoyment and has several specialisations and technical disciplines to provide more scope for varied activities for which specialist training can be offered, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and deep diving.|$|E
5|$|Felix Steiner {{published}} The Volunteers of Waffen-SS: Idea {{and sacrifice}} (German: Die Freiwilligen der Waffen-SS: Idee und Opfergang) in 1958. It presented the sacrifice messages echoing those of Der Freiwillige and stressed {{the theme of}} the <b>purely</b> military Waffen-SS.|$|E
5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a <b>purely</b> negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view that the goal of {{mathematics}} is to classify and characterize, the representation theory of the Lorentz group is since 1947 a finished chapter. But in association with the Bargmann–Wigner programme, there are (as of 2006) yet unresolved <b>purely</b> mathematical problems, linked to the infinite-dimensional unitary representations.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to Australia and {{played in the}} 1953–54 season, which was <b>purely</b> domestic. He scored 639 runs at 42.60, including a century against New South Wales and four fifties. He had a few near-misses during the season; he scored 97 against Queensland in two matches and made 88 against South Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the German {{paleontologist}} Otto Schindewolf {{argued that}} variation tends {{to move in}} a predetermined direction. He believed this was <b>purely</b> mechanistic, denying any kind of vitalism, but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 {{budget cuts}} {{compelled}} the magazine to rebrand itself as Japan Echo Web, a <b>purely</b> online magazine published on a website {{operated by the}} Foreign Affairs Ministry. However, two years later the Japanese government shut it down {{and replaced it with}} a similar project called the Japan Foreign Policy Forum.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision {{was taken up}} by the Israelites <b>purely</b> as a religious mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 {{study by}} Chase et al. {{referred}} to above, {{which was the}} largest yet to use <b>purely</b> molecular data, the results demonstrated paraphyly of the lilioids. However, because their data contradicted <b>purely</b> morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to the monophyly of this group. They identified four major clades of monocots. They named these alismatids, aroids, stemonoids and dioscoreoids, in addition to Acorus, and {{a core group of}} Asparagales, Liliales and commelinoids. They based the names of these groups on the closest corresponding superorders and orders of Dahlgren, with the exception of stemonoids (based on Stemonaceae for which there was no obvious equivalent).|$|E
5|$|In this case, the {{circular}} orbits {{of the water}} particles in the deep-water wave are converted to <b>purely</b> linear motion, with vertical velocities at the antinodes, and horizontal velocities at the nodes.|$|E
5|$|It is a white, {{hexagonal}} shaped {{6 metres}} (20ft) tall pagoda. The first storey of the pagoda has a hexagonal chamber, {{while the second}} storey is <b>purely</b> decorative. The pagoda is decorated with lotus petals and the steeple supports a precious bottle {{in the shape of}} a flower.|$|E
5|$|It {{was ranked}} 10th {{among the top}} Universities of India by QS in 2013. With 7 of the top ten Indian Universities being <b>purely</b> science and {{technology}} universities, it was India's 3rd best Multi Disciplinary University in the QS University ranking.|$|E
5|$|Most {{historical}} calendars are lunisolar. The 7th-century Islamic calendar is {{an exceptional}} {{example of a}} <b>purely</b> lunar calendar. Months are traditionally determined by the visual sighting of the hilal, or earliest crescent moon, over the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Much like had {{occurred}} at the final podium celebrations for the 2009 Tour de France, the wrong national anthem was played for Contador. Race organizers mistakenly played an old Spanish anthem with lyrics favored by former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. The Spanish national anthem {{as it should have}} been played would have been <b>purely</b> instrumental.|$|E
5|$|Northampton's first war {{memorial}} was {{a temporary}} cenotaph built from wood and plaster which stood in Abington Street from July 1919 as a placeholder until a more permanent memorial could be erected; the temporary cenotaph was {{the focal point}} for remembrance services until {{the installation of the}} permanent memorial. As in several towns and cities, there were discussions within the town as to whether its war memorial should serve a <b>purely</b> monumental purpose or some sort of community function. Suggestions included renovating civic buildings, a new 2,000-seat concert hall, and a classical-style arch on Guildhall road. The Northamptonshire War Memorial Committee, chaired by local landowner John Powys, 5th Baron Lilford, eventually commissioned Lutyens to design a <b>purely</b> commemorative monument, and selected a site in part of the churchyard of All Saints' Church. The memorial was funded by public donations, including a donation of £50 from Lord Lilford.|$|E
5|$|Production {{difficulties}} beset {{the series}} {{almost from the}} beginning. The series had three different producers {{in the course of}} its 26 episodes and went through a number of other key personnel changes. With the change in producers also came changes to the show's format, which started as comedy/variety but switched to an almost <b>purely</b> concert format.|$|E
5|$|Ralph {{inherited}} the ancestral lands in Normandy. The Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote that Basset built a tower on his ancestral lands of Montreuil in Normandy <b>purely</b> {{to demonstrate his}} status and wealth.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of double hull has been more of an economic than a <b>purely</b> architectural decision, some argue that double-sided ships receive less comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion. In spite of opposition, double hulls became a requirement for Panamax and Capesize vessels in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Statives are a {{class of}} predicative words expressing a quality or state, whose {{syntactic}} properties fall in between those of verbs and adjectives in Indo-European languages. Like verbs, statives can sometimes be inflected for person but normally lack inflections for tense, aspect and other <b>purely</b> verbal categories. Statives can be adjectives, positionals or numerals.|$|E
5|$|The 1953–54 {{season was}} <b>purely</b> domestic, with no Tests scheduled. Davidson had a modest injury-hit season, scoring 76 runs at 19.00 and taking nine wickets at 32.71 in four matches. His best was a 4/50 against Queensland, and 3/89 in a {{testimonial}} match for retiring Australian captain Lindsay Hassett; he removed Test teammates Benaud, Ron Archer and Graeme Hole.|$|E
5|$|The 1961–62 was <b>purely</b> domestic, and Harvey {{played a}} full season in the Sheffield Shield as New South Wales won their ninth {{consecutive}} title. However, Harvey was not prominent in the team's success and scored only 425 runs at 26.56 with two fifties for the season.|$|E
5|$|The Act's {{labeling}} {{requirement is}} unconstitutionally compelled speech under the First Amendment {{because it does}} not require the disclosure of <b>purely</b> factual information, but compels the carrying of the State's controversial Opinion.|$|E
5|$|The Restoration Movement {{was not a}} <b>purely</b> North American phenomenon, {{and active}} mission efforts began in the 18th century. There are now Churches of Christ in Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, Central America, and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The diver ascends {{along the}} shotline, and may use it <b>purely</b> {{as a visual}} reference, or can {{hold on to it}} to {{positively}} control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to an anchor line or shot line during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the 19th century saw {{geological}} and paleontological activity become increasingly well organised with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists. Interest increased for reasons that were not <b>purely</b> scientific, as geology and paleontology helped industrialists to find and exploit natural resources such as coal.|$|E
