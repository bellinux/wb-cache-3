50|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Pennsylvania, Galanter held {{positions}} at the University of Washington and Harvard University before becoming the Gelhorn Professor of Psychology at Columbia University, where he was also Director of the <b>Psychophysics</b> <b>Laboratory</b> and, for a time, Chairman of the Department of Psychology. In addition to his work in psychophysics and mathematical psychology, Galanter continues to publish in various subfields of psychometrics including psychoeducational assessment and motivational measurement. Galanter has been honored by NASA, which awarded him its Distinguished Scientist Research Award.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Faubert and the Visual Perception and <b>Psychophysics</b> <b>Laboratory</b> {{have been}} {{involved}} in transferring laboratory developments into the commercial domain since 1999. Several funding agencies {{have been involved}} in brokering this technology transfer. From the commercial domain, Essilor (an ophthalmic lens company) has partnered with the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). Together, their aim has been to explore the connection between aging, visual perception, and posture. Dr. Faubert has been a chairholder at the NSERC since 2003, at which time his laboratory received a five-year grant (renewed in 2008).|$|E

40|$|Nakayama and Shimojo {{consider}} 1 {{the visual}} interpretation of sparsely structured stereo images. The critical issue, common throughout this text, is how di erent interpretations {{for the same}} image should be compared. To dosuchcomparisons the authors appeal {{to the notion of}} accidental views of a scene. The motivation for this is primarily scepticism that the visual system could gain, through experience, any accurate quantitative information about the prior probabilities of di erent scene interpretations. Indeed the generic view approach ignores the prior probabilities and treats every scene interpretation as equally likely a priori. I am sympathetic to this concern about the availability of accurate priors, especially considering the range of di erent and typically unknown contexts our visual systems must face, including various arti cial contexts presented in <b>psychophysics</b> <b>laboratories.</b> But, as I discuss below, the generic view approach has some serious short comings, some of which {{can be traced back to}} this decision to ignore the priors. Finally, I argue that there is a middle ground, which seems to me to be compatible with Nakayama's and Shimojo's general intuition, but does involve the use of some prior information. The critical point here is that the approach I suggest requires only rather general, qualitative properties of the various prior distributions. This latter part of the commentary is intended to be a carrot, enticing researchers such as the Nakayama and Shimojo to put a little structure in their priors (and just a little). But rst we need the stick. 1 Against the generic view principle The principle of generic views does not, by itself, explain the preferences for the interpretations of several stereo displays in the target article. There is a technical loophole in th...|$|R
50|$|Several highly {{regarded}} tactile tests {{have been developed}} as rigorous replacements to the 2PD test. In <b>psychophysics</b> research <b>laboratories,</b> a favored test of tactile spatial acuity has for many years been the grating orientation task (GOT). In the GOT, the participant attempts to discern the orientation of parallel grooves pressed either along or across the fingertip. The GOT threshold is the groove width at which the participant performs with some specified level of accuracy (e.g., 75% correct). The GOT is considered to yield a valid measure of tactile spatial acuity and {{has been used in}} many research studies, with both manual and automated stimulus delivery protocols. For example, the GOT has been used to map spatial acuity on different body areas, to characterize how tactile spatial acuity is affected by age, sex, skin characteristics, and blindness, and to track the changes in tactile spatial acuity that occur during perceptual learning and recovery from nerve injury.|$|R
5000|$|Eugene Galanter {{was one of}} {{the modern}} founders of {{cognitive}} psychology. He was an academic in the field of experimental psychology and an author. Dr. Galanter was Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Quondam Director of the <b>Psychophysics</b> <b>Laboratory</b> at Columbia University. [...] He was also the co-founder, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Scientific Officer of Children’s Progress, an award-winning New York City-based company that specializes in the use of computer technology in early education. The company's assessments and reports have been used in 40 states and 9 countries.|$|E
50|$|Laboratory {{psychology}} of the kind practiced in Germany and the United States was slow in coming to Britain. Although the philosopher James Ward (1843-1925) urged Cambridge University to establish a <b>psychophysics</b> <b>laboratory</b> from the mid-1870s forward, {{it was not until}} the 1891 that they put so much as £50 toward some basic apparatus (Bartlett, 1937). A laboratory was established through the assistance of the physiology department in 1897 and a lectureship in psychology was established which first went to W. H. R. Rivers (1864-1922). Soon Rivers was joined by C. S. Myers (1873-1946) and William McDougall (1871-1938). This group showed as much interest in anthropology as psychology, going with Alfred Cort Haddon (1855-1940) on the famed Torres Straits expedition of 1898.|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Addiction has been {{reliably}} associated with biased emotional reactions to risky choices. Problematic Internet use (PIU) {{is a relatively}} new concept and its classification as an addiction is debated. Implicit emotional responses were measured in individuals expressing nonproblematic and problematic Internet behaviors while they made risky/ambiguous decisions to explore whether they showed similar responses to those found in agreed-upon addictions. Methods The design of the study was cross sectional. Participants were adult Internet users (N = 72). All testing took place in the <b>Psychophysics</b> <b>Laboratory</b> at the University of Bath, UK. Participants were given the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) which provides an index of an individual’s ability to process and learn probabilities of reward and loss. Integration of emotions into current decision-making frameworks is vital for optimal performance on the IGT and thus, skin conductance responses (SCRs) to reward, punishment, and in anticipation of both were measured to assess emotional function. Results Performance on the IGT did not differ between the groups of Internet users. However, problematic Internet users expressed increased sensitivity to punishment as revealed by stronger SCRs to trials with higher punishment magnitude. Discussion and conclusions PIU seems to differ on behavioral and physiological levels with other addictions. However, our data imply that problematic Internet users were more risk-sensitive, which is a suggestion that needs to be incorporated into in any measure and, potentially, any intervention for PIU...|$|E
