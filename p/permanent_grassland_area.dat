40|$|This paper {{describes}} the bio-economic land use model ProLand and presents selected results for scenarios of coupled and fully decoupled Pillar One transfer payments under the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The basic assumption {{for the model}} is that land users select the land use alternative from a set of agricultural and silvicultural land use systems {{which is expected to}} generate the highest possible land rent. The model is used to estimate effects of fully decoupled transfer payments on land use in a less favoured region in Hesse, Germany. The results confirm that the CAP Reform removes the distorting effects of coupled transfer payments. The extent and direction of land use changes are spatially variant. Overall, the CAP Reform will lead to increases of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>area</b> at the cost of arable land. The total agricultural land rent generated in the region will grow substantially, mainly due to higher amounts of transfer payments.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{effects of}} farming practice scenarios aiming to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and subsequent alternative land use on {{environmental impacts of}} a beef cattle production system using the life cycle assessment approach. The baseline scenario includes a standard cow-calf herd with finishing heifers based on grazing, and a standard bull-fattening herd using a diet mainly based on maize silage, corresponding to current farm characteristics and management by beef farmers in France. Alternative scenarios were developed with changes in farming practices. Some scenarios modified grassland management (S 1 : decreasing mineral N fertiliser on permanent grassland; S 2 : decreasing grass losses during grazing) or herd management (S 3 : underfeeding of heifers in winter; S 4 : fattening female calves instead of being reared at a moderate growth rate; S 5 : increasing longevity of cows from 7 to 9 years; S 6 : advancing first calving age from 3 to 2 years). Other scenarios replaced protein sources (S 7 : partially replacing a protein supplement by lucerne hay for the cow-calf herd; S 8 : replacing soya bean meal with rapeseed meal for the fattening herd) or increased n- 3 fatty acid content using extruded linseed (S 9). The combination of compatible scenarios S 1, S 2, S 5, S 6 and S 8 was also studied (S 10). The impacts, such as climate change (CC, not including CO 2 emissions/sequestration of land use and land-use change, LULUC), CC/LULUC (including CO 2 emissions of LULUC), cumulative energy demand, eutrophication (EP), acidification and land occupation (LO) were expressed per kg of carcass mass and per ha of land occupied. Compared with the baseline, the most promising practice to reduce impacts per kg carcass mass was S 10 (all reduced by 13 % to 28 %), followed by S 6 (by 8 % to 10 %). For other scenarios, impact reduction did not exceed 5 %, except for EP (up to 11 %) and LO (up to 10 %). Effects of changes in farming practices (the scenarios) on environmental impacts varied according to impact category and functional unit. For some scenarios (S 2, S 4, S 6 and S 10), <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>area</b> and LO per kg of carcass decreased by 12 % to 23 % and 9 % to 19 %, respectively. If the 'excess' permanent grassland was converted to fast-growing conifer forest to sequester carbon in tree and soil biomass, CC/LULUC per kg of carcass could be reduced by 20 %, 25 %, 27 % and 48 % for scenarios S 2, S 4, S 6 and S 10, respectively. These results illustrate the potential of farming practices and forest as an alternative land use to contribute to short-and mid-term GHG mitigation of beef cattle production systems...|$|E
40|$|In the EU, {{fossil fuels}} {{account for about}} 79 % of the total energy {{consumption}} and nuclear power for about 15 %. In the transport sector, fossil fuels deliver 98 % of total consumption. “Oil is the energy source that represents the most severe security of supply challenge for Europe”. This presentation considers how a biomass based energy supply could significantly decrease energy depending. Biomass production is limited and is dependent upon the availability of land and the yields that can be obtained. This paper assesses the current area under biomass production in the EU, the available land area and the potential to use that land for biomass production. There is also as assessment of the potential to produce biomass based on improvements in crop yield. There is also an issue {{with the use of}} arable land to produce biomass instead of food.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Bioenergy gives Europe {{the best}} {{opportunity}} to reduce GHG emission and secure its energy supply. However, the biomass production should not create additional pressure on the environment. Therefore, for presented calculations, biomass for energy utilization originates from the cropland of the agricultural <b>areas.</b> <b>Permanent</b> <b>grassland,</b> <b>areas</b> of agro-forestry and pasture have not been taken into account. The energy crops potential for the whole EU- 27 and for particular countries is presented. Only 10 % of arable land with poor yield conditions would result in almost 50 Mtoe of bioenergy production. With improved yield and increased percentage of the arable land dedicated for energy production up to 20 % of cropland, more than 180 Mtoe can be achieved. The computed results are compared with EU energy demand in 2030. As an example, this would be equal to almost 50 % of the transport fuel needs in 2030. By integrating biomass, wind, hydro, and solar, these energy sources can guarantee even 75 % of the world energy consumption {{in the near future}} (2025 - 2030). Moreover, diversity in energy supply would bring greater economic security and stability for the environment and the society...|$|R
40|$|Continuous (CG) and {{rotational}} grazing (RG) are important strategies for pasture based organic milk production systems. This study tests both grazing systems on their suitability for <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>areas</b> with drought tendency. The investigation {{was carried out}} on an organic dairy farm in Lower Austria on a permanent pasture sward in 2010. Simulated grazed swards were used at an average sward height of 8. 5 cm (CG) and 14. 8 cm (RG). CG variant was cut 9 times and RG variant 6 times in 2010. Low precipitation periods showed an effect on CG by reducing grass growth. RG reached significant higher yields in dry matter (10, 561 kg ha- 1), net energy lactation (68, 359 MJ ha- 1) and crude protein (1, 916 kg ha- 1) as CG (7, 753 kg DM ha- 1, 52, 792 MJ NEL ha- 1 and 1, 636 kg CP ha- 1).

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the current}} situation {{as well as the}} previous and potential development of the organic sectors in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. Concerning domestic productions and consumptions, <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>areas</b> have been most prominent, and consumers prefer fresh products in organic quality. In all countries, a mix of legal, financial and communicative policy instruments is currently being applied to stimulate both the organic markets’ supply and demand side. On the basis of this support, the sector has established and achieved noticeable market shares in Germany and especially in Austria so that these countries highly depend on imports to cover their domestic demand for organic foods nowadays. However, the organic sector’s development in the Czech Republic has slowed down due to both the general economic crisis and lacking stimulation of consumption, which is why particularly demand boosting political instruments should be intensified here. For the future support of organic farming, national policies should continuously be improved and targeted at consumers’ interests. Moreover, stronger international cooperation, especially on the political level, could contribute to a promising development of the European organic sector and help to put successful scientific work into practice...|$|R

Grasslands, {{in addition to the}} production functions, perform many non-productive ones. Grasslands are an essential part of our landscape. This thesis describes the importance of fertilising for grasslands and response of grasses, clovers and herbs on the application of mineral and organic fertilisers. Furthermore evaluates the influence of intensity of fertilising on species composition and yields of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland.</b> The issue was solved through an experiment at Kameničky stand, which is located at Bohemian-Moravian Highlands at an altitude of 650 m. In the experiment were evaluated variants of fertilising: non-fertilised, fertilised P 30 +K 60, fertilised N 90 +P 30 +K 60 and fertilised N 180 +P 30 +K 60 with a two-felling and three-felling usage variants in 2014. The results show, that with increasing dose of delivered nutrients increase fodder yields at the expense of decreasing species diversity. Nitrogen fertilising promotes the development of grasses and reduces the proportion of clovers and herbs in the stand. Phosphorus and potassium fertilising increase species diversity and supports the numbers of clovers and herbs in the stand.

40|$|Changes in {{land use}} and {{production}} systems are {{to a large extent}} responsible for land degradation. In Portugal this process has been triggered mainly by socioeconomic drivers, such as agricultural technology, demography and policy changes. In this article land use changes in Portugal are discussed in terms of their main drivers and impacts, focussing on land degradation and conservation. The discussion includes a brief outline of historical land use changes in Portugal and a more detailed account of the changes in the period after 1986, when Portugal joined the European Union. An assessment of recent (1986 – 2006) land use changes and their impact was conducted for two selected research areas in the Centro and Alentejo regions. This assessment was based on information from the CORINE Land Cover programme (1985 and 2006) and the National Agricultural Census (1989 and 1999). In the Centro research area the land under forest declined from 52 % to only 22 % of the area, mainly as a result of forest fires. In the Alentejo research area the major change was the decline of miscellaneous shrub, declining from 23 % to 11 %, to open forest land, increasing as a result of afforestation measures from 1 % to 22 %. These land use changes resulted in a significant increase of soil loss estimates through RUSLE. In the Centro research area soil losses greater than 10 t ha- 1 yr- 1 were estimated to occur in 57 % of the area in 1990, increasing as a result of land use change to 64 % in 2006. In the Alentejo research area this change was from 65 % in 1990 to 72 % in 2006. The research raises questions regarding land use management, in relation to the Common Agriculture Policy support during the 1986 – 2006 period.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work was to ascertain how plant species and land use management drive the diversity of the genus Burkholderia. In a greenhouse exper-iment, different crops, i. e., maize, oat, barley, and grass, were planted in pots containing soils with different land use histories, i. e., maize monoculture, crop rotation, and <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland,</b> for three consecutive growth cycles. The diversity of Burkholderia spp. in the rhizosphere soil was assessed by genus-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).

Although most variation in the Burkholderia community structure was observed between the <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> and agricultural <b>areas,</b> differences between the crop rotation and maize monoculture groups were also observed. Plant species affected Burkholderia community structure to a lesser extent than did land use history. Similarities were observed between Burkholderia populations associated with maize and grass, on the one hand, and between those associated with barley and oat, on the other hand. Additionally, CCA ordination plots demonstrated that these two groups (maize/grass versus barley/oat) had a negative correlation.

40|$|AbstractChanges in climatic {{conditions}} will directly affect {{the quality and}} quantity of water resources. Further on, they will affect them indirectly through adaptation in land use which ultimately influences diffuse nutrient emissions to rivers and therefore potentially the compliance with good ecological status according to the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). We present an integrated impact modelling framework (IIMF) to track and quantify direct and indirect pollution impacts along policy-economy-climate-agriculture-water interfaces. The IIMF is applied to assess impacts of climatic and socio-economic drivers on agricultural land use (crop choices, farming practices and fertilization levels), river flows and the risk for exceedance of environmental quality standards for determination of the ecological water quality status in Austria. This article also presents model interfaces as well as validation procedures and results of single models and the IIMF with respect to observed state variables such as land use, river flow and nutrient river loads. The performance of the IIMF for calculations of river nutrient loads (120 monitoring stations) shows a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0. 73 for nitrogen and 0. 51 for phosphorus. Most problematic is the modelling of phosphorus loads in the alpine catchments dominated by forests and mountainous landscape. About 63 % of these catchments show a deviation between modelled and observed loads of 30 % and more. In catchments dominated by agricultural production, the performance of the IIMF is much better as only 30 % of cropland and 23 % of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> dominated <b>areas</b> have a deviation of > 30 % between modelled and observed loads.

A crop rotation {{of grass and}} maize can be sustainable in terms of efficient nutrient use. However, there is lack {{of information on the}} effect of such a crop rotation on soil biological quality. Earthworms, nematodes, bacteria and fungi were sampled over three years in a 36 years old experiment. Permanent arable land was compared with <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> and with a ley-arable crop rotation. In the rotation, a period of three years of grassland (temporary grassland) was followed by a period of three years of arable land (temporary arable land) and vice versa. In the first year of arable cropping in the rotation, the number of earthworms was already low and not different from continuous cropping. In the three-year grass ley, the abundance of earthworms returned to the level of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> in the second year. However, the restoration of earthworm biomass took a minimum of three years. Furthermore, the anecic species did not recover the dominance they had in the <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland.</b> The numbers of herbivorous and microbivorous nematodes in the ley-crop rotation reached similar levels to those in the permanent treatments within one to two years. Although the same holds for the nematode genera composition, the Maturity Index and the proportion of omnivorous nematodes in the temporary treatments remained significantly lower than in their permanent counterparts. Differences in recovery were also found among microbial parameters. In the temporary treatments, bacterial growth rate and the capacity to degrade a suite of substrates recovered in the second year. However, the Community-Level Physiological Profiles in the <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> remained different from the other treatments. Our results suggest that many functions of soil biota that are well established in <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland,</b> are restored in a ley-arable crop rotation. However, due to a reduction in certain species, specific functions of these soil biota could be reduced or lost. The ley-arable crop rotations were intermediate to <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> and continuous arable land in terms of functioning of soil biota (e. g., N-mineralization).

40|$|International audienceTo {{upgrade the}} use of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> in {{livestock}} farming systems for their economic and environmental utility, their value needs better assessment {{in terms of both}} quantity (biomass production) and quality (nutritive value: organic matter digestibility (OMD) and crude protein content (CP)). The wide variability in <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> botanical composition makes it important to understand the links between vegetation characteristics and <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> value, and how far environmental factors influence this value. The current work investigated how vegetation characteristics and weather explained the variability of the biomass production and nutritive value of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Two models were used to determine the best vegetation characteristics for the prediction: (i) plant functional types (PFT), proportions of grasses, legumes and forbs and weather, and (ii) two proxies for PFT (dry matter content (DMC) and phenological development at medium plant stage (MPS)), proportion of grasses, legumes and forbs, and weather. The study was conducted on a set of 190 <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> distributed over a wide range of soil, climatic and management conditions, and lasted 2 years (2009 / 10). For each of the <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands,</b> climatic data, values of vegetation characteristics, biomass production and nutritive value were collected {{at the beginning and end}} of spring, and during summer and autumn regrowths. Contribution of weather was important and particularly for regrowths. Composition in terms of botanical families, plant stage and sward DMC was the common variables that explained both biomass production and nutritive value during the growing season. Biomass production was mainly explained by the proportion of legumes and forbs, MPS and DMC considering both models. Grass nutritive value was linked to the same factors, including PFT. However, the contribution of grass PFTs was lower in models. Both models could be used to predict biomass production and nutritive value: R- 2 of the two models are quite similar. Over a wide range of environmental and management conditions, vegetation characteristics and climatic data explained almost half of the variance of forage quality and 20 - 40 % of the variance of biomass production...|$|R

The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a non-destructive and rapid method for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content of forage from grassland using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). To accomplish this desiderate it was harvested forages in June from ten experimental trials of a <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> situated in the south – west part of Romania, in Banat County, fertilized organic (fermented sheep manure), mineral and organic – mineral. On the <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> the mineral fertilizers were applied yearly since 2003 and the organic fertilizer at each two years. For multivariate analysis to perform the NIR model was used a supervised technique, partial least squares (PLS) regression. The NIRS model was characterized by the following parameters: R 2 = 0. 9888, RMSEC = 222. 5, RMSEP = 215. 7. The differences between the chemical results and those predicted recommend like promising the NIRS method for PUFAs contents prediction of forages from <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> in studied conditions...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for agriculture today is to manage soil properties and their spatial distribution to optimize productivity and minimize environmental impacts, such as diffuse pollution. To identify best management practices, the effects of different agricultural management practices on pollutant sources, mobilization, transfer and delivery to water bodies need to be understood. Grasslands managed for dairy and meat production, despite being widespread, have received less research attention than other agricultural land uses. Therefore, this thesis studies the effects of different grassland management practices on soil properties and their spatial distribution and the mobilization and delivery of multiple diffuse pollutants. As a grassland case study, monitoring for this thesis was conducted across three fields (6. 5 – 7. 5 ha) on the North Wyke Farm Platform, a grassland experimental farm in the UK. First, the effects of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> management (<b>permanent</b> for at least 6 years, but different grassland management > 6 years ago) were characterized as a baseline, followed by quantifying the short-term effects of ploughing and reseeding of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> fields. Throughout those management periods, i) a range of soil physical (bulk density [BD]) and chemical (soil organic matter [SOM], total N [TN], total phosphorus [TP], total carbon [TC]) soil properties and their spatial distribution were sampled and analysed by geostatistics, and ii) hydrological characteristics and multiple pollutant fluxes (suspended sediment [SS] and the macronutrients: total oxidized nitrogen-N [TONN], total phosphorus [TP], and total carbon [TC]) were monitored at high temporal resolution (monitoring up to every 15 minutes). The <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> fields (or <b>areas</b> within fields) can {{be considered to be}} functioning differently. Past management legacy (more than 6 years ago) has affected soil properties and their distribution with subsequent effects on sediment and macronutrient delivery from the fields to surface waters. Overall, <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> were found to contribute significantly to agricultural diffuse pollution. The estimated erosion and macronutrient losses were similar to or exceeded the losses reported for other grasslands, mixed land use and even arable sites, and sediment and TP concentrations exceeded those recommended by EU / UK water quality guidelines. Ploughing and reseeding did not homogenize spatial variation and did not override past management effects. Long-term management differences affected soil properties and altered soil processes, so that the fields subsequently responded differently to ploughing and reseeding. All nutrient concentrations were significantly reduced in the older grassland field (no ploughing for 20 years), but not in the younger grassland field (no ploughing for 6 years). Ploughing and reseeding significantly accelerated the losses of sediment and macronutrients and sediment, TP and TONN exceedance frequencies of EU / UK water quality guidelines increased. Additionally, ploughing and reseeding caused a shift in the relative importance of nutrients, by increasing the relative importance of N. Such large sediment and nutrient losses from intensively managed grasslands should be acknowledged in land management guidelines and advice for future compliance with surface water quality standards. The between-field and within-field variation highlights the importance of baseline characterization and paired catchment studies. The long-term effects of management still acting on soil properties and subsequently water quality indicates how long it may take to see soil and water quality improvements after implementing mitigation measures. Therefore, long-term management history always has to be included when interpreting soil and water quality data. Case-funded PhD between NERC and Rothamsted Research (North Wyke...|$|R
