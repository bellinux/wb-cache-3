40|$|The {{most common}} {{structure}} used for current transformers (CTs) consists of secondary windings around a ferromagnetic core past the primary current being measured. A CT {{used as a}} surge protection device (SPD) may experience large inrushes of current, like surges. However, when a large current flows into the primary winding, measuring {{the magnitude of the}} current is difficult because the ferromagnetic core becomes magnetically saturated. Several approaches to reduce the saturation effect are described in the literature. A Rogowski coil is representative of several devices that measure large currents. It is an electrical device that measures alternating current (AC) or high-frequency current. However, such devices are very expensive in application. In addition, the volume of a CT must be increased to measure sufficiently large currents, but for installation spaces that are too small, other methods must be used. To solve this problem, it is necessary to analyze the magnetic field and electromotive force (EMF) characteristics when designing a CT. Thus, we proposed an analysis method for the CT under an inrush current using the time-domain finite element method (TDFEM). The input source current of a surge waveform is expanded by a Fourier series to obtain an instantaneous value. An FEM model of the device is derived in a two-dimensional system and coupled with EMF circuits. The time-derivative term in the differential equation is solved in each time step by the finite difference method. It is concluded that the proposed algorithm is useful for analyzing CT characteristics, including the field distribution. Consequently, the proposed algorithm yields a reference for obtaining the effects of design parameters and magnetic materials <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>shapes</b> and sizes before the CT is designed and manufactured...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of the adjoint variable approach to sensitivity analysis of objective functions used for defect detection from knowledge of supplementary boundary data, in connection with the use of BIE/BEM formulations for the relevant forward problem. The main objective is to establish expressions for crack shape sensitivity, based on the adjoint variable approach, that are suitable for BEM implementation. In order to do so, it is useful to consider first the case of a cavity defect, for which such boundary-only sensitivity expressions are obtained for general initial geometry and shape perturbations. The analysis made in the cavity defect case is then seen to break down in the limiting case of a crack. However, a closer analysis reveals that sensitivity formulas suitable for BEM implementation can still be established. First, particular sensitivity formulas are obtained <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>shape</b> transformations (translation, rotation or expansion of the crack) for either two- or three-dimensional geometries which, except for the case of crack expansion together with dynamical governing equations, are made only of surface integrals (three-dimensional geometries) or line integrals (two-dimensional geometries). Next, arbitrary shape transformations are accommodated by using an additive decomposition of the transformation velocity over a tubular neighbourhood of the crack front, which leads to sensitivity formulas. This leads to sensitivity formulas involving integrals on the crack, the tubular neighbourhood and its boundary. Finally, the limiting case of the latter results when the tubular neighbourhood shrinks around the crack front is shown to yield a sensitivity formula involving the stress intensity factors of both the forward and the adjoint solutions. Classical path-independent integrals are recovered as special cases. The main exposition is done in connection with the scalar transient wave equation. The results are then extended to the linear time-domain elastodynamics framework. Linear static governing equations are contained as obvious special cases. Numerical results for crack shape sensitivity computation are presented for two-dimensional time-domain elastodynamics...|$|R
