Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work {{as a challenge to}} the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E

The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E

The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, {{would be capable of}} preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so. The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.|$|E

5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> the greatest disability would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this logic to assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E
5|$|Following Desai's {{resignation}} {{and the fall}} of the Janata government headed by him, Reddy appointed Charan Singh as Prime Minister. This was on the condition that he should prove his majority {{on the floor of the}} House before the end of August. Singh was sworn in on 28 July 1979 but never faced Parliament to prove his majority when Reddy convened it on 20 August. Reddy had appointed him Prime Minister since he had produced a letter claiming to have a parliamentary majority with the support of the opposition Congress Party led by his rival, the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In return for her support, Gandhi demanded that a law establishing special courts to try her and her son Sanjay Gandhi be repealed – a <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> was unacceptable to Charan Singh. Gandhi therefore withdrew her support, forcing Singh to resign. His government lasted 24 days and he never faced Parliament. The convention of appointing a Prime Minister in a hung House but with conditions on time to prove majority was later adopted by President R Venkataraman.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and the conception of national interests, {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the centrality of notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{model of}} {{rational}} belief holds that: (i) an instantaneous snapshot of an ideally rational belief system {{corresponds to a}} probability distribution; and (ii) rational belief change occurs by Bayesian conditionalization. But a priori probability distributions of the Kolmogorov sort cannot distinguish between <b>propositions</b> <b>that</b> are simply true from <b>propositions</b> <b>that</b> are necessarily true. Further, propositions accepted by Bayesian conditionalization become necessary truths of the updated distribution. Thus on this model, once you have accepted a proposition, {{it is impossible to}} change your mind. These problems are not avoided by Jeffrey conditionalization nor by adopting infinitesimal probability values. In contrast, conditional probability distributions are able to distinguish <b>propositions</b> <b>that</b> are simply true from <b>propositions</b> <b>that</b> are necessarily true. However, Bayesian conditionalization as a model of belief change still makes the newly accepted proposition necessarily true, and hence immune to future revision.
