50|$|A clown, Tracy's {{only true}} friend, {{abducted}} Tim. The clown <b>puts</b> him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>port</b> container with seemingly limited air supply, no {{water and food}} supply and a camera connected to <b>a</b> laptop, stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> disc and new clips sent to Forensics everyday show Tim {{trying to create a}} fire to attract the rescuers using friction. But Forensics has only three days to find Tim before he dies of thirst and hunger. Siu-Yau is especially worried and fearful as she has fallen in love with him. The clown is caught, brought to Forensics to be interrogated, but before any information is extracted from him, he kills himself. All seems lost.|$|R
50|$|USS San Jacinto had <b>put</b> <b>in</b> at <b>a</b> <b>port</b> <b>in</b> Cuba, {{looking for}} news of Confederate agents who were {{reported}} to be active in that vicinity. Wilkes received word of Mason and Slidell's presence. It was generally then agreed that a nation at war {{had the right to}} stop and search a neutral merchant ship if it suspected that ship of carrying the enemy's dispatches. Mason and Slidell, Wilkes reasoned, were in effect Confederate dispatches and so he had the right to remove them. On November 8, 1861, he steamed out into the Bahama Channel, fired twice across the bow of the Trent’, sent a boat's crew aboard, seized the Confederate commissioners, and bore them off in triumph to the US, where they were held prisoner in Boston. Wilkes was hailed as a national hero.|$|R
60|$|The Gannet, {{manned by}} seven famine-stricken misogynists, reached London six days later, the skipper obstinately refusing to <b>put</b> <b>in</b> at <b>an</b> {{intermediate}} <b>port</b> to replenish his stock of hardware. The most he would consent {{to do was}} to try and borrow from a passing vessel, but the unseemly behaviour of the master of a brig, who lost two hours owing to their efforts to obtain a saucepan of him, utterly discouraged any further attempts in that direction, and they settled down to a diet of biscuits and water, and salt beef scorched on the stove.|$|R
6000|$|A {{month or}} two later in the diary came {{the account of the}} {{shipwreck}} of the Trondhjem and of the writer's rescue from imminent death. [...] "My first great adventure," [...] the pages were headed. They told how her father, with whom ready-money was a scarce commodity, and who had a passion for small and uncomfortable economies, suddenly determined to save two or three pounds by taking <b>a</b> passage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Norwegian tramp steamboat named the Trondhjem. This vessel, laden with a miscellaneous cargo, had <b>put</b> <b>in</b> at <b>a</b> Northumbrian <b>port,</b> and carried freight consisting of ready-made windows, door-frames, and other wooden house-fittings suited to the requirements of the builders of seaside villas, to be delivered at the rising watering-place of Northwold, upon her way to London. Then followed a description of the voyage, the dirt of the ship, the surpassing nastiness of the food, and the roughness of the crew, whose sailor-like qualities inspired the writer with no confidence.|$|R
5|$|Washington and {{the other}} ships of TF39 participated in {{exercises}} with the Home Fleet until late April. Along with certain British units, the task force departed the British Isles as TF99. They escorted some of the Arctic convoys which were carrying vital cargo to the Soviet Union. While carrying out this duty, an accompanying British battleship, , accidentally rammed a destroyer, cutting it in two. Directly behind King George V, Washington passed through the same stretch of sea and received damage from exploding depth charges. Though damage to the hull was minimal—limited to only one leaking fuel tank—many devices on board the ship were damaged, including main battery range finders, circuit breakers, three fire-control and the search radars. The American ships then <b>put</b> <b>in</b> at <b>an</b> Icelandic <b>port,</b> Hvalfjörður, until 15 May; they returned to Scapa Flow on 3 June. On 4 June, Washington hosted the commander of naval forces in Europe, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, who set up a temporary headquarters on the ship {{for the next few}} days. On 7 June, King George VI of the United Kingdom inspected the battleship.|$|R
60|$|We left, therefore, the Bay of Bengal, {{and coming}} to the coast of Sumatra, we <b>put</b> <b>in</b> at <b>a</b> small <b>port,</b> {{where there was a}} town, {{inhabited}} only by Malays; and here we took in fresh water, and a large quantity of good pork, pickled up and well salted, notwithstanding the heat of the climate, being in the very middle of the torrid zone, viz., in three degrees fifteen minutes north latitude. We also took on board both our vessels forty hogs alive, which served us for fresh provisions, having abundance of food for them, such as the country produced, such as guams, potatoes, and a sort of coarse rice, good for nothing else but to feed the swine. We killed one of these hogs every day, and found them to be excellent meat. We took <b>in</b> also <b>a</b> monstrous quantity of ducks, and cocks and hens, the same kind as we have in England, which we kept for change of provisions; and if I remember right, we had no less than two thousand of them; so that at first we were pestered with them very much, but we soon lessened them by boiling, roasting, stewing, &c., for we never wanted while we had them.|$|R
2500|$|On 24 February 1967, Yorktown {{entered the}} Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a seven-month overhaul. She {{completed}} repairs early in October and, after refresher training, resumed normal west coast operations {{for most of}} what remained of 1967. On 28 December, she stood out of Long Beach, bound for her last {{tour of duty in}} the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in the Far East late in January 1968. Instead of <b>putting</b> <b>in</b> at <b>a</b> Japanese <b>port</b> for turnover Yorktown headed directly to the Sea of Japan to provide ASW and search and rescue (SAR) support for the contingency force assembled {{in the wake of the}} North Korean capture of [...] She remained on that assignment for 30 days. On 1 March, she was released from that duty, and the warship headed for Subic Bay in the Philippines. During the remainder of the deployment, the aircraft carrier did another three tours of duty with TF77 on Yankee Station. In each instance, she provided ASW and SAR support for the fast carriers launching air strikes on targets in Vietnam. She concluded her last tour of duty in Vietnamese waters on 16 June and set a course for Sasebo, Japan where she stopped from 19–21 June before heading back to the United States.|$|R
