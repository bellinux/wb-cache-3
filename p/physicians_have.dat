5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested that this}} condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|Harrisburg Hospital was at {{one time}} located in a four-story complex one block from the town square, but in the 1990s moved to Harrisburg Medical Center where 78 beds and 34 {{physicians}} are on staff. It also has an 18-bed psychiatric area. In 1995, the hospital completed a multimillion-dollar expansion and renovation program. There are 25 nursing homes in the Harrisburg and southeastern Illinois area. Three are located within the city. Harrisburg also has several clinics and specialized <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> offices within the city.|$|E

5|$|Osteopathic <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> {{historically}} entered {{primary care}} fields {{at a higher}} rate than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims to a greater emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E
5|$|Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, {{manipulative}} {{treatment is}} taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions {{for a number}} of disorders and diseases. However, a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT on less than 5% of their patients. The survey follows many indicators that osteopathic <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> become more like M.D. physicians in every respect —few perform OMT, and most prescribe medications or suggest surgery as the first line of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E

5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E

25|$|Medications and {{treatments}} {{are said to}} have a palliative effect if they relieve symptoms without having a curative effect on the underlying disease or cause. This can include treating nausea related to chemotherapy or something as simple as morphine to treat the pain of broken leg or ibuprofen to treat aching related to an influenza (flu) infection. Although the concept of palliative care is not new, most <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> traditionally concentrated on trying to cure people.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis of {{megalencephaly}} {{has changed}} over the years, however, with the development of more advanced equipment, <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> been able to confirm the disorder with better accuracy.

A physician will then take head measurements {{in order to determine the}} circumference. This is known as the head circumference. Then a family background will be recorded in order to determine if there has been a history of megalencephaly in the family.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{its lack}} of {{scientific}} acceptance, HIV/AIDS denialism has had a significant political impact, especially in South Africa under the presidency of Thabo Mbeki. Scientists and <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> raised alarm at the human cost of HIV/AIDS denialism, which discourages HIV-positive people from using proven treatments. Public health researchers have attributed 330,000 to 340,000 AIDS-related deaths, along with 171,000 other HIV infections and 35,000 infant HIV infections, to the South African government's former embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism.

25|$|A {{number of}} <b>physicians</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} that the eponym is undeserved. Dr. Reiter's Nazi Party affiliation, and in particular his involvement in forced human experimentation in the Buchenwald concentration camp (which, after his capture {{at the end of}} World War II, resulted in his prosecution in Nuremberg as a war criminal), have come to overshadow his medical accomplishments. Furthermore, he was not the first physician to make associations between the arthritis and other symptoms: the terms arthritis urethritica, venereal arthritis and polyarteritis enterica had previously been applied, and the full triad was described by another physician in the nineteenth century.|$|E
