40|$|It is {{important}} to properly segregate the different components present in the destination <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> under different labels namely addressee name, house number, street number, extension/area name, destination town name and the like for automatic address reading. This task is {{not as easy as}} it would appear particularly for unstructured <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> such as that are found in India. This paper presents a fuzzy symbolic inference system for <b>postal</b> mail <b>address</b> component extraction and labelling. The work uses a symbolic representation for <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> and a symbolic knowledge base for <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> component labelling. A symbolic similarity measure treated as a fuzzy membership function is devised and is used for finding the distance of the extracted component to a probable label. An alpha cut based de-fuzzification technique is employed for labelling and evaluation of confidence in the decision. The methodology is tested on 500 <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> and an efficiency of 94 % is obtained for address component labeling...|$|R

40|$|The <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> {{data and}} the domain {{information}} for address validation contain qualitative, numeric, interval {{and other types of}} data. The efficient processing of such data required for postal automation needs a robust data structure that facilitates their storage and access. A symbolic data structure is proposed to represent the <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> and the information relevant for validating the <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> is stored in a newly devised symbolic knowledge base. The symbolic representation gives a formal structure to the information and hence is more beneficial than other representations such as frames, which do not reflect the structure inherent in the domain knowledge. The process of <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> validation checks the different components of the <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> for consistency before using it for further processing. In the present work a symbolic knowledge base supported address validation system is developed and tested for about 500 addresses. The system efficiency is observed to be 95. 6 % in validating the addresses automatically...|$|R
40|$|Mapping of <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> to a mail {{delivery}} {{point is a}} very important task that affects the efficiency of postal service. This task is very complex in the countries such as India, where <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> are not structured. Further most of the times the destination addresses in such countries are incomplete, approximate and erroneous which adds to the complexity of mapping <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> to delivery point. Automation of this aspect of the postal service is a challenge. This paper presents a soft computing model to map the <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> to {{mail delivery}} point. Firstly machine readable <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> is processed to identify the address components using a novel fuzzy symbolic similarity analysis, and further these labeled components are organized as a symbolic <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> object. This <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> object is further processed using the newly devised fuzzy symbolic methodology for mapping the address to mail delivery point. Symbolic knowledge bases for <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> component labeling and mail delivery point mapping are devised. Fuzzy symbolic similarity measures are formulated once for address component labeling and the second time for mapping the entire address to a mail delivery point. In sequel to similarity computations, which are viewed as fuzzy membership values, an expert system comprising of alpha-cut de-fuzzification is proposed to evaluate the confidence factors, while inferencing the validity of address component labels and mail delivery points. The system is tested exhaustively and an efficiency of 94 % is obtained in address component identification and about 86 % in mail delivery point mapping, while working on an Indian postal data base of about 500 addresses.

40|$|<b>Postal</b> <b>address</b> {{is one of}} {{important}} data that potentially used for trace, capture and used together with customer demographic, such as location, residential, income level, education level, transportation, and so on. The customer <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> is a touch point to analyzing demographic where it is vital important to the business, especially to prospecting their profitable customer. From literature review survey, the business has been used survey intensively as main sources for gathering demographic infomation about customer, including non-contractual customer, also called non-database customer. However, some problem will rise during joins used of home <b>postal</b> <b>address,</b> specifically, refers to un-match problems between home <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> of non-contractual customer (from the survey) with spatial data address (road and street data). These un-match problems may create un-accurate value in analyzing customer demographic background when current location, of customer takes into account. The objective of the paper is to discuss some issues regarding un-match between home <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> of non-contractual customer and spatial address. Secondly, this study will introduce a procedure on how to solve these problems where at the end results on 100 percents match between these two data. The method {{of this study is}} by using iThoughMap as an application for transforming customer <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> into spatial address. To operating this work, data survey of non-contracting customer will use as a source of home <b>postal</b> <b>address,</b> while road and street data were obtained from government agency. This study will be applied specifically on the location of Seberang Perai, Pulau Pinang in Malaysia. One of result indicates that perfect match between <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> with spatial address bas produced when hundred percent match has resulted. At the end, suggestion will be recommended for future research on how improvising the accuracy, timeliness, and precision of information regarding non- contracting customer by utilizes spatial and non-spatial data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} {{feasibility}} of boostrapping a location service through geocoded <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> rather than the common wardriving technique. A location service that contains the MAC addresses and geographic position of wireless LAN access points enables positioning services for WLAN devices and location-aware networking protocols. This work thus compares the accuracy of access point position estimates obtained based on RF signal strengths readings (wardriving) with {{the accuracy of the}} geocoded <b>postal</b> <b>address.</b> The results show similar accuracy for geocoding in comparison to typical wardriving studies, with significantly reduced effort if <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> of access point positions are known. ...|$|R
