40|$|Software {{integration}} {{is a growing}} area of concern for many programmers and software managers because the need to build new programs quickly from existing components is greater than ever. This includes building versions of software products for multiple hardware platforms and operating systems, building programs from components written in different languages, and building systems from components that must execute on different machines in a distributed network. The goal of software {{integration is}} to make building new programs from existing components more seamless [...] programmers should pay minimal attention to the underlying configuration issues involved. Libraries of reusable components and classes are important tools but only partial solutions to software development problems. Even though software components may have compatible interfaces, {{there may be other}} reasons, such as differences between execution environments, why they cannot be integrated. Often, components must be adapted or reimplemented to fit into another application because of implementation differences [...] they are implemented in different programming languages, dependent on different operating system resources, or must execute on different physical machines. The software packager is a tool that allows programmers to deal with interfaces between software components and ignore complex integration details. The packager takes modular descriptions of the structure of a software system written in the <b>package</b> <b>specification</b> language and produces an integration program {{in the form of a}} makefile. If complex integration tools are needed to integrate a set of components, such as remote procedure call stubs, their use is implied by the packager automatically and stub generation tools are invoked in the corresponding makefile.

Conclusion The adequate setup of an organization's supply and its specification phase activities are indispensible for long-term care providers who aim to do better in terms of quality and efficiency.

40|$|In hard {{real-time}} systems, if computations do not execute {{before their}} explicit deadlines, catastrophic or life-threatening failure may occur. The traditional approach to real-time operating systems {{is to use}} a small set of primitives to obtain predictable response. However, by restricting the available primitives, the flexibility of the user is greatly diminished. ^ There are two areas in which this dissertation increases flexibility for user applications in dynamic, hard real-time environments. The first contribution is the UMass Spring threads <b>package</b> <b>specification,</b> which is unique because of its emphasis on predictability, support for new semantics (2 ̆ 2 guaranteed 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 nonguaranteed 2 ̆ 2 thread group spawning) and explicit support for semantically-correct premature thread (and thread group) termination under hard real-time constraints. Implementation of this threads package in the UMass Spring kernel is discussed. The UMass Spring kernel is a parallel and distributed operating system featuring an on-line, planning-based scheduler that makes it suitable for dynamic environments. The evaluation of the implementation of the threads package in the UMass Spring kernel is discussed both in terms of primitive operations and higher-level system activities. In addition to new flexibility for user and kernel applications, the adoption of the threads package in the UMass Spring kernel significantly reduces kernel overhead in the context switch and memory access time. ^ The second contribution involves multi-level scheduling for real-time systems. Multi-level scheduling consists of scheduling and planning at more than one level of abstraction, generally in terms of time and resources. The contribution of this dissertation is operating system support in the form of dynamic function and timing composition and performance studies that are the first steps towards quantifying the overall performance of the multi-level scheduling system in dynamic, hard real-time environments. Results in a flexible manufacturing domain show that high performance can be achieved if the multiple schedulers have similar performance goals; performance is significantly hindered otherwise. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{semiconductor}} {{industry has been}} driven by Moore 2 ̆ 7 s law for almost half a century. Miniaturization of device size has allowed more transistors to be packed into a smaller area while the improved transistor performance has resulted in a significant increase in frequency. Increased density of devices and rising frequency led, unfortunately, to a power density problem which became an obstacle to further integration. The processor industry responded to this problem by lowering processor frequency and integrating multiple processor cores on a die, choosing to focus on Thread Level Parallelism (TLP) for performance instead of traditional Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP). While continued scaling of devices have provided unprecedented integration, it has also unfortunately led to a few serious problems: The first problem is that of increasing rates of system failures due to soft errors and aging defects. Soft errors are caused by ionizing radiations that originate from radioactive contaminants or secondary release of charged particles from cosmic neutrons. Ionizing radiations may charge/discharge a storage node causing bit flips which may result in a system failure. In this dissertation, we propose solutions for online detection of such errors in microprocessors. A small and functionally limited core called the Sentry Core (SC) is added to the multicore. It monitors operation of the functional cores in the multicore and whenever deemed necessary, it opportunistically initiates Dual Modular redundancy (DMR) to test the operation of the cores in the multicore. This scheme thus allows detection of potential core failure and comes at a small hardware overhead. In addition to detection of soft errors, this solution is also capable of detecting errors introduced by device aging that results in failure of operation. The solution is further extended to verify cache coherence transactions. A second problem we address in this dissertation relate to power concerns. While the multicore solution addresses the power density problem, overall power dissipation is still limited by packaging and cooling technologies. This limits the number of cores that can be integrated for a given <b>package</b> <b>specification.</b> One way to improve performance within this constraint is to reduce power dissipation of individual cores without sacrificing system performance. There have been prior solutions to achieve this objective that involve Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and the use of sleep states. DVFS and sleep states take advantage of coarse grain variation in demand for computation. In this dissertation, we propose techniques to maximize performance-per-power of multicores at a fine grained time scale. We propose multiple alternative architectures to attain this goal. One of such architectures we explore is Asymmetric Multicore Processors (AMPs). AMPs have been shown to outperform the symmetric ones in terms of performance and Performance-per-Watt for a fixed resource and power budget. However, effectiveness of these architectures depends on accurate thread-to-core scheduling. To address this problem, we propose online thread scheduling solutions responding to changing computational requirements of the threads. Another solution we consider is for Symmetric Multicore processors (SMPs). Here we target sharing of the large and underutilized resources between pairs of cores. While such architectures have been explored in the past, the evaluations were incomplete. Due to sharing, sometimes the shared resource is a bottleneck resulting in significant performance loss. To mitigate such loss, we propose the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Boosting (DVFB) of the shared resources. This solution is found to significantly mitigate performance loss in times of contention. We also explore in this dissertation, performance-per-Watt improvement of individual cores in a multicore. This is based on dynamic reconfiguration of individual cores to run them alternately in out-of-order (OOO) and in-order (InO) modes adapting dynamically to workload characteristics. This solution is found to significantly improve power efficiency without compromising overall performance. Thus, in this dissertation we propose solutions for several important problems to facilitate continued scaling of processors. Specifically, we address challenges in the area of reliability of computation and propose low power design solutions to address power constraints...|$|E
