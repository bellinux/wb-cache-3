40|$|Administrators {{have a lot}} of {{influence}} over the nature of youth programs.

This study of administrators in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area suggests that, while some evidence for a more social structural understanding exists, in general the individual problem perspective prevails.

5|$|On 4 March, Richards' partner Anita Pallenberg {{pleaded guilty}} to drug {{possession}} and incurred a fine {{in connection with the}} original airport incident. The drug case against Richards dragged on for over a year. Ultimately, Richards received a suspended sentence and was ordered to play two free concerts for the CNIB in Oshawa; both shows featured the Rolling Stones and the New Barbarians, a group that Wood had put together to promote his latest solo album, and which Richards also joined. This episode strengthened Richards' resolve to stop using heroin. It also ended his relationship with Pallenberg, which had become strained since the death of their third child, Tara. Pallenberg was unable to curb her heroin addiction while Keith struggled to get clean. While Richards was settling his legal and <b>personal</b> <b>problems,</b> Jagger continued his jet-set lifestyle.

The club reached the 2003 Second Division play-off Final, but were defeated 1–0 by Cardiff City at the Millennium Stadium on 25 May 2003.

5|$|Brimsek {{remained}} with the Bruins {{for three more}} seasons. He {{was named to the}} NHL Second All-Star team twice more and was selected to play in the inaugural NHL All-Star Game in 1947. The Bruins made the playoffs all three seasons but were eliminated in the semi-finals in all of them. Brimsek was also a finalist for the Hart Trophy in 1947–48, finishing behind Buddy O'Connor of the Rangers. <b>Personal</b> <b>problems</b> plagued Brimsek during his final years in Boston. His 10-month-old son had died in January 1949, and his coach and longtime teammate, Dit Clapper, had resigned from his coaching duties. It did not also help that the Boston crowd would occasionally boo Brimsek for his play. After the 1948–49 season, Brimsek requested a trade from Boston to Chicago in order to be closer to home, and to the new blueprint business he had started there. Boston granted his request and he was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for cash. Brimsek only played one season with the Black Hawks, recording 22 wins, 38 losses and 10 ties in 70 games played. The team finished last in the standings. Brimsek's lone season with the Hawks was the only season where his team did not reach the playoffs. He retired {{at the conclusion of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{generally}} satisfactory {{situation in}} Venice, Monteverdi experienced <b>personal</b> <b>problems</b> {{from time to}} time. He was on one occasion – probably because of his wide network of contacts – {{the subject of an}} anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he therefore moved him to the University of Bologna. This did not have the required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career – he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church canonry.|$|E

Göring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with epilepsy and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring; her son was taken by his father. Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925. He was violent {{to the point where he}} had to be confined to a straitjacket, but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine. Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry. Hitler, who had written Mein Kampf while in prison, had been released in December 1924. Carin Göring, ill with epilepsy and tuberculosis, died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.|$|E

Third, the purpose of this study was to keep a tally of the types of worries about which the sixth graders sought help from heir guidance counselor. Fourth, the purpose of this study was to compare these findings to information in the existing literature.
