25|$|One {{special case}} {{of this is the}} {{inconsistent}} theory defined by the axiom ∃x ¬x = x. It is a perfectly good theory with many good properties: it is complete, decidable, finitely axiomatizable, and so on. The only <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has no models at all. By Gödel's completeness theorem, it is the only theory (for any given language) with no models. It {{is not the same as}} the theory of the empty set (in versions of first-order logic that allow a model to be empty): the theory of the empty set has exactly one model, which has no elements.|$|E
25|$|A {{less obvious}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is very {{difficult}} to keep such a vehicle moving in a straight line. Although a governor can be used to ensure the two engine speeds are similar, loads on the tracks will not be the same as it moves over different terrain, causing the more heavily loaded track to slow and the tank to turn in that direction. This will cause the tank to wander when moving over uneven ground. This is not an issue at very low speeds, and the system is sometimes used on bulldozers and other tracked construction vehicles. For tanks, considerable driver skill and constant adjustment are needed, even at the relatively low speeds seen on early designs.|$|E
500|$|Kill the Irishman {{contains}} four historical inaccuracies. This {{has been}} noted by critics, one of whom said the film's main <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> seemed [...] "all too willing to sacrifice historical accuracy {{in the name of}} an easy-to-digest narrative". Shondor Birns was murdered on March 29, 1975, whereas in the film this occurs on March 8. The movie also misspells the name of a nearby parish known as 'St. Malachi's'; in the movie it is spelled 'St. Malichy's'.|$|E

The station could not accommodate passenger trains passing through the city without time-consuming back-up moves.

500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, this {{rule of thumb}} came into being, {{developed}} by R. H. Kraft. [...] It was noted from rainfall amounts (in imperial units) reported by the first order rainfall network in the United States that the storm total rainfall fit a simple equation: [...] 100 divided by the speed of motion in knots. [...] This rule works, even in other countries, {{as long as a}} tropical cyclone is moving and only the first order or synoptic station network (with observations spaced about [...] apart) are used to derive storm totals. [...] Canada uses {{a modified version of the}} Kraft rule which divides the results by a factor of two, which takes into account the lower sea surface temperatures seen around Atlantic Canada and the prevalence of systems undergoing vertical wind shear at their northerly latitudes. [...] The main problem with this rule is that the rainfall observing network is denser than either the synoptic reporting network or the first order station networks, which means the absolute maximum is likely to be underestimated. [...] Another <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not take the size of the tropical cyclone or topography into account.|$|E

Rejath R.G of Kerala Kaumudi said, [...] "Renjith has beautifully conceived the film", and praised {{the technical aspects}} with special mention to Kunjunni's camera work and the three [...] "beautiful" [...] songs composed by Sreevalsan. He summarised it as [...] "a watchable good film {{that could have been}} much better if the director paid a little more attention to the screenplay. The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> loses steam here and there particularly in the post-interval sequences". Deccan Chronicle rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and said, [...] "Any of [...] fans, who are exposed to thrillers of Hollywood and Bollywood like Ocean's 11 and Special 26 will lose the thrill soon. There is nothing commendable about the script or cinematography or music", but he praised Mohanlal's action sequences and car chasing scenes, Siddique and his companion's performances, and Mythili and Musthafa's [...] "heart touching" [...] moments. He called the message of the film [...] "socially relevant" [...] and [...] "effective". Akhila Menon of Filmibeat also gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. He praised the performances of Mohanlal and Siddique, but was less enthusiastic about the script, observing that [...] "Ranjith's craft as a filmmaker is visible throughout the movie. But what Loham lacks is his brilliance as a writer".|$|E
500|$|Soon I Will Be Invincible takes characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} {{associated with}} the comic book format and re-casts them using the novel's prose format. This use of superhero fiction in an alternate format was compared to other similar, successful attempts, like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and the TV serial No Heroics. Several reviewers contrasted the novel's elements of realism with Alan Moore's Watchmen and Rick Veitch's Bratpack which portrayed a darker side of more realistic superheroes. Novels cited as being similar included Donald Barthelme's Snow White, Robert Coover's Stepmother, and the works of Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem. The novel format allowed for more character development, which Grossman took advantage of by portraying them as [...] "real, human characters, {{with all of the}} foibles that come with the territory" [...] in what one reviewer called a [...] "hybridization of character and genre". Grossman described it as [...] "a book about real people who happen to be [...] or supervillains" [...] and that if it were a comic, it would be [...] "page after page of thought balloons". Compared to comic stories, the reviewer for the Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote [...] "The common denominator for most superhero comic books is that they don't make fun of themselves - the believability of their stories is never called into question. They take the heroes seriously. Not so in literature. When a novel appears with comic books as its focus, its author will undoubtedly believe that his or her theme is far more important - far more serious - than the comic books that inspired them. ... tries to do it all, combining humor and comic-book adventure with a literary sense of character. ...The result is a postmodern, inventive, comic-book plot with literary aspirations, and its only <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> isn't entirely successful as either humor or as straight adventure." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{problem with}} this {{explanation}} {{can be seen by}} blowing along the bottom of the paper: were the deflection due simply to faster moving air one would expect the paper to deflect downward, but the paper deflects upward regardless of whether the faster moving air is on the top or the bottom. Another problem is that when the air leaves the demonstrator's mouth it has the same pressure as the surrounding air; the air does not have lower pressure just because it is moving; in the demonstration, the static pressure of the air leaving the demonstrator's mouth is equal to the pressure of the surrounding air. [...] A third <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is false to make a connection between the flow on {{the two sides of the}} paper using Bernoulli’s equation since the air above and below are different flow fields and Bernoulli's principle only applies within a flow field.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{problems}} emerge when {{a homeless}} shelter is present. Homeless shelters have been argued by some to {{have a negative effect}} on businesses. Businesses for years have complained that they frequently witness pedestrians being stopped outside their stores by homeless people begging for money.

[...] Another <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is often difficult to decide on where {{a homeless shelter}} should be built and how to zone the area where a shelter can be built. Neighborhoods, as well as schools, argue that homeless shelters bring in bad elements to their surroundings. There are additionally far too many shelters that have become nothing but housing facilities; they fail to provide job training or education that would assist the homeless population with gaining their own housing. Housing through homeless shelters offers no lasting solutions, just temporary ones. Drugs and alcohol also tend to surround homeless shelters. Most shelters prohibit residential use of illegal drugs and alcohol, but enforcement is sporadic in many locations. Lastly, no classification system for shelters has been put into effect. There are no mechanisms or facilities to separate those who have mental illnesses from the rest of the shelter population.|$|E
