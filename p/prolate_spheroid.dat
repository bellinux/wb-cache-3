5|$|Of {{the moons}} {{discovered}} by the Voyager2 imaging team, only Puck was discovered early enough that the probe could be programmed to image it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly <b>prolate</b> <b>spheroid</b> (ratio between axes is 0.97±0.04). Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color. There are three named craters {{on the surface of}} Puck, the largest being about 45km in diameter. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water-ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a <b>prolate</b> <b>spheroid.</b> An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E

25|$|Maclaurin used Newton's {{theory to}} show that a smooth sphere covered by a {{sufficiently}} deep ocean under the tidal force of a single deforming body is a <b>prolate</b> <b>spheroid</b> (essentially a three-dimensional oval) with major axis directed toward the deforming body. Maclaurin was the first to write about the Earth's rotational effects on motion. Euler realized that the tidal force's horizontal component (more than the vertical) drives the tide. In 1744 Jean le Rond d'Alembert studied tidal equations for the atmosphere which did not include rotation.|$|E
25|$|In visible light, the Crab Nebula {{consists}} of a broadly oval-shaped mass of filaments, about 6arcminutes long and 4arcminutes wide (by comparison, the full moon is 30arcminutes across) surrounding a diffuse blue central region. In three dimensions, the nebula {{is thought to be}} shaped like a <b>prolate</b> <b>spheroid.</b> The filaments are the remnants of the progenitor star's atmosphere, and consist largely of ionised helium and hydrogen, along with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, neon and sulfur. The filaments' temperatures are typically between 11,000 and 18,000K, and their densities are about 1,300particles per cm3.|$|E
25|$|Sustained speed may be {{estimated}} by calculating the drag of a simplified {{model of the}} body, that can be approached by a <b>prolate</b> <b>spheroid,</b> and the sustainable level of energy output by the muscles. A first study of this problem was published by Judy Massare in 1988. Even when assuming a low hydrodynamic efficiency of 0.65, Massare's model seemed to indicate that plesiosaurs, if warm-blooded, would have cruised at a speed of four metres per second, or about fourteen kilometres per hour, considerably exceeding the known speeds of extant dolphins and whales. However, in 2002 Ryosuke Motani showed that the formulae that Massare had used, had been flawed. A recalculation, using corrected formulae, resulted in a speed of half a metre per second (1.8km/h) for a cold-blooded plesiosaur and {{one and a half}} metres per second (5.4km/h) for an endothermic plesiosaur. Even the highest estimate is about a third lower than the speed of extant Cetacea.|$|E

2500|$|The Fat Man bomb had two concentric, spherical {{shells of}} high explosives, each about [...] thick. The inner shell drove the implosion. The outer shell {{consisted}} of a soccer-ball pattern of 32 high explosive lenses, each of which converted the convex wave from its detonator into a concave wave matching the contour of the outer surface of the inner shell. If these 32 lenses could be replaced with only two, the high explosive sphere could become an ellipsoid (<b>prolate</b> <b>spheroid)</b> with a much smaller diameter.|$|E

The concentration dependence of the sedimentation rate, the hindered diffusivity and the Theological behaviour of face-centred lattices are examined for concentrations up to regular close packing (74 % by volume). The influence of the detailed microstructure of the dispersion is also investigated by considering different arrangements of parallel ellipsoids.

Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which {{are responsible for the}} color of purple grapes. Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines.

A meridian arc of Jean Picard was extended to a longer arc by Giovanni Domenico Cassini and his son Jacques Cassini [...] over the period 1684–1718. The arc was measured with at least three latitude determinations, so {{they were able to}} deduce mean curvatures for the northern and southern halves of the arc, allowing a determination of the overall shape. The results indicated that the Earth was a <b>prolate</b> <b>spheroid</b> (with an equatorial radius less than the polar radius). [...] To resolve the issue, the French Academy of Sciences (1735) proposed expeditions to Peru (Bouguer, Louis Godin, de La Condamine, Antonio de Ulloa, Jorge Juan) and Lapland (Maupertuis, Clairaut, Camus, Le Monnier, Abbe Outhier, Celsius). The expedition to Peru is described in the French Geodesic Mission article and that to Lapland is described in the Torne Valley article. The resulting measurements at equatorial and polar latitudes confirmed that the earth was best modelled by an oblate spheroid, supporting Newton.|$|E
6000|$|The {{child at}} five, {{unless it is}} colour blind, should know the range of colours by name, and {{distinguish}} them easily, blue and green not excepted; it {{should be able to}} distinguish pink from pale red and crimson from scarlet. [Footnote: There could be a set of colour bands in the book that the English Language Society might publish.] Many children through the neglect of those about them do not distinguish these colours until a very much later age. I think also--in {{spite of the fact that}} many adults go vague and ignorant on these points--that a child of five may have been taught to distinguish between a square, a circle, an oval, a triangle and an oblong, and to use these words. It is easier to keep hold of ideas with words than without them, and none of these words should be impossible by five. The child should also know familiarly by means of toys, wood blocks and so on, many elementary solid forms. It is matter of regret that in common language we have no easy, convenient words for many of these forms, and instead of being learnt easily and naturally in play, they are left undistinguished, and have to be studied later under circumstances of forbidding technicality. It would be quite easy to teach the child in an incidental way to distinguish cube, cylinder, cone, sphere (or ball), <b>prolate</b> <b>spheroid</b> (which might be called [...] "egg"), oblate spheroid (which might be called [...] "squatty ball"), the pyramid, and various parallelepipeds, as, for example, the square slab, the oblong slab, the brick, and post. He could have these things added to his box of bricks by degrees, he would build with them and combine them and play with them over and over again, and absorb an intimate knowledge of their properties, just at the age when such knowledge is almost instinctively sought and is most pleasant and easy in its acquisition. These things need not be specially forced upon him. In no way should he be led to emphasize them or give a priggish importance to his knowledge of them. They will come into his toys and play mingled with a thousand other interests, the fortifying powder of clear general ideas, amidst the jam of play.|$|E

However, Fridman & Polyachenko showed [...] that the critical axis ratio for stability of homogeneous (constant-density) oblate and <b>prolate</b> <b>spheroids</b> was roughly 3:1, not 15:1 as implied by the infinite slab, and Merritt & Hernquist found a similar result in an N-body study of inhomogeneous <b>prolate</b> <b>spheroids</b> (Fig. 1).|$|R

In continuation of these studies, we recall some fundamental properties of the polynomials, and prove some recursive formulae between them.
