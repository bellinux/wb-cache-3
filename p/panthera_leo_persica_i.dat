25|$|Human development, mostly agriculture, has {{replaced}} {{nearly all of}} the original natural vegetation of the Ganges basin. More than 95% of the upper Gangetic Plain has been degraded or converted to agriculture or urban areas. Only one large block of relatively intact habitat remains, running along the Himalayan foothills and including Rajaji National Park, Jim Corbett National Park, and Dudhwa National Park. As recently as the 16th and 17th centuries the upper Gangetic Plain harboured impressive populations of wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), Bengal tigers (Panthera t. tigris), Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), gaurs (Bos gaurus), barasinghas (Rucervus duvaucelii), sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) and Indian lions (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> <b>persica).</b> In the 21st century there are few large wild animals, mostly deer, wild boars, wildcats, and small numbers of Indian wolves, golden jackals, and red and Bengal foxes. Bengal tigers survive only in the Sundarbans area of the Ganges Delta. The Sundarbands freshwater swamp ecoregion, however, is nearly extinct.

40|$|Comparative phylogeography of African savannah mammals shows a {{congruent}} {{pattern in}} which populations in West/Central Africa are distinct from populations in East/Southern Africa. However, for the lion, all African populations are currently {{classified as a}} single subspecies (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> leo), while the only remaining population in Asia {{is considered to be}} distinct (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> <b>persica).</b> This distinction is disputed both by morphological and genetic data. In this study we introduce the lion as a model for African phylogeography. Analyses of mtDNA sequences reveal six supported clades and a strongly supported ancestral dichotomy with northern populations (West Africa, Central Africa, North Africa/Asia) on one branch, and southern populations (North East Africa, East/Southern Africa and South West Africa) on the other. We review taxonomies and phylogenies of other large savannah mammals, illustrating that similar clades are found in other species. The described phylogeographic pattern is considered in relation to large scale environmental changes in Africa over the past 300, 000 years, attributable to climate. Refugial areas, predicted by climate envelope models, further confirm the observed pattern. We support the revision of current lion taxonomy, as recognition of a northern and a southern subspecies is more parsimonious with the evolutionary history of the lion.

30|$|Therefore, {{there is}} a strong need to {{describe}} locus-specific genotyping profile characteristics using DNA from a high-quality source, which has been suggested in the literature to minimize genotyping errors related to allele calling (Matsumoto et al. 2004). This has also been indicated in the guidelines of the ISFG (Gill et al. 20062012). Thus, we describe {{for the first time the}} screening and genotyping profile characteristics of 39 microsatellite markers developed for the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), domestic cat (Felis catus), Asiatic lion (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> <b>persica)</b> and snow leopard using DNA from a high-quality source. Of these, 21 loci are being reported for the first time in the literature for the Bengal tiger. Based on our findings, we suggest a combination of highly polymorphic dinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat loci along with their genotyping profile characteristics for use in population genetic, forensic and non-invasive genetic sampling studies involving the Bengal tiger that will minimize allele calling errors by using locus-specific profile characteristics. Thus, the present study will provide better options in the selection and use of loci in population genetic and forensic studies carried out on Bengal tigers.|$|R

40|$|The Asiatic lion (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> <b>persica)</b> {{exists in}} the wild as a single relict {{population}} of approximately 250 individuals in the protected Gir Forest Sanctuary in western India. In 1981, a species survival plan (SSP) for the Asiatic lion was established by the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums to manage the 200 + descendants of Asiatic lions in captivity in western zoological facilities. This captive population was derived from seven founders. In order to compare the genetic structure of the Gir Forest population {{with that of the}} captive SSP population, a genetic survey of 46 electrophoretic allozyme systems resolved from extracts of lion blood was undertaken by using 29 SSP Asiatic lions and 28 wild-caught or captive-bred lions maintained at the Sakkarbaug Zoo in India but originally derived from the Gir Forest. The Gir lion population was found to be genetically monomorphic at each of 46 allozyme loci. This was in contrast to several African lion (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> leo) populations, which show moderate levels of allozyme variation at the same loci. The SSP lion population was polymorphic at three allozyme loci (IDHI, TF, and PTI) for alleles that were previously found only in African lion populations. Pedigree analysis of the genetic transmission of these three biochemical loci demonstrated that two of the five primary founder animals of the SSP Asiatic lion population (a breeding pair originally imported from the Trivandrum Zoo in southern India) were descendants of the African subspecies. Three other founder animals were pure Asian. A retrospective SSP pedigree analysis of two morphologic characters (prominent abdominal fold and pairing of infraorbital foramen) that are partially diagnostic for <b>persica</b> vs <b>leo</b> was consistent with this conclusion as well.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Estimating {{evolutionary}} {{rates for}} slowly evolving viruses such as papillomaviruses (PVs) {{is not possible}} using fossil calibrations directly or sequences sampled over a time-scale of decades. An ability to correlate their divergence with a host species, however, can provide a means to estimate evolutionary rates for these viruses accurately. To determine whether such an approach is feasible, we sequenced complete feline PV genomes, previously available only for the domestic cat (Felis domesticus, FdPV 1), from four additional, globally distributed feline species: Lynx rufus PV type 1, Puma concolor PV type 1, <b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> <b>persica</b> PV type 1, and Uncia uncia PV type 1. RESULTS: The feline PVs all belong to the Lambdapapillomavirus genus, and contain an unusual second noncoding region between the early and late protein region, which is only present in members of this genus. Our maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that the evolutionary relationships between feline PVs perfectly mirror those of their feline hosts, despite a complex and dynamic phylogeographic history. By applying host species divergence times, we provide the first precise estimates for the rate of evolution for each PV gene, with an overall evolutionary rate of 1. 95 x 10 (- 8) (95 % confidence interval 1. 32 x 10 (- 8) to 2. 47 x 10 (- 8)) nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the viral coding genome. CONCLUSION: Our work provides evidence for long-term virus-host co-speciation of feline PVs, indicating that viral diversity in slowly evolving viruses {{can be used to}} investigate host species evolution. These findings, however, should not be extrapolated to other viral lineages without prior confirmation of virus-host co-divergence. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Rarely human {{communities}} coexist {{in harmony}} with large predators. Most often communities suffer due to predation on their stock while large carnivores suffer losses and at times extirpation due to retaliation. We examine the mechanisms permitting the coexistence of Asiatic lions (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> <b>persica)</b> and pastoral communities (Maldharis) in the Gir forests, India. We monitored six Maldhari settlements between 2005 and 2007 to quantify seasonal livestock holding, density and losses due to predation and other causes. Lion density, estimated by mark recapture, was 15 ± 0. 1 SE/ 100 km(2). Livestock density, estimated by total counts, ranged between 25 /km(2) - 31 /km(2) with buffaloes being most abundant. Average livestock holding of Maldhari families was 33 ± 3 SE. Lions predated mostly on unproductive cattle (30 %). Scat analysis (n = 165), predation events (n = 180) and seven continuous monitoring sessions of 1, 798 hours on four radio-collared lions estimated livestock to contribute between 25 to 42 % of lions' biomass consumptions, of which only 16 % was predated; rest scavenged. With free grazing rights within Gir forests, Maldharis offset 58 ± 0. 2 SE% of annual livestock rearing cost in comparison to non-forest dwelling pastoralists. With government compensation scheme for livestock predation, this profit margin augmented to 76 ± 0. 05 SE%. Lion density was higher in areas with Maldhari livestock in comparison to areas without livestock. Thus, the current lifestyles and livestock holdings of Maldharis seem to be beneficial to both lions and local pastoralists. We conclude {{that a combination of}} strict protection regime for lions, Maldharis' traditional reverence towards lions and the livelihood economics permit the delicate balance of lion-Maldhari coexistence. Indefinite increase in human and livestock population within Gir might upset this equilibrium undermining the conservation objectives. We see no end to compensation programs worldwide as they constitute a crucial element needed for human-carnivore coexistence...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} mammal was cloned, {{the idea of}} using this {{technique}} to help endangered species has aroused considerable interest. However, several issues limit this possibility, including the relatively low success rate at every stage of the cloning process, and the dearth of usable tissues from these rare animals. iPS cells have been produced from cells from a number of rare mammalian species and this is the method of choice for strategies to improve cloning efficiency and create new gametes by directed differentiation. Nevertheless information about other stem cell/progenitor capabilities of cells from endangered species could prove important for future conservation approaches and adds to the knowledge base about cellular material that can be extremely limited. Multipotent progenitor cells, termed skin-derived precursor (SKP) cells, can be isolated directly from mammalian skin dermis, and human cheek tissue has also been shown to be a good source of SKP-like cells. Recently we showed that structures identical to SKPs termed m-SKPs could be obtained from monolayer/ two dimensional (2 D) skin fibroblast cultures. Here we aimed to isolate m-SKPs from cultured cells of three endangered species; giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca); red panda (Ailurus fulgens); and Asiatic lion (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> <b>persica).</b> m-SKP-like spheres were formed from the giant panda buccal mucosa fibroblasts; whereas dermal fibroblast (DF) cells cultured from abdominal skin of the other two species were unable to generate spheres. Under specific differentiation culture conditions giant panda spheres expressed neural, Schwann, adipogenic and osteogenic cell markers. Furthermore, these buccal mucosa derived spheres were shown to maintain expression of SKP markers: nestin, versican, fibronectin, and P 75 and switch on expression of the stem cell marker ABCG 2. These results demonstrate that giant panda cheek skin can be a useful source of m-SKP multipotent progenitors. At present lack of sample numbers means that we can only postulate why we were unable to obtain m-SKPs from the lion and red panda cultures. However the giant panda observations point to the value of archiving cells from rare species, and the possibilities for later progenitor cell derivation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of physiological changes to measurable signs of the behaviour of large cats. The physiological change was the change of hormone level during the oestrus cycle. Eleven numbers of the genus Panthera were observed {{during a period of}} two years in the Berlin - Friedrichsfelde zoo. Main observations took place from December 1996 till March 1997. It was measured the general activity in a period of two hours before feeding. As additionally parameters were investigated: the step frequency two hours, thirty minutes before and immediately after feeding, the clean frequency, the chew frequency, the drink frequency and the breath frequency. The investigations were taken in five pairs of different species: jaguar (Panthera onca), black panther (Panthera pardus), clouded leopard (Panthera pardus japonensis), Sumatra tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) and Indian lion (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> <b>persica).</b> Also a single Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) was investigated. All females, which lived together with a male, had one to two oestrus cycles within the three month observation, where as at the single female an oestrus could not be recognised. It could be found significant changes of activity during the oestrus. The walking activity two hours before feeding decreased significantly during oestrus of the females. Therefor there was a marketable difference between females and males. Males changed their activity only at days with copulation?s and depending on the number of copulation?s. Females decreased their walking activity already one week before oestrus and increased slowly after it. The reason is seen as threefold - change in motivation due to the breeding behaviour, physiological exhausting due to the copulations and the supressing influence of the biochemical reduction product of progesteron. Deviations every 4 weeks of walking activity at the single female tiger could also be recognised although there were no signs for oestrus. The step frequency decreased significantly at all measurements during the oestrus Those changes affected both sex. It was supposed to result from physical exhausting after copulation?s. Changes in the step frequency occurred also at the single female Bengal tiger. They followed the activity changes at one week delay. A significant decrease of clean frequency could not be recognised. Only at one male and one female could be found a significant decrease during the first part of oestrus and increase at the end of oestrus in comparison to the average. A general conclusion for this fact can not be drawn due to irregular measurements of this parameter. During copulation time the chew frequency changed very much depending on the sex. Females chewed much slower, where as males faster. Probably this fact results from change in dominance. The drink frequency could not be measured satisfactoinary. For future investigations an acoustic method followed by a computer analysis is presented. The breath frequency differed significantly during one cycle. Therefore it is suggested to investigate the trend of decreasing averages of breath frequency during oestrus additionally. It can be concluded, that all described activities showed a trend of decrease during oestrus. Further investigations should search for mentioned occurs. It should be compared single and in pair living large cats. Helpful would be the analyses of hormone level at the same time. <br...|$|R

50|$|Mammals:The {{following}} {{descriptions of}} mammals of the Ammiq wetlands {{have all been}} recorded by A Rocha personnel in the Aammiq region from 1997 onwards. The region covered includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the slopes of Mount Barouk. In addition to these, other mammal species are probably present but {{have not yet been}} positively identified. One mammal of interest is the European otter Lutra lutra which was reported in the Aammiq wetlands prior to 1975; its reappearance was confirmed in June 2003. Water buffalos were introduced to the swamp {{in order to maintain the}} health of the vegetation cover and the swamp itself, since buffalo graze wetlands in a more efficient way than other herbivores. The mammals recorded in the region include: southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), wild boar (Sus scrofa). The area was probably also the home of some extinct mammals from Lebanon such as the Asiatic lion (<b>Panthera</b> <b>leo</b> <b>persica),</b> and the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus).Birds:Nearly 260 bird species have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. The Aammiq region includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the sometimes wooded rocky slopes of Mount Barouk.The listing of these birds does not give any idea of their abundance or status. While some of the birds recorded below are residents, others are passage migrants. Some of these, such as the white stork and the lesser spotted eagle, may pass over Aammiq in flocks of hundreds at a time. Other migrants fly over in far smaller numbers. Species include: pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common crane (Grus grus), rock pigeon (Columba livia).Amphibians and reptiles: The amphibians and reptiles listed below have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. As with the other species lists, the Aammiq region is here taken to include not just the valley floor wetlands, which are very rich in reptiles, but also the adjacent farmlands and the rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. Herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, is a specialised field and as yet there has been no systematic A Rocha herpetological survey of this area. Far more species are known to exist in the area than the ones reported.
