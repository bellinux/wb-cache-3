40|$|Parties to {{international}} commercial transactions choose to refer potential disputes to arbitration instead of litigation for different reasons. In {{most of the}} cases an important factor for a decision in favour of arbitration is that {{they want to have a}} potential dispute settled quickly. Even if the dispute resolution through arbitration is often speedier than court proceedings, it still takes a fair amount of time until a final award is rendered. Thus, it might become necessary to obtain <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> to regulate the terms of an ongoing relationship for the duration of the arbitral proceedings, to stabilize matters on a provisional basis or to avoid frustration of the final award. If the need <b>for</b> <b>interim</b> <b>measure</b> arises, the concerned party will be confronted with a bundle of complex legal and tactical questions. The second chapter deals with the question which judicial authority has jurisdiction to order <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> in international arbitral proceedings conducted in Switzerland, respectively with the legislative and contractual framework that must be considered in order to determine the competent authority. As will be explained, arbitral tribunals and state courts may have concurrent jurisdiction to order <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> and thus, the parties will have to decide which authority to apply to. To determine which possibility will be more advantageous in the concrete circumstances they have to compare the two options. Thus, the third chapter is concerned with <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> available to arbitral tribunals, whereas the fourth chapter deals with those available to state courts. In these two chapters the focus is particularly on the variety of <b>interim</b> <b>measures,</b> some procedural aspects and on questions with regard to enforcement.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the role the African and Inter-American human rights systems in {{protecting}} the rights of detainees through <b>interim</b> <b>measures.</b> The need <b>for</b> regional human rights to complement protection {{at the national level}} is all the more pronounced when it comes to detainees, because they oft en lack democratic leverage at the national level. While complementing the universal system, regional systems have the added benefit of closer connection and binding judgments. Because the situation of detainees often requires urgent intervention, <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> are required to ensure that detainees do not suffer undue harm. A comparative survey of <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> in the two regional systems reveals that, while these measures had been issued in both systems, the Inter-American has used them much more frequently. One of the reasons for this difference {{is the fact that the}} Inter-American system does not make the submission of a formal complaint a prerequisite <b>for</b> issuing <b>interim</b> <b>measures.</b> The African Commission should amend its Rules of Procedure to allow for a similar possibility; and it should devote more resources and institutionalize this procedure. Despite the inclusion of collective rights in the African system, the African Commission has infrequently dealt with urgent measures affecting groups of detainees. Both systems suffer from some defects. There is a lack of substantiated reasoning in decisions dealing with <b>interim</b> <b>measures,</b> especially when requests are rejected; information is not made available systematically about the fate of all requests <b>for</b> <b>interim</b> measures; and a lack of compliance besets both systems.

40|$|When {{considering}} a mosquito release programme, {{one of the}} first issues to be addressed is how to eliminate/separate the females. The greatest number of options might eventually be available for those who can use transgenic mosquitoes, but the inherent characteristics of the target species may also provide possibilities <b>for</b> <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> until more efficient methods can be developed. Differences in intrinsic size, in behaviour and in development rate between females and males are often available and useful for sexing. Efficient species-specific systems for eliminating females at the embryo stage have been developed, but most have since been discarded due to lack of use. Ideal systems specifically kill female embryos using some treatment that can be manipulated during production. Such killing systems are far more efficient than using intrinsic sexual differences, but they systems require selectable genetic markers and sex-linkage created by rare random chromosomal rearrangements. While intrinsic sexual differences should not be considered as long-term candidates for the development of robust and efficient sexing approaches, in the absence of these, the accessibility and integration of less efficient systems can provide a stop-gap measure that allows rapid start up with a minimum of investment. The International Atomic Energy Agency is funding over a 5 year period (2013 – 2018) a new Coordinated Research Project on “Exploring Genetic, Molecular, Mechanical and Behavioural Methods of Sex Separation in Mosquitoes” to network researchers and to address the critical need of genetic sexing strains for the implementation of the sterile insect technique (using radiation-sterilised or transgenic male mosquitoes) and for insect incompatibility technique programmes against disease-transmitting mosquitoes...|$|R

40|$|Arbitration is {{a private}} method of dispute {{resolution}} used mostly in commercial relationships. It provides the parties {{an efficient way to}} finally resolve their disputes outside national courts. This study presents the basic principles of international arbitration focusing on the interaction between arbitral tribunals and national courts. It is not always clear which one has the jurisdiction on certain issues and in some cases the parties may face the risk of being involved in parallel <b>proceedings.</b> The basis <b>for</b> international arbitration is the arbitration agreement, from which the jurisdiction of the tribunal is derived. Without an agreement there cannot be any jurisdiction on the arbitrators to decide the issue. The most controversial situations are when the other party contests the validity or existence of the arbitration agreement and therefore the jurisdiction of the tribunal. The principle of separability of the arbitration agreement from the main contract helps to define jurisdiction in these situations. The study is structured to present some distinct features of arbitration as the basic rules related to arbitration agreement and the general principles governing the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards under the New York Convention. An award would have no significance if it could not be enforced where needed. Through the widely accepted New York Convention arbitral awards are presumed to be enforceable, and the enforcement can be denied only on specified grounds. Enforcement is the main task of national courts concerning international arbitration. Tribunals and courts both have certain jurisdiction in arbitration based on international principles and national legislation. The tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction; this principle of competence-competence helps to define jurisdictional questions in unclear situations together with the principle of separability. A request may also be made to a national court concerning the jurisdiction of the tribunal, in which case the court must determine whether it decides the issue and in which extent, or whether it refers the parties to arbitration. National courts always have the final word on jurisdictional issues. Interests of the parties may need protection before the tribunal is constituted, which can be done by applying <b>for</b> <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> of protection. <b>Interim</b> <b>measures</b> may be ordered by the tribunal or a court depending on what kind of measures are needed and when. From a special emergency arbitrator parties may apply for protective measures before the constitution of the tribunal, this is otherwise possible only from national courts.

The proposed remedial technology for this project is the installation of five large-diameter boreholes (LDBs) in a source area that has been identified on the property formerly used for grain storage by the Commodity Credit Corporation of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (CCC/USDA). The goal of the LDB technology is the remediation of the source area by removal of mass quantities of contaminated soil from the vadose zone and treatment of any remaining contaminated soils that are adjacent to the source area to achieve a carbon tetrachloride concentration below 200 {micro}g/kg. Secondary to the soil remediation is the remediation of groundwater at and adjacent to the source areas. The LDB technology serves the following purposes: (1) The physical removal of contaminated soil from the identified source area. (2) Replacement of less permeable native materials (silty clay, clayey silt, and silty sand) with more permeable materials to facilitate the capture of volatilized contaminants in the vertical borehole. (3) Removal of contaminants volatilized by air sparging (AS) and extracted from the vadose zone by soil vapor extraction (SVE). (4) Volatilization of contaminants from portions of the affected aquifer that can be accessed from the former CCC/USDA property. The primary objective of the proposed removal action is removal of mass quantities of carbon tetrachloride from the vadose zone and treatment of any remaining contaminated soils that are adjacent to the source area, to achieve a carbon tetrachloride concentration below 200 {micro}g/kg. This objective will be the basis for evaluating system performance. The scope of action outlined in the IMWP/D is limited to the five treatment zones defined by the LDB/SVE/AS locations. Surrounding soils and groundwater will benefit; however, remedial benefits to groundwater will be limited to the area of influence associated with the five treatment zones.
