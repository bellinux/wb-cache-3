But, though his <b>physical</b> <b>cure</b> was somewhat advanced, the prostration of his mind seemed susceptible of no relief. The services of the Church accorded with his depressed condition; {{they were the only}} events of his life, and he cherished them. His attendants now permitted and even encouraged him to speak; but he seemed entirely incurious and indifferent. Sometimes they read to him, and he listened, but he never made remarks. The works which they selected had a religious or ecclesiastical bias, even while they were imaginative; and it seemed difficult not to be interested by the ingenious fancy by which it was worked out, that every thing that was true and sacred in heaven had its symbol and significance in the qualities and accidents of earth.|$|E

[...] The ideal survivor is bravely committed to mainstream medicine and optimistic or even certain of a <b>physical</b> <b>cure.</b> He or she is open about diagnosis and treatment and becomes an educated, empowered medical consumer. The ideal survivor, like a superwoman who simultaneously manages her home, family, and career, struggles valiantly to prevent cancer from affecting loved ones by appearing, behaving, and working as much as possible. Once the immediate crisis is past, the person may feel strongly pressured to donate time, money, and energy to cancer-related organizations. Above all, the ideal survivor does not die of cancer. People who publicly conform to this ideal are given social status and respect.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Butterfield, {{a former}} student, recounted in a memoir: Tenzin offered {{to explain his}} {{behavior}} at a meeting which I attended. Like all of his talks, this was considered a teaching of dharma, and donations were solicited and expected. So I paid him $35.00 to hear his explanation. In response to close questioning by students, he first swore us to secrecy (family secrets again), and then said that Trungpa had requested him {{to be tested for}} HIV in the early 1980s and told him to keep quiet about the positive result. Tendzin had asked Trungpa what he should do if students wanted to have sex with him, and Trungpa's reply was that as long as he did his Vajrayana purification practices, it did not matter, because they would not get the disease. Tendzin's answer, in short, was that he had obeyed the guru." [...] Butterfield noted, Tendzin's account of his conversations with Trungpa was challenged by other senior disciples, who claimed Trungpa would never have led anyone to believe that the laws of nature could be suspended by practice." [...] Butterfield also wrote, [...] "it was a difficult dilemma: if you chose to believe Tendzin, then Trungpa had simply been wrong in telling him he could not transmit the disease [...] [...] but what then became of the axiom that the guru cannot make a mistake? But if you chose to disbelieve Tendzin, then Trungpa may have been wrong in allowing him to remain Regent, or perhaps in choosing him at all... I heard Tendzin's illness explained by his servants in this way: it was not a consequence of any folly or self-indulgence on his part, but the karma of his infected partners, that he had deliberately imbibed for them. In what way they benefitted was never made clear to me, although one could safely assume the benefits did not include <b>physical</b> <b>cure.</b>|$|E

40|$|What Nightingale {{spent most}} of her effort at {{battlefield}} was not the struggles against inadequate facility of hospital, rapid spread of infectious diseases or rough behaviors of soldiers. It was the British Army which was on the same side as her at the point of battle. In the British Army, commanding officers were greatly obsessed with their own conservative status. Governors rejected any new idea and soldiers only kept supply without thinking of the use of it. Also people around Nightingale were neither cooperative with her work. For example, sisters who believed that spiritual relief comes before <b>physical</b> <b>cure</b> and former nurses at the hospital, obstructed her all new attempts with intolerance. Generally speaking, betrayal and conspiracy of the same side led to the defeat in the battle. On the other hand, after experiencing several wars such as War of Independence and Civil War, American people learned what would become of struggle and fight. This leads to the attitudes to accept new things and U. S. A succeeded in consisting a nation with people who have different cultures and backgrounds. Thus it was easy for Adams to begin the new social project in Chicago. Their achievement did not only affect forming the education of nursing and settlement movements but reforming society with new attempts.

40|$|Udder {{health is}} usually {{considered}} as a health and economic problem for farmers. We now consider that mastitis {{is the result of}} many factors related to the environment, the pathogen and the host. What may have been forgotten in the process is the fact that nowadays, the main interface with mastitis is the farmer, and their knowledge about mastitis is very heterogeneous. This reflexion has {{led to the creation of}} a technical and pedagogical pack called “Mammipack” which contains different tools, from all actors of the dairy chain. We included small charts explaining the most important risk factors identified through epidemiology, good dairy practices and its effect on milk flow, milking machine check-up, how-to for mastitis milk sample, a how-to for performance records use for udder health management, a resume on genetic selection of sires and mastitis, charts upon nutrition factors and their main effect on udder physiology during lactation and dry-off, resume on veterinary drugs good management in the farm. Small laminated sheets upon milk sampling for bacteriology and teats evaluation were also joined in order to be use in parlors, sterile sampling tubes were also given in the pack. A mastitis record pad was designed to record the main clinical forms and the treatment chosen. Eventually, the book Udder Health® was added to have a complete modern look on that problem in dairy farms. 25 farmers were selected on a voluntary base by 12 veterinarians, and they answered to questionnaires about their main practices regarding herd structure, mastitis treatment, and southern Belgium main 19 risk factors. They had to answer basic questions concerning udder health on 15 points. They agreed to keep a record of all next mastitis cases in their farms and take milk samples for bacteriology each time at day 0 and day 21 during 3 months. The main objective is to show to a group of dairy farmers that mastitis could take several different forms from one farm to another, in term of incidence, pathogens and clinical forms. One other purpose is to show the difficulty to have bacteriological cure, even when <b>physical</b> <b>cure</b> has happened. After all, one collateral objective was to create the Mammipack®, designed for farmers and vets to increase their ability to collaborate on mastitis management through most dairy chain actors’ expertise.
