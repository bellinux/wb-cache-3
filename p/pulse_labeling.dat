40|$|The {{mechanism}} for acute hypercalcaemia increasing pancreatic enzyme secretion is unknown. To determine if raised extracellular calcium concentrations can directly stimulate pancreatic enzyme output, we measured discharges of <b>pulse</b> <b>labelled</b> protein and chymotrypsin from isolated cat pancreatic lobules {{in the presence}} of normal and raised calcium concentrations. Incubation in 5. 0 mmol/l calcium increased discharges of <b>pulse</b> <b>labelled</b> protein (four fold), chymotrypsin (2. 5 fold) and amylase (2. 2 fold), compared with control experiments with 2. 5 mmol/l calcium (p less than 0. 001). This effect was similar to the maximal effect of carbachol or caerulein. Compared with 5. 0 mmol/l calcium, incubation at the higher calcium concentration of 10. 0 mmol/l induced similar discharges of chymotrypsin and amylase, whereas the increase in discharge of <b>pulse</b> <b>labelled</b> protein was smaller (p less than 0. 01). The effects of raised calcium were not altered by atropine. Incubation in a high calcium medium did not impair pancreatic acinar response to subsequent stimulation with carbachol, but incubation in hypothermia abolished the effects of high calcium concentrations, suggesting that increased enzyme discharge is caused by stimulation of secretion not to cell damage. These data are consistent with a direct stimulatory effect of raised extracellular calcium concentrations on pancreatic acinar cell function...|$|R

Moreover, there is no consistent way of data analysis to date. In this study we compare with the same experimental setup the two main techniques: <b>pulse</b> and continuous <b>labelling.</b> We evaluate how these techniques perform to estimate the C transfer time, the C partitioning along time and the C residence time in different plant-soil compartments. We used identical plant-soil systems (Populus deltoides × nigra, Cambisol soil) to compare the <b>pulse</b> <b>labelling</b> approach (exposure to 99 atom % 13 CO 2 for three hours, traced for eight days) with a continuous labelling (exposure to 10 atom % 13 CO 2, traced for 14 days). The experiments were conducted in climate chambers under controlled environmental conditions. Before label addition and at four successive sampling dates, the plant-soil systems were destructively harvested, separated into leaves, petioles, stems, cuttings, roots and soil and soil microbial biomass was extracted. The soil CO 2 efflux was sampled throughout the experiment. To model the C dynamics we used an exponential function to describe the 13 C signal decline after <b>pulse</b> <b>labelling.</b> For the evaluation of the 13 C distribution during the continuous labelling we applied a logistic function. <b>Pulse</b> <b>labelling</b> is best suited to assess the minimum C transfer time from the leaves to other compartments, while continuous labelling can be used to estimate the mean transfer time through a compartment, including short-term storage pools. The C partitioning between the plant-soil compartments obtained was similar for both techniques, but the time of sampling had a large effect: shortly after labelling the allocation into leaves was overestimated and the soil 13 CO 2 efflux underestimated. The results of belowground C partitioning were consistent for the two techniques only after eight days of labelling, when the 13 C import and export was at equilibrium. The C mean residence times estimated by the rate constant of the exponential and logistic function were not valid here (non-steady state). However, the duration of the accumulation phase (continuous labelling) could be used to estimate the C residence time. <b>Pulse</b> and continuous <b>labelling</b> techniques are both well suited to assess C cycling. With <b>pulse</b> <b>labelling,</b> the dynamics of fresh assimilates can be traced, whereas the continuous labelling gives a more integrated result of C cycling, due to the homogeneous labelling of C pools and fluxes.

However, large knowledge gaps exist {{in terms of}} how drought events influence the short-term ecosystem carbon cycle. Here, we present results from 13 CO 2 <b>pulse</b> <b>labeling</b> experiments at an intensively managed lowland grassland in Switzerland. We investigated the effect of extreme summer drought on the short-term coupling of freshly assimilated photosynthates in shoots to roots as well as to soil CO 2 efflux. Summer drought was simulated using rainout shelters during two field seasons (2010 and 2011). Soil CO 2 efflux and its isotopic composition were measured with custom-built chambers coupled to a quantum cascade laser spectrometer (QCLAS-ISO, Aerodyne Research Inc., MA, USA). During the 90 min <b>pulse</b> <b>labeling</b> experiments, we added 99. 9 atom % 13 CO 2 to the grass sward. In addition to the isotopic analysis of soil CO 2 efflux, this label was traced over 31 days into bulk shoots, roots and soil. Drought reduced the incorporation of recently fixed carbon into shoots and increased carbon allocation below-ground relative to total tracer uptake. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find a change in allocation speed in response to drought, although drought clearly reduced soil CO 2 efflux rates. 19 days after <b>pulse</b> <b>labeling,</b> only about 60 % of total tracer uptake was lost via soil CO 2 efflux under drought compared to about 75 % under control conditions.

40|$|Synthesis of {{bacterial}} membranes {{has been investigated}} in Bacillus subtilis by examining incorporation of amino acids and glycerol into the protein and lipid of membranes of synchronous cultures. A simple reproducible fractionation scheme divides cellular proteins into three classes (i) truly cytoplasmic, (ii) loosely membrane bound, released by chelating agents, and (iii) tightly membrane bound. These comprise approximately 75, 10, and 15 %, respectively, of cellular proteins in this organism. Incorporation of radioactivity into these fractions, using steady-state and <b>pulse</b> <b>labeling</b> has been followed during the cell cycle. Cytoplasmic proteins and the loosely membrane-bound proteins are labeled at an exponential rate throughout the cell cycle. The membrane fraction is labeled discontinuously in the cell cycle, with periods of rapid synthesis over {{the latter part of}} the cycle and a period with no net synthesis during the early part of the cycle. <b>Pulse</b> <b>labeling</b> indicates that synthesis of membrane occurs at a linear rate that doubles at a fixed time in each cycle, which coincides with the period of zero net synthesis. Rates of membrane synthesis measured by <b>pulse</b> <b>labeling</b> during the period of rapid membrane synthesis are significantly less than indicated by steady-state labeling. These discrepancies are consistent with the hypothesis that during the cell cycle certain proteins are added to the membrane from the cytoplasm and that during the period of zero net synthesis there is an efflux of proteins from the membrane. Evidence in favor of this has been presented. The activity of succinic dehydrogenase (a representative of class c) varies in a step-wise manner with periods of rapid increase, approximately coincident with bursts of membrane protein synthesis, alternating with periods without any increase in activity.
