40|$|Single-step {{synthesis}} of ultra-fine barium titanate powder with a crystallinity {{as high as}} 90 % and without barium carbonate contamination has been successfully performed under supercritical conditions using a continuous-flow reactor in the temperature range 150 – 380 °C at 16 MPa. To synthesize this bimetallic oxide, alkoxides, ethanol and water were used. The influence of the synthesis parameters on the BaTiO 3 powder characteristics was investigated. The {{results show that the}} water to alkoxide precursor ratio, the reactor temperature and the Ba:Ti molar ratio of alkoxide precursor {{play a major role in}} the crystallization of pure and well-crystallized BaTiO 3 nanoparticles. The continuous mode of operation without post-treatments for <b>powder</b> <b>washing,</b> drying or crystallization increase the industrial interest...|$|E
