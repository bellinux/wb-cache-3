25|$|Typically, for {{a smaller}} {{executive}} car, there is ample room up front for the driver and passenger to sit comfortably, with very comfortable seats. However, rear seat passengers may find the design restrictive in overall room. The 156 Sportwagon features the addition of fold down rear seats which increases the luggage area normally covered by a <b>privacy</b> <b>screen.</b> Ideally the 156 is a car for four people, rather than five, although later models did add a full centre seatbelt {{in place of the}} lap belt in earlier models.|$|E

50|$|This shrub is a common, drought-tolerant {{and fairly}} hardy {{landscaping}} plant. Many cultivars have been developed, including dwarf forms {{and the popular}} 'Variegata', which has variegated leaves.

Here, visitors are greeted at a secondary shelter or pavilion, work on gardens (hoggos) is organized, children spend the day in play and work if of age, and afternoon prayers, naps, conversations, and meals occur until dark. Zone 6 is the outside world.|$|E

A roller blind was fitted to the rear window as an anti-glare mechanism (not a <b>privacy</b> <b>screen</b> as many think).|$|E
50|$|A monitor filter is an {{accessory}} to the computer display to filter out the light reflected from the smooth glass surface of a CRT or flat screen display {{as well as the}} radiation emitted from CRT and LCD displays. Many also include a ground to dissipate static buildup. A secondary use for monitor filters is privacy as they decrease the viewing angle of a monitor, preventing it from being viewed from the side; in this case, they are also called <b>privacy</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R

40|$|With the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) of 2000, {{hundreds}} {{of public and}} school libraries in the United States have implemented internet filters. While filtering can keep children from viewing inappropriate Internet materials, the use of filters in public libraries infringes on the intellectual freedom of library users. Over-blocking and under-blocking are negatively affecting open research and use of online resources, bringing about profession-wide discussions about emerging technological changes in libraries. This essay examines these discussions and advocates for an approach incorporating <b>privacy</b> <b>screens</b> or recessed monitors, the establishment of clear Internet use policies, and better user education to help maintain the role of libraries as valued centers for free self-education and learning...|$|R

During the acquisition of Targus, the managing director at Fenway Partners, Timothy Mayhew, was quoted saying; ‚ÄúTargus has many of the elements Fenway looks for, including a leading market position, a diversified revenue base with high barriers to entry, strong free cash flow and dynamic industry characteristics. Targus was the original creator of carrying cases for portable computers and have since expanded into multiple electronics accessories including; backpacks, locks, keyboards and keypads, <b>privacy</b> <b>screens,</b> to name a few, and most recently with their acquisition of Sena, a high quality leather case maker, into the market of cases for smart phones.|$|R
50|$|After Senator Palpatine of Naboo became Chancellor, he {{increased}} {{the power of}} the office from acting as commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic to the institution of his personal bodyguard, the Red Guard. The rights of many, including the Galactic Senate, were relinquished in the name of security. The removal of <b>privacy</b> <b>screens</b> in the Galactic Senate, which allowed senators to discuss issues before the Senate in private, resulted in many senators afraid to voice their response to a vote because of the installed surveillance hovercams listening in on every word and reporting to the Senate Security Chief. The Galactic Senate also met less often, as the Chancellor was voted more emergency powers to act on his own.|$|R
50|$|The {{main house}} has a steeply-pitched gabled roof covered in {{galvanised}} corrugated iron. There are early hipped, concave, corrugated-iron verandah roofs to the upper level verandahs. The single-storey rear extension {{on the west side}} has a hipped roof, and the single-storey extension to the east side has a mono-pitch roof, both covered in corrugated galvanised iron. There is a central brick chimney rising above the main roof, and resting on stone foundations. The front verandahs have timber posts with decorative capitals and fretwork brackets. On the lower level the timber balustrade has simple timber dowel in-fill and there is a timber lattice valance. Two of the bays are in-filled with timber lattice <b>privacy</b> <b>screens.</b> The first floor has a cast iron balustrade.|$|R

Throughout the entire competition, Smiley and New York were the runaway leaders in terms of points accumulated. For the final part of the challenge, Smiley does a very erotic dance (which is not censored on the DVD). New York attempts an erotic dance and nearly falls through the <b>privacy</b> <b>screen</b> (so Flav could not tell who was who). Due to New Yorks gaffe, Smiley wins, and she spends time with Flav in his hot tub.|$|E
50|$|Exterior {{shutters}} were vital elements on {{homes in}} the colonies. The expense of the shutters and their associated hardware was easily justified. There were no organized police forces; each man's home was truly his own castle to defend. With stout shutters securely locked from within, {{the windows of the}} home offered no easy access to marauding Indians or urban burglars. Which is why you often see raised panel shutters {{on the ground floor of}} early homes and louvered above. The raised panels were much more secure against access from ground level and the louvered upstairs shutters were often later additions to the home. Exterior shutters also proved a first barrier against the elements - winter winds and summer sun alike. In the cities shutters also provided <b>privacy</b> <b>screens</b> between the residents and the considerable pedestrian traffic only feet away. Shutters were in constant use, opened and closed daily.|$|R
40|$|In {{many parts}} of the United States, the {{constant}} force of the wind exaggerates daily weather conditions and can make living in these areas seem unbearable. A well-designed windbreak around the home, ranch, or farmstead slows the wind and improves the overall environment. Farm and ranch windbreaks conserve energy, provide snow control, improve working and recreational environments, enhance wildlife populations, provide visual screening and dust control, and increase the production of various wood and food products. Ranch and farmstead windbreaks provide the greatest benefits in areas with high winds, large amounts of snow, extreme temperature fluctuations, or minimal natural forest cover. Traditionally, the most extensive use of ranch and farmstead windbreaks in the United States is in the Western, North Central, and Great Plains regions. However, windbreak use for <b>privacy</b> <b>screens,</b> dust control, and noise reduction as well as wind protection are important throughout the country...|$|R
30|$|Privacy {{presents}} {{a major challenge}} {{in the use of}} public or semi-public displays as part of a mobile multi-device ecosystem [68]. We can consider such forms of social interaction with technology at different scales from inch (cm) to chain (several m) and beyond [8]. Personal devices overcome the privacy challenge by use of private environments, use at an intimate distance, <b>privacy</b> <b>screens</b> or non-visual modalities. Questions arise when we consider how we might share content on intimate displays [69, 70], at varying scales, different social interaction types or even share content spanning multiple private displays. For example, users might be reluctant to surrender the possession of their smartphone in group binding situations [71]. We can differentiate between personal and public privacy. Personal privacy describes the challenges faced when using personal display elements in a mobile multi-device environment. Public privacy describes the challenges faced when using semi-public and public display elements in a mobile multi-device environment.|$|R
