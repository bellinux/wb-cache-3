50|$|The Mamiya 6 MF was {{introduced}} in 1993. It includes an adapter that allows 6×4.5 cm formatted images to be produced. However, {{the number of images}} per roll remains the same because images are horizontally oriented. An optional <b>panoramic</b> <b>adapter</b> allows 24×54 mm images to be captured on 35 mm film. The two new features added additional lines to the viewfinder.|$|E
50|$|The radio {{spectrum}} scope (also radio panoramic receiver, <b>panoramic</b> <b>adapter,</b> pan receiver, pan adapter, panadapter, panoramic radio spectroscope, panoramoscope, panalyzor and band scope) {{was invented by}} Marcel Wallace and measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within one or more radio bands - e.g. shortwave bands. A spectrum scope is normally a lot cheaper than a spectrum analyzer, because the aim is not high quality frequency resolution - nor high quality signal strength measurements.|$|E
50|$|The Mamiya 7 has a coupled {{viewfinder}} window which displays frame lines {{appropriate to}} the lens mounted, but only for the 65 mm, 80 mm, and 150 mm lenses. The 43 mm and 50 mm lenses require an external viewfinder to be inserted into the hot shoe for composition. There is no composition aid for the 210 mm lens. The camera has a built-in dark slide that allows the manual-focusing electronic leaf shutter lenses to be changed with film in the camera. It can operate in auto exposure, auto exposure lock, and manual modes. It captures ten 6 cm × 7 cm images on 120 film rolls, and 20 on 220 film. The camera also features a self-timer, hot shoe, and flash synchronization terminal. An optional <b>panoramic</b> <b>adapter</b> allows 24×65 mm images to be captured on 35 mm film.|$|E
