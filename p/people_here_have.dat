For example, {{in the community of}} Dzitnup, in the municipality of Valladolid, the Maya <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> their own variation. In addition to the laying the child in the manger, there is a dance called “Abraham and Isaac.” This dance includes people who play the two main characters as well as devils. [...] The dance is accompanies by a pre-Hispanic wind instrument called a “tunkul,” which is similar to the “teponatli” used in other states such as Guerrero and Puebla.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{government}} banned protests, the National Front for the Defence of Democracy {{went ahead with}} its planned protest in Nouakchott on October 5. The protest began {{with a small group}} numbering a few dozen; the police asked the group to disperse, but it grew larger, with participants chanting anti-junta slogans and carrying pictures of Abdallahi. The police then responded with tear gas, breaking up the protest. Subsequently the protesters attempted smaller gatherings at various places in Nouakchott, and the police worked to disperse these as well. According to UFP President Mohamed Ould Mouloud, the [...] "protests constitute a scathing denial of the junta's pretence that the situation in Mauritania is calm, that everybody accepts the coup and that <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> freedom of expression and live in a democracy". State media ignored the protests, as it also ignored the passing of the AU's October 6 deadline. A spokesman for the pro-junta parliamentary majority said that the AU ultimatum [...] "doesn't scare anybody". Mouloud, acting as spokesman for the National Front for the Defence of Democracy, called for [...] "the immediate implementation of sanctions against the junta". Ping said that the junta sent a delegation on October 6 to hold talks with the AU.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I don't {{think the}} English {{can do much}} here,' said the Consul, shaking his head. 'What have we to give them in exchange? The <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>had</b> better look to Austria, {{if they wish to}} thrive. The Austrians also have cottons, and they are Christians. They will give you their cottons, and take your crucifixes.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] {{answered}} Deane. [...] "You see, you <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> {{taken to}} lunching so early nowadays. You {{make it hard}} for a man to get through any work at all in the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] said Mrs Carbonel, [...] "the <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> far {{too much}} good sense to want to molest their best friends. They quite admire our threshing-machine; and see what a saving of labour it is!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even in Alexandria, our countrymen suffered. Breaking {{out into}} a quarrel with the Greeks, a tumult arose; and Tiberias Alexander, the governor--by faith a Jew--tried to pacify matters; but the madness which <b>had</b> seized the <b>people,</b> <b>here,</b> <b>had</b> fallen also upon the Jews of Alexandria. They heaped abuse upon Alexander, who was forced to send the troops against them. The Jews fought, but vainly; and fifty {{thousand}} men, women, and children fell.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have reason}} to be {{grateful}} indeed, Nat, to the forethought of those who have gone before me; it is strange that the same idea did not occur to others. One can see now that our <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> been living in a fool's paradise, totally oblivious of the fact that a volcano might at any moment open under their feet. Are you going to remain here?" ...|$|E

50|$|According {{to sources}} {{of our old}} generation, Gurholi village name {{is derived from the}} then native gurav people. Gurav is one {{community}} in Hindu religion.About 200 year ago near 1800 A.D. Konde people came to this place from Khed Shivapur area. Native Gurav people allowed them to live here.

60|$|And {{there was}} the silence of death about it: the {{solitude}} of a lonesome wild. No wonder that letters addressed to <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>had</b> never received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by conflagration: but how kindled? What story belonged to this disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as property? If so, whose? Dreadful question: {{there was no one}} here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute token.|$|R

And yet how {{thoroughly}} he {{has caught}} the note that catches a public who think with their boots and read with their elbows! The cold-blooded insolence of the work almost saves it; but he mustn't go on with this. Hasn't he been praised and cockered up too much? You know these <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> no sense of proportion. They'll call him a second Detaille and a third-hand Meissonier while his fashion lasts. It's windy diet for a colt.' ...|$|E

It's only {{a little}} unfortunate, because your {{stepmother}} says she won't think of our going back to America till these <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> given me a title. She wants to put one over on her sister. That's all that's troubling me, the thought that this affair will set us back, this Lord Percy being in so strong with the guys who give the titles. I guess it will mean my staying on {{here for a while}} longer, and I'd liked to have seen another ball-game. Jimmy, do you know they call baseball Rounders in this country, and children play it with a soft ball!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed I will. We {{all have}} our burdens to bear. It is a hard world, and we must bear them. And {{it will all be}} the same in the end, in just a few years. I daresay these dead <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> felt as we feel, and how quiet they are! And perhaps there may be {{something}} beyond, where things are not so. Who can say? You won't go away from this place, Harold, will you? Not until I am married at any rate; perhaps you had better go then. Say that you won't go till then, and you will let me see you sometimes; it is a comfort to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} told," [...] said the hermit to Nigel, {{as they went}} down with Moses {{to the place where}} the canoe had been left, [...] "the history of Krakatoa since we left. A friend informs me that a short time after our {{departure}} the eruptions subsided a little, and the <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>had</b> ceased to pay much attention to them, but about the middle of June the volcanic activity became more violent, and on the 19th, in particular, it was observed that the vapour-column and the force of the explosions were decidedly on the increase." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{found several}} of these people had little bits of gold about them; but when we made signs to them {{to know where they}} got it, and where it might be had, they made signs to us, {{pointing}} to the country {{on the north side of}} the river; so that we had, it seems, fallen upon the right gold coast in our first coming. They pointed indeed likewise to some very high mountains, which we saw at a great distance south-west, so that it seems as if there was gold found that way also; but it appeared the <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>had</b> not much of it for their share.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "the {{life you}} <b>people</b> lead <b>here</b> <b>has</b> its attractions; {{they must be}} strong to you. It {{would be hard to}} break with all its associations, to face one that was new and different; I mean for a woman to do so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The working <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> had a {{hard time}} during the last year," [...] she went on. [...] "Some of the mills had to be shut down, you know. It has troubled me. Indeed, it has troubled all of us. And what has made it more difficult, more painful is that many of them seem {{actually}} to dislike us. They think it's father's fault, and that he could run all the mills if he wanted to. I've been around a little with mother and sometimes the women wouldn't accept any help from us; they said they'd rather starve than take charity, that they had the right to work. But father couldn't run the mills at a loss--could he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. You see, this {{doing good}} to the world by driblets amounts to just nothing. I am for doing {{good to the}} world with a will. I am for doing good to the world once for all and having done with it. Do but think, my dear sir, of the eddies and maëlstroms of pagans in China. <b>People</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> no {{conception}} of it. Of a frosty morning in Hong Kong, pauper pagans are found dead in the streets like so many nipped peas in a bin of peas. To be an immortal being in China is no more distinction than to be a snow-flake in a snow-squall. What are a score or two of missionaries to such a people? A pinch of snuff to the kraken. I am for sending ten thousand missionaries in a body and converting the Chinese en masse within six months of the debarkation. The thing is then done, and turn to something else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{they can}} have them out; but having them out and having food for them are {{different}} things. The <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> so much stock now, that directly the growth is checked by the frost, the land becomes almost bare. They forget the old saying--"Half stocking, whole profits; whole stocking, half profits!" [...] And then, too, I think the winters are earlier here {{than they used to}} be. They'll {{have to go back to}} the Swiss plan, I fancy, and carry the food to the cattle in their houses. It may be old-fashioned, as they say; but I doubt whether the fodder does not go farther so.' Then as they began to ascend the mountain, he got on to the subject of his own business and George's prospects. 'The dues to the Commune are so heavy,' he said, 'that in fact there is little or nothing to be made out of the timber. It looks like a business, because many men are employed, and it's a kind of thing that spreads itself, and bears looking at. But it leaves nothing behind.' ...|$|E

50|$|As {{a village}} within the Remigiusland, Frutzweiler belonged from the Early Middle Ages to the Kusel church, but later to the Quirnbach church. In {{the time of}} the Reformation, <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>had</b> to convert to Lutheranism as well, but unlike people in Steinbach, they obeyed the order from Duke Johannes to convert to Calvinism. Only after the Thirty Years' War did the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken have to {{tolerate}} other faiths. The Swedish kings promoted Lutheranism while the French tried to restore Catholicism to the land. By the turn of the 19th century, almost half Frutzweiler’s population was Catholic. By the 20th century, the ﬁgures had once again swung the Protestants’ way, and they are to this day about two thirds of the population.|$|R
6000|$|The people here, I observed, are a poor sort of people, very thin, lean, and swarthy. The town is {{surrounded}} for several miles with {{many thousands of}} little hills, which are very near one to the other. I {{have been on the}} top of some of them near Mecca, where I could see some miles about, yet was not able to see the farthest of the hills. They are all stony-rock and blackish, and pretty near of a bigness, appearing at a distance like cocks of hay, but all pointing towards Mecca. Some of them are half a mile in circumference, but all near of one height. The <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> an odd and foolish sort of tradition concerning them, viz.: That when Abraham went about building the Beat-Allah, God by his wonderful providence did so order it, that every mountain in the world should contribute something to the building thereof; and accordingly every one did send its proportion; though there is a mountain near Algier, which is called Corradog, i.e. Black Mountain; and the reason of its blackness, they say, is because it did not send any part of itself towards building the temple at Mecca.[FN#16] Between ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ever since I {{heard the}} terrible {{story of the}} persecutions here," [...] Ned replied. [...] "I said to myself then that when I came {{to be a man}} I would take revenge for these horrible murders. Since then the more I have heard of the persecutions that the <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> {{suffered}} in the cause of their religion, the more I have longed {{to be able to give}} them such aid as I could. I have spoken of it over and over again to my sisters; but I do not think that I should ever have ventured to put my desire into words, had it not been for the terrible news we learnt at Vordwyk. Now, however, that they have killed my grandfather and uncles and have wounded you, I long more than ever to join the patriots here; and of course the knowledge that many young Englishmen were coming out to Brill and Flushing as volunteers added to my desire. I said to myself if they who are English are ready to give their lives in the cause of the Hollanders, why should not I, who speak their language and am of their blood?" ...|$|E

[...] "But the <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>have</b> taken that idea into their minds, {{and it will be}} hard to disabuse them. You must {{therefore}} keep up your disguise as a French knight while passing through this neighborhood. Another week's journeying, and you will reach the confines of Saxony, and there you will, as you anticipate, be safe. But I would not answer for your life were you discovered here to be of English birth. And now tell me if there is aught that I can do for you. I will myself accompany you into the town, and will introduce you as a French knight, so that no suspicion is likely to lie upon you, and will, further, ride with you to the borders of Saxony. I am well known, and trust that my company will avert all suspicion from you. You have told me that your purse is ill-supplied; you must suffer me to replenish it. One knight need not fear to borrow of another; and I know that when you have returned to your home you will bestow the sum which I now give you upon some holy shrine in my name, and thus settle matters between us." ...|$|E

When the first Choctaws arrived in 1832, they found fields that had been cleared for farming and cabins that had housed the previous inhabitants.
