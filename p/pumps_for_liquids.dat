50|$|Typically, {{a liquid}} pump can't simply draw air. The feed {{line of the}} pump and the {{internal}} body surrounding the pumping mechanism must first be filled with the liquid that requires pumping: An operator must introduce liquid into the system to initiate the pumping. This is called priming the pump. Loss of prime is usually due to ingestion of air into the pump. The clearances and displacement ratios in <b>pumps</b> <b>for</b> <b>liquids,</b> whether thin or more viscous, usually cannot displace air due to its compressibility. This {{is the case with}} most velocity (rotodynamic) pumps — for example, centrifugal pumps.|$|E
