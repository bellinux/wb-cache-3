Henry Mancini in particular found <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for him; the two shared an interest in experimenting with tone colors, and Mancini came to rely on Manne to shape the percussive effects in his music. Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Hatari! (1962) and The Pink Panther (1963) {{are only a few}} of Mancini's films where Manne's drums and special percussive effects could be heard.|$|E
25|$|There was <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in post-war Britain and {{industries}} such as British Rail, the National Health Service and public transport recruited almost exclusively from Jamaica and Barbados. Though Afro-Caribbean people were encouraged to journey to Britain through immigration campaigns created by successive British governments, many new arrivals were to endure prejudice, intolerance and extreme racism from sectors of White British society. This experience was to mark African-Caribbean people's relations with the wider community over a long period. Early African-Caribbean immigrants found private employment and housing denied {{to them on the}} basis of race. Trade unions would often not help African-Caribbean workers and some pubs, clubs, dance halls and churches would bar black people from entering. Housing was in short supply following the wartime bombing, and the shortage led to some of the first clashes with the established white community. Clashes continued and worsened into the 1950s, and riots erupted in cities including London, Birmingham and Nottingham. In 1958, attacks in the London area of Notting Hill by white youths marred relations with West Indian residents, leading {{to the creation of the}} annual Notting Hill Carnival, which was initiated in 1959 as a positive response by the Caribbean community. Some of the racism and intolerance was stoked by explicitly fascist or anti-immigration movements including Oswald Mosley's Union Movement, the League of Empire Loyalists, the White Defence League, the National Labour Party and others. Influenced by this kind of propaganda, gangs of Teddy Boys would often attack blacks in London. Historian Winston James argues that the experience of racism in Britain was a major factor in the development of a shared Caribbean identity amongst immigrants from a range of different island and class backgrounds. The shared experience of employment by organisations such as London Transport and the National Health Service also played a role in the building of a British African-Caribbean identity.|$|E

2500|$|Although Matsumoto {{drew in a}} {{wide range}} of styles, certain {{features}} remain consistent. His characters have an air of intelligence without melancholy, and of cheerful optimism that is never saccharine. Other popular illustrators of the day were better suited to the niches in which Matsumoto was not in his element. The multi-talented and enormously popular Jun'ichi Nakahara (...) drew girls who were intelligent and stylish, but humor was not his forte. In the genre of sentimental melodrama, according to Akiko Horiguchi, no one was more popular than Hiroshi Katsuyama (勝山ひろし).

While on leave on 18 October 1917 {{he was awarded the}} bar to the Military Cross. As a consequence of his vacation he missed the Battle of Cambrai which began on 20 November 1917. Mannock was, however, present for other developments. On 23 November the squadron began to convert to the S.E.5. Piloting his personal mount, B4884, he damaged the fighter when force landing after engine trouble at Dainville. Mannock's morale seemed high. He wrote to his sister on 21 November after returning to France, [...] "Hope all is well in Birmingham. <b>Plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for the airmen and plenty of casualties.

2500|$|Lothar Ruben-Wolf took a {{job with}} the All Union Institute of Experimental Medicine (WIEM) where he ws set to work on fascist race theories. [...] Martha Ruben-Wolf was {{employed}} as a gynaecologist In The Eighth Moscow Abortion clinic. [...] She was disappointed to find that in the eyes of senior colleagues her German qualifications and experience counted for very little. [...] There was <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> to be done, but she experienced the absence of professional status acutely. [...] A particular disappointment came in June 1936 when the Soviet Union reverted to the more conservative stance on birth control already enforced in Germany, and abortion, a topic as politicised in the Soviet Union as in the west, again became illegal. [...] As the political climate in Moscow turned increasingly ugly, Martha Ruben-Wolf experienced four months of unemployment, and then was given a relatively poorly paid job with Intourist, the state tourism agency. [...] The leader was becoming increasingly paranoid. [...] German political refugees who had come to Moscow in search of safety were increasingly in danger of being identified and denounced as Trotskyites or agents of the German government or both.|$|E
2500|$|Whitehead {{moved to}} Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, on {{completion}} of his training. There {{he bought a}} general practice and in 1866 established an eight-bed cottage hospital. The business of the practice itself was not great but he also held the post of medical officer to the local Poor Law Union. The Union provided him with <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and a gross income of 30 guineas a year, out {{of which he had}} to fund his own horse for transport and supply all medicines and surgical equipment. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1866. A year later, he sold his practice and returned to Manchester, where he was appointed Honorary Surgeon at St Mary's Hospital for Women and Children in 1868. He remained there until he moved to the MRI to be Honorary Assistant Surgeon in 1873. In 1876 he was a signatory to the almost-unanimous request from MRI medical staff for the hospital to be rebuilt, either on its current site or elsewhere, due to its inadequacies both in size and design. He was promoted to Honorary Surgeon in 1879 and in the early 1880s he abandoned his remaining involvement in general practice to concentrate entirely on surgical work. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 7February 1881. As was customary, he was appointed an Honorary Consulting Surgeon at the MRI when he reached his 60th birthday in 1900, at which point regulations demanded he resign his position as the senior Honorary Surgeon. This last appointment at the MRI coincided with the 30th anniversary of his association with the hospital and was marked with a dinner attended by surgical colleagues such as F. A. Southam and Bilton Pollard; it was described by the BMJ as [...] "probably the first of its kind" [...] in the city.|$|E
