40|$|Recent works {{showed that}} Stemphylium vesicarium, the causal agent of brown spot of pear, {{is able to}} colonize the herb plants of the lawn {{covering}} the orchard soil in a permanent manner. The fungus growths on the dead leaves of these plants as saprophyte and produces conidia from spring to autumn, and pseudothecia and ascospores of Pleospora allii from autumn to spring, more abundantly than on the <b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> litter. Considering that S. vesicarium does not produce spores on the affected pear tissue, the orchard floor (<b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> residues and dead herb plants) is then the inoculum source for both ascospores and conidia all season long.

Abstract: The <b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> blister mite can cause severe damage to pear leaves and young fruits in some regions. Due to hidden living inside leaf blisters, the mites are largely protected against the impact of plant protecting agents. Until now, treatments with mineral oil or rape oil in early spring, during the time when the mites leave their hibernation sites under the bud scales to invade the young leaves and blossoms, are the only possibility to control these mites in Swiss organic fruit growing. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of sulphur, mineral oil and Surround®WP applied after harvest during the time, when the mites leave their blisters and migrate to their hibernation sites. The different treatments were applied shortly after harvest to benefit from the mild temperatures in September. Counting the number of mites after dissection of the buds in laboratory in autumn and spring showed a good efficacy for all treatments. But the visual control in spring during bloom could not verify these results for all treatments. Only the sulphur-treated trees were virtually free of blisters in spring. With a corrected efficacy (Abbott’s formula) of 95...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pear</b> <b>leaf</b> scorch, {{the only}} Xylella fastidiosa-induced disease {{reported}} from Taiwan, {{was found in}} area where the variety Hengshan (Pyrus pyrifolia) was grown. Strains of <b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> scorch Xyl. fastidiosa (XF-PLS) shared similarities to strains of other host origins in the requirement of complex medium and the exhibition of rippled cell walls, however, recent serological and molecular biology studies showed difference among them. Five strains of XF-PLS were compared with 20 other strains originally isolated from almond, oleander, pecan, plum, peach, mulberry, grapes, citrus, coffee, and sycamore by sequence analyses of the 16 S rRNA gene and 16 S- 23 S rRNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS). When sequences of 16 S rRNA gene based on fragment size of 1, 537 - 1, 540 bp were compared, the similarity index among 5 XF-PLS strains was 99. 3 - 99. 8 %, whereas it was 97. 8 - 98. 6 % between XF-PLS strains and strains from other hosts. When sequences of 16 S- 23 S rRNA ITS based on fragment size of 510 - 540 bp were compared, the similarity index among 5 XF-PLS strains was 99. 0 - 100 %, whereas it was 80. 7 - 82 % between XF-PLS strains and strains from other hosts. Multiple sequence alignments led to the identification of 5 polymorphic nucleotides in the 16 S rRNA gene among the 25 Xyl. fastidiosa strains, and there were considerable variations in the nucleotide sequences of 16 S- 23 S rRNA ITS between XF-PLS and the other 20 Xyl. fastidiosa strains. The phylogenetic trees revealed that XF-PLS strains were separated from strains of other hosts. Strains of other hosts were divided into four subgroups: strains from (1) oleander, (2) grape, almond M 23 and mulberry, (3) citrus and coffee, and (4) pecan, peach, plum, sycamore and almond M 12. Results indicate that XF-PLS strains were not {{closely related to the}} above-mentioned strains from other hosts and could possibly belong to a new subspecies of Xyl. fastidiosa...|$|R
