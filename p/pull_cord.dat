25|$|Citroën {{unveiled}} {{the car at}} the Paris Salon on 7 October 1948. The car on display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the <b>pull</b> <b>cord</b> starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one stop light, and was only available in grey. The fuel level was checked with a dip stick/measuring rod, and the speedometer was attached to the windscreen pillar. The only other instrument was an ammeter.|$|E
2500|$|North American diesel {{locomotives}} manufactured {{prior to the}} 1990s utilized an air valve actuated by the engineer through the manipulation of a lever or <b>pull</b> <b>cord.</b> Use of this method made possible a practice known as [...] "feathering", meaning that modulation of the horn's volume was possible through finer regulation of the air valve.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pull</b> and tilt <b>cords</b> are {{dangerous}} {{to young children}} and pets, as they may cause strangulation. Over 200 children have strangled on <b>pull</b> and tilt <b>cords</b> of horizontal blinds. Cord retrofit kits include cord stops, tassels and tie down devices which are used to upgrade the blind but is not considered the safest alternative according to the US.CPSC, who recommends using only cordless window coverings in homes where small children live or visit. Blinds with wand tilt are safer than blinds with traditional cord tilt. There are also cordless blinds. The dangling group of <b>pull</b> <b>cords</b> {{is replaced by a}} spring motor system. A push or pull on the bottom bar raises or lowers the mini blind rather than using <b>pull</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|R
50|$|Common uses of {{ball chain}} are for <b>pull</b> <b>cords</b> on light {{fixtures}} and ceiling fans, keychains, as retaining chains for {{things such as}} counter pens, and dogtag chains.|$|R
50|$|A {{light switch}} {{combined}} with a light socket is sometimes installed in basement or utility areas of homes. The switch is operated by a <b>pull</b> chain or <b>cord.</b> It is also possible to have the cord-operated switch separate from the light socket, which is particularly common in British bathrooms. Until 2001 it was a requirement of the UK wiring regulations that all bathroom switches were operated by <b>pull</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1933, the Chinese {{designed}} {{and produced a}} grenade based on the German Model 1924. This grenade was deployed under name 'Type 23' by the National Revolutionary Army. In comparison to the Model 24, the Chinese version was shorter in length and had a smaller diameter. The Type 23 operated very similarly to its German counterpart, but with a few exceptions; most significantly, the fuse delay was slightly longer, at {{five and a half}} seconds. The other differences included a small thumb release lever to hold the screw-on cap in place, and the lack of a porcelain bead attached to the fuse's <b>pull</b> <b>cord</b> (both unlike the German grenade). Some of these Type 23 grenades were used as booby traps, by removing the cap and attaching the <b>pull</b> <b>cord</b> to a tripwire. As the United States entered the war, and operations in the Pacific Theater began, the Chinese Type 23 grenade was mistakenly listed in early intelligence reports as being Japanese made.|$|E
50|$|When {{the lever}} (10) is pulled (usually via a <b>pull</b> <b>cord),</b> the valve opens {{and lets the}} steam escape through the orifice. The steam will {{alternately}} compress and rarefy in the bell, creating the sound. The pitch, or tone, {{is dependent on the}} length of the bell; and also how far the operator has opened the valve. Some locomotive engineers invented their own style of whistling.|$|E
5000|$|... "Red Cord Cards" [...] help {{to improve}} safety in {{accessible}} toilets. The cards created by Euan's Guide {{are designed to}} be easily attached to emergency red <b>pull</b> <b>cords</b> in toilets. They inform people of the importance of leaving the cords untied and reaching {{all the way to the}} floor.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{nursing homes}} or assisted-living communities, {{independent}} retirement living communities {{do not provide}} skilled nursing or assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, eating, or taking medication. However, residents of Holiday Retirement can use outside home health care services to meet additional needs. Holiday Retirement apartments also include emergency <b>pull</b> <b>cords</b> that notify managers of emergency situations.|$|R

50|$|A pullstring (pull string, pull-string), pullcord (<b>pull</b> <b>cord,</b> pull-cord), or pullchain (pull-chain, pull chain) is a string, cord, or chain {{wound on}} a {{spring-loaded}} spindle that engages a mechanism {{when it is}} pulled. It is most commonly used in toys and motorized equipment. More generally and commonly, a pullstring can be any type of string, cord, rope, or chain, attached to an object in some way used to pull or mechanically manipulate part of it.|$|E
50|$|While the M16 and the M15 were {{functionally}} identical, the new successor {{included a}} vital {{change in the}} base design; a small porcelain ball was placed {{at the base of}} the grenade- attached directly to the <b>pull</b> <b>cord.</b> This new addition prevented the string from being exposed. The small bead was partially enveloped in the wooden handle, meaning that some force was needed to pluck it out. Operation was nearly identical, except that a soldier no longer needed to pull the string itself.|$|E
5000|$|Steam {{whistles}} {{were almost}} always actuated with a <b>pull</b> <b>cord</b> (or sometimes a lever) that permitted proportional (tracker) action, {{so that some}} form of [...] "expression" [...] could be put into the sound. Many locomotive operators would have their own style of blowing the whistle, and it was often apparent who was operating the locomotive by the sound. Modern locomotives often make use of a push button switch to operate the air horn, eliminating any possibility of altering the horn's volume or pitch.|$|E

25|$|Pacific Northwest Coastal {{indigenous}} groups were generally highly skilled woodworkers. Their masks were often master-pieces of carving, sometimes with movable jaws, or a mask within a mask, and parts moved by <b>pulling</b> <b>cords.</b> The carving of masks {{was an important}} feature of wood craft, {{along with many other}} features that often combined the utilitarian with the symbolic, such as shields, canoes, poles, and houses.|$|R
50|$|Hasbro {{continued}} {{to produce a}} variety of exclusive offerings that utilize this figure; most were not available to the general public, and some sets were priced {{in the hundreds of}} dollars. A couple of the more basic offerings were a talking Land Adventurer, and basic Land adventurer (2006 Hot Topic store exclusive, $14.99 U.S.), both with reproduction boxes/literature. A talking AT commander was released (same as Talking Pilot and Talking Sailor), with the flocked hair and beard. The mechanism is <b>pull</b> <b>cord</b> activated, but battery operated unlike the original 1960s-1970s version.|$|E
50|$|One final {{development}} of the Stielhandgranate was implemented during the later stages of the First World War, and was very minor in differences to the original. Identical in function to the Model 1916, but yet another change was made to the actual priming system. The base of the Stielhandgrante's handle was slightly redesigned, and a metal cover cap was introduced. This cap concealed the porcelain bead and <b>pull</b> <b>cord,</b> allowing it to simply rest freely inside of the handle. The cover cap would simply be pulled off, and the M16's motions followed.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} window blinds and {{curtains}} use a cord pull to open, close, raise, and lower them. Some types of ladders like the extension ladder and attic ladder {{can have a}} pullstring that pulls it down from the ceiling. A dock plate can use a pullchain to move it. Some gates have a pullstring on its latch. A pull switch uses a chain or string to actuate a switch, commonly used in lighting and ceiling fans. Modern flush toilets use a pullchain attached to a lever that lifts the plunger to release water into the toilet bowl. The photoplayer uses pullchains to generate sound effects for silent films. Pre-1990s North American diesel locomotive train horns used a lever or <b>pull</b> <b>cord</b> to actuate an air valve. Older steam whistles were almost always actuated with a <b>pull</b> <b>cord.</b> A train's emergency brake can be a cord or chain that will stop the train when pulled. Older transit buses and trams/trolleys have a pullcord that a passenger can pull to signal the driver that they are requesting a stop. The Jaguar XK120 sports car's doors have no external handles so it uses an interior pullcord instead. Some grandfather clocks have a pullchain to raise the weights in order to wind the clock's gears. A lifejacket has a pullcord used to inflate it.|$|E

A fourth player sits on another turntable and wears a canvas-like backdrop {{on their face}} and a bucket below their chin. The team that gets the most paint in their bucket in three minutes wins. As an advantage, the winning team has one extra bucket for a player to use.|$|R

50|$|A bell pull is a woven textile, <b>pull</b> <b>cord,</b> handle, knob, {{or other}} object that connects with a bell or bell wire, and which rings a bell when pulled. Bell pulls {{are used to}} summon workers in homes {{of people who have}} butlers, maids or other servants, and often have a tassel at the bottom. The bell pull is one element of a complex {{interior}} mechanical network which typically in Victorian times involved a range of bell pulls in different rooms; moreover, these bell connections link to a central bank of bells in a room where servants would await commands.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>pull</b> <b>cord</b> {{ran down}} the hollow handle from the {{detonator}} within the explosive head, terminating in a porcelain ball {{held in place by}} a detachable base closing cap. To use the grenade, the base cap was unscrewed, permitting the ball and cord to fall out. Pulling the cord dragged a roughened steel rod through the igniter, causing it to spark and start the five-second fuse burning. This simple design continued to evolve throughout the First and Second World Wars, with the Model 24 grenade (popularly known as the [...] "potato masher") becoming one of the most easily recognized of all German small arms.|$|E

5000|$|Early Action Man {{came with}} a dogtag similar to G.I. Joe's; a thin stamped steel tag. From 1970 on, Palitoy devised their own design, made of hard plastic with [...] "bullet holes" [...] passing through the logo, and cast in grey or green, which was used until the 1980s. Talkers have the tag {{attached}} directly to the <b>pull</b> <b>cord,</b> standard bodies have the tag attached to a small chain. In the 1980s, a modified identity tag with decals to be applied was released; these decals {{vary according to the}} figure. On talker figures, the tag was tied directly to the pull-string, on standard bodies, it was suspended by a black cord around the neck. The Hasbro-authorised reproductions of the 1960s metal and 1970s identity tags are virtually indistinguishable from the original.|$|E
50|$|Multiple devices may {{share an}} edge-triggered {{interrupt}} line {{if they are}} designed to. The interrupt line must have a pull-down or pull-up resistor so that when not actively driven it settles to one particular state. Devices signal an interrupt by briefly driving the line to its non-default state, and let the line float (do not actively drive it) when not signalling an interrupt. This type of connection is {{also referred to as}} open collector. The line then carries all the pulses generated by all the devices. (This is analogous to the <b>pull</b> <b>cord</b> on some buses and trolleys that any passenger can pull to signal the driver that they are requesting a stop.) However, interrupt pulses from different devices may merge if they occur close in time. To avoid losing interrupts the CPU must trigger on the trailing edge of the pulse (e.g. the rising edge if the line is pulled up and driven low). After detecting an interrupt the CPU must check all the devices for service requirements.|$|E
5000|$|In 1915, {{industries}} of the German Empire designed and began {{production of the}} original Stielhandgranate, appropriately named Model 1915. The Model 15 Stielhandgranate utilized a priming system, unlike many others of the time. Most grenades of the period used the percussion cap pin, a fuse system quite different {{to that of the}} Stielhandgranate. The easily recognizable [...] "potato masher" [...] shape is a result of a number of different styles and choices of the design. The grenade mounted a charge head within a steel sheet cylinder atop a long hollow wooden handle. Internally, the explosive filler - initially ammonal but later approximately 170 g of trinitrotoluene filling) was connected to a detonator, and a <b>pull</b> <b>cord</b> ran from the detonator {{down the length of the}} hollow handle, emerging from the base. To use, a soldier would simply pull the string downwards, dragging a rough steel rod through the igniter within the fuse. The rod's abrasive contact would cause sparks and a flame to light from within, setting the fuse burning. This fuse took approximately four and a half seconds to reach the detonator before exploding.|$|E
