25|$|Men's field {{lacrosse}} protective equipment {{contains a}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloves,</b> elbow pads, shoulder pads, helmet, and mouthguard. Pads differ {{in size and}} protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more protective elbow pads {{to protect themselves from}} checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less protective pads due to their smaller possibility of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large protective chest pad to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.|$|E
25|$|Ali {{stood up}} and started towards Angelo Dundee who guided him into the corner. At first Dundee talked and slapped Ali's legs, but after Ali {{misunderstood}} {{and tried to get}} off the stool, Dundee used smelling salts. Dundee has since claimed to have opened a small tear in one of Ali's gloves and told the referee that his fighter needed a new <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloves,</b> thus delaying the start of the 5th round. Cooper insisted that this delay lasted anywhere from three to five seconds according to the footage and that this did not deny him the chance to try to knock Ali out while he was still dazed. Tapes of the fight show that Ali received only an extra six seconds, and the gloves were ultimately not replaced. Cooper started the 5th round aggressively, attempting to make good on his advantage, but a recovered Ali effectively countered and Cooper was hit high on the face with a hard right which opened a severe cut under his eye. Referee Tommy Little was forced to stop the fight, and thus Ali defeated Cooper by technical knockout.|$|E

500|$|Childhood friends, Donnel Carty, 18, and Delano Brown, 17, {{had earlier}} that evening robbed chef Kurshid Ali, {{a middle-aged man}} in Kensal Green station, 20 minutes before Pryce arrived at the station {{on his way home}} from work. Pryce was walking from Kensal Green Tube station at about 2300 to 2330 GMT, when he was attacked. According to witness reports, Pryce was running along Bathurst Gardens from two black youths. According to {{testimony}} from Delano Brown, Donnel Carty stabbed Pryce after they had chased him from Kensal Green Tube station where police found a trail of blood and belongings, including a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloves</b> and papers regarding Pryce's wedding arrangements. As the youths chased Pryce, Carty [...] "fly-kicked" [...] him in the back and he dropped to the floor. As Pryce attempted to stand up, Carty kicked him in the face. Trying to get away, Pryce began to fight Carty, as Carty stopped him. Some time during this Pryce was stabbed twice in the chest and once in the hip, the wounds penetrating vital organs including his heart. He also suffered cuts to his head, hands and torso. As Pryce's belongings lay scattered around him, Carty and Brown took Pryce's mobile phone and Oyster card, the only possessions of value Pryce was carrying. Carty then shouted 'What else have you got?' to which Pryce responded 'Nothing. You have got everything'. Carty and Brown then ran off towards Clifford Gardens, heading to Carty's home leaving Pryce dying on the ground. Pryce was later taken to Central Middlesex Hospital, where he was confirmed dead shortly after midnight.|$|E

Accumulated scar tissue around Cooper's eyes made him more vulnerable than in the previous meeting and a serious cut was opened by Ali, which led to the fight being stopped, Cooper again losing to Ali via technical knockout.÷÷×≤≤≤≤ ...|$|E
