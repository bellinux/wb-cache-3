50|$|By this point, {{benefit of}} clergy had been {{transformed}} from a <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical <b>jurisdiction</b> to a mechanism by which first-time offenders could obtain partial clemency for some crimes. Legislation in the 17th and 18th centuries further {{increased the number of}} people who could plead benefit of clergy, but decreased the benefit of doing so.|$|R

In 1951, the university was granted statutory recognition and was renamed as Shrimati Nathibai Thackersey Women’s University now popularly known as SNDT Women’s University. The recognition came along with rare <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> having a <b>jurisdiction</b> across the country.|$|R
50|$|The commons now {{assembled}} in parliament, being justly occasioned thereunto, concerning sundry liberties, franchises, <b>privileges,</b> and <b>jurisdictions</b> <b>of</b> parliament, amongst others not herein mentioned, do make this protestation following: - That the liberties, franchises, <b>privileges,</b> and <b>jurisdictions</b> <b>of</b> parliament are the ancient and undoubted birthright and inheritance {{of the subjects}} of England; and that the arduous and urgent affairs concerning the king, state, and the defence of the realm, and {{of the church of}} England, and the making and maintenance of laws, and redress of mischiefs, and grievances which daily happen within this realm, are proper subjects and matter of counsel and debate in parliament; and that in the handling and proceeding of those businesses, every member of the house hath, and of right ought to have, freedom of speech to propound, treat, reason, and bring to conclusion the same: that the commons in parliament have like liberty and freedom to treat of those matters, in such order as in their judgments shall seem fittest: and that every such member of the said house hath like freedom from all impeachment, imprisonment, and molestation (other than, by the censure of the house itself), for or concerning any bill, speaking, reasoning, or declaring of any matter or matters, touching the parliament or parliament business; and that, if any of the said members be complained of, and questioned for any thing said or done in parliament, the same is to be showed to the king, by the advice and assent of all the commons {{assembled in}} parliament, before the king give credence to any private information.|$|R
2500|$|There were {{clashes between}} the Hungarians and Cumans in 1280 and 1282. The first {{involved}} the king convincing the Cumans {{not to leave}} the country, yet a small group still moved to Wallachia. The second was a battle between Cuman rebels and the king's forces. The Cumans initially lived in felt yurts, but as time went by they gradually gave up their nomadic way of life. The head of Cuman clans served the dual role of a military leader and a judge. The Cumans, having their own jurisdiction, were exempt from Hungarian jurisdiction and appealed to the king only in cases of unsettled disagreements. The Cumans paid 3000 gold bullions {{a year to the}} king, as well as other products and animals (since King Béla IV). They had other <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> self <b>jurisdiction,</b> with their own judges, magistrates and priests and not paying port and custom dues. Cuman villages didn't have landlords and thus no manors were established; this meant that the people of these villages bought off statute labour. The royal guard of the Hungarian kings were Cumans, called nyoger. From the 16th century onwards, the Cumans between the Danube and Tisza rivers were referred to as Kiskun, while the Cumans east of the Tisza river were referred to as nagykun. The majority of Cumans were exterminated during the Great Turkish War ...|$|R
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> the estates, yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the knights, including tax exemption, assertion <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|R
5000|$|In 1877 Queen Victoria {{confirmed}} these {{commissions and}} endorsed the ancient <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the liberty justices {{and at the}} same time excluded the High Sheriff of Northamptonshire from exercising his authority in the Soke. The commissions of oyer and terminer and gaol delivery were not renewed by the monarchs immediately succeeding Queen Victoria and in 1920 the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a conviction recorded at Peterborough Quarter Sessions. It was held that three of the liberty magistrates adjudicating at the hearing were not in order, as the assize authority of the court then derived from commissions granted during the reign of Queen Victoria. The three justices in question had been appointed to the commission of the peace subsequent to her death and only justices appointed during her reign were in order in adjudicating at such a court. This resulted in a renewal of the commissions in continuation of the ancient assize jurisdiction, and an announcement was made at the Easter Quarter Sessions in 1921 that [...] "whatever may have happened as a result of a recent case in the Court of Criminal Appeal by authority of this Commission now granted, this Court will continue to exercise this ancient jurisdiction in the same manner as it has done under similar commissions since the days of Charles I." [...] In fact, the justices of the liberty did not exercise their full powers, although they were always jealous of their special and historic privileges. In 1949, the Marquess of Exeter moved an amendment in the House of Lords to the Justices of the Peace Bill. This was necessary to safeguard the special position <b>of</b> the liberty <b>jurisdiction</b> as the new Bill provided there should be a separate commission of the peace for every administrative county and county borough and not for any other area. Accordingly, an amendment was accepted by the Lord Chancellor and the following paragraph was included in the Act:— SAVING FOR SOKE OF PETERBOROUGH: The Justices for the Soke of Peterborough shall, by virtue of the Commission of the Peace and without any further commission, have within the county the same jurisdiction as before the coming into force of Section 10 of this Act the Justices for the Liberty of Peterborough had within the Liberty by virtue of the commissions of oyer and terminer and gaol delivery customarily issued to those Justices, but as respects any matters within their competence as Justices of the Peace, shall act as such and not as Justices of Oyer and Terminer or Justices of Gaol Delivery. In accepting the amendment the Lord Chancellor said that in murder cases this ancient jurisdiction had survived all these years only because it had never been exercised and he added, [...] "if the justices ever appear to act upon the powers they possess, I shall be the first to come and remove those powers for them." ...|$|R

5000|$|Zarzosa council had “since time immemorial” {{enjoyed the}} <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> {{jurisdictional}} immunity: the king’s officials could not enter with authority to command or make orders <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in Zarzosa council or within its boundaries. [...] Several nearby councils also enjoyed the same <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> immunity: Castrillo de Riopisuerga, Olmos de Pisuerga, Tagarrosa and Valtierra de Riopisuerga. We {{do not know}} since when or why these council immunities were granted, but one hypothesis {{is that they were}} possibly related with the proximity of the frontier with the Cantabrians. If that were so, these immunities could be much older than they are generally thought to be. The jurisdictional immunity of Zarzosa appears confirmed enshrined in the Firm Judgement of Villazgo (1571) ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{reaching}} its conclusion {{about the lack}} <b>of</b> personal <b>jurisdiction,</b> the court applied a three-part test from Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797 (9th Cir. 2004), which stated that {{to determine whether the}} exercise <b>of</b> specific personal <b>jurisdiction</b> is appropriate, [...] "the non-resident defendant must purposefully direct his activities or consummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof; or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself <b>of</b> the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws". Further, [...] "the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant's forum-related activities"; and [...] "the exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> must comport with fair play and substantial justice". The court further observed that the plaintiff had the burden of proving the first two prongs of the foregoing test and only then the defendant was required to come forward and show that the [...] "exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> would not be reasonable".|$|R

50|$|During {{the reign}} of King Philip IV of France and his sons, France's monarchy {{gradually}} expanded its authority, as {{the power of the}} king grew {{at the expense of the}} nobles. One of the chief tools in this process was the Parlement of Paris, which allowed people to appeal the decisions of lower courts. During these appeals their possessions were under the direct protection of the Crown, weakening one of the most important <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the nobility: that <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over their own lands.|$|R
