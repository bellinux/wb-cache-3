40|$|Abstract. Group-wise {{analysis}} of time series of images requires to compare observed longitudinal evolutions. In medical imaging, longitudinal anatomical {{changes can be}} modeled by using deformations resulting from the non-rigid registration of follow-up images. The comparison of longitudinal trajectories is therefore the transport of longitudinal deformations in a common reference frame. We previously showed that the Schild's Ladder is an e cient and simple method for the parallel transport of diffeomorphic deformations parameterized by tangent velocity elds. The Schild's Ladder {{is based on the}} construction of a geodesic parallelogram. The base vertices of the parallelogram are the pairs of follow-up images and another vertex is the reference frame. By building the geodesic diagonals of the parallelogram, Schild's Ladder computes the missing vertex which corresponds to the transported follow-up image. However, Schild's Ladder may be ine cient in case of time series of multiple time points, in which the computation of the geodesic diagonals is required several times. In this paper we propose a new algorithm, the <b>Pole</b> <b>Ladder,</b> in which one diagonal of the parallelogram is the baseline-to-reference frame geodesic.

40|$|International audienceModeling the {{temporal}} {{evolution of the}} tissues {{of the body is}} an important goal of medical image analysis, for instance for understanding the structural changes of organs affected by a pathology, or for studying the physiological growth during the life span. For such purposes we need to analyze and compare the observed anatomical differences between follow-up sequences of anatomical images of different subjects. Non-rigid registration {{is one of the main}} instruments for modeling anatomical differences from images. The aim of non-rigid registration is to encode the observed structural changes as deformation fields of the image space, which represent the warping required to match observed differences. This way, anatomical changes can be modeled and quantified by analyzing the associated deformations. The comparison of temporal evolutions thus requires the transport (or "normalization") of longitudinal deformations in a common reference frame. Normalization of longitudinal deformations can be done in different ways, depending on the feature of interest. For instance, local volume changes encoded by the scalar Jacobian determinant of longitudinal deformations can be compared by scalar resampling in a common reference frame via inter-subject registration. However, if we consider vector-valued deformation trajectories instead of scalar quantities, the transport is not uniquely defined anymore. Among the different normalization methods for deformation trajectories, the parallel transport is a powerful and promising tool which can be used within the ''diffeomorphic registration'' setting. Mathematically, parallel transporting a vector along a curve consists in translating it across the tangent spaces to the curve by preserving its parallelism according to a given derivative operation called (affine) connection. This chapter focuses on explicitly discrete algorithms for parallel transporting diffeomorphic deformations. Schild's ladder is an efficient and simple method proposed in theoretical Physics for the parallel transport of vectors along geodesics paths by iterative construction of infinitesimal geodesics parallelograms on the manifold. The base vertices of the parallelogram are given by the initial tangent vector to be transported. By iteratively building geodesic diagonals along the path, Schild's Ladder computes the missing vertex which corresponds to the transported vector. In this chapter we first show that the Schild ladder can lead to an effective computational scheme for the parallel transport of diffeomorphic deformations parameterized by tangent velocity fields. Schild's ladder may be however inefficient for transporting longitudinal deformations from image time series of multiple time points, in which the computation of the geodesic diagonals is required several times. We propose therefore a new parallel transport method based on the Schild's ladder, the "pole ladder", in which the computation of geodesics diagonals is minimized. Differently from the Schild's ladder, the <b>pole</b> <b>ladder</b> is symmetric with respect to the baseline-to-reference frame geodesic. From the theoretical point of view, we show that the <b>pole</b> <b>ladder</b> is rigorously equivalent to the Schild's ladder when transporting along geodesics. From the practical point of view, we establish the computational advantages and demonstrate the effectiveness of this very simple method by comparing with standard methods of transport on simulated images with progressing brain atrophy.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} problem of de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) {{diamagnetic}} susceptibility oscillations in a thin, free-electron film trapped in a synthetic harmonic potential well. A treatment of this phenomenon at zero temperature was announced many years ago by Childers and Pincus (designated hereafter as CP), and we traverse initially much the same ground, but from a slightly different analytic perspective. That difference hinges around our use, in calculating the Helmholtz free energy F, of an inverse Laplace transform, Bromwich-type contour integral representation for the sharp distribution cutoff at Fermi level μ. The contour integral permits closed-form summation all at once over the discrete orbital Landau energy levels transverse to the magnetic field, and the energy associated with the in-plane canonical momenta ℏ k x and ℏ k z. Following such summation/integration, pole/residue pairs appear in the plane of complex transform variable s, a fourth-order pole at origin s = 0, and an infinite ladder, both up and down, of simple poles along the imaginary axis. The residue sum from the infinite <b>pole</b> <b>ladder</b> automatically engenders a Fourier series with period one in dimensionless variable μ/ ℏ ω (with effective angular frequency ω suitably defined), series which admits closed-form summation as a cubic polynomial within any given periodicity slot. Such periodicity corresponds to Landau levels slipping sequentially beneath Fermi level μ as the ambient magnetic field H declines in strength, and is manifested by the dHvA pulsations in diamagnetic susceptibility. The coëxisting steady contribution from the pole at origin has a similar cubic structure but is opposite in sign, inducing a competition whose outcome is a net magnetization that is merely quadratic in any given periodicity slot, modulated by a slow amplitude growth. Apart from some minor notes of passing discord, these simple algebraic structures confirm most of the CP formulae, and their graphic display reveals a numerically faithful portrait of the oscillatory dHvA diamagnetic susceptibility phenomenon. The calculations on view have a merely proof-of-principle aim, with no pretense at all of being exhaustive. The zero-temperature results hold moreover {{the key to the}} entire panorama of finite-temperature thermodynamics with T > 0. Indeed, thanks to the elegant work of Sondheimer and Wilson, one can promote the classical, Maxwell-Boltzmann partition function Z (s), via an inverse Laplace transform of its ratio to s 2, directly into the required, Fermi-Dirac Helmholtz free energy F at finite temperature T > 0. While the underlying cubic polynomial commonality continues to bestow decisive algebraic advantages, the evolving formulae are naturally more turgid than their zero-temperature counterparts. Nevertheless we do retain control over them by exhibiting their retrenchment into precisely these antecedents. So fortified, we undertake what is at once both a drastic and yet a simple-minded step of successive approximation, a step which clears the path toward numerical evaluation of the finite-temperature diamagnetic susceptibility. We are rewarded finally with a persistent dHvA periodicity imprint, but with its peaks increasingly flattened and its valleys filled in response to temperature rise, all as one would expect on physical grounds...|$|E

Moreover, the ladder diagram showed that boron was uniformly distributed through the matrix with nearly all boron found on pure Ni-planes. The suggestion that boron preferentially settles on these planes would be supported by reports of a strong Ni-B bond, since on Ni planes, B atoms can be accommodated on octahedral interstitial sites surrounded by only Ni atoms.

The closed analytical expression for the correlation function obtained from NCBT is nothing but the series involving the RPA (Random Phase Approximation) diagrams in powers of the forward scattering coupling strength resummed to include only the most singular terms with the source of inhomogeneities treated exactly.
