5|$|The spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> {{cinnamon}} or rusty brown. The spores are elliptic, smooth-walled, nonamyloid (not absorbing iodine when {{stained with}} Melzer's reagent), and measure 6.6–8 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, and four-spored, with dimensions of 16–25 by 5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|The spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> greyish-black. Spores are {{narrowly}} elliptical to spindle-shaped, smooth, {{and measure}} 17–23 by 4.5–7.5μm. The cystidia are somewhat spindle-shaped or narrowly club-shaped, and measure 112–164 by 13–20µm. They have characteristically thick walls, up to 7.5µm wide {{in the middle}} portion.|$|E

50|$|Digital <b>printing</b> <b>is</b> {{a process}} in which <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> {{directly}} applied to fabrics with printer, reducing 95% the use of water, 75% the use of energy, and minimizing textile waste. The main advantage of digital <b>printing</b> <b>is</b> the ability to do very small runs of each design (even less than 1 yard).|$|R
5|$|A surviving, {{but very}} {{deteriorated}} 35mm nitrate {{print of the}} film was known to exist in 1988. It was described as being {{in various states of}} decomposition throughout the entire reel, including severe shrinkage and brittle or torn perforations. This <b>print</b> <b>is</b> 925 feet long and was held by John E. Allen, Inc. though it is not specifically known if it transferred to the Library of Congress in 1997.|$|E
5|$|As the {{original}} negatives are lost, {{the closest to}} an original <b>print</b> <b>is</b> a spare negative stored in Paramount's vaults. Suffering from decay and defects, the negative was fully restored with modern technology. For the restored version of Wings, {{the original}} music score was re-orchestrated. The sound effects were recreated at Skywalker Sound using archived audio tracks. The scenes using the Handschiegl color process were also recreated for the restored version.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation {{acquired}} an original 35mm nitrate film print from John Conning. The {{intention was to}} deposit the film in the Library of Congress. The surviving <b>print</b> <b>is</b> 925 feet in length, {{but it is not}} listed as being a whole or partial print.|$|E
50|$|In an archival setting, Van Dyke <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> {{relatively}} rare, as {{they were}} created for temporary purposes and often discarded after the final positive <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> made. Because of the nitrates used in preparing the paper and the preferred thin paper itself, Van Dyke <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> often extremely brittle and susceptible to damage. Van Dyke <b>prints</b> should <b>be</b> stored separately and, when possible reformatted before the image degrades unacceptably.|$|R
50|$|In January 2009, the Obama inaugural {{committee}} {{released a}} print produced by Shepard Fairey {{on behalf of}} Obama's inauguration. 10,000 numbered <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> produced in total, of which the first 1,000 were signed by Fairey. The signed and numbered <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> sold by the Obama Inaugural Committee for $500, while the unsigned and unnumbered <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> sold for $100.|$|R

5|$|The {{color in}} the {{original}} <b>print</b> <b>is</b> breathtaking; Redskin leaves an impression of a kaleidoscope of awe-inspiring backgrounds, with such much happening in the foreground that one hardly has time {{to take in the}} whole frame. The color is used for emotional impact; black and white (toned amber) represents the world of the white man; color is reserved for scenes of Indian life.|$|E
5|$|The dense, bow-like {{lamellae}} are pale-orange to pale-ochre {{and on the}} stipe basifixed {{or slightly}} decurrent. They are brittle and intermixed with shorter lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) as well as partly forking near the stem. In old age or in cases of injury they receive initially dark red, later grey green spots. The spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> pale ochre.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} most of the cast are known, but the role of director, often erroneously {{credited}} to Theodore Marston is not. The film was released on December 27, 1910 and met with positive reviews. The surviving <b>print</b> <b>is</b> in the Nederlands Filmmuseum and has been released on DVD.|$|E

5|$|The release {{managed to}} survive against {{considerable}} odds, but the surviving <b>print</b> <b>is</b> not without severe faults. The surviving print has considerable nitrate deterioration and very poor picture quality in certain parts. This film survives in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences film archives.|$|E
5|$|The spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> ochre or clay coloured, the {{elongated}} elliptical spores measuring 7–10 by 3–3.5μm. Basidia (spore-producing cells) {{are four}} spored, with dimensions of 14–18 by 4–5μm. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube faces (pleurocystidia) and edges (cheilocystidia), either scattered or, more rarely, as bundles. They measure 20–35 by 5–7μm and have a narrow club shape. Clamp connections are not present in the hyphae of S.luteus.|$|E
5|$|The spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores are {{somewhat}} oblong to slightly ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} faces of the tubes) are fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14µm.|$|E

50|$|Vintage <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} the original piece of art, {{as it is}} possible to arbitrarily obtain many copies from the same negative. This means that vintage <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> often signed by the photographer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{restored}} by the UCLA Film & Television Archive, with funding provided by The Film Foundation and The Franco-American Cultural Fund. [...] A fine-grain <b>print</b> <b>was</b> recently struck {{from the original}} nitrate negative, from which a new negative and superb new <b>print</b> <b>were</b> produced. Among other earlier exhibitions, the new <b>print</b> <b>was</b> exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in November 2014.|$|R
5|$|The spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> white. Spores are {{elliptic}} (or narrowly so), {{and measure}} 8–12 by 4.8–6.2µm. There are clamp connections {{present in the}} hyphae. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 23–30 by 8–10µm. The hymenium lacks cystidia. The cap flesh comprises homogenous, interwoven hyphae that are 3–5µm in diameter, while the cap cuticle is a 200–300-micrometer thick layer of interwoven, gelatinous hyphae up to 4µm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Kansas Saloon Smashers film {{is now in}} {{the public}} domain, and a paper <b>print</b> <b>is</b> {{preserved}} in the Library of Congress. This paper print was used to recover the film for a 2007 DVD release, as part of the compilation Social Issues in American Film 1900–1934. The compilation, part of the Treasures from American Film Archives produced by the National Film Preservation Foundation, features several films from the period which had particular focus on common issues at their releases. The other Edison-produced Nation film, Why Mr. Nation Wants a Divorce, is also included.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> pale yellow. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have {{dimensions}} of 8–10 by 5–6µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped, two- to four-spored, and measure 24–30 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the inner walls of the tubes) are light yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm.

50|$|Printing {{technologies}} {{divide between}} sheet-based and roll-to-roll-based approaches. Sheet-based inkjet and screen <b>printing</b> <b>are</b> best for low-volume, high-precision work. Gravure, offset and flexographic <b>printing</b> <b>are</b> more common for high-volume production, such as solar cells, reaching 10.000 square meters per hour (m²/h). While offset and flexographic <b>printing</b> <b>are</b> mainly used for inorganic and organic conductors (the latter also for dielectrics), gravure <b>printing</b> <b>is</b> especially suitable for quality-sensitive layers like organic semiconductors and semiconductor/dielectric-interfaces in transistors, {{due to high}} layer quality. If high resolution is needed, gravure is also suitable for inorganic and organic conductors. Organic field-effect transistors and integrated circuits can be prepared completely by means of mass-printing methods.|$|R

5|$|The colour of the spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> brownish, with pink, reddish, or rosy tints. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11–17 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18–25.6 by 7.0–10.2µm. Cystidia {{on the walls}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have overall dimensions of 36–44 by 8.0–11.0µm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0µm. The hymenium of Smith and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2–8µm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8–12µm) globule in the pleurocystidia.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of Tricholoma pardinum is an {{imposing}} mushroom with a pale grey cap up to 15cm (6in) in diameter that {{is covered with}} dark brownish to greyish scales. The gills are whitish, and are not attached to the stout white to pale grey-brown stalk. The spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> white. One of the more toxic members of the genus Tricholoma, the species has been implicated {{in a number of}} episodes of mushroom poisoning, probably because it is a large, attractive mushroom with a pleasant smell and taste, and it bears a superficial resemblance to several edible species, like Tricholoma terreum. Ingesting T.pardinum—even in small quantities—results in a severe, persistent gastroenteritis caused by an unknown mycotoxin.|$|E
5|$|The smell {{has been}} {{described}} as initially faint and honey-sweet, but strengthening over time to become overpowering, sickly-sweet and objectionable. Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant. The spore <b>print</b> <b>is</b> white, a common feature of Amanita. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measure 8–10μm (0.30.4mil) long, and stain blue with iodine. The gills, in contrast, stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated sulfuric acid.|$|E
