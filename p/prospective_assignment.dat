All licensed establishments must have an Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body [...] (commonly referred to as AWERBs) which considers and monitors project applications for the site. The assessment of severity has also changed under the amendments to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986). Working examples of severity bands are provided by European Commission Expert Working Group. The assessment of severity must also be conducted retrospectively, which results in severity being assigned {{on the basis of the}} actual suffering experienced by the animals, rather than what is presumed during study design. This in turn leads to more accurate <b>prospective</b> <b>assignment</b> of severity bands.|$|E
40|$|The Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) {{oversight}} of animal care and use requires experimental protocols {{to be classified}} according to the invasiveness of procedures. The CCAC policy statement on categories of invasiveness in animal experiments (CCAC, 1991) provides the basis for this classification and defines five categories A to E (from least to most invasive). These categories are further refined and explained through development of CCAC guidelines aimed at minimizing pain and distress. The CCAC {{has been able to}} monitor progress in the minimization of pain and distress through collation and publication of detailed national animal use statistics on the numbers of animals used within each of the categories of invasiveness. In order to provide accurate data, the CCAC also provides guidance on the submission of animal use data, for example through an interpretation bulletin posted on the CCAC website. A number of factors related to the assignment of categories of invasiveness (CIs) in the Canadian system {{have an impact on the}} national statistics, and on comparisons with animal use data from other jurisdictions. These include <b>prospective</b> <b>assignment</b> of severity, and precautionary measures such as assigning the generation of all genetically-engineered animals to CI D, a severe category of invasiveness. These factors will be discussed with a view to sharing experiences in animal use data collation, and enhancing public accountability...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis introduces {{the concept of}} Simplified Person-Job Matching (SPJM) {{as a means of}} measuring the effectiveness of the Surface Warfare/Officer Distribution and Assignment process. Data Base analysis of a cohort of officers attending the Surface Warfare Officer Department Head School, their career histories and <b>prospective</b> <b>assignments</b> was performed. Cohort Analysis indicate that : (1) on the average, the current distribution and assignment process is doing a marginally adequate job of matching personnel to available billets, (2) process improvement is recommended in that, 17 of 135 officers had <b>prospective</b> <b>assignments</b> to billets that they held no prior experiences for, (3) SPJM analysis resulted in a 22 % improvement for SPJM fit and resulted in no assignment of officer to billet without some related experience. Recommendations include: (1) implementation of consistent personnel policy in relation to assignment and distribution process, (2) provide budgetary funding for next generation Officer Assignment and Information System (OAIS) computer software, (3) incorporate computer program to ensure SPJM is accomplished, (4) utilize future software improvements to merge the somewhat adversarial roles of the Assignment and Placement Officers[URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens {{made it possible}} to offer allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) to older patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, the relative risks and benefits of alloHCT compared with novel nontransplant therapies continue to be the source of considerable uncertainty. We will perform a <b>prospective</b> biologic <b>assignment</b> trial to compare RIC alloHCT with nontransplant therapies based on donor availability. Primary outcome is 3 -year overall survival. Secondary outcomes include leukemia-free survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Four hundred patients will be enrolled over roughly 3  years. Planned subgroup analyses will evaluate key biologic questions, such as the impact of age and response to hypomethylating agents on treatment effects. Findings from this study potentially may set a new standard of care for older MDS patients who are considered candidates for alloHCT...|$|R

30|$|This {{investigation}} evaluates a common, well-defined injury with {{a consistent}} presentation and clear outcome goals. It was weakened, however, {{by the presence}} of lower-than-expected patient accrual, a high rate of patients lost to follow-up, and a change in the format from prospective randomization to <b>prospective</b> cohort <b>assignment.</b> The inherent problems of a randomized format (namely, expense, complexity, and patient and surgeon willingness to participate) proved infeasible, and it was felt that a better study could be produced using a cohort method. Nonrandomized cohort studies have been shown to produce similar results to randomized studies on the same topic, especially when they are prospective studies and outcomes evaluators have been blinded and outcomes are objective [29]. We had a significant lost to follow up in the cast 53  % (17 / 32) vs the IMN 26  % (6 / 23). This discrepancy could bias results in either direction. In general patients with a persistent problem return for follow up. Late complication in patients treated non-operatively is less likely and improved follow up in non-operatively treated injuries would more likely than not improve overall results of the cast treatment group.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of the Ologen as an aid for trabeculectomy performed for primary open-angle glaucoma compared with mitomycin C. Methods. In this <b>prospective,</b> randomized, parallel <b>assignment,</b> comparative study, 31 eyes of 21 primary open-angle glaucoma patients were allocated for trabeculectomy with the Ologen implant; another 32 eyes of 23 patients were treated with trabeculectomy augmented with mitomycin C. The patients were followed up for 5 years and evaluated for intraocular pressure, rate of success, status of the bleb, and adverse events. Result. The mean postoperative intraocular pressure was statistically different at 3 [*]m, 6 [*]m, 1 [*]y, 3 [*]y, and 5 [*]y follow-up. The rates of both complete success P= 0. 017 and overall success P= 0. 031 in the Ologen group {{were significantly higher than}} those in the mitomycin C group. The difference of the bleb extent and vascularity was statistically significant in both groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} postoperative complication. Conclusions. Ologen provides higher rates of surgical success compared with mitomycin C for patients with primary open-angle glaucoma undergoing trabeculectomy. It may be a new, safe, simple, and effective therapeutic approach for treating primary open-angle glaucoma...|$|R
40|$|Hypothermia is {{commonly}} found in injured victims who suffer from central nervous system injury, hypovolemic shock, exposure to environment, administration of anesthetic drugs and cold intravenous fluid. All these factors decrease the abilities of trauma victims to maintain normothermia and conserve body heat. Hypothermia in injured victim is a significant contributor to a well known cycle—triad of death and associated with increased mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay. Hypothermia {{is one of the}} preventable complications in trauma patients. Therefore nurse plays a vital role to evaluate the methods of preventing hypothermia. However, there is no systematic review of effectiveness of different warming methods in local setting. The purpose of this dissertation is to develop an evidence-based guideline to prevent hypothermia in trauma patients by reviewing existing evidence, to assess the feasibility and transferability of implementing the guideline and to develop its implementation and evaluation plan. Five articles meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria are identified after a systematic research of six electronic databases. Among these articles, four of them are randomized controlled trials while the remaining one is quasi-experimental design with <b>prospective</b> randomized <b>assignment.</b> The quality of these identified articles is evaluated with the methodology checklist for randomized controlled trials which is developed by Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN). All studies of medium and high quality would be considered as sufficient evidence to support the proposed innovation in preventing hypothermia for trauma patients in Accident & Emergency Department. After assessing the implementation potential, an evidence-based guideline in preventing hypothermia for adult trauma patients is established. The proposed innovation is necessary and beneficial for adult trauma patients to prevent hypothermia. The grade of recommendation in the guideline is rated based on the SIGN grading system from A to D. Communication plans with stakeholders and 3 -month pilot study on 20 patients are conducted before implementing the innovation into clinical setting. Evaluation is made to assess the effectiveness of the proposed guideline after the end of pilot study and the end of implementation of guideline. The effectiveness of the proposed innovation is determined by change of core temperature as + 1. 1 °C/hr and at least 90 % reduction in shivering and thermal discomfort which are reported in the reviewed articles. The guideline is considered as clinical effective when similar outcome is obtained. published_or_final_versionNursing StudiesMasterMaster of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|Background: Antiplatelet {{treatment}} {{is an important}} component in optimizing the clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) especially in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Prasugrel, which is a new P 2 Y 12 inhibitor, has been confirmed as efficacious in a large trial in Western countries, and a similar trial is also to be launched in Asian countries. Although a 60 -mg loading dose of prasugrel followed by 10 mg per day should be acceptable, there have been no data regarding the optimal dose in Asian patients. Furthermore, serum levels of prasugrel and the rates of platelet inhibition are known to be higher in Asians than Caucasians with the same dose of the drug. Polymer, a key component of drug-eluting stents (DES), has been suggested as the cause of inflammation leading to late complications, and has driven many companies to develop biodegradable-polymer DES. Currently, there are limited data regarding the head-to-head comparison between BP-BES and the biostable polymer CoCr-EES or the newest platinum-chromium everolimus-eluting stent (PtCr-EES). Furthermore, the polymer issue may be more important in ACS where there is ruptured thrombotic plaque where polymer-induced inflammation may affect the local milieu of the stented artery. Therefore, the present study dedicated only to ACS patients, will offer important information on the optimal prasugrel dose in the Asian population by comparing a 10 -mg versus a 5 -mg maintenance dose beyond 1 month after PCI, as well as giving important insight into the polymer issue by comparing BP-BES versus biostable-polymer PtCr-EES. Method/Design: Harmonizing Optimal Strategy for Treatment of coronary artery diseases - comparison of REDUCtion of prasugrEl dose or POLYmer TECHnology in ACS patients (HOST-REDUCE-POLYTECH-ACS) trial is a multicenter, randomized and open-label clinical study with a 2 x 2 factorial design, according to the type of stent (PtCr-EES versus BP-BES) and prasugrel maintenance dose (5 mg versus 10 mg), to demonstrate non-inferiority of PtCr-EES relative to BP-BES or the reduced prasugrel dose relative to conventional dose in an Asian all-comers PCI population presenting with ACS. Approximately 3400 patients will undergo <b>prospective,</b> random <b>assignment</b> separately to either stent or prasugrel arm (1 : 1 ratio, respectively). When the patients have contraindications to prasugrel, they are categorized into an antiplatelet observation group after stent-randomization. The primary endpoint is the patient-oriented composite outcome, which is a composite of all-cause mortality, any myocardial infarction (MI), any repeat revascularization in the stent arm at 12 months after index PCI. In the prasugrel arm, primary endpoint is any major adverse cardiovascular event, which is a composite of all-cause mortality, any MI, any stent thrombosis (Academic Research Consortium (ARC) -defined), any repeat revascularization, stroke, or bleeding (BARC class ?= 2). Discussion: The HOST-REDUCE-POLYTECH-ACS RCT is the first study exploring the optimal maintenance dose of prasugrel beyond 1 month after PCI for ACS in Asian all-comers. In addition, this is the largest study dedicated only to ACS patients to evaluate the polymer issue in the situation of ACS by directly comparing biostable-polymer PtCr-EES versus BP-BES.
