40|$|This thesis uses {{experiments}} and modelling {{to determine the}} kinetics of industrial ammonia combustion over <b>platinum</b> <b>gauzes.</b> The study is motivated by the existing poor understanding of the kinetics under industrial conditions. A comprehensive literature review of ammonia combustion is given, which includes a historical study of the industrial process, the current understanding of the industrial reaction kinetics, and {{an overview of the}} surface reaction mechanism. For this study, to further investigate industrial combustion, a burner was built whose design parameters were based on individual plant data found in the literature. Two models of the system are presented, one for the kinetics, and another for the temperatures in the catalyst bed. The key finding from the kinetic model is how individual process parameters determine the selectivity of the combustion products. The temperature model shows that for combustion in air, the catalyst surface temperature is not constant throughout the gauze pack, as it is currently thought to be...|$|R

40|$|The current thesis {{deals with}} the ammonia {{oxidation}} on cobalt oxide catalyst at the molecular level. The catalytic oxidation of ammonia to NO is crucial in the industrial process of nitric acid production. Cobalt oxide catalysts are being used together with <b>platinum</b> <b>gauzes</b> to reduce the production cost and emission of greenhouse gas N 2 O. However, the fundamentals of ammonia oxidation on cobalt oxides are not known. This thesis aims to provide insights into our fundamental understanding of ammonia oxidation on Co 3 O 4 surfaces. The performance of cobalt oxide catalysts in the oxidation of NH 3 strongly depends upon the exposed surface terminations. Results indicate that different surfaces of Co 3 O 4 behave markedly differently in oxidative reactions due to the difference in binding energy and O recombination energies and oxygen vacancy formation. Overall, NH 3 oxidation follows stepwise dehydrogenative route (NH 3 * → NH 2 * → NH* → N*) on Co 3 O 4 surfaces. Desorption of lattice products results {{in the formation of}} O vacancy sites opening the way for a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The successive dehydrogenation of ammonia preferably occurs on the surfaces exposing active lattice O sites. Removal of active lattice O sites from the Co 3 O 4 surfaces in the form of products results in the surface reduction. If the rate of reduction is faster than that of re-oxidation, a CoO-like phase might form. The formation of CoO in Co 3 O 4 catalysts during NH 3 oxidation not only reduces the NH 3 conversion but also alters the selectivity towards N 2 rather than NO due to weak ability of lattice O at the CoO surface to assist the hydrogen abstraction process. A surface with a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy and a higher binding energy of hydrogen exhibits a higher activity towards ammonia oxidation to NO.

The influence of selected parameters - electrolyte content, applied voltage, and kind of deposition electrode - on the pore structure has been investigated. The green bodies were sintered at 1450 deg C in air. Optical microscopy and X-ray computer tomography (CT) were used for characterising the porous structures. CT-investigations have the advantage of a three-dimensional characterisation of the samples by a non-destructive method. The resulting pore structure depended to a high degree on the experimental conditions of the EPD. The kind of the deposition electrode - platinum foil or <b>platinum</b> <b>gauze</b> on foil - had a strong influence on the arrangement of the pores.

40|$|Ammonia {{oxidation}} {{is used in}} {{the production}} of nitric acid. The process is either run at high pressure or low pressure, with the latter requiring larger equipment. <b>Platinum</b> <b>gauze</b> is typically used as a catalyst operating at high temperatures (in the range of 810 - 940 ᵒC). The platinum based catalyst is highly active and highly selective in producing the desired NOₓ products, with some formation of the undesired byproducts, i. e. N₂, N₂O and N₂O₄. However, a significant amount of platinum is lost during the process due to platinum volatilisation resulting in plant operating times varying between 2 - 12 months. Furthermore, the loss of platinum is the 2 nd largest expense of the operation. Platinum loss can only be minimised but not eliminated, thus a variety of metal oxide catalysts for oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen oxides have been studied. Cobalt oxide seems to be the most promising alternative for platinum exhibiting a high activity and selectivity towards NO.

They can be {{formed by the}} electrochemical reduction of nitrobenzyl halides (in this work, 2 -nitrobenzylchloride) in various solvents. In liquid ammonia at - 60 °C, the mechanism involves a one-electron reduction and de-chlorination followed by the coupling of the neutral radical intermediate species. Exhaustive voltammetric studies, including fast scan cyclic voltammetry, of the starting material are presented prior to preparative electrolysis experiments. Electrolysis under both potentiostatic and galvanostatic conditions are compared. Under conditions of severe dryness, potentiostatic reduction at <b>platinum</b> <b>gauze</b> set at a voltage of - 0. 30 V (vs. Ag wire) {{in the presence of}} ultrasound yields the dimer 2, 2 -dinitrobibenzyl (> 95 %) and no detectable side products.

40|$|Nitric acid {{production}} by the oxidation of ammonia on platinum gauzes con-stitutes {{one of the}} world’s major chemical industries. In this article the author outlines some of the principal features of this process, and describes in some detail the chemical reaction taking place at the platinum surface. He also discusses the changes {{that occur in the}} gauze leading to metal loss during operation. Handling and repairing the gauzes on a plant site and platinum dust recovery byJilters are among other aspects of interest to plant operators with which the author deals. Thomas Malthus (1766 - 1 834) maintained that the world’s population increases more rapidly than its food supplies, and only disease, war, poverty and vice prevent large-scale starvation. He could not foresee the world of the twentieth century, nor the role to be played by platinum gauzes in producing fixed nitrogen fertilisers without which his gloomy predictions might well be realised. I t is now estimated that the total world output of nitric acid has risen from about 18. 3 million tonnes (100 per cent HNO,) in 1962 - 63 to just under 23. 5 million tonnes in 1965 - 66 (I). At this level of production the world’s nitric acid plants are believed to operate at an average of 82 per cent of all available production capacity. The estimated production of the major manufacturing countries is shown in Table I (I).

30|$|Highly {{ordered and}} smooth TiO 2 {{nanotubes}} were fabricated by anodization of Ti foils in ethylene glycol (EG) electrolyte containing 0.5 wt% NH 4 F and 0.2 wt% H 2 O. Briefly before anodization, the Ti foils were degreased by sonicating in acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and methanol each for 10 min. Subsequently, the Ti foils were rinsed many times with deionized (DI) water and dried in gas stream. Two electrodes system with Ti-foil {{as a working}} electrode and a <b>platinum</b> <b>gauze</b> (15 × 25 × 0.2 mm 3) as a counter electrode was used for anodization. The first-step anodization was carried out at 50 V in the above-mentioned electrolyte for 7 h using DC power supply system, producing highly ordered and smooth TiO 2 nanotubes. It is worth mentioning that in this study the first nanotubes layer was separated from the underlying Ti substrates {{with the help of}} N 2 -blowing technique instead of using an ultrasonic treatment [32]. This method not only provides a very clean, smooth, uniform, and oriented honeycomb-like a patterned substrates for further anodization but also helps to avoid possible mechanical damage to the substrates. Thus, as a result a high-quality TiO 2 nanotubes arrays have been achieved. In order to study the effect of electrolytes on pore morphology, a set of experiments were performed in different electrolytes during the second-step anodization. The second-step anodization was conducted in the same EG-based and 0.5 wt% HF aqueous electrolytes under identical parameters for 20 h, producing TiO 2 nanotubes covered with a thin nanoporous layer on the top surface. The second-step anodization conducted in an electrolyte consisting of glycerol with 0.5 wt% NH 4 F and 0.2 wt% H 2 O under identical parameters for 20 h led to a highly oriented TNP structure.|$|E

However, a very promising technique, {{which has not been}} explored much in the characterization of EDLCs, is the use of density function theory (DFT) to determine the mesopore size dis-tribution and the corresponding cumulative surface area of carbon materials. 10 Therefore, the objectives here are to demonstrate the use of DFT in determining the PSD and cumulative surface area of carbon mate-rials that are being evaluated as EDLCs, and to show how this infor-mation can be used to identify the pore sizes that are contributing to the DLC. The carbon material chosen for this purpose is a car-bonized resorcinol-formaldehyde (R-F) resin derived from a sol-gel process. This material has been receiving considerable attention in the recent literature, 1, 6, 11 - 17 In this study, the DLCs of a series of car-bon xerogels fabricated from R-F resins, carbonized at different tem-peratures and CO 2 -activated to different extents, are correlated with their corresponding PSDs and cumulative surface areas determined ically separated from the disk using a porous glass fiber filter.

40|$|Electrochromatography employs an axial {{electric}} field across a chromatographic stationary phase to separate molecules based on differences in electrophoretic mobility. Although electrochromatography columns have existed for over 40 years, ineffective removal {{of heat and}} electrolysis gases have historically limited the scale-up of these columns to 2. 5 cm ID with sample volumes of less than 0. 5 mL. ^ Several new electrode designs were tested that employed either agarose or polyacrylamide gels. In all cases, the gel based electrodes suffered from excessive heating in the gel. However, an ultrafiltration membrane and <b>platinum</b> <b>gauze</b> electrode design reduced both electrolysis gas formation and heating in the electrode. ^ To study column-heating effects, a new column was designed with thermocouple ports at four axial positions. In each of these ports specially sheathed thermocouples were {{used to measure the}} temperature at the radial center of the column. A transient two-dimensional temperature model was developed to predict the temperature rise in the column. From both model prediction and experimental data, it was determined that heating in the electrochromatography column could be substantially reduced by using a non-conductive methacrylate base stationary phase with a low conductivity (3. 9 mM tris- 47 mM glycine) buffer. The resolving power of this new column (3. 81 cm ID x 38. 1 cm long) was demonstrated by separating mixtures of BSA and myoglobin. ^ Careful selection of operating conditions yielded a separation of 19. 5 mL of a mixture containing BSA and myoglobin on a 400 mL column. Further scale up of the separation experienced problems with excessive heating at the column inlet. The most likely cause of this heating was dissolved CO 2 that entered the column with the sample. However, decreased column heating and increased sample loading was achieved if an injection of 0. 1 M NaCl was made after the initial protein sample injection. Using a second salt injection, a baseline separation of 49 mL of bovine serum albumin and myoglobin was achieved. Lower overall column temperature and higher resolution were obtained over traditional electrochromatography operation. Based on the heat transfer model, this column could be scaled to a 10. 8 cm ID x 38. 1 cm long column capable of processing over 390 mL of sample per run. ...|$|E
