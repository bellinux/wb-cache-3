5|$|Ballard {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a third-pairing defenseman in his second season with Vancouver. He missed five contests in November and December 2011 due to a back injury, before sustaining a season-ending concussion on February 5, 2012. Initially undetected, the injury was caused by two separate hits during a game against the Colorado Avalanche. He remained in the lineup for the following contest before being diagnosed with the injury. His season ended with 1 goal and 7 points over 47 games. His third season with the Canucks was shortened by the 2012–13 NHL lockout. When the season started Ballard was again on the Canucks third <b>pairing</b> with Tanev. Early in the season the two were the Canucks' most consistent <b>pairing.</b> An injury to Kevin Bieksa allowed Andrew Alberts to get into the line-up and split the Ballard-Tanev <b>pairing.</b> After Bieksa's return it was Ballard who was removed from the line-up becoming a healthy scratch. In late March Vancouver suffered several injuries up front to help fill the void Ballard returned to the line-up as a forward. He played three games before suffering a broken foot. Though he was healthy by the playoffs Vancouver opted to play Alberts and rookie Frank Corrado in the first round lost to San Jose. He finished the year playing in 36 games and recording two assists.|$|E

5|$|During the {{off-season}} Vancouver signed defenceman Jason Garrison to a six-year contract worth $27.6 million. While the Canucks brought in Garrison, they lost longtime defenceman Sami Salo. The Canucks wanted to re-sign Salo, {{though they were}} unwilling to sign him to a two-year contract and offered only a one-year deal. Salo chose to leave and signed a two-year $7.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. It was believed that Garrison would step in {{and contribute to the}} power play and replace the departed Salo, who had performed a similar role. However, he struggled to adjust with his new team. He was taken off the power play unit and dropped to the third <b>pairing</b> within the first month. After the injuries to Bieksa, Garrison was moved from left defenceman to the right side <b>pairing</b> with Dan Hamhuis. The coaching staff came to consider this <b>pairing</b> to be the best and most trusted. Garrison finished the season with eight goals and eight assists, scoring three goals and three assists on the power play, and registering a +18 rating. His plus-minus was second on the team and led all defenceman.|$|E

5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base <b>pairing.</b> Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base <b>pairing</b> is Hoogsteen base <b>pairing</b> where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E

5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base <b>pairing</b> to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base <b>pairing</b> occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E
