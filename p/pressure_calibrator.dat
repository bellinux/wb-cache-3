In order to establish international / national compatibility, uniformity and affirmation of measurement results, considerable efforts are being made globally so that measurements made in one location in the world are equivalent / compatible in other locations on the same or related products. Such tasks are achieved by organizing international comparisons and proficiency testing by inter-laboratory comparisons of measurement results carried out on the same pressure gauge. National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) provide guidelines to industries and other researchers in terms of pressure calibration.

40|$|Pressure {{balances}} {{are excellent}} standards for measuring pressure with acceptable uncertainty {{and they are}} widely used at the primary pressure laboratories in the world. This study aims to study the propagation of uncertainty from primary standard piston cylinder assembly (PCA) up to 500 MPa. The hierarchy of pressure measurements at NIS is based on using large effective area PCA in defining the pressure of 1 MPa. Characterization of primary standard PCA is presented transferring the obtained results to other level pressure standard described. Uncertainty calculation method at each level was studied. Propagation of uncertainty from primary standards through national standards to digital pressure gauges, digital <b>pressure</b> <b>calibrators,</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors and pressure transducers were investigated. Study {{of the effect of}} each variable on the uncertainty calculation was discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} conducted {{to obtain the}} heat transfer and pressure drop data for an integral trailing edge cavity test section that simulates a novel turbine blade’s internal cooling passage with bleed holes. Local heat transfer is measured on both the suction and pressure sides by a transient liquid crystal technique, while pressures at six positions are recorded by <b>pressure</b> <b>calibrators.</b> Moreover, flow characteristic {{and its effect on}} heat transfer are analyzed for conditions with or without bleed flow. The experimental results show that, in the cases with bleed flow, local heat transfer on the pressure side exceeds that on the suction side in the first and second channels. In the cases without bleed flow, in the first and third channels, local heat transfer on the suction side weakens whilst it increases significantly on the pressure side. For the second channel, non-bleed condition leads to a more balanced heat transfer distribution between the upstream and downstream channel. Besides, after the bleed holes are blocked, heat transfer in the first bend region on the suction side declines sharply, while the opposite phenomenon occurs for the second bend region on the pressure side. In both bleed and non-bleed cases, the total pressure of six measurement positions decreases continuously along the channel at the same Reynolds number and it promotes for higher Reynolds number. Among all the measurement points, under the same flow rate condition, the highest speed occurs at Position 5, which also shows the maximum difference between the total and static pressures. When the bleed holes are blocked, the total pressure at each measurement position appears to increase...|$|R

The calibrator generates sine wave pressures at levels up to 1 PSIG P-P(168 dB) at frequencies from 10 Hz to 6 KHz and. 5 PSIG P. P (162 dB) at frequencies from 6 KHz to 20 KHz. The calibrator consists of two units connected by a single cable. The handheld unit contains a pressure transducer, speaker, and deadman switch. This unit allows application of dynamic pressure to transducers/ports on installed wind tunnel models. The base unit contains all of power supplies, controls and displays. This unit allows amplitude and frequency to be set and verified at a safe location off of the model...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{performance}} of the calibration results obtained by 21 laboratories using digital <b>pressure</b> <b>calibrator</b> as an artifact in the pressure range 7 - 70 MPa. National Physical Laboratory (NPLI), New Delhi has coordinated this programme and also acted as a reference laboratory. The program started in May, 2006 and completed during May, 2008. The comparison was carried out at 10 equally spaced pressure points i. e. 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63 and 70 MPa throughout the entire pressure range of 7 - 70 MPa. The calibration results thus obtained were analyzed as per ISO/IEC GUM document. The 92. 7 % measurement results are found in agreement with the results of NPLI. The relative deviations between laboratories values and reference values are well within the 0. 05 % for 123 measurement points, 0. 1 % for 162 measurement points and 0. 25 % for 177 measurement points. The difference of the laboratories values with reference values are found almost well within the uncertainty band of the reference values at 68. 0 % measurement results, within their reported expanded uncertainty band at 81. 5 % measurement results and within the combined expanded measurement uncertainty band at 92. 7 % measurement results. Overall, the results are considered to be reasonably good being the first proficiency testing for most of the participating laboratories...|$|E
40|$|The {{compressor}} is a {{key component}} of a jet engine necessary to compress air for the combustion process. Research to optimize compressor efficiency through the understanding of air flow behavior has led to increased efforts in creating modern compressor test facilities. In collaboration with Honeywell, the High Speed Compressor facility at Zucrow Laboratories has built a centrifugal compressor test cell with instrumentation to measure the temperatures and pressures of the air flow. This facility conducts experiments to characterize the compressor performance at varying conditions. During prolonged experimentation cycles, it is difficult to acquire reliable pressure measurements of the flow, as pressure sensor “drift” increases the uncertainty of measurements over time. Pressure scanners must be calibrated periodically to maintain reliability and calibration services are costly. To reduce cost, a pressure calibration process was automated {{with the use of a}} CPC 6000 <b>pressure</b> <b>calibrator.</b> LabVIEW visual instrument (VI) software was developed to interface with the calibrator and the Digital Sensor Array (DSA) pressure scanners. The CPC 6000 determines the calibration range, and the VI software uses the calibrated pressure to overwrite the calibration coefficients of the DSA. The calibration coefficients that were outside of the calibration range were successfully overwritten by the VI software. The DSA was calibrated to measure pressures within 0. 05 % of full-scale measurement. Automating the calibration process will reduce the cost of periodic calibration by an external resource. It will also maintain repeatability in the uncertainty of the measurements through testing cycles that last beyond the 6 month guaranteed calibration period of the manufacturer...|$|E
