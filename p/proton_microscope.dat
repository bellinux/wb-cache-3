40|$|Recently a {{new high}} energy proton {{microscopy}} facility PRIOR (<b>Proton</b> <b>Microscope</b> for FAIR) has been designed, constructed and successfully commissioned at GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung (Darmstadt, Germany). As {{a result of the}} experiments with 3. 5 - 4. 5 GeV proton beams delivered by the heavy ion synchrotron SIS- 18 of GSI, 30 um spatial and 10 ns temporal resolutions of the <b>proton</b> <b>microscope</b> have been demostrated. A new pulsed power setup for studying properties of matter under extremes has been developed for the dynamic commissioning of the PRIOR facility. This paper describes the PRIOR setup as well as the results of the first static and dynamic proton radiography experiments performed at GSI.

40|$|The charged {{particle}} community {{is looking for}} techniques exploiting proton interactions instead of X-ray absorption for creating images of human tissue. Due to multiple Coulomb scattering inside the measured object it has shown to be highly non-trivial to achieve sufficient spatial resolution. We present imaging of biological tissue with a <b>proton</b> <b>microscope.</b> This device relies on magnetic optics, distinguishing it from most published proton imaging methods. For these methods reducing the data acquisition time to a clinically acceptable level {{has turned out to}} be challenging. In a <b>proton</b> <b>microscope,</b> data acquisition and processing are much simpler. This device even allows imaging in real time. The primary medical application will be image guidance in proton radiosurgery. Proton images demonstrating the potential for this application are presented. Tomographic reconstructions are included to raise awareness of the possibility of high-resolution proton tomography using magnetooptics...|$|E
40|$|Protons having {{energies}} in the GeV range {{have been}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} Bragg-peak hadron therapy. This strategy reduces lateral scattering and overcomes uncertainties of particle range and relative biological effectiveness. GeV protons could additionally be used for targeting in image guided stereotactic radiosurgery. We experimentally demonstrated the potential of GeV protons for imaging of biological samples using E= 0. 8 GeV protons and the pRad setup at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). In this setup, a system of magnetic lenses creates a point-to-point mapping from object to detector. This mapping compensates image blur due to lateral scattering inside the imaged (biological) object. We produced 2 -dim proton radiographs of biological samples, an anthropomorphic phantom and performed simple dosimetry. High resolution tomographic reconstructions were derived from the 2 -dim proton radiographs. Our experiment was performed {{within the framework of the}} PANTERA (Proton Therapy and Radiography) project. In the future, the <b>proton</b> <b>microscope</b> PRIOR (<b>Proton</b> <b>Microscope</b> for FAIR) located in the FAIR facility (Darmstadt), will focus on optimizing the technique for imaging of lesions implanted in animals and couple the irradiation with standard radiotherapy...|$|E
40|$|A <b>proton</b> <b>microscope</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} for radiography applications using the 800 -MeV linear accelerator at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). The microscope provides a magnified image of a static device, or of a dynamic event such as a high-speed projectile impacting a target. The microscope assembly consists primarily of four Permanent Magnet Quadrupoles (PMQ's) that are supported on movable platforms. The platform supports, {{along with the rest}} of the support structure, are designed to withstand the residual dynamic loads that are expected from the dynamic tests. This paper covers the mechanical design of the microscope assembly, including the remote positioning system that allows for fine-tuning the focus of an object being imaged...|$|E
40|$|A {{radiographic}} {{setup for}} an investigation of fast dynamic processes with areal density of targets up to 5 g/cm$^ 2 $ is under development {{on the basis of}} high-current proton linear accelerator at the Institute for Nuclear Research (Troitsk, Russia). A virtual model of the <b>proton</b> <b>microscope</b> developed in a software toolkit Geant 4 is presented in the article. Full-scale Monte-Carlo numerical simulation of static radiographic experiments at energy of a proton beam 247 MeV was performed. The results of simulation of proton radiography experiments with static model of shock-compressed xenon are presented. The results of visualization of copper and polymethyl methacrylate step wedges static targets also described. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|Proton {{radiography}} or microscopy {{is a novel}} {{technique for}} probing the interior of dense objects in dynamic experiments by mono-energetic beams of GeV-energy protons. A special system of magnetic lenses is employed for imaging and aberrations correction. Using this technique, one can measure areal density of a thick sample with sub-percent accuracy. The spatial resolution is a few micrometers over a centimeter-wide field of view, whereas the time resolution is on the nanosecond scale. Recently an international project PRIOR (<b>Proton</b> <b>Microscope</b> for FAIR) [1] was started for developing of a new proton microscopy facility {{according to the requirements}} of the HEDgeHOB collaboration experiments at FAIR. The PRIOR microscope will be able to initially be fielded at GSI for testing and commissioning with the same SIS- 18 proton beam as later used at FAIR. Its installation at the HHT experimental area of GSI and commissioning in static and dynamic experiments with a 4. 5 GeV proton beam from the SIS- 18 synchrotron is currently under discussion. The PRIOR magnetic lens system is designed utilizing quadrupole magnets as focusing elements. The most cost effective quadrupole technology for both fabrication and operation costs are permanent magnet quadrupoles (PMQ) constructed from rare earth permanent magnet material (REPM). Having a small aperture, PMQ can reach high field gradients while maintaining high magnetization. PMQ were successfully employed in proton microscopes for 0. 8 GeV proton beams at LANL [2] and at ITEP [3]. A prototype of the PRIOR PMQ with a 15 mm aperture and 238 T/m magnetic field gradient has been recently constructed at ITEP. For enlarging the field of view of the imaging optics, 30 mm aperture PMQs are also considered for PRIOR.

40|$|High-energy proton {{microscopy}} provides unique {{capabilities in}} penetrating radiography including {{the combination of}} high spatial resolution and field-of-view, dynamic range of density for measurements, and reconstructing density variations to less than 1 % inside volumes and in situ environments. We have recently proposed to exploit this novel proton radiography technique for image-guided stereotactic particle radiosurgery. Results of a first test for imaging biological and tissue-equivalent targets with high-energy (800 MeV) proton microscopy are presented here. Although we used a <b>proton</b> <b>microscope</b> setup at ITEP (Moscow, Russia) optimized for fast dynamic experiments in material research, we could reach a spatial resolution of 150 μm with approximately 1010 protons per image. The potential of obtaining high-resolution online imaging of the target using a therapeutic proton beam in the GeV energy region suggests that high-energy proton microscopy {{may be used for}} image-guided proton radiosurgery. © 2012 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica...|$|E
