40|$|The master’s thesis {{deals with}} the {{piezoelectric}} coefficients, the resonance frequency and especially the piezoelectric constants verification. With the assistance of several devices, for instance LCR-meter HIOKI 3532, impedance analyzer Agilent 4294 A and LCR-meter Agilent E 4980 A, the resonance and the anti-resonance frequencies as well as impedance and capacitance of samples are measured. The paper opens with {{the theory of the}} piezoelectric phenomenon and the difference between direct and indirect piezoelectric phenomenon, it also describes the basic behaviour of a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>element</b> during mechanical straining or applied voltage. Further, the paper concerns the description of various piezoelectric constants and their calculations. Subsequent part of the paper is devoted to the temperature dependence of the main piezoelectric parameters of PZT ceramics. The materials coefficients are delineated as a function of temperature of the piezoelectric charge coefficients dij, relative permittivity r, electromechanical coupling factor kij and frequency constants Ni. One of the chapters also determines the piezoelectric charge constant d 33 of PZT ceramics by laser interferometer and compares it with the value measured by resonance methods. The surface displacement was measured by a single-beam interferometer Polytec OFV- 5000. The results of measurements of piezoelectric charge coefficients d 33 acquired by the first and the second method are identical. The last section of the paper is focused on different methods of experimental studies on the characteristics of heat transfer by diffusing heat through conduction between the silver-plated surface of cylinder made of PZT ceramics. The effect on the resonance and the anti-resonance frequencies is monitored. There after, the real heat, determined by thermo camera and the physical model of heat transfer created in program COMSOL Multiphysics, is analysed...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} a successful extension of passive R–L shunt damping to <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>elements</b> working in direct 3 - 3 mode and {{a performance comparison}} to elements working in indirect 3 - 1 mode. A new circuit topology is implemented to synthesize the very large inductances required by the low inherent piezoelectric device capacitance at relatively low frequencies. This allows for efficient tuning of the R–L circuit to the structure resonance frequency to be damped. The vibration suppression performance of monolithic <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>ceramic</b> actuators and active fiber composites is compared in this study. For this purpose, different actuators are bonded on aluminum cantilever plates. An integrated FE model is implemented for the prediction of structure resonance frequencies, optimum values for electric components, and the resulting vibration suppression performance. The passive structure, bonded active patch, and shunted electrical network are analyzed within the same FE model. Active fiber composite patches working in the direct 3 - 3 mode show equivalent specific damping performance compared to conventional monolithic 3 - 1 actuated patches. Issues related to the sensitivity of R–L shunts to variations in environmental and operational conditions are discussed in this study. In short, monolithic actuators operating on the 3 - 1 piezoelectric effect {{seem to be the}} best for use in R–L shunting.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for generating ultrasonic beams with spatial profiles of amplitude governed by a truncated Bessel function or Gaussian function [1, 2]. Bessel beams have very unique properties; in optics Bessel beams {{have been shown to}} be diffractionless (J. Durnin et al, 1987 [3, 4]). In a related work, R. W. Ziolkowski et al [5] reported experimental measurements of “acoustic directed energy pulse trains” generated by synthetic line array of ultrasonic transmitters in water. However, a Bessel function ultrasonic transducer has never been reported before. Gaussian beams also have desirable properties; they are very easy to model analytically, and a circular Gaussian function ultrasonic transducer is free of near-field nulls and far-field sidelobes associated with conventional “piston source” transducers [6]. At least three designs of Gaussian transducers have been reported in the literature in the past 30 years [7 – 9]. We report a method in which <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>elements</b> are poled with nonuniform electric fields shaped like Bessel or Gaussian functions such that the resulting polarization (and hence the ultrasonic amplitude) follows that of the applied poling field. Like conventional piston source transducers, such Bessel or Gaussian transducers also possess the simple “parallel plate capacitor” configuration and can be packaged likewise. Beam profiles and propagation behavior of these Bessel and Gaussian transducers have been measured experimentally in an immersion tank and the results compared well with model prediction...|$|R

Navy {{interest in the}} development of light-weight, low-volume, broadband, underwater acoustic projectors and receivers is the principal motivation for this research topic. Acoustic cymbal transducers, so named for their geometric similarity to the percussion instruments, are miniature "class V" flextensional transducers that consist of a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>ceramic</b> drive <b>element</b> bonded to two opposing cymbal-shaped metal shells. Operating as mechanical transformers, the two metal shells convert the naturally large generative force of a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>ceramic</b> in the radial mode into increased volume displacement at the metal shell surface to obtain usable source levels and sensitivities in a broad frequency range. The magnified displacement makes the acoustic cymbal element a potential alternative to acoustic transduction technologies presently used to generate and receive Navy sonar frequencies. Potential benefits to utilizing this technology are generating or receiving broadband sound, at sonar frequencies in a thin, low volume, conformable package. Applications of this technology have been limited because air-backed acoustic cymbal elements undergo degradation in performance when exposed to elevated hydrostatic pressure (i. e., deep ocean and extreme littoral water applications). This research shows that consistent and reliable acoustic performance can be achieved with cymbal-based transducers at hydrostatic pressures of interest to the Navy.

A high stiffness of the tuner system is also necessary both to ensure mechanical stability and to mitigate the frequency instabilities induced by perturbations.
