5|$|FH {{needs to}} be {{distinguished}} from familial combined hyperlipidemia and <b>polygenic</b> hypercholesterolemia. Lipid levels {{and the presence of}} xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare conditions that can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Some poison dart frogs species {{include a}} number of conspecific color morphs that emerged as {{recently}} as 6,000 years ago. Therefore, species such as Dendrobates tinctorius, Oophaga pumilio, and Oophaga granulifera can include color pattern morphs that can be interbred (colors are under <b>polygenic</b> control, while the actual patterns are probably controlled by a single locus). Differing coloration has historically misidentified single species as separate, {{and there is still}} controversy among taxonomists over classification.|$|E
5|$|There are no interventional {{studies that}} {{directly}} show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH. Rather, evidence of benefit {{is derived from}} a number of trials conducted in people who have <b>polygenic</b> hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} <b>polygenic</b> arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a <b>polygenic</b> risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the general}} {{structure}} of all antibodies is very similar, a small region {{at the tip}} of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is <b>polygenic,</b> made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.|$|E
25|$|Skin colour is a <b>polygenic</b> trait, {{which means}} that several {{different}} genes are involved in determining a specific phenotype. Many genes work together in complex, additive, and non-additive combinations to determine the skin colour of an individual. The skin colour variations are normally distributed from light to dark, as it is usual for <b>polygenic</b> traits.|$|E
25|$|The {{intrahepatic}} shunts {{found in}} large dog breeds are passed on {{in a simple}} autosomal recessive way, while the extrahepatic shunts of the small breeds are inherited on a <b>polygenic</b> basis.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that many {{conditions}} are <b>polygenic</b> meaning there are multiple defective genes rather than only one {{that are responsible for}} a disorder. Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's are both examples of hereditary mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{speed of}} the faster gazelle could {{be caused by a}} single gene, be <b>polygenic,</b> or be fully {{environmentally}} determined, but the unit of selection in this case is the individual since speed is a property of each individual gazelle.|$|E
25|$|In dogs, hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormal {{formation of the}} hip socket that, in its more severe form, can eventually cause crippling lameness and painful arthritis of the joints. It is a genetic (<b>polygenic)</b> trait that is affected by environmental factors. It is common in many dog breeds, particularly the larger breeds.|$|E
25|$|CAE is {{a complex}} <b>polygenic</b> disorder. Particularly in the Han Chinese {{population}} there is association between mutations in CACNA1H and CAE. These mutations cause increased channel activity and associated increased neuronal excitability. Seizures are believed to originate in the thalamus, where there is an abundance of T-type calcium channels such as those encoded by CACNA1H.|$|E
25|$|A study {{concluded}} that a polymorphism was associated with higher fasting insulin levels in the obese patients only. These findings {{support the hypothesis that}} the melanocortin pathway may modulate glucose metabolism in obese subjects indicating a possible gene-environment interaction. POMC variant may be involved in the natural history of <b>polygenic</b> obesity, contributing to the link between type 2 diabetes and obesity.|$|E
25|$|In dogs, hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormal {{formation of the}} hip socket that, in its more severe form, can eventually cause crippling lameness and painful arthritis of the joints. It is a genetic (<b>polygenic)</b> trait that is affected by environmental factors. It is common in many dog breeds, particularly the larger breeds, and {{is the most common}} single cause of arthritis of the hips.|$|E
25|$|A mode of {{inheritance}} {{is currently}} unknown, {{but it is}} most probably <b>polygenic.</b> Research has also demonstrated that fibromyalgia is potentially associated with polymorphisms of genes in the serotoninergic, dopaminergic and catecholaminergic systems. However, these polymorphisms are not specific for fibromyalgia and {{are associated with a}} variety of allied disorders (e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome) and with depression. Individuals with the 5-HT2A receptor 102T/C polymorphism {{have been found to be}} at increased risk of developing fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|Diversity of antigen presentation, {{mediated}} by MHC classes I and II, is attained {{in at least}} three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repertoire is <b>polygenic</b> (via multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); (3) MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (diversely varying from organism to organism within a species). Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} genetics, if genes A and B are mutated, {{and each}} mutation by itself produces a unique phenotype {{but the two}} mutations together show the same phenotype as the gene A mutation, then gene A is epistatic and gene B is hypostatic. For example, the gene for total baldness is epistatic to the gene for brown hair. In this sense, epistasis can be contrasted with genetic dominance, which is an interaction between alleles at the same gene locus. As the study of genetics developed, and {{with the advent of}} molecular biology, epistasis started to be studied in relation to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and <b>polygenic</b> inheritance.|$|E
25|$|In insects {{it opens}} sodium ion {{channels}} in neurons, {{causing them to}} fire spontaneously, which leads to spasms and eventual death. Insects with certain mutations in their sodium channel gene are resistant to DDT and similar insecticides. DDT resistance is also conferred by up-regulation of genes expressing cytochrome P450 in some insect species, as greater quantities of some enzymes of this group accelerate the toxin's metabolism into inactive metabolites. (The same enzyme family is up-regulated in mammals too, e.g., in response to ethanol consumption.) Genomic studies in the model genetic organism Drosophila melanogaster revealed that high level DDT resistance is <b>polygenic,</b> involving multiple resistance mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Nemrut is a <b>polygenic</b> {{stratovolcano}} {{located in}} the collision zone of the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates, which determines the seismic and volcanic activity in the region. The collision of these plates began in the Middle Eocene and closed the stretch of water, which in the Mesozoic formed the Tethys Ocean. Nemrut, along with three other extinct volcanoes of eastern Turkey: Ararat, Tendürek and Süphan, is {{located in the}} area of a complex fault, which runs along the boundary of the Arabian and Eurasian plates in the territory of the Armenian Highland. It is the westernmost of these volcanoes, the only one that remains active, and generally the only volcano in Anatolia, which erupted in the historical period. Nemrut is located 10km north of the city Tatvan, in the north-western shore of Lake Van.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{may also}} be complex, multifactorial, or <b>polygenic,</b> meaning they are likely associated {{with the effects of}} multiple genes in combination with lifestyles and environmental factors. Multifactorial disorders include heart disease and diabetes. Although complex disorders often cluster in families, {{they do not have a}} clear-cut pattern of inheritance. This makes it difficult to determine a person’s risk of inheriting or passing on these disorders. Complex disorders are also difficult to study and treat, because the specific factors that cause most of these disorders have not yet been identified. Studies which aim to identify the cause of complex disorders can use several methodological approaches to determine genotype-phenotype associations. One method, the genotype-first approach, starts by identifying genetic variants within patients and then determining the associated clinical manifestations. This is opposed to the more traditional phenotype-first approach, and may identify causal factors that have previously been obscured by clinical heterogeneity, penetrance, and expressivity.|$|E
25|$|All {{researched}} psychological {{traits are}} influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees. These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother {{in his or her}} (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental behavioral genetic research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior. Traditionally this research has been conducted using twin studies and adoption studies, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome-wide association studies. One goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in Huntington's: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly <b>polygenic,</b> where a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic variants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder. Active research continues to understand the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction.|$|E
500|$|Guttural Pouch Tympany (GPT) {{occurs in}} horses ranging {{from birth to}} 1 year of age and {{is more common in}} fillies than in colts. It is thought to be genetic in Arabians, {{possibly}} <b>polygenic</b> in inheritance, but more study is needed. Foals are born with a defect that causes the pharyngeal opening of the eustachian tube to act like a one-way valve [...] air can get in, but it cannot get out. The affected guttural pouch is distended with air and forms a characteristic nonpainful swelling. Breathing is noisy in severely affected animals. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and radiographic examination of the skull. Medical management with NSAID and antimicrobial therapy can treat upper respiratory tract inflammation. Surgical intervention is needed to correct the malformation of the guttural pouch opening, to provide a route for air in the abnormal guttural pouch to pass to the normal side and be expelled into the pharynx. Foals that are successfully treated may grow up to have fully useful lives.|$|E
500|$|Other critics {{believed}} that Wilson's theories, {{as well as}} the works of subsequent admirers, were not supported scientifically. Objections were raised to many of the ethnocentric assumptions of early sociobiology (like ignoring female gatherers in favour of male hunters in hunter-gatherer societies) and to the sampling and mathematical methods used in informing conclusions. Many of Wilson's less well supported conclusions were attacked (for example, Wilson's mathematical treatment of inheritance as involving a single gene per trait, even though he admitted that traits could be <b>polygenic).</b> Sociobiologists were accused of being [...] "super" [...] adaptationists, or panadaptationist, believing that every aspect of morphology and behaviour must necessarily be an evolutionarily beneficial adaptation. Philosophical debates about the nature of scientific truth and the applicability of any human reason to a subject so complex as human behaviour, considering past failures, raged. Describing the controversy, Eric Holtzmans noted that [...] "Given the baleful history of misuse of biology in justifying or designing social policies and practices, authors who attempt to consider human sociobiology have special responsibilities that are not adequately discharged by the usual academic caveats." ...|$|E
500|$|Analyzing {{the results}} of the Maudsley–Bethlem study, Gottesman and Shields devised the multi-element, <b>polygenic</b> {{causation}} model for schizophrenia by modeling schizophrenia diagnoses using the recently introduced liability-threshold model. The book that summarized and expanded on the study, Schizophrenia and Genetics: A Twin Study Vantage Point, argued that schizophrenia is a product of several genes acting together, and introduced the techniques of precise analysis in the field of behavioral genetics.Gottesman and Shields introduced terms such as [...] "reaction ranges/surface", [...] "endophenotype" [...] and [...] "epigenetic puzzle" [...] into the behavioral sciences. The threshold model hypothesized that both genetic and environmental risks combined to produce schizophrenia, and pushed an individual into a diagnosable condition when their influence grew strong enough. The reaction range concept is the idea that the genes and the environment control behavior, but with separate upper and lower limits on the strength of that control in each case, a concept now part of basic psychology. Before the study, the prevailing opinion was that schizophrenia originated from bad parental relationships. The researchers showed identical twins were more likely to either have or not have schizophrenia together, concluding the disorder was the [...] "outcome of a genetically determined developmental predisposition".|$|E
500|$|Nearly all Cavaliers {{eventually}} {{suffer from}} {{disease of the}} mitral valve, with heart murmurs which may progressively worsen, leading to heart failure. This condition is <b>polygenic</b> (affected by multiple genes), and therefore all lines of Cavaliers worldwide are susceptible. It {{is the leading cause}} of death in the breed. A survey by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom showed that 42.8% of Cavalier deaths are cardiac related. The next most common causes are cancer (12.3%) and old age (12.2%). The condition can begin to emerge at an early age and statistically may be expected to be present in more than half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by age 5. It is rare for a 10-year-old Cavalier not to have a heart murmur. While heart disease is common in dogs generally– one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems– mitral valve disease is generally (as in humans) a disease of old age. The [...] "hinge" [...] on the heart's mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate, along with the valve's flaps, causing a heart murmur (as blood seeps through the valve between heartbeats) then congestive heart failure. The Cavalier is particularly susceptible to early-onset heart disease, which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age.|$|E

2500|$|Galton {{explicitly}} {{rejected the}} idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (Lamarckism), and was an early proponent of [...] "hard heredity" [...] through selection alone. He came close to rediscovering Mendel's particulate theory of inheritance, but was prevented from making the final breakthrough in this regard because of his focus on continuous, rather than discrete, traits (now known as <b>polygenic</b> traits). He went on to found the biometric approach to the study of heredity, distinguished by its use of statistical techniques to study continuous traits and population-scale aspects of heredity.|$|E
2500|$|Host genetic factors play a {{major role}} in {{determining}} differential susceptibility to major infectious diseases of humans. [...] Infectious diseases of humans appear highly <b>polygenic</b> with many loci implicated but only a minority of these convincingly replicated. Over the course of time humans have been exposed to organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. [...] It is possible that the human genome has evolved in part from our exposure to M. tuberculosis. Animal model studies and whole genome screens can be used to identify potential regions on a gene that suggest evidence of tuberculosis susceptibility. [...] In the case of M. tuberculosis, animal model studies were used to suggest evidence of a locus which was correlated with susceptibility, further studies were done to prove the link between the suggested locus. [...] The genetic loci that have been identified to be associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis are HLA-DR, INF-γ, SLC11A1, VDR, MAL/TIRAP, and CCL2. Further studies will be needed to determine genetic susceptibility to other infectious diseases and ways public health officials can prevent and test for these infections to enhance the concept of personalized medicine.|$|E

5000|$|In modern sense, the {{inheritance}} mode of <b>polygenic</b> patterns is called <b>polygenic</b> inheritance, whose main properties may {{be summarized as}} follows: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Polygenic</b> {{inheritance}} {{refers to}} inheritance of a phenotypic characteristic (trait) that {{is attributable to}} two or more genes and can be measured quantitatively. Multifactorial inheritance refers to <b>polygenic</b> inheritance that also includes interactions with the environment. Unlike monogenic traits, <b>polygenic</b> traits do not follow patterns of Mendelian inheritance (discrete categories). Instead, their phenotypes typically vary along a continuous gradient depicted by a bell curve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polygenic</b> locus is any {{individual}} locus which {{is included in}} the system of genes responsible for the genetic component of variation in a quantitative (<b>polygenic)</b> character. Allelic substitutions contribute to the variance in a specified quantitative character. <b>Polygenic</b> locus may be either a single or complex genetic locus in the conventional sense, i.e., either a single gene or closely linked block of functionally related genes.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, many {{traits are}} {{produced}} by the interaction of several genes. Traits controlled by two or more genes {{are said to be}} <b>polygenic</b> traits. <b>Polygenic</b> means [...] "many genes." [...] For example, at least three genes are involved in making the reddish-brown pigment in the eyes of fruit flies. <b>Polygenic</b> traits often show a wide range of phenotypes. The broad variety of skin color in humans comes about partly because at least four different genes probably control this trait.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polygenic</b> {{characters}} show {{a continuous}} rather than discontinuous distribution.|$|E
50|$|The {{paradigm}} of <b>polygenic</b> inheritance as {{being used to}} define multifactorial disease has encountered much disagreement. Turnpenny (2004) discusses how simple <b>polygenic</b> inheritance cannot explain some diseases such as the onset of Type I diabetes mellitus, and that in cases such as these, not all genes are thought to make an equal contribution.|$|E
