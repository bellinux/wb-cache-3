5|$|One of Bart's early {{hallmarks}} was his <b>prank</b> {{calls to}} Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe {{and asks for}} a gag name.

5|$|Both <b>prank</b> and {{intentionally}} deadly exploding cigars {{have been}} featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the exploding cigar in literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow.

Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an exploding cigar to Uncle Sam, and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding cigar.|$|E

50|$|In 1838, <b>Pranker</b> {{purchased}} {{an abandoned}} mill in Saugus, Massachusetts. He renovated the mill and installed new machinery. At his mill, <b>Pranker</b> {{engaged in the}} manufacturing of flannel and bed sheets. Although {{the conditions of the}} wool business in general were extremely poor during the mill's first years of operation, the business was a success. In 1840, he was able to pay off the bond on the property. By 1846, Pranker's business had grown so much that he had to build a second mill. Also in 1846, <b>Pranker</b> enlarged a dam on the Saugus River by two feet, which raised the water level of a pond that bears his name. In 1857, <b>Pranker,</b> his son George <b>Pranker,</b> and John Armitage incorporated the Edward <b>Pranker</b> & Co. textile firm. Also that year, <b>Pranker</b> had frame buildings constructed for wool pulling and sheepskin tanning. In 1860 he built another mill {{on the opposite side of}} the road. <b>Pranker</b> remained involved with the business until his death in 1865.|$|R

50|$|In 1865, Edward <b>Pranker</b> {{died and}} {{ownership}} of the mill passed to his son George <b>Pranker</b> and son-in-law John Parsons, who ran the business under the name <b>Pranker</b> & Co. In February 1866, a fire damaged the two adjoining brick mills. As {{a result of the}} damage, the older mill was reduced from three stories to two. To compensate, a fourth floor was added to the building built in 1846. In 1870, <b>Pranker</b> and Parsons brought some of the younger members of the family into the business. In 1877, both <b>Pranker</b> and Parsons died and operations were suspended for two years. In April 1879, six of Edward Pranker's grandchildren formed the <b>Pranker</b> Manufacturing Company, which manufactured wool shirts, dresses, flannels, and sacks. In 1884, a one hundred foot high round brick chimney was constructed next to the building housing the mill's boiler. <b>Pranker</b> Manufacturing Company ran the mills until 1898, when operations were suspended until a settlement was reached with the company's creditors. That year, the business was reorganized as the Saugus Woolen Manufacturing Co. George Parsons, one of Edward Pranker's grandsons, served as the company's president. The mill operated under this arrangement for a few years before the mill went idle and the property was offered for sale.|$|R
