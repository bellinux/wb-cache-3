25|$|In February 1925 Adele died of meningitis. Shortly {{afterwards}} Gustav {{filed for}} probate; he included {{a document that}} stated that the clause in the will was <b>precatory,</b> i.e. a request rather than a binding testament. He added that Ferdinand had said he would honour the clause, even though he, not Adele, was the legal owner of the paintings. The works by Klimt which Ferdinand owned, including the two portraits, were moved to Adele's bedroom as a shrine to her. The painting was lent for an exhibition at the Vienna Secession in 1928 to mark the tenth anniversary of Klimt's death; in 1934 it was displayed in London {{as part of the}} Austria in London exhibition. In 1936 Ferdinand gave Schloss Kammer am Attersee III to the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere; he later acquired a further Klimt painting, the Portrait of Amalie Zuckerkandl (1917–1918). In 1937 the golden portrait of Adele was lent for display at the Paris Exposition.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is merely to examine the {{pertinent}} antitrust issues. The essay proceeds {{on the assumption that}} the AALS policy, whose terms are <b>precatory,</b> speaks to what is in fact an agreement among law schools. As noted below, the policy itself contemplates that law school deans will seek waivers, in individual cases, extending the time periods for up to two months. Were the policy to be litigated, law schools might dispute the existence of an agreement. We believe, though, that the nature of the policy strongly suggests that it represents an agreement among law schools and that any litigation would yield consistent evidence. Nothing in our individual experiences as faculty members suggests otherwise. 6 Reviewing the policy on that basis, we conclude that the policy violates federal antitrust law...|$|E

Since international law derives from the practice of states, {{how is it that}} what states do becomes what they must do? How do we get bindingness or normativity out of empirical fact? We have to avoid the Humean fallacy of attempting to derive an ought from an is. Yet we can find in nature at least one norm that is compelling: the norm of survival. This norm is hardwired into our brains through evolution. It is also hardwired into the international legal system that has survived for four thousand years. In every dispute or controversy, the international legal system weighs in on the side of peaceful and stable resolution [...] simply because that is in the system 2 ̆ 7 s interest of self-perpetuation. In sum, it is internaitonal law itself that selects from state actions those actions most conducive to the peaceful resolution of disputes and formulates them as rules and precedents of the system...|$|E
40|$|Legal {{academics}} and practitioners {{have engaged in}} intense elaboration and defence of differing perspectives about the appropriate standard of corporate conduct, and unresolved debates surrounding this contemporary legal issue have proved intractable. The classical scholarship has become ghettoised in self-supporting ecosystems of inflexible exchange. Of necessity, a new conceptual approach has been proposed to address in an affirmative fashion the inevitable penumbra of uncertainty and institutional indeterminacy of corporate law, specifically in regard to stipulating an appropriate standard of corporate behaviour for the myriad of organisational activity. This is the Equitable Maximisation and Viability principle (EMV). This paper focuses on providing for some meaningful enforceable standards that ensure the principle is not <b>precatory.</b> Before this can be undertaken, it considers in a systematic and comprehensive manner corollary questions as to whether substantive private enforcement procedures can, and should, be used to monitor and challenge directors’ decision making. These insights allow the paper {{to open up the}} enforcement issue. The principal part of the paper identifies and examines various alternative ways of enforcing the principle and then argues for the use of one credible mechanism...|$|E
40|$|This thesis re-examines the law {{of secret}} trusts and the doctrinal {{justification}} for enforcing a legatee's promise to a testator to apply his inheritance {{for the benefit of}} a third party nominated by the testator. It critically appraises, in terms of both case law and theory, the justifications presented by the fraud and dehors the will theories. Commencing with a review of the law on past and present testamentary formalities, it presents evidence that the modem dehors the will theory is a throwback to early misunderstanding about the relationship of informal testamentary trusts to wills. The testamentary nature of secret trusts is confirmed by an examination of probate case law defining a will and an analysis of the functions of the Wills Act formalities excludes the notion of an implied statutory exception for secret trusts. A review of <b>precatory</b> secret trust case law indicates how the law has developed based on a conventional assumption as to the nature of testators' secret instructions. The thesis also re-considers limits to the fraud-based constructive trust jurisdiction assumed to have endured the demise of the special probate courts. The thesis offers a new approach for English law based on accommodating the legatee's moral duty within a contingent restitutionary principle of personal fraud...|$|E
40|$|The reformulated duty {{of loyalty}} now found in s 172 of the Companies Act 2006 {{has been seen}} as imprecise or an {{ambiguous}} development for directors’ duties. It has generated debate about what is the best reading of the duty, the most fundamental aspect of which is whether this behavioural standard obliges a narrow focus on financial capital or a broader notion of well-being and inclusiveness amongst nonshareholder interests. This article argues that the law as a privileged and constitutive way of society-making can only be understood within a broader conceptual framework rather than the more traditional expository analysis of law. The context in which such an analysis takes place is that of the anti-collectivist, marketbased political project of neoliberalsm. When viewed through this explanatory lens, we see very clearly that English legal doctrine codifies an embedded relationship between managers and shareholders. In doing so, the article shows that the extraction of private benefits of control by shareholders is not an inevitable occurrence, but a decades-long, human-created and contingent phenomenon. While non-shareholder interests are introduced into the duty, this <b>precatory</b> element is merely a potential source of legitimacy to the ideology of the company as a private, exclusively shareholder-oriented enterprise...|$|E
40|$|Psalm 137 and {{metrical}} {{versions of}} imprecatory psalms This article discusses seven metrical {{versions of the}} im- <b>precatory</b> section of Psalm 137, two in Dutch (1773 and 1968), two in English (in the “Psalter hymnal” of the Christian Re- formed Church and in “Sing psalms” of the Free Church of Scotland) and three Afrikaans versions (J. D. du Toit, T. T. Cloete and Lina Spies), looking at {{the way in which}} these versions treated this section. This is done in the light of recent research on Psalm 137, and especially the imprecatory section. In the literature questions are asked about the singing of this kind of psalm in the church, but also about the omission or softening of this part of Psalm 137 in the versions of Cloete and Spies. The choice of melody, the number of strophes used and the division of the contents of the psalm in strophes {{play an important role in}} determining most of the omissions or alle- viations in the metrical versions. All seven the versions dis- cussed took the imprecatory section seriously. The problems raised against these versions can be ascribed to these choices, and not to a deliberate attempt to circumvent the problem of such an imprecatory section. The version of Spies is the only exception, with the omission of the last line of the psalm...|$|E
40|$|Knowing {{that work}} is a site of {{intimacy}} between coworkers does not tell us [...] as lawyers and public policy designers [...] what should change to accommodate this new knowledge. Rosenbury rightly emphasizes that this deeper understanding of intimate networks at work should enrich and modify our pursuit of antidiscrimination norms in the workplace. On the one hand, we might wish to allow friends to prefer one another at work in order to reinforce the social institution of friendship that does so much to sustain us. On the other hand, the dangers of homophily [...] the robust sociological finding that we tend to sort ourselves into intimate networks of people like ourselves [...] become apparent when we see that courts {{are less likely to}} find sex-based or racial discrimination when someone at work prefers a friend, even though those preferred friends {{are most likely to be}} of the same race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and nationality as the ones defending themselves from charges of discrimination. Rosenbury focuses us on this dilemma, but doesn 2 ̆ 7 t furnish us with any comforting answers. In the spirit of this forum, I have two thoughts to share to supplement Rosenbury 2 ̆ 7 s provocative (though <b>precatory)</b> work in this volume. My hope is that these comments are useful to the ultimate research agenda Rosenbury will pursue in forthcoming papers about intimacy in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|Abstract * The U. S. {{corporate}} governance {{system is a}} "representative " shareholder democracy (director primacy and manager discretion, fiduciary/professional duties and aspirational preferences, reputational- and self-enforcement mechanisms), conceptually similar to Karl Popper's open society. The system is a semi-personal exchange, repeated game that helps to offset the three fundamental conflicts of principal-agency in {{corporate governance}}. From an architectural perspective, the U. S. system is a model-reference adaptive control system with three feedback mechanisms (the stock market, the material disclosure system, and the proxy solicitation system) that admit shareholder criticism (exit, voice, and <b>precatory</b> judgment). Constructive shareholder criticism pushes firms to adapt, brings problems to their boards ' attention, and prods their managers {{to solve the problems}} early on before they fester and grow. The U. S. system relies on fiduciaries (outside directors) and professionals (public auditors). The current crisis of investor confidence can be attributed to their failure to carry out their public responsibilities, which has significantly increased the measurement and enforcement costs of public equity ownership. Representative democracy provides for the economizing of virtue. Restoring investor confidence will require the continual reinforcement of aspirational preferences for virtuous conduct by fiduciaries and professionals. The current crisis can also be attributed to the inability of corporations in economic distress to problem-solve. Representative democracy also facilitates problem-solving through time. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the U. S. corporate governance system (Allen, 1999) from the perspectives of North’s framework of institutional analysis (1990 a) and Popper’s political philosophy of open society (1944 a-b), (1988). Along the lines of a recently proposed problem-solving model of economic behavior (Mantzavinos, 2001), open society is based on the adaptive behavior paradigm (Popper, 1994) : “All life is problem-solving. ” The paradigm can be summarized by Popper’s four-stage methodology of science (1979) ...|$|E
