40|$|The reserves, {{production}} from mines, supply of aluminium {{to society and}} mass fluxes of aluminium in society was assessed using an integrated systems dynamics model (ALUMINIUM) in order to reconstruct the past and investigate potential future scenarios. The investigations for input data show that the mine- able aluminium reserves are large, but finite.

Continuing business-as-usual consumption with sustained global population growth above 7 billion people combined with a decline in cheap fossil fuels, aluminium may in the long perspective be a more expensive product than today.

40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production</b> is {{a highly}} {{energy-intensive}} and greenhouse gas (GHG) -emitting process responsible for about 1 % of global GHG emissions. In 2009, the two most energy-intensive processes in <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production,</b> alumina refining and aluminium smelting consumed 3. 1 EJ, of which 2 EJ was electricity for aluminium smelting, about 8 % of the electricity use in the global industrial sector. The demand for aluminium {{is expected to increase}} significantly over the next decades, continuing the upward trend in energy use and GHGs. The wide implementation of energy efficiency measures can cut down GHG emissions and assist in the transition towards a more sustainable primary aluminium industry. In this study, 22 currently available energy efficiency measures are assessed, and cost-supply curves are constructed to determine the technical and the cost-effective energy and GHG savings potentials. The implementation of all measures was estimated to reduce the 2050 primary energy use by 31 % in alumina refining and by 9 % in <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production</b> (excluding alumina refining) when compared to a “frozen efficiency” scenario. When compared to a “business-as-usual” (BAU) scenario, the identified energy savings potentials are lower, 12 and 0. 9 % for alumina refining and <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production</b> (excluding alumina refining), respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{worldwide}} {{aluminium industry}} has made good progress in reducing emissions of PFCs {{over the last}} decade and continues to work toward achieving further reductions. Depending on the technology type, a further lowering of emissions is both technically and economically feasi-ble for many plants.

40|$|A multiregional {{input-output}} model {{representing the}} world in the year 2000 was constructed based on statistical data, and combined with process specific data on a primary aluminium supply chain, to create a model of the global primary aluminium industry. Using input-output methodology, total emissions of eight substances due to <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production,</b> their size and origins, were estimated and expressed in terms of global warming potential (GWP) and acidification potential (AP). Simulations from 2000 to 2030 were run based on final demand estimates from external GDP projections and three assumed development scenarios. The baseline, scenario 0, assumed no changes in technologies or relative production and trade patterns - only the model's response to the expected change in final demand was analyzed. By contrast, both scenarios 1 and 2 assumed that the additional aluminium production predicted by the baseline would be produced exclusively in China. Scenario 2 employed the added assumption that the Norwegian aluminium production would experience a steady decline from its 2000 level to zero by 2030. The baseline scenario showed rapidly increasing aluminium output towards 2030, following the expected GDP developments. Emissions followed the same trend, increasing about 3. 3 times over the three decades. As for total cradle-to-gate impacts of <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production,</b> the model showed large variations from one region to another. Emissions per ton of Chinese primary aluminium were high relative to most other regions, hence the total global GWP and AP from <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production</b> rose more rapidly in scenarios 1 and 2 than in scenario 0. By 2030, the GWP in scenarios 1 and 2 were 11. 4 % and 12. 5 higher than in the baseline, while AP were 50. 0 and 51. 9 higher. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production</b> {{requires}} {{huge amounts}} of electricity. The cost of electricity is thus of great importance for firms in the industry. Electricity prices {{in the western world}} tends to increase over time {{at the same time as}} many producers face expiring long term power contracts, thus resulting in increased production costs and reduced competitiveness. Hence, reports from media suggest a growing tendency towards a re-location of capacity to countries capable of offering cheap electricity. This study was carried out in order to shed further light on which factors firms in the industry consider in their choice of location for investments. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the determinants of investment in <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production</b> and asses how these determinants affect location choice for investments. Using smelter-level data on a majority of the world’s primary producers, a count data analysis was performed in order to asses the impact of factor prices and agglomeration effects. Due to the lack of country-level data for key variables, smelters were grouped into 12 regions. Contrary to expectations, no significant evidence was found for the importance of electricity prices. However, access to cheap labour and agglomeration effects appears to attract investments. This implies that high levels of sunk costs make firms prone to upgrading existing capacity, but may also suggest that agglomeration effects such as technical know-how and industry infrastructure are considered in the choice of location for investments in new plants.

40|$|AbstractAim of {{this paper}} is to {{quantify}} and compare the environmental impact of <b>primary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>production</b> for the 29 major countries active in the primary aluminium value chain. The technology mix, electricity mix and heat mix vary a lot between countries. Different countries produce aluminium with different technologies, which can be translated into specific energy requirements and process efficiencies as well as different electricity inputs which is the main reason why the impact per unit mass is geographically dependent. The analysis illustrates this large difference among countries. A Life Cycle Assessment study was performed for comparison and comprehensive reasons based on two impact assessment methods; one at endpoint level and one using a midpoint indicator.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project is {{studying}} the factors affecting the growth of Aluminium Industry and predicting the production of Aluminium {{for the next two}} decades.

Consumption of Aluminium goes hand in hand with production. So a future prediction of Aluminium production is projected considering the Gross Domestic Product, Population, Power and Automobiles.
