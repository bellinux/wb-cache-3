5000|$|Methylparaben {{is readily}} absorbed from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{or through the}} skin. It is hydrolyzed to <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid and rapidly excreted in urine without accumulating in the body. [...] Acute toxicity {{studies have shown that}} methylparaben is practically non-toxic by both oral and parenteral administration in animals. In a population with normal skin, methylparaben is practically non-irritating and non-sensitizing; however, allergic reactions to ingested parabens have been reported.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid, {{also known}} as <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid (PHBA), is a monohydroxybenzoic acid, a {{phenolic}} derivative of benzoic acid. It is a white crystalline solid that is slightly soluble in water and chloroform but more soluble in polar organic solvents such as alcohols and acetone. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid is primarily known {{as the basis for}} the preparation of its esters, known as parabens, which are used as preservatives in cosmetics and some ophthalmic solutions. It is isomeric with 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, known as salicylic acid, a precursor to aspirin.|$|E
50|$|Paroxypropione {{is closely}} related {{structurally}} to <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid and parabens such as methylparaben, and also bears a close resemblance to diethylstilbestrol (which, in fact, produces paroxypropione as an active metabolite) and alkylphenols like nonylphenol, {{all of which are}} also estrogens. The drug possesses relatively low affinity for the estrogen receptor and must be given at high dosages to achieve significant estrogenic and antigonadotropic action, for instance, 0.8 to 1.6 g/day. It possesses 0.1% of the estrogenic activity of estrone and less than 0.5% of the antigonadotropic activity of estrone.|$|E
50|$|Having {{obtained}} a value for K0, {{a series of}} equilibrium constants (K) are now determined {{based on the same}} process, but now with variation of the para substituent—for instance, <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid (R=OH, R'=H) or p-aminobenzoic acid (R=NH2, R'=H). These values, combined in the Hammett equation with K0 and remembering that ρ = 1, give the para substituent constants compiled in table 1 for amine, methoxy, ethoxy, dimethylamino, methyl, fluorine, bromine, chlorine, iodine, nitro and cyano substituents. Repeating the process with meta-substituents afford the meta substituent constants. This treatment does not include ortho-substituents, which would introduce steric effects.|$|E
50|$|In soil, L. hoffmannii {{is thought}} {{primarily}} to be a decomposer of wood. To this end, L. hoffmannii is one of, {{if not the}} most important fungal agents of soft rot in preservative-treated wood. It, along with soft rot species of other genera, is known to metabolize aromatic compounds of low molecular weight; this includes nine phenolic compounds metabolized by L. hoffmannii itself, such as <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid, vanillic acid, and vanillin, to name a few. This allows for the utilization of part of the amorphous granular material, found in said phenolic compounds, which contains the lignin breakdown products produced in soft-rot activities.|$|E
50|$|The oil {{compartments}} in açaí fruit contain polyphenols such as procyanidin oligomers and vanillic acid, syringic acid, <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid, protocatechuic acid, and ferulic acid, {{which were}} shown to degrade substantially during storage or exposure to heat. Although these compounds are under study for potential health effects, there remains no substantial evidence that açaí polyphenols have any effect in humans. Açaí oil is green in color, has a bland aroma, and is high in oleic and palmitic fatty acids. The oil is suitable for cooking or as a salad dressing, but is mainly used in cosmetics as shampoos, soaps or skin moisturizers.|$|E
50|$|A unique {{class of}} {{partially}} crystalline aromatic polyesters based on <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid and related monomers, liquid-crystal polymers {{are capable of}} forming regions of highly ordered structure while in the liquid phase. However, the degree of order is somewhat {{less than that of}} a regular solid crystal. Typically, LCPs have a high mechanical strength at high temperatures, extreme chemical resistance, inherent flame retardancy, and good weatherability. Liquid-crystal polymers {{come in a variety of}} forms from sinterable high temperature to injection moldable compounds. LCPs can be welded, though the lines created by welding are a weak point in the resulting product. LCPs have a high Z-axis coefficient of thermal expansion.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} an API being studied would be that of Piracetam, or (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)acetamide, {{which is used to}} stimulate the central nervous system and thus, enhance {{learning}} and memory. Four polymorphs of Piracetam exist that involve hydrogen bonding of the carbonyl and primary amide. It is these same hydrogen bonding functional groups that interact with and enhance the cocrystallization of Piracetam with gentisic acid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and with <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid, an isomer of the aspirin precursor salicylic acid. No matter what the API is that is being researched, it is quite evident of the wide applicability and possibility for constant improvement in the realm of drug development, thus making it clear that the driving force of cocrystallization continues to consist of attempting to improve on the physical properties in which the existing cocrystals are lacking.|$|E
5000|$|The first toxic {{compound}} found in W. sebi was isolated and named walleminol A by Wood et al. in 1990 {{in their study}} on toxic metabolite of W. sebi. They suggested that walleminol A causes toxic effects in range of in vitro systems such as mammalian cell lines, protozoa and brine shrimp. [...] The toxin contains two hydroxyl groups, four methyl groups, {{and two or three}} ring structures in the molecule. [...] The molecular weight of this compound is 236. The toxicity level is comparable with mycotoxins like penicillic acid and citrinin. However, the toxic metabolite only applies in culture environment, the mycotoxin does not necessarily produce in food. A recent study on secondary metabolism of W. sebi found six compounds including walleminone, tryptophol, tryptophol, phenylacetic acid, <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid, and wallimidione. This study did not isolate walleminol like the previous studies did, but they found new metabolite, wallimidione.|$|E
50|$|Agaritine (1) {{was long}} thought by {{biologists}} to emanate from shikimate (4), with the glutamate moiety clearly originating from glutamic acid.This assumption was made purely by inference: a similar compound, γ-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene (5) {{is produced in}} the fruiting body of mushrooms in the genus Agaricus with similar abundance to agaritine and {{has been shown to}} be derived from the shikimate biosynthetic pathway. Recent work, however, has uncovered several problems with this hypothesis, of which inconsistencies in radiolabeling experiments are most notable. These recent efforts now assert that the molecule is synthesized in the vegetative mycelium and then translocated into the fruiting body. These researchers posit that the <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid moiety (6) is absorbed directly from the lignin on which the fungus feeds, not produced by the fungus itself (Figure 2).Despite recent work, however, experts still acknowledge the nebulous origin of the hydrazine functionality. Two theoretical mechanisms are postulated: oxidative coupling of two amines via a phenolic radical mechanism or fixation of nitrogen via nitrogenase.|$|E
50|$|Benzalkonium {{chloride}} degradation follows consecutive debenzylation, dealkylation, and demethylation steps producing benzyl chloride, alkyl dimethyl amine, dimethyl amine, long chain alkane, and ammonia. The intermediates, major, {{and minor}} products {{can then be}} broken down into CO2, H2O, NH3, and Cl-. The first step to the biodegradation of BAC is the fission or splitting of the alkyl chain from the quaternary nitrogen as shown in the diagram. This is done by abstracting the hydrogen from the alkyl chain by using a hydroxyl radical leading to a carbon centered radical. This results in benzyl dimethyl amine as the first intermediate and dodecanal as the major product. From here, benzyl dimethyl amine can be oxidized to benzoic acid using the Fenton process. The trimethyl amine group in dimethylbenzylamine can be cleaved to form a benzyl that can be further oxidized to benzoic acid. Benzoic acid uses hydroxylation (adding a hydroxyl group) to form <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid. Benzyldimethylamine can then be converted into ammonia by performing demethylation twice, which removes both methyl groups, followed by debenzylation, removing the benzyl group using hydrogenation. The diagram represents suggested pathways of the biodegradation of BAC for both the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic regions of the surfactant. Since Stearalkonium chloride is a type of BAC, the biodegradation process should happen in the same manner.|$|E
50|$|Those fungi {{listed below}} {{have been shown}} to have {{significant}} effect as evidenced by human clinical trials published in peer reviewed papers and quoted in secondary sources. Agaricus subrufescens (Agaricus blazei/brasiliensis, almond mushroom) is a fungus associated with Brazil and Japan. Research and small clinical studies demonstrated A. subrufescens extracts have antihyperglycemic and anticancer activities. Brefeldin A and blazein were isolated from A. subrufescens. Boletus badius has been shown to synthesize theanine which is claimed to have mild psychoactive properties. Cordyceps sinensis is an entomopathogenic fungi collected on the Tibetan Plateau. The immunosuppressant ciclosporin was originally isolated from Cordyceps subsessilis. The adenosine analog cordycepin was originally isolated from Cordyceps. Other Cordyceps isolates include, cordymin, cordycepsidone, and cordyheptapeptide. CS-4 is commercially sold as C. sinensis, but Cs-4 has recently been confirmed to be a different species from the Cordyceps species used in traditional Chinese medicine. CS-4 is properly known as Paecilomyces hepiali. Hirsutella sinensis is the accepted asexual form of C. sinensis. Lentinula edodes (Shiitake) {{has been used as a}} source of Lentinan, AHCC, and eritadenine. In 1985 Japan approved lentinan as an adjuvant for gastric cancer. Studies there indicate prolonged survival and improved quality of life when gastric cancer patients with unresectable or recurrent diseases are treated with lentinan in combination with other chemotherapies. Morchella esculenta (Morel) contains the amino acid, cis-3-amino-L-proline. Ustilago maydis (Mexican truffle, huitlacoche, corn fungus) synthesises ustilagine and ustilagic acid. Ganoderma lucidum (Ling zhi, mannentake, reishi) has a long record of medicinal use. It contains <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid, cinnamic acid, and lanostane-type triterpenoids such as ganoderic acids. Hydnellum peckii has yielded atromentin, an anticoagulant isolated from the mycorrhiza. Schizophyllum commune (Split gill) has yielded schizophyllan (SPG, sizofiran, sonifilan) which has been researched clinically for anticancer activity. Hydrophobins were originally isolated from S. commune. A chemically analogous polysaccharide, scleroglucan, is an isolate of Sclerotium rolfsii.|$|E
40|$|Flagellation of Salmonella typhimurium {{was found}} to require a {{functional}} pathway for ubiquinone biosynthesis as well as growth {{in the presence of}} appropriate carboxylic acids. Induction of flagellation by carboxylic acids was shown to induce incorporation of <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid into polyprenylphenol. Constitutive flagellation {{was found to}} correlate with constitutive incorporation of <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid into polyprenylphenol. A novel pathway for polyprenyl <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> acid decarboxylation to polyprenylphenol was implicated in flagellation of S. typhimurium...|$|E
