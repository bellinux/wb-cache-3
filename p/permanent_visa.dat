25|$|Australia's special {{investor}} visa program {{introduced in}} 2012 encouraged Chinese investment. The visa program fast tracks visas and eases the residency requirement for a <b>permanent</b> <b>visa</b> for those ready to invest over 5 million Australian dollars into state government bonds, specific infrastructure and property investments. Wealthy Chinese interested in retirement houses, top schools and cleaner air, began looking to Australia after Canada started scaling back it’s investment visa program in 2012 and eliminated it's main investor visa program in 2014. In early 2014 {{it was reported}} that the Australia's special investor visa was granted to 65 mostly Chinese millionaires who brought over $440 million into the country. By 2017, almost 90% of the more than 1,300 foreigners who used Australia's special investor visa program were from China.

25|$|In March 2015, {{a federal}} judge ruled null and void a {{decision}} to grant him a <b>permanent</b> <b>visa</b> as this would conflict with Brazilian law, and ordered his deportation.
