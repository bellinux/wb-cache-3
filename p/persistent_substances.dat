This naturalistic follow-up of a cohort of 152 people with first-episode schizophrenia examined substance use and clinical outcome in terms of symptoms and social and neuropsychological function. Results. Data were collected on 85 (56 %) of the patient cohort after a median period of 14 months. Over the follow-up period, the proportion of smokers rose from 60 % at baseline to 64 %. While 30 % reported lifetime problem drinking of alcohol at baseline, only 15 % had problem drinking at follow-up. Furthermore, while at baseline 63 % reported lifetime cannabis use and 32 % were currently using the drug, by the follow-up assessment the latter figure had fallen to 18. 5 %. At follow-up, <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> users had significantly more severe positive and depressive symptoms and greater overall severity of illness. A report of no lifetime substance use at baseline was associated with greater improvement in spatial working memory (SWM) at follow-up. Conclusions. Past substance use may impede recovery of SWM performance in people with schizophrenia in the year or so following first presentation to psychiatric services. The prevalence of substance use other than tobacco tends to diminish over this period, {{in the absence of}} specific interventions. <b>Persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use in first-episode schizophrenia is associated with more severe positive and depressive symptoms but not negative symptoms, and should be a target for specific treatment intervention. © 2007 Cambridge University Press...|$|R

40|$|In this Project in an {{interdisciplinary}} cooperation {{the influence of}} tensides on the performance improvement of biochemical decomposition of <b>persistent</b> <b>substances</b> has been investigated. During {{the first part of}} the project (Prof. Raebiger) two continously supplied experimental plants were built. These two plants, using activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, were run simultaneously with and without tensides respectively. The investigations show, that the results in regard to the decomposition rate are better from the plant operated with tenside. Also, the decomposition rate in relation to the total solids content has shown to be better in the plant run with tenside in comparison to the plant without tenside. This was especially relevant during simulated malfunctions. In project part II (Prof. Dr. U. Fischer) further investigations into the influence of tensids on the microbial decomposition of pollutants have been conducted using the adapted microorganism cultures taken from the experimental reactors. Investigations using activated sludge flakes and a monoculture in a batchprocess have shown an increased growth in the presence of the investigated tensids. A variation in the pollutant concentration as well as the addition of the tensid Bioversal to the nutrient medias yielded hints for the optimization of the culture conditions. In Part III of the project (Prof. Leibfritz) an extraction process was optimized in order to meet the requirements of the bacteria cultures and the objective of the project. Among other things, the influence of the tensids on the decomposition speed of the pollutants has been demonstrated in the course of this examinations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preventing relapse is an {{essential}} element of early intervention in psychosis, but relevant risk factors and precise relapse rates remain to be clarified. The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically compile and analyse risk factors for and rates of relapse in the early course of psychosis. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of English and non-English language, peer-reviewed, longitudinal studies, with a minimum 12 -month follow-up and at least 80 % of participants diagnosed with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) that reported risk factors for relapse. RESULTS: Of 153 potentially relevant articles, 29 were included in the study. Pooled prevalence of relapse of positive symptoms was 28 % (range= 12 - 47 %), 43 % (35 - 54 %), 54 % (40 - 63 %) at 1, 1. 5 - 2, and 3 years follow-up, in that order. A total of 109 predictors were analysed, with 24 being assessed in at least 3 studies. Of those, 20 predictors could be extracted for meta-analysis. Medication non-adherence, <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use disorder, carers' critical comments (but not overall expressed emotion) and poorer premorbid adjustment, increased the risk for relapse 4 -fold, 3 -fold, 2. 3 -fold and 2. 2 -fold, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical variables and general demographic variables have little impact on relapse rates. Conversely, non-adherence with medication, <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use disorder, carers' criticism and poorer premorbid adjustment significantly increase the risk for relapse in FEP.

30|$|There is {{inconsistency}} in {{the criteria}} used for categorization of various substances under regulations in the EU. The criteria for considering an active substance (PPP), safener, or synergist to be a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substance are {{laid down in}} paragraph 3.7. 2 of Annex II of Regulation EC 1107 / 2009 [10]. The persistence criterion is fulfilled when the half-life in marine water and sediment, fresh and estuarine water and sediment, and in soil exceeds specific values (see Table  1). It is further noted that ‘assessment of persistency in the environment shall be based on available half-life data collected under appropriate conditions, which shall be described by the applicant.’ Similarly, in paragraph 3.7. 3.1, a very <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> (vP) is characterized by longer half-lives in the same environmental media.

Around the year 2000, several papers and statements dealt with the temperature relevant for European climate conditions. The Swedish Committee on New Guidelines on Chemicals Policy [9] proposed that “a substance is regarded as unacceptably persistent if its half-life is longer than 8  weeks in a simulation test at 20  °C”. This half-life corresponds to a half-life of 1  year in the northern European climate (average annual temperature of 5  °C) and takes into account unfavourable degradation conditions. Sinkkonnen and Paassivirta [45] suggested degradation half-times for POPs as input parameters to the Baltic Sea model assuming an annual average temperature of 7  °C. Beyer et al.

Methods:MEDLINE, LILACS, PsycINFO, and SciELO databases were searched with the keywords first episode psychosis, factor, adherence, nonadherence, engagement, disengagement, compliance, and intervention. References of selected studies were consulted for relevant articles. Results:A total of 157 articles were screened, of which 33 articles were retained for full review. The factors related to nonadherence were: a) patient-related (e. g., lower education level, <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use, forensic history, unemployment, history of physical abuse); b) environment-related (e. g., no family involved in treatment, social adjustment difficulties); c) medication-related (e. g., rapid remission of negative symptoms when starting treatment, therapeutic alliance); and d) illness-related (e. g., more positive symptoms, more relapses). Treatment factors that improve adherence include a good therapeutic alliance and a voluntary first admission when hospitalization occurs.

Dual trajectory classes of both alcohol and other drug use (AOD) and antisocial behavior (ASB), previously identified using latent class growth analyses (LCGA), were used to predict depression outcomes. The Dual Chronic, Increasing AOD/Persistent ASB, and Decreasing Drugs/Persistent ASB classes had higher past-week depression scores, more past-year MDD symptoms, {{and were more likely}} to have past-year MDD than the Resolved class. The Dual Chronic and Decreasing Drugs/Persistent ASB classes also had more past-year MDD symptoms than the Persistent AOD/Adolescent ASB class.

Data were collected from patients medical records (MR) using a standardized questionnaire. 134 MR were available. Time to NAT was the outcome of interest. Baseline and treatment predictors of NAT were examined via cox proportional hazards model. Results: Kaplan-Meier 18 -month NAT-risk was 0. 28. A lower severity of illness at baseline (HR= 0. 20), living without family during treatment (HR= 4. 8), and <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use during treatment (HR= 2. 6) contributed significantly to predicting NAT.

40|$|Methylmercury (MeHg) {{is one of}} {{the most}} toxic and <b>persistent</b> <b>substances</b> in the environment. Research has focused on how MeHg forms from {{inorganic}} mercury deposited from atmospheric sources such as coal combustion. A UW study conducted at the Allequash Creek watershed in northern Wisconsin determined that anoxic zones in shallow groundwater are an important site of MeHg formation (Stoor, et al., 2002). Further study showed that MeHg concentrations in these hyporheic (shallow zone) pore waters co-vary with the mercury methylation rate at depth (Meyer, et al., 2005). This suggests that the measured MeHg concentrations are likely produced in situ, and are not from legacy sources. Methylation rates in the hyporheic zone of the peat bog are generally higher than those of the headwater springs – which is consistent with previous observations of increased wetland export of MeHg (Armstrong, et al., 2006). Additional work also showed that methylation rates were not controlled by the total mercury concentration in pore waters (Creswell, et al., 2008). Instead, high concentrations of strong mercurybinding ligands have been observed and are believed to influence methylation rates by one of several possible mechanisms (Creswell, et al., 2010). Current research examines the leading mechanism by determining the role of neutral sulfide complexes on methylation in Allequash groundwater (Shafe...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if pH-shift processing of Baltic herring with elevated toxicity levels could be used to produce a protein isolate with low fat content and, thereby, reduced dioxin and PCB levels. Both acid (pH 2. 7) and alkaline (pH 11. 2) pH-shift processing were investigated and resulted in efficient reduction of fat, dioxin, and PCB levels. A reduction of 70 - 80 % per amount of protein was determined for all of these parameters. The amounts, and thus the removal, of lipids and dioxins (R(2) = 0. 952) as well as lipids and PCBs (R(2) = 0. 996) were highly correlated (p < 0. 01). A mass balance of the alkaline pH-shift process showed that most of the fat and pollutants were found in the floating fat emulsion layer of the first centrifugation, followed by the pellet of the first centrifugation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: To {{assess the}} impact of {{duration}} of untreated psychosis (DUP) on baseline and 18 -month follow-up characteristics controlling for relevant confounders in an epidemiological first-episode psychosis (FEP) cohort. METHOD: The Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) in Australia admitted 786 FEP patients from January 1998 to December 2000. Data were collected from medical files using a standardized questionnaire. Data from 636 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Median DUP was 8. 7 weeks. Longer DUP was associated with worse premorbid functioning (p< 0. 001), higher rate of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (p< 0. 001), and younger age at onset of psychosis (p= 0. 004). Longer DUP was not associated with baseline variables but with a lower rate of remission of positive symptoms (p< 0. 001) and employment/occupation (p< 0. 001), a higher rate of <b>persistent</b> <b>substance</b> use (p= 0. 015), worse illness severity (p< 0. 001) and global functioning (p< 0. 001) at follow-up after controlling for relevant confounders, explaining approximately 5 % of variance of remission of positive symptoms (p< 0. 001) in the total sample and 3 % in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders excluding bipolar I disorder (p= 0. 002). Outcome was significantly worse when DUP exceeded 1 - 3 months. CONCLUSION: Avoiding pitfalls of non-epidemiological studies, DUP appears to be a modest independent predictor of prognosis in the medium-term.

40|$|Various {{scenarios}} of DDT and ß-HCH global emis-sions {{of the years}} 1970 - 1990 {{have been used to}} study the sensitivity of the multicompartmental fate of these sub-stances towards location and mode of entry during the first two years upon entry. A multicompartment chemis-try-transport model with 3. 75 °* 3. 75 ° horizontal resolution has been used, based on an atmospheric general circula-tion model. ß-HCH {{is expected to be the}} more mobile but less <b>persistent</b> <b>substance.</b> Persistence in the total environment, ?overall, ranged from 1. 5 - 1. 8 years for the DDT and from 0. 6 - 1. 2 years for the ß-HCH scenarios. Compartmental distributions and residence times were found to be strongly influenced by the scenario of entry. Emissions in the trop-ics rather than in mid latitudes and application to vegeta-tion rather than to the soil tend to enhance the mobility and to limit the persistence. The changing geographic application pattern of DDT in 1970 - 1990, which was caused by the phasing out in many countries during this period, went along with sig-nificant changes in the environmental fate of DDT: the number of completed atmospheric cycles ('hops') in-creased and the residence times in the ground compart-ments decreased correspondingly. The north-south shift in the application pattern, which occurred in this time pe-riod, was expected to have given rise to increased disper-sion over the globe...|$|R
