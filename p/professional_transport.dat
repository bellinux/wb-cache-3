40|$|Contemporary <b>professional</b> <b>transport</b> {{planning}} and policy continue {{to focus on}} resolving the car’s place in contemporary urban society. Transport planners really only have two viable alternatives when engaging car-specific concerns: constructing more road space or allocating existing road space to give specific modes priority and/or to reduce travel. The second alternative drives the research programme for this thesis. For reasons made clear in this thesis, turning to transport-specific bodies of scholarly literature fails to provide a useful starting point to understand road space allocation. This research is therefore situated within a ‘mobilities paradigm’ (Urry, 2008). The mobilities paradigm provides a heterogeneous view {{of the world in which}} to view what is referred in this thesis as the scientific world of transport planning. This opens up useful exploratory lines of inquiry to understand the ways in which the work of transport planners (i. e. animate) allocating road space (i. e. inanimate) is constrained and constituted. This helps reveal limitations of governance, policy frameworks and professional knowledge in allocating road space. Insight from the sociology of scientific knowledge is used to analyse road space allocation from historical and contemporary settings, and to incorporate materiality into analysis. Utilising a case study methodology, this study critically examines road space allocation in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Data is drawn upon from a critical examination of scholarly literature, a document analysis of archival materials and government policy and legislative materials, face-to-face interviews with over 60 practicing and retired transport planners and participant observation of a transport planning exercise. The findings of this research suggest that though traditional aspects such as politics and legislative mandate do constrain and limit the action and reach of professionals, professionals were found to make and enact normative decisions that resulted in re-imagining road space as more than the site of car travel. Resolving several tensions identified in the thesis which make allocating road space challenging resulted in professionals embodying knowledge and experience reflective of adopting a demand management stance. This stance continues to be advanced by scholars as crucial to destabilising the car’s place in contemporary urban society. However, momentum needed to entrench the demand stance at institutional levels is found to be constrained by cyclical and/or alternating mobility visions generated from constant change in state government in Victoria. Drawing insight from sociology of scientific knowledge has therefore been found to provide for a new and enhanced frame to look at issues related to transport planning, road space allocation and the role of different agents (e. g. actors and infrastructure). Developing new professional knowledge and practices critical to engraining a demand management stance in practice is shown to be informed and enacted through practitioners actively engaging, and/or reacting to and against, technology and infrastructure. This confirms and reinforces the usefulness of tracing the contours of materiality, and in so doing, provides for an improved and more realistic picture of <b>professional</b> <b>transport</b> planning practice. Findings drawn from this thesis therefore advance our current understanding of how <b>professional</b> <b>transport</b> planning practice is constrained and constituted...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings on CD-ROMIn {{response}} to the weak apparent performance of own account transport, government policy, {{with a view to}} promoting sustainable development, are pushing for a transfer from own account to third party transport.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the overall {{results of the}} comparative study of road traffic rules and corresponding enforcement actions in Qatar compared to western countries specifically the State of Florida in the United States and the United Kingdom. The {{primary purpose of the}} study is to provide comparisons with major western countries, and therefore possible guidance in {{the development and implementation of}} driving policies in Qatar. Therefore, the main focus of the data collection was on countries that would be considered well established as far as traffic rules and traffic safety. The data collection process covers the detail of the rules and respective enforcement for different topics of interest. The selection of the topics was based on considering that the set of topics had to be sufficiently broad to serve the main purpose of this study. Topics that are either far away from Qatar competencies or that do not have the potential to present interesting best practices are not included. Topics are aggregated by themes in order to enable a systematic approach in the data collection, analysis, and structured presentation of the results. Driving requirements, <b>professional</b> <b>transport,</b> road characteristics, safety equipment, traffic rules, and vehicle characteristics are the six themes used in the aggregation of the topics of interest. The analysis of each topic covers detailed aspects on the rule, control and enforcement framework, and control and enforcement practice. The results of reviewing the traffic laws of the three studied countries indicated that a high percentage of laws and enforcement rules are similar in concept. It was found that the United Kingdom's traffic law is more strict when it comes to minimum age of driving and Qatar's traffic law is more restrict when it comes to running red–light violations. It was also found that Qatar does not currently have traffic laws that address seat belts use for children under 14 years of age, manslaughter and vehicular homicide, or blood alcohol content specifications for driving under influence...|$|E

Embora exista na literatura internacional pesquisa sobre burnout, na categoria profissional de transporte, não é tradição, no Brasil, estudos direcionados para essa categoria. A pesquisa foi realizada com 412 motoristas e cobradores de duas empresas de tranporte de Natal. Para realização da coleta de dados foram utilizados dois questionários e uma entrevista semi-estruturada. O primeiro instrumento, construído e validado durante a pesquisa, investigou as fontes de desgaste e o segundo a síndrome de burnout. Como principais resultados, foram identificadas duas fontes de desgaste empíricas a saber: (1) o Conflito de Valores e a Falta de Justiça no Trabalho, (2) União e Recompensa. Além disso, observou-se que há incidência da síndrome de burnout entre os motoristas e cobradores de transporte urbano via ônibus, tanto quanto nas ocupações de cuidado estudadas anteriormente em Natal e no Brasil e ainda que essa incidência está relacionada às fontes de desgaste que permeiam as condições de trabalho desses profissionaisRecognizing {{the importance}} the workplace has {{on mental health}} of the individual, {{the objective of this}} study was to investigate the relationship between the burnout syndrome and the sources of physical and emotional wear which permeate the work conditions of the urban public transport system of the city of Natal.
