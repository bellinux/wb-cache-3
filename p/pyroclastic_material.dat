5|$|Initial Vulcanian {{activity}} {{is characterized by}} a series of short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes to a few hours and typified by the ejection of volcanic bombs and blocks. These eruptions wear down the lava dome holding the magma down, and it disintegrates, leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions. Thus an early sign of future Vulcanian {{activity is}} lava dome growth, and its collapse generates an outpouring of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> down the volcano's slope.|$|E
5|$|Tiga Island {{is formed}} through the {{eruption}} of mud volcano in 1897. The island {{is now part of}} the Tiga Island National Park together with Kalampunian Besar and Kalampunian Damit islands as a tourist attractions, with a mud bath tourism. The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is a group of five islands of Gaya, Manukan, Mamutik, Sapi and Sulug. These islands are believed to once connected to the Crocker Range but separated when sea levels rose since the last ice age. The Tun Mustapha Marine Park is the largest marine park located in the north of Sabah. It covers the three major islands of Banggi, Balambangan and Malawali. Another marine park is the Tun Sakaran Marine Park located in the south-east of Sabah. The park comprising the islands of Bodgaya, Boheydulang, Sabangkat and Salakan along with sand cays of Maiga, Mantabuan and Sibuan. Bodgaya is gazetted as a forest reserve, while Boheydulang as a bird sanctuary. These islands are formed by Quaternary <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> that was ejected during explosive volcanic activities.|$|E
25|$|Felsic and {{intermediate}} magmas that erupt often do so violently, with explosions {{driven by the}} release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour, but also carbon dioxide. Explosively erupted <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> is called tephra and includes tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite. Fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits, which can often cover vast areas.|$|E
40|$|Pandansari village, Ngantang District was {{severely}} affected by Mt. Kelud eruption in 2014. Almost all soil surfaces {{were covered by}} the eruption product, leading to serious problems for cultivation. <b>Pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> potentially have high content of nutrients, {{but they are not}} readily available to plants. As an attempt to improve chemical properties of the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials,</b> we applied locally available organic matters, from four different sources, i. e. leaves of sweet potatoes, Tithonia diversifolia, maize, and cow manure. The <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> were sieved at 2 mm, placed inside pots (50 x 50 x 50 cm 3), until it reached 30 cm thick. The fresh leaves were chopped into 2 mm size and mixed with the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> at the dosage of 15 Mg/ha. They were incubated and kept at field condition. Selected chemical properties (pH, CEC, sum of basic cations, and the total contents of N, organic C, and available P) were measured before and after 90 days incubation. The results showed that after 90 days, organic matter application significantly increased pH, cation exchange capacity, organic C, and total exchangeable basic cations content. The increases of P-available and total N contents were only detected on cow manure treated materials...|$|R
40|$|Home Plate is a layered plateau in Gusev crater on Mars. It is {{composed}} of clastic rocks of moderately altered alkali basalt composition, enriched in some highly volatile elements. A coarse-grained lower unit is overlain by a finer-grained upper unit. Textural observations indicate that the lower strata were emplaced in an explosive event, and geochemical considerations favor an explosive volcanic origin over an impact origin. The lower unit likely represents accumulation of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials,</b> while the upper unit may represent eolian reworking of the same <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
30|$|Components and sulfur isotopic {{compositions}} of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> {{from the}} 2014 Mt. Ontake eruption were investigated. The volcanic ash samples {{were found to}} be composed of altered volcanic fragments, alunite, anhydrite, biotite, cristobalite, gypsum, ilmenite, kaolin minerals, native sulfur, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, pyrite, pyrophyllite, quartz, rutile, and smectite, and most of these minerals were likely derived from the acidic alteration zones of Mt. Ontake. The absence of juvenile material in the eruptive products indicates that the eruption was phreatic. The sulfur isotopic compositions of the water-leached sulfate, hydrochloric acid-leached sulfate, acetone-leached native sulfur, and pyrite of the samples indicate that these sulfur species were produced by disproportionation of magmatic SO 2 in the hydrothermal system at temperatures of 270 – 281  °C. This temperature range is consistent with that inferred from the hydrothermal mineral assemblage (e.g., pyrophyllite and rutile) in the 2014 <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> (200 – 300  °C). Except for the sulfur isotopic compositions of anhydrite, which may have been altered by incorporation of sulfate minerals in a fumarolic area with lower sulfur isotopic values into the underground materials during the 1979 eruption, no significant differences in the mineral assemblages and sulfur isotopic compositions of the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> were identified between the products of the 2014 and 1979 Ontake phreatic eruptions, which suggests geochemical similarities in the underlying hydrothermal systems before the 2014 and 1979 eruptions.|$|R
25|$|Lahars (a type of mudflow of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> and water) are an {{important}} hazard on the mountain, and are caused by rain remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-frequency seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} {{have suggested that}} Devils Tower is a volcanic plug or {{that it is the}} neck of an extinct volcano. Presumably, if Devils Tower was a volcanic plug, any volcanics created by it– volcanic ash, lava flows, volcanic debris– would have been eroded away long ago. Some <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> of the same age as Devils Tower has been identified elsewhere in Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|Lengthy erosion, which removed {{nearly all}} of the {{original}} outer cone of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material,</b> was followed by the eruption of satellitic vents. This third and final phase of activity began about 300,000 years ago with the eruption of a dacite lava flow into the extant valley of Shovelnose Creek and concluded with the construction of two small satellitic plagioclase-hypersthene-biotite-phyric dacite lava domes about 200,000 years ago.|$|E

50|$|Andesitic lava {{bombs on}} top of the deposit may {{indicate}} that an eruption occurred during the collapse. Indeed, <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> have been found {{at the foot of the}} volcano within the collapse deposit, where they fill small depressions. These materials are formed by several units of pumice and ash, generated by fallout and lava dome collapses.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pyroclastic}} eruption entails spitting or [...] "fountaining" [...] lava, {{where the}} lava will be {{thrown into the}} air along with ash, <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials,</b> and other volcanic byproducts. Hawaiian eruptions such as those at Kīlauea can eject clots of magma suspended into gas; {{this is called a}} [...] "fire fountain". The magma clots, if hot enough may coalesce upon landing to form a lava flow.|$|R
25|$|Eruptive {{activity}} {{itself could}} continue for years, followed {{by years of}} decreasing secondary activity. Volcanic ash would most likely spread throughout the Pacific Northwest, causing airports to be closed and relevant flights to be diverted or cancelled. The associated ash column would then extend eastward by the prevailing winds and disrupt air traffic throughout Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador. The cooling lava would discontinuously spall units to create pyroclastic flows (super-heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice). The loose volcanic rock and <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> on Cayley's flanks and in valleys would be periodically reactivated into debris flows. Considerable structural improvements {{would have to be}} made to reclaim use of Highway 99 and Squamish area.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent outpourings of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> {{from the}} breach {{left by the}} {{landslide}} consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks.

500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{presence}} of significant quantities of sulfurous materials in Io's crust and on its surface, some eruptions propel sulfur, sulfur dioxide gas, and <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> up to [...] into space, producing large, umbrella-shaped volcanic plumes. This material paints the surrounding terrain in red, black, and/or white, and provides material for Io's patchy atmosphere and Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere. Spacecraft that have flown by Io since 1979 have observed numerous surface changes as {{a result of}} Io's volcanic activity.|$|E
30|$|The area is also {{affected}} by tectonism {{leading to the}} development of fractures and faults which act as conduit to groundwater flows in some areas (Ghiglieri et al. 2010). Figure  2 shows the fault system within the main cone deposits of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> with subordinate nephelinitic and phonolitic lavas. The fault lines are assumed to be avenue of huge groundwater flows that manifest through numerous springs which discharge into Themi River.|$|R
50|$|Barreiro da Fancea is a {{superficial}} area of arid and clay terrain, built {{up from the}} geological area known as Formação de Feteiras (Feteiras Formation), that corresponds {{to the most recent}} volcanism that was essentially explosive, and constituted of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials.</b> Later, these projectiles and deposits were altered in reddish clays due to the warm and humid climate, resulting in an area of semi-desert-like geology composed of yellowish-red sands.|$|R
50|$|Tephra is a {{generalized}} {{word for the}} various bits of debris that are launched out of a volcano during an eruption, regardless of their size. <b>Pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> are generally categorized according to size: dust measures at <1/8 mm, ash is 1/8-2 mm, cinders are 2-64 mm, and bombs and blocks are both >64 mm. There are different hazards associated with {{the different kinds of}} <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials.</b> Dust and ash could coat cars and homes, rendering the car unable to drive with dust accumulation in the engine. They could also layer on homes and add weight to roofs causing the house to collapse. Also, ash and dust inhaled could cause long-term respiratory issues in people inhaling the particles. Cinders are flaming pieces of ejected volcanic material which could set fire to homes and wooded areas. Bombs and blocks run the risk of hitting various objects and people within range of the volcano. Projectiles can be thrown thousands of feet in the air and can be found several miles away from the initial eruption point.|$|R

2500|$|The {{long term}} {{durability}} of Roman concrete structures {{has been found}} to be due to its use of pyroclastic (volcanic) rock and ash, whereby crystallization of strätlingite and the coalescence of calcium–aluminum-silicate–hydrate cementing binder helped give the concrete a greater degree of fracture resistance even in seismically active environments. Roman concrete is significantly more resistant to erosion by seawater than modern concrete which is [...] also due to the use of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> which react with seawater to form Al-tobermorite crystals over time.|$|R
5000|$|As is {{the case}} for many regions of El Salvador, the makeup of Santa Tecla's terrain and its many natural springs makes the area prone to landslides. As {{mentioned}} above, much of the terrain is composed of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> with low permeability. Pore water pressure or pore air pressure are unable to dissipate fast enough; the subsequent strength loss triggers land sliding. This is especially true during seismic activity. [...] See, for instance, the effects of landslides during the 2001 El Salvador earthquakes.|$|R

500|$|Between two {{and three}} million years ago, during the Pliocene, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and tilted westward. A series of {{volcanic}} mudflows (lahars) from three major source areas contributed debris that covered almost [...] to form the oldest distinctive geologic formation in the High Cascades.

500|$|The tidal heating {{produced}} by Io's forced orbital eccentricity {{has made it}} the most volcanically active world in the Solar System, with hundreds of volcanic centres and extensive lava flows. During a major eruption, lava flows tens or even hundreds of kilometres long can be produced, consisting mostly of basalt silicate lavas with either mafic or ultramafic (magnesium-rich) compositions. As a by-product of this activity, sulfur, sulfur dioxide gas and silicate <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> (like ash) are blown up to [...] into space, producing large, umbrella-shaped plumes, painting the surrounding terrain in red, black, and white, and providing material for Io's patchy atmosphere and Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere.|$|E
500|$|A {{seamount}} such as Davidson is {{an underwater}} volcano; this one rises over [...] above the surrounding ocean floor. Although {{there are over}} 30,000 seamounts in the Pacific Ocean alone, only about 0.1% {{of them have been}} explored. The aqueous environment of the seamount means that it behaves differently from volcanoes on land. Its surface is composed mostly of blocky lava flows, although some pillow lava, which is the typical lava type of a seamount, prevails at the deeper flank. The summit is composed of layered deposits of volcanic ash and <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material.</b> These rocks indicate mildly explosive eruptions of gas-rich lava near the summit of the volcano.

5000|$|Based on {{studies on}} Taal, it is {{believed}} that an ancient Taal Cone was formed by buildup of large volume dacitic <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> more than 140,000 years ago. Several major catastrophic eruptions probably between 27,000 and 5,000 years ago destroyed this greater Taal Cone and ultimately formed the [...] wide depression now known as Taal Caldera.

500|$|Mount Tehama {{originated}} in the Lassen volcanic complex, an area of active volcanism {{for more than three}} million years. It formed during a period of eruptive activity approximately 600,000 years ago on a series of faults; the largest of these eruptions was about 50 times as powerful as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. During the Pleistocene, constantly renewed lava of andesite flowed from the caldera of the volcano, eventually becoming [...] "interbedded" [...] and heightening the mountain. By the time it reached its peak size, the volcano was immense, measuring at its base between [...] and [...] wide and more than [...] tall. Activity at Tehama lasted for approximately 200,000 years.

500|$|The bulk of {{the volcano}} is formed by lava flows, along with volcaniclastic rocks, with dacites and {{pyroclastics}} lying {{on top of the}} Cretaceous-Eocene basement. These loose rocks formed by erosion, explosive activity and hot avalanches and are deposited in a large apron {{at the base of the}} volcano that extends over [...] away from the central vents. Several fans of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material,</b> cemented by andesitic tuffs, surround the base of Taftan. Ignimbrites and pyroclastic flows are also present, including breccias, nuee ardentes and tuffs. Volcanic rocks cover a surface of [...] There is also evidence of southeastern migration of the craters of Taftan, with Anjerk and Sardarya being more westerly vents. These preceding centres have left andesitic lava flows that are partially dissected and agglomerates. The existence of a caldera at Taftan has been inferred. The table mountain Takht-i-Rostam [...] south of Taftan may be the remnant of a basalt extrusion, but it doesn't appear to be related to Taftan. A magma chamber may lie beneath the volcano.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of plumes at the volcanoes Pele and Loki {{were the first}} sign that Io is geologically active. Generally, these plumes are formed when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds of gas and dust. Additional material that might be found in these volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. These plumes appear to be formed {{in one of two}} ways. Io's largest plumes, such as those emitted by Pele, are created when dissolved sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas are released from erupting magma at volcanic vents or lava lakes, often dragging silicate <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>material</b> with them. These plumes form red (from the short-chain sulfur) and black (from the silicate pyroclastics) deposits on the surface. Plumes formed in this manner are among the largest observed at Io, forming red rings more than [...] in diameter. Examples of this plume type include Pele, Tvashtar, and Dazhbog. Another type of plume is produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide frost, sending the sulfur skyward. This type of plume often forms bright circular deposits consisting of sulfur dioxide. These plumes are often less than [...] tall, and are among the most long-lived plumes on Io. Examples include Prometheus, Amirani, and Masubi. The erupted sulfurous compounds are concentrated in the upper crust from a decrease in sulfur solubility at greater depths in Io's lithosphere.|$|E

At least 20 subsidiary or parasitic cones are known. Some of them have names: Tahe, Molo, Kadiendinae; Kubah, and Doro Api Toi. Most of these cones have produced basaltic lavas.|$|R
30|$|The emerged {{part of the}} Stromboli {{strato-volcano}} {{is mainly}} formed during two distinct cycles of activity (Barberi et al. 1974). The old cycle is composed of rhythmic eruptions of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>materials</b> and lava flows, giving rise {{to the formation of}} all the eastern sector of the island. The recent cycle, during which lava flows have been mainly erupted, is responsible for the formation of all the western half of the Stromboli island.
