5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E
25|$|Current {{diagnostic}} techniques usually involve <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> tests {{like the}} line bisection test. Though these tests have provided relatively accurate diagnostic results, advances in virtual reality therapy (VRT) have proven these tests {{to not be}} completely thorough. Dvorkin et al. used a camera system that immersed the patient into a virtual reality world and required the patient to grasp or move object in the world, through tracking of arm and hand movements. These techniques revealed that <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> tests provide relatively accurate qualitative diagnoses of hemispatial neglect patients, but VRT provided accurate mapping into a 3-dimensional space, revealing areas of space that {{were thought to be}} neglected but which patients had at least some awareness. Patients were also retested 10 months from initial measurements, during which each went through regular rehabilitation therapy, and most showed measurably less neglect on virtual reality testing whereas no measurable improvements were shown in the line bisection test.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{screening}} {{programs that}} have attempted to preclude soldiers exhibiting personality traits thought to predispose them to CSR have been a total failure. Part of this failure stems from the inability to base CSR morbidity on {{of one or two}} personality traits. Full psychological work-ups are expensive and inconclusive, while <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> tests are ineffective and easily faked. In addition, studies conducted following WWII screening programs showed that psychological disorders present during military training did not accurately predict stress disorders during combat.|$|E
25|$|The Shia {{believe that}} the status of Ali is {{supported}} by numerous hadith, including the Hadith of the pond of Khumm, Hadith of the two weighty things, Hadith of the <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper,</b> Hadith of the invitation of the close families, and Hadith of the Twelve Successors. In particular, the Hadith of the Cloak is often quoted to illustrate Muhammad's feeling towards Ali and his family by both Sunni and Shia scholars. Shias prefer hadith attributed to the Ahl al-Bayt and close associates, and have their own separate collection of hadiths.|$|E

In addition to the constant demand on him for matter for his paper, he was incessantly preparing articles, and preparing books for the press, for the Harpers, the Appletons, and other publishers. Very few men surpassed him in the variety and extent of his literary acquirements. To great mathematical knowledge he added large attainments in philological lore, and as a linguist he ranked high.|$|E

25|$|A player starts by {{clearing}} the memory on their calculator. The player will {{then use the}} random number generator on their calculator to bring up a number between 0 and 1. The number of runs scored is the first digit after the decimal point (for example, if the random number generator provides 0.521, 5 runs are scored). Scoring is kept by using the memory addition function on the calculator, or by <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper.</b> Scoring a 0 is considered out. The player who has the highest score wins.|$|E

After this, her interest in Amateur Radio developed and she was eventually licensed with the callsign KD4WUJ, although her license currently shows as canceled.|$|E
25|$|Hertzfeldt's work {{commonly}} features hand-drawn stick figures, {{in stories}} of black humor, surrealism, and tragicomedy. Some films contain existential and philosophical themes {{while others are}} more straightforwardly slapstick and absurdist. His animation is created traditionally with <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper,</b> often with minimal digital aid. Hertzfeldt uses antique 16mm or 35mm–film cameras to photograph his drawings and often employs old-fashioned special effect techniques such as multiple exposures, in-camera mattes, and experimental photography. While some of these techniques are as established as an occasional stop-motion animation sequence or a universe of moving stars created by back-lit pin holes, other effects are new innovations on classical methods, as seen with the in-camera compositing of multiple, split-screen windows of action in the Everything Will Be OK films.|$|E

25|$|The French Revolution of 1789 {{probably}} {{added to}} the strain that Charlotte felt. Queen Charlotte and Queen Marie Antoinette of France and Navarre kept a close relationship. Charlotte was 11 years older than Marie Antoinette, yet they shared many interests, such as their love of music and the arts, in which they both enthusiastically took an interest. Never meeting face to face, they kept their friendship to <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper.</b> Marie Antoinette confided in Charlotte upon {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolution. Charlotte had organized apartments to be prepared and ready for the refugee royal family of France to occupy. After the execution of Marie Antoinette and the bloody events that followed, Charlotte was said to have been shocked and overwhelmed that such a thing could happen to a kingdom, and at Britain's doorstep.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{computer}} age, the bookbinding trade involved two divisions. First, there was Stationery binding (known as vellum binding in the trade) {{which deals with}} making new books {{to be written into}} and intended for handwritten entries such as accounting ledgers, business journals, blank books, and guest log books, along with other general office stationery such as note books, manifold books, day books, diaries, portfolios, etc. Second was Letterpress binding which deals with making new books intended to be read from and includes library binding, fine binding, edition binding, and publisher's bindings. A result of the new bindings is a third division dealing with the repair, restoration, and conservation of old used bindings. With the digital age, personal computers have replaced the <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> based accounting that used to drive most of the work in the stationery binding industry.|$|E
25|$|He was in Boston at {{the outset}} of the American Revolutionary War, and marched with Percy to relieve the British troops {{returning}} from Concord. He was appointed chief engineer in America and captain in late 1775. He was present at the Battle of Long Island the next year, and was present at the execution of Nathan Hale on 22 September 1776. It is said that he kindly sheltered Hale in his office, giving him <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> to write final letters to his family, and that the execution moved him deeply. He was sent to the rebel lines under flag of truce to report the event, and he conveyed Hale's last words to William Hull. Having been superseded as chief engineer, he was placed as aide-de-camp on the staff of General William Howe, but was later reinstated as chief engineer. On 13 January 1777 his home on Montresor's Island was burned.|$|E

But, though nobody had told him of such an art, he may be said to have invented it for himself. On a table near at hand there were <b>pens</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> ink of two colors, black and red.

25|$|Minsc and Boo {{originated}} in <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> Dungeons & Dragons sessions {{held by the}} lead designer of Baldur's Gate, James Ohlen. Played by Cameron Tofer, associate producer and lead programmer of MDK2, Minsc was conceived as an unstable comic relief ranger who carried around a pet hamster named Boo in the Dark Sun campaign setting. The lead writer for Baldur's Gate, Lukas Kristjanson, expanded upon the character and created dialogue intended to make Minsc funny and memorable to the general audience. During development, some of the character's lines were rewritten based on the voice actor's readings. As this progressed, the writers noted {{they were able to}} interject dialogue more freely for Minsc into the script in a tone suitable for the character. In a 2001 interview, BioWare co-founder Ray Muzyka has stated that among the titles the company has completed, Minsc was his favorite character.|$|E
