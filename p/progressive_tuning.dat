40|$|Theoretical {{background}} and application principles of Monitoring Natural Attenuation (MNA) contaminated aquifers not engineered remediation methodology are presented. A detailed knowledge of hydrodinamical, hydrochemical and microbiological processes occurring inside and, particularly, at the interfacial fringe (the so called “corona”) of the plume {{is put in}} evidence as the key factor in assessing the natural attenuation potential. Chemical mass balance of plume and identification of chemical “footprints” reflecting that NA is really working {{are the two most}} important tools to evaluate the processes. As a representative case study the Rexco plant (Mansfield, UK) is considered. A phenols plume has been almost entirely attenuated by the natural groundwater system avoiding so the contamination of wells located downgradient; at the same time an ammonium plume, originating at the same plant, also if strongly retarded by the finer matrix of the aquifer, has was recalcitrant to attenuation. The presented case study underlines the importance of a combined use of both an experimental verification and a forecasting of the plume time-space evolution by numerical models, being the first one necessary for the calibration and the <b>progressive</b> <b>tuning</b> of the second one...|$|E
40|$|Propagation {{of light}} beams through {{scattering}} or multimode systems {{may lead to}} the randomization of the spatial coherence of the light. Although information is not lost, its recovery requires a coherent interferometric reconstruction of the original signals, which have been scrambled into the modes of the scattering system. Here, we show that we can automatically unscramble optical beams that have been arbitrarily mixed in a multimode waveguide, undoing the scattering and mixing between the spatial modes through a mesh of silicon photonics tuneable beam splitters. Transparent light detectors integrated in a photonic chip are used to directly monitor the evolution of each mode along the mesh, allowing sequential tuning and adaptive individual feedback control of each beam splitter. The entire mesh self-configures automatically through a <b>progressive</b> <b>tuning</b> algorithm and resets itself after significantly perturbing the mixing, without turning off the beams. We demonstrate information recovery by the simultaneous unscrambling, sorting and tracking of four mixed modes, with residual cross-talk of - 20 dB between the beams. Circuit partitioning assisted by transparent detectors enables scalability to meshes with a higher port count and to a higher number of modes without a proportionate increase in the control complexity. The principle of self-configuring and self-resetting in optical systems should be applicable {{in a wide range of}} optical applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{non-volatile}} switching of amorphous chalcogenide glass thin films to the crystalline phase through a {{through a number of}} reproducible, discrete, optically distinguishable intermediate states, and on the re-amorphization of these films using femtosecond laser pulses. Potential applications lie in high-base (>binary) all-optical signal modulation, high-density data storage, image processing and non-Von Neuman computing. Chalcogenide phase-change media such as Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST) are commercially established as a platform for both optical and electronic data storage (re-writable CDs, DVDs and Blu-Ray discs; Phase-change RAM). These technologies harness non-volatile amorphous-crystalline (binary) transitions in the chalcogenide induced by nanosecond optical or electronic excitations, which have also recently been applied to the realization of metamaterial electro- and all-optical transmission/reflection modulators for near- to mid-IR wavelengths providing switching high-contrast in device structures only a fraction of a wavelength thick. But chalcogenides offer a much richer pallet of transitional behaviours that can be exploited to enhance all of these functionalities and to open up new computational and image processing paradigms: They retain a 'memory' of sub-threshold excitations, such that transitions ordinarily initiated by single excitation pulses can be reproducibly stimulated by sequences of arbitrarily timed shorter/lower energy pulses cumulatively delivering the required energy. Here we demonstrate multi-level switching of GST films down to 30 nm thick using femtosecond optical pulses. Domains ranging in size from 200 down to 1 µm 2 are progressively converted through at least eight distinct partially crystalline states using 85 fs pulses. Intermediate states are distinguished and their progressively changing optical properties characterised using white light reflectivity, transmission/reflection microspectrophotometry and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. Applications potential is demonstrated to high-density data storage - encoding/read-out of multiple bits per (semi-) crystalline mark with micron-level pixellation, the performance of optical arithmetic operations, and <b>progressive</b> <b>tuning</b> of chalcogenide hybrid metamaterial resonance...|$|E

40|$|Discovery that reflectin {{proteins}} {{fill the}} dynamically tunable Bragg lamellae in the reflective skin cells of certain squids has prompted efforts to design new reflectin-inspired systems for dynamic photonics. But {{new insights into}} the actual role and mechanism of action of the reflectins constrain and better define the opportunities and limitations for rationally designing optical systems with reflectin-based components. We and our colleagues have discovered that the reflectins function as a signal-controlled molecular machine, regulating an osmotic motor that tunes the thickness, spacing, and refractive index of the tunable, membrane-bound Bragg lamellae in the iridocytes of the loliginid squids. The tunable reflectin proteins, characterized by a variable number of highly conserved peptide domains interspersed with positively charged linker segments, are restricted in intra- and inter-chain contacts by Coulombic repulsion. Physiologically, this inhibition is progressively overcome by charge-neutralization resulting from acetylcholine (neurotransmitter) -induced, site-specific phosphorylation, triggering the simultaneous activation and <b>progressive</b> <b>tuning</b> of reflectance from red to blue. Details of this process have been resolved through in vitro analyses of purified recombinant reflectins, controlling charge-neutralization by pH-titration or mutation as surrogates for the in vivo phosphorylation. Results of these analyses have shown that neutralization overcoming the Coulombic inhibition reversibly and cyclably triggers condensation and secondary folding of the reflectins, with the emergence of previously cryptic, phase-segregated hydrophobic domains enabling hierarchical assembly. This tunable, reversible, and cyclable assembly regulates the Gibbs-Donnan mediated osmotic shrinking or swelling of the Bragg lamellae that tunes the brightness and color of reflected light. Our most recent studies have revealed a direct relationship between the extent of charge neutralization {{and the size of the}} reflectin assemblies, further explaining the synergistic effects on the intensity and wavelength of reflected light. Mutational analyses show that the “switch” controlling reflectins’ structural transitions is distributed along the protein, while detailed comparisons of the sequences and structures of the recently evolved tunable reflectins to those of their ancestral, non-tunable homologs are helping to identify the specific structural determinants governing tunability...|$|E

40|$|Improving {{the energy}} {{efficiency}} {{has been the}} critical design goal for embedded systems. Recently, {{there have been some}} practical techniques employed to the power supply of embedded systems to extend the system 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime. One is renewable energy technologies such as energy harvesting from the environment to offer a sustainable, inexpensive, and maintenance-free alternative power source. Another is voltage overscaling (VOS) technique, which scales down the supply voltage to reduce the power consumption quadratically. However, most renewable energy sources are unstable and intermittent due to dynamically changing environmental conditions, and VOS inevitably incurs hardware errors, thereby posing new challenges to the improvements of energy efficiency in the embedded systems. In this dissertation, we identify four specific power-hungry signal processing units and develop a suite of techniques to improve the energy efficiency of embedded systems, by jointly exploiting the properties of the power source and the domain-specific information in the signal processing of embedded systems. First, we propose to dynamically adjust the modulation scheme to deal with time-varying wireless channel conditions and non-deterministic renewable energy levels in a coherent manner to maximize the data rate of RF circuits of the embedded systems. Then, we develop a <b>progressive</b> performance <b>tuning</b> approach to dynamically determine an acceptable signal processing performance in accordance with the changing energy level at runtime, by considering both of the non-deterministic characteristics of renewable energy and the unique relationship between signal processing performance and the required energy consumption. We also develop a link and energy adaptive UWB-based sensing technique to improve the detection time coverage and range coverage for self-sustained embedded applications. The proposed technique jointly exploits the link information between the transmitter and receiver of the UWB pulse radar, and the non-deterministic characteristics of the renewable energy, and dynamically adjusts the pulse repetition frequency of the UWB radar to enhance the sustainable operation under the unreliable energy supply. Finally, we present a low-power LDPC decoder design by exploiting inherent memory error statistics due to voltage scaling. After analyzing the error sensitivity to the decoding performance at different memory bits and memory locations in the LDPC decoder, we apply the scaled supply voltage to memory bits with high algorithmic error-tolerance capability to reduce the memory power consumption with minimal decoding performance loss...|$|R
40|$|Although all sensory {{circuits}} {{ascend to}} higher brain areas where stimuli {{are represented in}} sparse, stimulus-specific activity patterns, relatively {{little is known about}} sensory coding on the descending side of neural circuits, as a network converges. In insects, mushroom bodies have been an important model system for studying sparse coding in the olfactory system, where this format is important for accurate memory formation. In Drosophila, it has recently been shown that the 2, 000 Kenyon cells of the mushroom body converge onto a population of only 34 mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), which fall into 21 anatomically distinct cell types. Here we provide the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive view of olfactory representations at the fourth layer of the circuit, where we find a clear transition in the principles of sensory coding. We show that MBON tuning curves are highly correlated with one another. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} process of <b>progressive</b> decorrelation of <b>tuning</b> in the earlier layers of the circuit. Instead, at the population level, odour representations are reformatted so that positive and negative correlations arise between representations of different odours. At the single-cell level, we show that uniquely identifiable MBONs display profoundly different tuning across different animals, but that tuning of the same neuron across the two hemispheres of an individual fly was nearly identical. Thus, individualized coordination of tuning arises at this level of the olfactory circuit. Furthermore, we find that this individualization is an active process that requires a learning-related gene, rutabaga. Ultimately, neural circuits have to flexibly map highly stimulus-specific information in sparse layers onto a limited number of different motor outputs. The reformatting of sensory representations we observe here may mark the beginning of this sensory-motor transition in the olfactory system...|$|R
