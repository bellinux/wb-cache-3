This paper shall provide {{a closer look at}} the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Koper and its security. First, a historical overview and the geo-economic ambitions <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> are presented, followed by a concise review of the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code; the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Koper, like most global sea ports around the world, must comply with the ISPS Code. The <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Koper’s security governance will then be explored. Finally, an ethnographic study on port security in the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Rotterdam (Eski, 2015) shall be discussed, leading to key recommendations for the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Koper in advancing its security. The <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Koper aims to make security services responsible for specific port security tasks, through which multi-agency <b>policing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> is established, and by applying security technologies more intensively. The recommendations will point out that the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Koper must be aware of specific multi-agency policing-related challenges and how “the human element” might react to an increase in security technologies...|$|R

50|$|After {{separation}} {{had been}} secured, Mackinnon represented the Belfast and Warrnambool {{district in the}} old unicameral Victorian Legislative Council, and assisted to pass a measure intended to prevent the introduction of convicted offenders into the colony. He energetically combated {{the efforts of the}} imperial authorities to prevent the effective administration of the enactment; and on the popular opposition proving successful he proceeded in 1853 with William Westgarth to Tasmania to assist the anti-transportation party in the colony. Indeed, he took a strong interest in all the public movements of the day; and his vigour and courage were so well recognised that, in the early days when bushrangers were prevalent, he had been offered the command <b>of</b> the <b>police</b> force <b>of</b> <b>Port</b> Phillip—a position which, however, he did not accept. He was {{one of the members of}} the original Council of the University of Melbourne, and first Chairman of its Building Committee. When the gold discoveries in Victoria gave such a wonderful impetus to the colony, the vigorous judgment and business ability of Mackinnon, with the brilliant literary qualities of his partner, Edward Wilson, placed the Argus in the van of the Australian press. After some years of arduous work, Mackinnon returned to England, where he remained. He was twice married, his first wife being a daughter of Robert Montgomery, and sister of James Montgomery; and his second, Emily, daughter of Capt. Bundoch, R.N.|$|R

50|$|This {{remained}} the city's governing structure in 1993, when former President Raúl Alfonsín prevailed on his successor, President Carlos Menem, {{to agree to}} a limited devolution of governing powers to the city (the Olivos Pact). Accordingly, the 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution included article 129, which guaranteed Buenos Aires greater self-governance. The Indentente (appointed Mayor) was replaced by a Jefe de Gobierno (elected Mayor), and the city council by the Buenos Aires City Legislature. Shortly before the historic, June 30, 1996, elections to these posts, however, a senior Peronist Senator, Antonio Cafiero, succeeded in limiting the city's autonomy by advancing National Law 24.588, which reserved control of the 25,000-strong Policía Federal (the federally administered city <b>police),</b> the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Buenos Aires and other faculties to the national government.|$|R
