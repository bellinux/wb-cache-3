Hence, despite the fact that conformational polymorphs can be obtained from crystallisations in ethanol, we found no links between solution chemistry and crystallisation outcomes.

We also analyzed the same 43 DNA samples using microsatellite markers previously identified for A. catenella, comparing the PCR amplification success, the number of alleles and gene diversity. These three parameters were not significantly different, showing that the compound microsatellite markers have the same potential to reveal A. catenella genetic structure.

In particular, small molecular thienoimide (TI) based materials are emerging as novel multifunctional materials combining a good processability together to ambipolar or n-type charge transport and electroluminescence at the solid state, thus enabling the fabrication of integrated devices like organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and light emitting transistor (OLETs). Given this peculiar combination of characteristics, they also constitute the ideal substrates for fundamental studies on the structure-property relationships in multifunctional molecular systems. In this scenario, this thesis work {{is focused on the}} synthesis of new thienoimide based materials with tunable optical, packing, morphology, charge transport and electroluminescence properties by following a fine molecular tailoring, thus optimizing their performances in device as well as investigating and enabling new applications.

40|$|Recently, we {{identified}} that the single nucleus mechanism, {{in which all}} crystals in the suspension originate from the same parent single crystal, might occur more generally than is currently recognized, even in larger volumes. This {{has important implications for}} the control of industrial crystallization processes of <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compounds.</b> In this paper, we used polymorphism as a tool to validate this single nucleus mechanism. Isonicotinamide (INA) crystallizes as form II in ethanol solutions, form I in nitromethane, and form IV in nitrobenzene solutions. The metastable form I and form IV, furthermore, only very slowly transform to the stable form II in solvent mixtures of ethanol-nitromethane and ethanol-nitrobenzene. We performed multiple crystallization experiments in solvent mixtures of ethanol-nitromethane and ethanol-nitrobenzene which all resulted in the formation of either pure form I or pure form II and either pure form II or pure form IV, respectively. In ethyl acetate, 4 -hydroxyacetophenone (4 HAP) crystallizes as form II at lower concentrations and as form I at higher concentrations. Crystallization of 4 HAP as a function of concentration on a 3 mL scale results in either pure form I or pure form II. This can be well explained by the single nucleus mechanism. In terms of polymorphism, the control can be achieved by controlling the primary nucleation event that leads to the single crystal, which in turn defines the crystal form of the secondary nuclei. Seeding approaches using only a single crystal would then lead to the avoidance of primary nucleation and thus control over the polymorph obtained...|$|R

Two additional NO 3 - ions intercalate between the hexanuclear entities in order to ensure the electroneutrality of the crystal structure. Some crystallization water molecules fill the intermolecular space. The three first families of compounds (1 - 3) exhibit crystal structures that have previously been reported.

Modification of the physicochemical properties of the parent material by inclusion of a second component within the crystal structure, {{with the potential to}} lead to large improvements in useful attributes, being the key reason for the interest in co-crystals. Being able to efficiently utilise co-crystallisation to ameliorate problem properties of drugs or other compounds would be a boon to many industries, the pharmaceutical being an ideal example. Limitations in current ability to predict co-crystal formation and potential property modification presents a great opportunity for development in this research area. The work presented in this thesis encompasses the optimisation of a high-throughput ultrasonication based physical co-crystal screen paired with a computational pre-screen, the application of this optimised screen and the analysis of both co-crystalline and co-amorphous materials resulting from the screening. An initial optimisation of a manual physical co-crystal screen was later transferred to an automated screen implemented on a robotics platform. The implementation of the screen and subsequent analysis of products led to the discovery of the stabilisation of an amorphous form of highly <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compound,</b> ROY, through a predicted co-former interaction. The interactions responsible for the stabilisation were further investigated in the ROY:pyrogallol co-amorphous material and it was found that certain analogues of pyrogallol exhibit the same behaviour with ROY depending on the presence and position of specific functionality. Implementation of the optimised co-crystal screen to the antiprotozoal drug ornidazole led to the detection of 23 hits and the crystal structure of the 1 : 1 co-crystal of ornidazole and 5 nitroisophthalic acid being determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Characterisation of this co-crystal found that it crystallised much more readily than pure ornidazole, potentially improving its processing characteristics, but that unexpectedly had a lower intrinsic dissolution rate than either of the parent components. In comparison, formulation and characterisation of the already known zafirlukast:piperazine co-crystals showed that large improvements in dissolution rates and oral bioavailability in relation to the parent drug are possible. Specifically, the 1 : 1 zafirlukast:piperazine co-crystal showed a large increase in dissolution rate in vitro and an accompanying six-fold increase in in vivo oral bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{is faced with}} a wide range of complex problems, one of which is the relationship between different structural forms of crystalline materials of the same compound, so called polymorphism. In this Thesis Raman spectroscopy was used to search for spectroscopic evidence for the formation of nuclei as precursors to crystalline forms. This involved attempts to detect small changes in Raman spectra during crystallisation which were not associated with the simple conversion of a test compound in solution into solid crystals. However, near the start of the work it was discovered that the Raman spectra collected from a known monomorphic compound were not always reproducible, with variations in relative peak intensities, changes in band profiles and even disappearance of some peaks. Since these spectra l irregularities were not due to the presence of a new structural form, yet were similar to those which would indicate this to be the case, it was important to isolate the source of this variance and try to remove it. It was found that it was excitation of the crystals is along different crystallographic axes which was causing the marked differences in t e Raman spectra but that these effects could be significantly diminished, if not removed completely, by the collection and averaging of spectra orthogonal to each other. This has been demonstrated with two separate crystalline materials, one of which, the <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compound,</b> Carbamazepine. The second stage of this project involved the investigation of the early stages of crystal formation. Since Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to molecular arrangement, the changes seen with in the spectra during the transformation from solution to crystal may provide information on the pathway taken during crystal formation. In this work multivariate analysis, specifically principal component analysis (PCA), was used to search for small changes within the spectra of a sample undergoing crystallisation that might be associated with formation of nuclei prior to crystallisation. In this work evidence consistent with the presence of an intermediate stage were found during t he crystallisation of sucrose. It is believed this is the first time such an observation has been made using Raman spectroscopy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the crystallization of terthiophene, chosen as a model compound, {{has been carried out}} using the thermal gradient technique. We have observed that nucleation and growth can be decoupled for organic semiconductors (OSC) crystallizing from the melt in a temperature gradient and that these conditions lead to the generation of highly textured thin films with uniaxial in-plane alignment. Furthermore, adequate gradient conditions allow the selective growth of a single polymorphic form of terthiophene. The last results obtained on terthiophene concern the orientation of the unit cell with the reciprocal vector c* normal to the substrate and the alignment of the [100] and [- 100] directions parallel to the gradient direction. It is hypothesized that the geometry of the system and the temperature profile induce a preferential fast growth direction perpendicular to the gradient direction. In order to validate these results, we embarked on an exploratory {{study of the}} crystallization of a set of organic semiconductors, carefully selected based on rational arguments, to evaluate the potential of the thermal gradient process as well as the required parameters for an OSC to perform adequately in this treatment. As in the case of terthiophene, nucleation and growth can be decoupled for the other organic semiconductors depending on their rate of growth. Furthermore, {{we have been able to}} reproduce on another <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compound</b> the selective growth of a single polymorphic form by applying adequate gradient conditions. We have also observed that compounds tend to orient preferentially along one of their major morphological planes parallel to the substrate, indicating a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism. A careful comparison between the different samples allowed us to confirm and complete our growth mechanism proposition. Based on the undercooling, maximal growth rate, primary and secondary nucleation rates of the compound, geometry of the system and adequate gradient parameters, a preferential alignment of the crystals along the thermal gradient direction can be achieved. Finally, we showed through this investigation and careful comparison that 2, 7 -didodecyl[1]benzothieno[3, 2 -b][1]benzothiophene possesses all the characteristics to be an excellent material candidate for the thermal gradient processing: low primary nucleation rate, moderate undercooling, high growth rate, platelet-like crystal growth morphology and liquid crystal phase allowing preorganization of the compound before crystallization and processing on single substrates without dewetting. Moreover, this compound is currently one of the best solution processable organic semiconductors. We then investigated the directional crystallization of 2, 7 -dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3, 2 -b][1]benzothiophene directly from its liquid crystal phase as a function of thermal gradient parameters (magnitude of the gradient, sample velocity) and film thicknesses in thin film geometry (spin-coated films). Again, decoupling of the nucleation and growth has been observed for crystallization processed directly from the liquid crystal phase leading to the generation of highly textured films presenting uniaxial in-plane alignments of the crystallites. Moreover, secondary nucleation spots highlighted by POM in the alignment region give a clue to elucidate the alignment mechanism. The unit cell orients with the reciprocal vector c* normal to the substrate. Moreover, POM observation tends to indicate systematic thermal cracks orientations for higher rates of displacement (25 μm. s- 1) as well as a reduction of the number of domains present in the sample, suggesting a preferential alignment of the crystallites at higher rates of displacement. All our results indicate that an optimum of the quality of the aligned film is reached for thermal gradient conditions of 120 °C - 90 °C - 25 μm. s- 1.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} the interrelationship between thermodynamic, kinetic and structural aspects of crystal polymorphism. It is both experimental and theoretical, and limited {{with respect to}} compounds to substituted monocyclic aromatics. Two polymorphs of the compound m-aminobenzoic acid have been experimentally isolated and characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and optical microscopy. In addition, two polymorphs of the compound m-hydroxybenzoic acid have been isolated and characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, high-temperature XRPD, confocal Raman, hot-stage and scanning electron microscopy. For all polymorphs, melting properties and specific heat capacity have been determined calorimetrically, and the solubility in several pure solvents measured at different temperatures with a gravimetric method. The solid-state activity (ideal solubility), and the free energy, enthalpy and entropy of fusion have been determined as functions of temperature for all solid phases through a thermodynamic analysis of multiple experimental data. It is shown that m-aminobenzoic acid is an enantiotropic system, with a stability transition point determined to be located at approximately 156 °C, and that the difference in free energy at room temperature between the polymorphs is considerable. It is further shown that m-hydroxybenzoic acid is a monotropic system, with minor differences in free energy, enthalpy and entropy. 1393 primary nucleation experiments {{have been carried out}} for both compounds in different series of repeatability experiments, differing with respect to solvent, cooling rate, saturation temperature and solution preparation and pre-treatment. It is found that {{in the vast majority of}} experiments, either the stable or the metastable polymorph is obtained in the pure form, and only for a few evaluated experimental conditions does one polymorph crystallize in all experiments. The fact that the polymorphic outcome of a crystallization is the result of the interplay between relative thermodynamic stability and nucleation kinetics, and that it is vital to perform multiple experiments under identical conditions when studying nucleation of <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compounds,</b> is strongly emphasized by the results of this work. The main experimental variable which in this work has been found to affect which polymorph will preferentially crystallize is the solvent. For m-aminobenzoic acid, it is shown how a significantly metastable polymorph can be obtained by choosing a solvent in which nucleation of the stable form is sufficiently obstructed. For m-hydroxybenzoic acid, nucleation of the stable polymorph is promoted in solvents where the solubility is high. It is shown how this partly can be rationalized by analysing solubility data with respect to temperature dependence. By crystallizing solutions differing only with respect to pre-treatment and which polymorph was dissolved, it is found that the immediate thermal and structural history of a solution can have a significant effect on nucleation, affecting the predisposition for overall nucleation as well as which polymorph will preferentially crystallize. A set of polymorphic crystal structures has been compiled from the Cambridge Structural Database. It is found that statistically, about 50 % crystallize in the crystallographic space group P 21 /c. Furthermore, it is found that crystal structures of polymorphs tend to differ significantly with respect to either hydrogen bond network or molecular conformation. Molecular mechanics based Monte Carlo simulated annealing has been used to sample different potential crystal structures corresponding to minima in potential energy with respect to structural degrees of freedom, restricted to one space group, for each of the <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compounds.</b> It is found that all simulations result in very large numbers of predicted structures. About 15 % of the predicted structures have excess relative lattice energies of <= 10 % compared to the most stable predicted structure; a limit verified to reflect maximum lattice energy differences between experimentally observed polymorphs of similar compounds. The number of predicted structures is found to correlate to molecular weight and to the number of rotatable covalent bonds. A close study of two compounds has shown that predicted structures tend to belong to different groups defined by unique hydrogen bond networks, located in well-defined regions in energy/packing space according to the close-packing principle. It is hypothesized that kinetic effects in combination with this structural segregation might affect the number of potential structures that can be realized experimentally. The experimentally determined crystal structures of several compounds have been geometry-optimized (relaxed) to the nearest potential energy minimum using ten different combinations of common potential energy functions (force fields) and techniques for assigning nucleus-centred point charges used in the electrostatic description of the energy. Changes in structural coordinates upon relaxation have been quantified, crystal lattice energies calculated and compared with experimentally determined enthalpies of sublimation, and the energy difference before and after relaxation computed and analysed. It is found that certain combinations of force fields and charge assignment techniques work reasonably well for modelling crystal structures of small aromatics, provided that proper attention is paid to electrostatic description and to how the force field was parameterized. A comparison of energy differences for randomly packed as well as experimentally determined crystal structures before and after relaxation suggests that the potential energy function for the solid state of a small organic molecule is highly undulating with many deep, narrow and steep minima.

40|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{the most}} powerful technique for structural determination of proteins, a vital research tool, enabling insight at the atomic level, of the three dimensional structure of key protein receptors for potential drug compounds. To be successful, single, high quality crystals of the compound in question are required. Current methods to produce crystals involve frustratingly long timescales, extensive trial and error using large amounts of material, and have no guarantee of success. <b>Polymorphic</b> <b>compounds</b> add another level of frustration, requiring the thermodynamic control of crystallisation in order to overcome Ostwald’s rule of stages, which considers crystallisation from bulk solution to be under kinetic control with metastable polymorphs often crystallising initially. These factors have led to what is currently referred to as the “bottle-neck” of protein crystallisation, an acute problem motivating the rapid development of protein crystallisation techniques. This thesis aims to alleviate the bottle-neck found in protein crystallisation by exploring protein crystallisation using microemulsions; a technique, which until now, has only been successfully applied to the thermodynamic control of crystallisation for small compounds, such as 5 -methyl- 2 -[(2 -nitrophenyl) amino]- 3 -thiophenecarbonitrile (commonly known as ROY) and glycine. Through the application of several different surfactant systems for the crystallisation of model protein, Lysozyme, this thesis explores the use of microemulsions with the aim of producing high quality single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments. Numerous, large, high quality, single crystals of Lysozyme were successfully grown using a TritonX- 100 / 1 -hexanol surfactant system in which an anti-solvent, mixed microemulsion method was applied. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was effectively used to confirm formation of microemulsions and led to the determination of droplet sizes using generalised indirect Fourier Transform (GIFT) analysis. X-ray diffraction experiments showed single crystals grown from microemulsions to have a high internal order, with the resultant data sets of a publishable quality and of a comparative quality to data sets collected from crystals grown using standard vapour diffusion crystallisation techniques. This thesis demonstrates, for the first time, that microemulsions can be successfully used to produce high quality, single crystals of the protein, Lysozyme, shining light on this novel technique as a potential means of relieving the bottle-neck of protein crystallisation. Future directions of this work include exploring the robustness of the microemulsion crystallisation technique with other proteins such as insulin, glucose isomerase and albumin. Expanding this novel technique to the crystallisation of membrane proteins may be initially explored through the crystallisation of a 25 residue, membrane spanning part of the M 2 protein of the influenza virus. This would provide an interesting starting point due to the proteins’ biological importance as a target of anti-influenza drugs. ...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{manufacturing}} {{has gained}} significant interest {{in recent years}} as the ultra-lean mode of pharmaceutical production. Albeit the increasing number of studies on the process dynamics in continuous crystallization, in particular in yield improvement and impurity separation, the research community lacks the systematic understanding of the control of polymorphism in continuous crystallization. Variations in the polymorphism of the active pharmaceutical ingredient can undermine the bioavailability and the downstream processability of the drug substance. Thus, precise control of the drug polymorphism is pivotal for delivering quality drug products to the patients. In this thesis work, we aimed to develop a series of steps forward in understanding the polymorph dynamics in continuous crystallization, notably in mixed-suspension, mixed-product removal (MSMPR) crystallization. We first elucidated the major intrinsic and extrinsic factors which govern the process polymorphism in both monotropic and enantiotropic <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Using the monotropic L-glutamic acid as the model compound, two temperature regimes each with distinctive kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics were identified. It is found that at high temperatures, the polymorph dynamics is mediated by the relative thermodynamics of the polymorphs. The most stable form {{is likely to be the}} dominant form at steady state. On the other hand, at low temperatures, the interplay of the crystal growth and nucleation kinetics is found to play an important role in determining the final polymorphism. Similar results were identified in the enantiotropic p-aminobenzoic acid system where three temperature regimes were identified. The additional regime is located near to the transition temperature where the chemical potential of the two polymorphs are identical. The steady state polymorphism is thereby determined by the kinetic energy barriers for the crystallization of the polymorphs. The study of polymorphism was also conducted in cooling-antisolvent crystallization and the effect of solvent composition on the polymorph dynamics was studied. In addition, the dynamic pathways connecting the startup states to the metastable steady states and the stable steady states were determined. The polymorphic transition between these steady states was observed and analyzed. The fundamental understanding of the kinetic competition and the governing dynamics in polymorphic crystallization forms the backbone for developing the polymorph control strategies in this thesis. Based on the polymorph dynamic studies, we designed MSMPR cascade systems to control the process polymorphism. In addition, systematic procedures are established to facilitate the design and optimization of continuous crystallization with the objectives to control polymorphism, optimize process yield and achieve the target crystal size distribution. The operational window is determined within which these control objectives are achieved. As there are increasing interests in transitioning pharmaceutical manufacturing from batch to continuous processing, the results in this thesis should develop a substantial position in the body of scientific literature. by Tsai-Ta Christopher Lai.

40|$|Nuclear {{quadrupole}} resonance (NQR) is a {{radio frequency}} (RF) technique, {{able to distinguish}} between <b>polymorphic</b> forms of <b>compounds</b> containing quadrupolar nuclei, a requirement fulfilled by many high explosives and narcotics. To alleviate the problems of {{low signal to noise}} ratio and strong RF interference in NQR detection, various multi-sensor NQR signal detection algorithms have recently been proposed. These algorithms, however, assume the presence of a single polymorph with its associated amplitudes known to within a scaling, and any error in this a priori information will lead to performance degradation. In this paper, we develop a robust multi-sensor hybrid algorithm able to process NQR signals from multiple polymorphs while allowing the associated amplitudes to vary within an uncertainty hyper-sphere. Numerical investigations indicate that the proposed algorithm provides significant performance gains as compared to existing algorithms when there are multiple polymorphs present and/or when uncertainties in the amplitudes exist...|$|R

40|$|Open–framework {{inorganic}} {{materials are}} an important class of compounds because of their many applications {{in the areas of}} ion–exchange, separation and catalysis. Ever since the discovery of microporous aluminophosphates by Flanigen and co–workers in the early 80 ’s, the field of open–framework compounds has witnessed explosive growth. It is now established that the open–framework compounds comprise of almost all the elements of the periodic table. In addition, {{it has been shown that}} the inorganic anions in the open–framework compounds can be partially substituted by rigid organic linkers such as the oxalate. The resulting inorganic–organic hybrid structures are interesting due to the variable nature of the binding properties of the organic and inorganic moieties. The present thesis consists of systematic studies on the formation of amine–templated inorganic open–framework structures and inorganic–organic hybrid compounds based on the main group, transition metal and actinide elements. In Chapter 1 of the thesis an overview of inorganic open-framework materials is presented, with an emphasis on the elements that have been employed in the present study. Chapter 2 has two parts (Parts A and B) describing the synthesis and structure of open-framework tin(II) containing compounds. In Part A, the syntheses and structures of amine–templated tin(II) phosphates are presented, and in Part B, the syntheses and structures of a family of tin(II) oxalate compounds are discussed. Weak intermolecular forces such as hydrogen-bond interactions, π•••π interactions, and lone-pair–π interactions have been observed in these compounds, and appear to lend structural stability. As part of this study, efforts have been made to evaluate the energies associated with the π•••π interactions and the lone-pair–π interactions using suitable theoretical models. In Chapter 3, a new family of organically templated hybrid materials based on indium, synthesized by partially substituting the inorganic anion (phosphite/phosphate/suphate) by the oxalate group, is presented. These compounds exhibit a wide range of structures in which the oxalates play a variety of roles. The observation of the first zero-dimensional molecular hybrid structure and the isolation of concomitant <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compounds</b> is noteworthy. The molecular hybrid structure is reactive and undergoes transformation reactions under both acidic and basic conditions. In Chapter 4, the synthesis and structural studies of five new open–framework phosphate and phosphite compounds of gallium are presented. All the compounds have three-dimensional structures, and the formation of a gallium phosphate based on only one type of building unit (spiro– 5) is noteworthy. While a large number of organically templated transition metal phosphates have been synthesized, studies on transition metal phosphites are not many. In Chapter 5, the synthesis, structure and magnetic properties of a family of transition metal (cobalt, vanadium, manganese) phosphite structures templated by the organic amines are presented. A previously known vanadyl phosphite has also been isolated and investigated by temperature dependent ESR and magnetic susceptibility studies. All the transition metal compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic behavior. In Chapter 6, the synthesis, structure, and transformation reactions in amine-templated actinide phosphonoacetates are presented. The compounds, which are based on uranium and thorium, are built up from the connectivity between the metal polyhedra and the phosphonoacetate/oxalate units, forming two– and three–dimensional structures. It has been shown that the two–dimensional uranyl phosphonoacetate–oxalate compound can be prepared by two different synthetic approaches: (i) solvent–free solid state reaction at 150 ˚C and (ii) room temperature mechanochemical (grinding) route. The formation of oxalate hybrids using the phosphonocarboxylate ligand is a new approach in the synthesis of multi-component hybrid compounds...|$|R

Although metastable phases are ubiquitous in both nature and technology, only a heuristic {{understanding of their}} underlying thermodynamics exists. We report a large-scale data-mining study of the Materials Project, a high-throughput database of density functional theory–calculated energetics of Inorganic Crystal Structure Database structures, to explicitly quantify the thermodynamic scale of metastability for 29, 902 observed inorganic crystalline phases. We reveal the influence of chemistry and composition on the accessible thermodynamic range of crystalline metastability for <b>polymorphic</b> and phase-separating <b>compounds,</b> yielding new physical insights that can guide the design of novel metastable materials. We further assert that not all low-energy metastable compounds can necessarily be synthesized, and propose a principle of ‘remnant metastability’—that observable metastable crystalline phases are generally remnants of thermodynamic conditions where they were once the lowest free-energy phase.

40|$|Crystallization is an {{essential}} step in many processes in chemical industries, ranging from bulk chemicals to special products. It is a separation and purification technique that results in a solid particulate product, which is generally preferred in the pharmaceutical industry. The crystal product quality {{is determined by the}} specific crystal form (polymorph) crystallized, and by the crystal size, morphology and purity. It depends heavily on the process conditions under which crystal nucleation occurs. During the crystal nucleation event, parameters that are essential for the product quality, in particular the polymorph formed, are not very well established. The nucleation event is still poorly understood and is therefore difficult to control and optimize. Crystal nucleation sets the initial crystal size distribution at the start of unseeded batch crystallization processes and is the first and most important step in this process (Chapter 1). A fundamental understanding of crystal nucleation is needed for the rigorous control and prediction of the crystalline product quality of any crystallization processes on industrial scale. Also the lead compounds in pharmaceutical industry become more and more complex. As a result crystallization research becomes increasingly fundamental while model compounds have shifted from bulk chemicals to high added-value chemicals. A fundamental understanding of molecular processes during crystallization is becoming increasingly important not in the least when applied on an industrial scale. In this thesis we improve the knowledge and understanding of crystal nucleation of organic compounds from solution. The research starts with comparing two newly developed methods to measure heterogeneous nucleation kinetics by determining crystal nucleation rates in stirred solutions (Chapter 2). Both methods make use of the stochastic nature of crystal nucleation by determining and analysing the variation in nucleation kinetic measurements. The values of the kinetic parameter (A) obtained in the present thesis are low compared to the theoretical values. This could be due to both a lower than expected attachment frequency of building units to the nucleus and a lower than expected concentration of active nucleation sites (heterogeneous particles) in the solution. It was further identified that the single nucleus mechanism, in which all crystals in the suspension originate from the same parent single crystal, might occur more generally than is currently recognized, even in larger volumes. In this thesis we used concomitant polymorphism as a tool to validate this single nucleus mechanism (Chapter 3). The single nucleus mechanism has important implications for the control of industrial crystallization processes of <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compounds.</b> In terms of crystal size distribution, control can be obtained by controlling the secondary rather than the primary nucleation event for which completely different control procedures are needed. In terms of polymorphism, the control can be achieved by controlling the primary nucleation event that leads to the single crystal, which in turn defines the crystal form of the secondary nuclei. One of the major challenges the pharmaceutical industry is faced in production, where often during cooling crystallization the product separates not as crystals but as a viscous liquid. This phenomenon is referred to as oiling out or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The effect of LLPS on the crystallization of 4 -hydroxyacetophenon (4 HAP) in water, water-ethanol mixtures and ethyl acetate solutions were shown in Chapter 4. For HAP, the LLPS is a stable region above the saturation temperature of 52 °C, 36 °C and 30 °C of 4 HAP in water, water-ethanol (90 - 10 wt%) and water-ethanol (80 - 20 wt%) mixtures, respectively. Cooling crystallization experiments always resulted into mixtures of polymorphic fractions if the LLPS preceded 4 HAP crystallization. The results suggest that the crystallization behavior is strongly influenced by the presence of this LLPS. Due to the LLPS the nucleation may proceed on the droplet surface and the single nucleus mechanism does not hold anymore. The crystallization within the LLPS region seems to lead to agglomeration of the particles. One of the causes for the low kinetic parameter A of the nucleation rate equation was identified in Chapter 3 to be the building units that attach to the nucleus and thus determine the attachment frequency. The effect of these solution-building units or associates in solution was investigated in Chapter 5. The model compound used was isonicotinamide, which has an amide group that can form both homosynthons and heterosynthons by self-association. We show that, in a controlled and reproducible way, specific solvents lead to specific polymorphic forms of isonicotinamide. We argue on the basis of Raman and FTIR spectroscopy that the hydrogen bonding (self-association) in solution kinetically drives the nucleation towards a specific form. The self-association in solution reflects the crystal structure of the obtained polymorph. The method based on self-association of molecules in solution may help in reproducible production of polymorphs. In chapter 6 we propose a polymorph screening method based on the identification of crystal building units using Raman, FTIR and NMR techniques. We demonstrated this new approach by relating the structural outcome of the crystallization process of Isonicotinamide (INA), Nicotinamide (NA), Picolinamide (PA), Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Diprophylline (DPL) to the association and self-association processes in solutions, which are largely influenced by the hydrogen bonding capacity of the solvent. The screening method based on the identification of crystal building units may help to discover new polymorphs. The self-association method offers the ability to identify solvents or solvent mixtures that promote or avoid the presence of specific building units and in this way control the building unit towards polymorphs having specific structural features. As identified in chapter 3, another cause for the low kinetic factor in nucleation is the heterogeneous particle. Nothing is known about the actual concentration and functionality of these heterogeneous particles while they tremendously affect nucleation behavior. We therefore investigated the interplay between self-associates in solution and well-defined heterogeneous template surface by studying the crystallization behavior of isonicotinamide (INA) and 2, 6 -dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHB) (Chapter 7). Well-defined templates were prepared by making Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAM) onto a gold surface. The self-association of INA and DHB were investigated using spectroscopic techniques. Raman spectroscopy of the crystal-template surface after template crystallization suggests that molecular interactions between INA or DHB associates and the SAM are responsible for the formation of specific polymorphs. XRPD helped in the identification of the crystal orientation on the template surface further verifying the importance of solute interactions with the functionalized template surface. The systematic analysis of the association processes in solutions and the interplay with well-defined templates is beneficial in the development of polymorph discovery and preparation methods as well as control over crystallization processes. Industrially, the thesis results may not only help to discover new polymorphs but can also help in reproducible industrial production of polymorphs. On Industrial scale seeding approaches using only a single crystal can lead to the avoidance of primary nucleation and thus control over the polymorph obtained. The combination of well-defined template surfaces and the self-association method {{can be used as a}} screening method in the early drug discovery and development phase but also define robust conditions for industrial crystallization of polymorphs. This will not only help to discover and reproducibly prepare polymorphs, but a more comprehensive screening can be performed at reduced cost. Industries can implement the results to improve crystal product qualities and can also discover and optimize the quality of new crystal products by incorporating the methods in the development process. Scientifically, this thesis opened the route towards a thorough study of heterogeneous nucleation of <b>polymorphic</b> <b>compounds</b> taking into account self-association, template effects and relative stability of polymorphs. Such a study would result in an accurate molecular interpretation of crystal nucleation and would finally enable the validation of heterogeneous nucleation theories. As analytical techniques become more and more powerful, finding new and better ways to powerful insights in the crystal nucleation research become easier. Utilization of these principles and tools not only allow studying crystal nucleation, but also allows the understanding of nucleation processes to a new level. Molecular simulations are still needed to bridge the gap between solution chemistry and crystal nucleation rate analysis to come to a molecular interpretation of crystal nucleation of organic compounds. The new experimental approaches described in this thesis will boost the existing methods for polymorph prediction and in particular for predicting the conditions for polymorph formation.

The cocrystals with formamide (T: 1), acetamide (T: 2) and benzamide (T: 5), and one polymorph of the cocrystal with pyrazinamide (T: 6 -I), contain an R 22 (9) hydrogen bonding motif between the amide cocrystal formers and the HN-C-C=O moiety of the theophylline molecule (an amide-pseudo amide synthon). This motif was, however, {{absent from the}} other polymorph of the pyrazinamide cocrystal (T: 6 -II), and also from the N-methylformamide cocrystal (T: 3) (and is not possible in the N,N-dimethylformamide cocrystal (T: 4)). These observations are rationalised using hydrogen bond propensity calculations, although limitations of using such calculations for predicting cocrystallisation are noted. The amide-pseudo amide synthon is favoured when theophylline cocrystallises with both primary amides and with secondary amides which are locked in a cis configuration. On heating, all cocrystals were found to dissociate before melting due to loss of the amide, making stability to dissociation a more meaningful measure of cocrystal stability than melting point for these systems. On dissociation of the cocrystals, theophylline typically crystallises as the commonly observed polymorph Form II.

The interest of the pharmaceutical field in the development of SCF techniques is increasing due to the need for clean processes, reduced consumption of energy, and to their several possible applications. The food field is still far from the application of SCF micronization techniques, but there is increasing interest mainly for the processing of products with high added value. The aim {{of this study is to}} use SCF micronization techniques {{for the production of}} particles of pharmaceuticals and food ingredients with controlled particle size and morphology, and to look at their production on semi-industrial scale. The results obtained are also used to understand the processes from the perspective of broader application within the pharmaceutical and food industries. Certain pharmaceuticals, a biopolymer and a food ingredient have been tested using supercritical antisolvent micronization (SAS) or supercritical assisted atomization (SAA) techniques. The reproducibility of the SAS technique has been studied using physically different apparatuses and on both laboratory and semi-industrial scale. Moreover, a comparison between semi-continuous and batch mode has been performed. The behaviour of the system during the SAS process has been observed using a windowed precipitation vessel. The micronized powders have been characterized by particle size and distribution, morphology and crystallinity. Several analyses have been performed to verify if the SCF process modified the structure of the compound or caused degradation or contamination of the product. The different powder morphologies obtained have been linked to the position of the process operating point with respect to the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of the systems studied, that is, mainly to the position of the mixture critical point (MCP) of the mixture. Spherical micro, submicro- and nanoparticles, expanded microparticles (balloons) and crystals were obtained by SAS. The obtained particles were amorphous or with different degrees of crystallinity and, in some cases, had different pseudo-polymorphic or <b>polymorphic</b> forms. A <b>compound</b> that could not be processed using SAS was micronized by SAA, and amorphous particles were obtained, stable in vials at room temperature. The SCF micronization techniques studied proved to be effective and versatile for the production of particles for several uses.

40|$|Glycation is a non-enzymatic {{reaction}} with reactants {{including a}} reducing sugar {{and a free}} amino containing molecule such as protein, amino acids, DNA, RNA and lipids. In the initial phase of glycation, the carbonyl group of the reducing carbohydrate condenses with the free amino groups on the target biomolecule to form reversible glycosylamines, which are then converted to more stable Amadori products. Once formed, these Amadori products can with time undergo dehydration, cyclization, oxidation, and rearrangement to form a <b>polymorphic</b> group of <b>compounds</b> collectively referred to as Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs). The accumulation of AGEs in vivo has been implicated as a major pathogenic process in diabetic complications including diabetic cataract formation, retinopathy and neurological diseases, {{as well as other}} health disorders, such as Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD). Chapter one reviewed the chemistry of glycation and the formation of AGEs in a mechanical perspective. The role of AGEs in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease were considered. Here we also reviewed the potential inhibitors against glycation published to date, focusing on some novel potential AGE inhibitors such as zinc and gold nanoparticles. The purpose of the study described in chapter two was to investigate the susceptibility of the amine groups of melamine to glycation by milk sugars and sugar metabolites. Dairy products adulterated with melamine have been recently blamed for the death of at least several infants and the sickening of countless children in China. The presented study described the non-enzymatic glycation of melamine with milk sugar D-galactose and several sugar metabolites including methylglyoxal, glyoxal and DL-glyceraldehyde. The chemical structures of melamine AGEs were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry. The factors influencing the rate and extent of melamine 2 ̆ 7 s glycation were also evaluated. The third part of the dissertation described a study on anti-glycation effect of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). In this study we showed that certain sizes of spherical GNPs exhibit an inhibitory effect on the formation of AGEs when Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was glycated by D-ribose. A combination of UV spectrometry, HPLC and circular dichroism showed that only GNPs with size ranging from 2 nm to 20 nm inhibited the formation of BSA AGEs. The inhibition effect of GNPs was correlated to the overall surface area of nanoparticles in the solution. GNPs with higher surface areas were found to be better inhibitors of glycation, whereas those with low surface areas were less effective inhibitors. The inhibitory effect of GNPs on non-enzymatic glycation reactions {{may be due to the}} covalent bonding between gold atoms on the surface of GNP and E. amino groups of L-lysine residue on protein. In chapter four, we evaluated the effect of UVC radiation on glycation of Human Serum Albumin (HSA). In this study, we found that exposure to UVC radiation accelerated the glycation level of HSA and promoted the formation of AGEs, which may be stimulated by the generation of ROS by UVC radiation. A combination of several analytical methods including UV spectrometry, HPLC, and MALDI-TOF were used to evaluate the glycation level of HSA at 37 °C under neutral pH in the presence of D-glucose in vitro. This study warrants further investigation as there have been few reports on the correlation between the UVC radiation of proteins and their enhanced glycation by a reducing sugar...|$|R
