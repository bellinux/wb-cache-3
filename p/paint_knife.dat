He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends in his own way. He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media—oil paint, watercolor, ink, pastel, etching, and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal foils, fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint. Klee employed spray <b>paint,</b> <b>knife</b> application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and mixed media such as oil with watercolor, watercolor with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.|$|E

50|$|He {{received}} his primary education along the places of the family’s moves, in schools at Penvern, and Bréhat, in Brittany, then in Gargilesse-Dampierre and Fresselines in the Creuse area. His secondary education {{was completed in}} Sainte-Croix school in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. He did not attend any art school or studio. His artistic education was provided by his father, the painter-etcher-watercolorist :sv:Allan Österlind, of post romantic and naturalist inclination, and by his French friends Maurice Rollinat, Maxime Maufra, Jean-François Raffaëlli, {{as well as by}} the Nordic community he used to get with, and in particular the swede Per Ekström who taught him the art of <b>painting</b> <b>knife</b> which shall become a feature of his work.|$|R
5000|$|Each 30-minute show usually {{begins with}} Ross (or a guest) {{standing}} in front of a blank canvas against a white or black background. Guests included Ross's long-time friend Dana Jester, along with Ross's son Steve, his old instructor John Thamm, and many others. Within the 30-minute program, Ross painted an imaginary landscape, using the wet-on-wet oil painting technique, in which the painter continues adding paint on top of still-wet paint rather than waiting for each layer of paint to dry. Combining this method with the use of two-inch and other types of brushes, as well as <b>painting</b> <b>knives,</b> allowed him to paint trees, water, clouds, and mountains in a matter of seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Hawkins {{work has}} always {{concentrated}} on landscape. Early paintings were figurative painted in watercolour on location. After {{he turned to}} acrylic his practice became increasingly studio based but with reference to frequent camping and walking trips throughout Scotland. The work has been abstract at times and representational at others a progression that the artist describes as [...] "being like climbing a spiral staircase, by turns arriving at a similar point but from a different perspective". The surfaces of the paintings are complex and textured the artist applying paint with large <b>painting</b> <b>knives</b> and pieces of board. Most recently he has been making cut out paintings, fragments of landscape that are freestanding irregular shapes mounted on carbon fiber.|$|R
50|$|Ross {{used the}} wet-on-wet oil {{painting}} technique, {{in which the}} painter continues adding paint on top of still-wet paint rather than waiting a lengthy {{amount of time to}} allow each layer of paint to dry. From the beginning, the program kept the selection of tools and colors simple so that viewers would not have to make large investments in expensive equipment. Ross frequently recommended odorless paint thinner (aka odorless mineral spirits) for brush cleaning. Combining the wet painting method with the use of large one- and two-inch brushes, as well as <b>painting</b> <b>knives,</b> allowed Ross to paint trees, clouds, mountains, and water in a matter of seconds. Each painting would start with simple strokes that appeared as nothing more than smudges of color. As he added more and more strokes, the blotches would transform into intricate landscapes.|$|R

40|$|I {{explore the}} use of color and texture to create mood and drama. I {{typically}} focus on landscape images, in which I can {{convey a sense of}} whimsy, mystery, community, or solitude. I use non-naturalistic colors and stylize the objects in my paintings but they are still identifiable as landscapes. My color choices, combined with the abstracted landscapes, urges the viewer to look at the world around them in new ways. I use a variety of materials to create my work including oil, acrylics, art papers, fabrics, miscellaneous fibers, and found objects. The tools I use include brushes, <b>painting</b> <b>knives,</b> plastic bags, cloth, and my fingers. Using a variety of materials and tools allows me to create complex texture and a sense of depth in my paintings. My goal is to give the viewer a lift or energy boost. I want the experience to be positive for the viewer and cause them to be curious and want to keep looking...|$|R

5000|$|Rob Schamberger is an American painter, {{best known}} for his {{portraiture}} of professional wrestlers. He is currently the host of Canvas 2 Canvas on the WWE Network. He currently resides in Kansas City. Rob's technique involves the tracing/copying of promotional images or video stills to paper or canvas after which he uses various materials such as acrylic (Liquitex basics or Amsterdam standard series are favourites), watercolour (appear to be unbranded pan sets), ink and paint markers, to create his work. Often many materials are used in the same painting in a mixed media fashion. Schamberger uses what appear to be synthetic round brushes in a variety of sizes as well as a <b>painting</b> <b>knife</b> to create his works. Regarding tracing Schamberger himself has stated - [...] "Man, I could give a damn."Schamberger has a great eye for unusual colour combinations and uses a technique not unlike the posturization tool in Photoshop to break down the original reference photos to create something that is often quite unique when compared to the source material although his work in ink can vary in quality with some likenesses not quite hitting the mark. This might be as a result of having his reference on a monitor some way behind him and to one side rather than closer to hand. This can be seen briefly in some of the Canvas 2 Canvas videos and might be as a result of trying to avoid comparisons from viewers about the direct referencing of images in a painting by numbers fashion or an attempt to hide photomanipulation that is done in advance of the painting as although these steps are a common part of many illustrators work processes some artists can remain sensitive about how much is referenced to avoid criticism. Whatever the case Schamberger has a distinctive style and though his grinding he has created a near six figure business, something to be admired.|$|R
2500|$|The Forge emphasises the muscularity of the men, who are {{rendered}} as classically heroic with thick, {{strong arms}} and heavy masculine backs. Yet their faces indicate a coarseness of temperament—a device likely {{used to make}} them more identifiable to the common man. The figures are likely intended to represent the working class of the 19th-century Spain—hammering out {{the future of the country}} in a literal allegory to the then-popular saying [...] "on the anvil of history". In this way, the work evokes the imagery of resistance to the French threat from Napoleon, earlier examined by Goya in his 1808 <b>painting</b> The <b>Knife</b> Grinder, and may refer to the peoples' participation in drafting the Constitution. Though a court painter, Goya was sensitive throughout his life to the plight of common men. He often captured their everyday lives, usually emphasising the dignity of work or the suffering of war.|$|R
5000|$|Waugh's 1947 survey, The Comics, was {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} history and analysis of comic strips. The book was reviewed in 1948 as fulfilling [...] "the need for a thoroughgoing study of this flourishing branch of popular literature". Waugh also wrote a series of instructional books, including two on <b>painting</b> with palette <b>knives,</b> {{and he was the}} editor during the 1940s and 1950s of the textbooks used in the home study course of Art Instruction, Inc. His other books include Space Answer Book (1972) and Fish and Underwater Life.|$|R
2500|$|Weiss uses a wood palette {{and a small}} {{range of}} colors; {{typically}} titanium white, yellow ochre, ultramarine blue and cadmium red light, sometimes {{with the addition of}} a deeper red, cadmium yellow light, cerulean and green. [...] He occasionally <b>paints</b> with a <b>knife,</b> but mostly with flat brushes to achieve [...] "a kind of blocky modeling". He uses Claessens oil-primed linen for portraits and panels for landscape work. After forming quick outlines, he works rapidly to block in the light and dark areas of the figure and major compositional elements with turpentine-thinned paint. Following this first stage which takes around half-an-hour, he reworks the areas a dozen times or more, constantly refining and unifying.|$|R
5000|$|Oval {{received}} both {{praise and}} controversy for its styling methods, such as literally deconstructing music and digital audio by using exacto <b>knives,</b> <b>paint,</b> and tape {{to damage the}} surfaces of compact discs, only to stitch the sound back together in loops of melody punctuated by the disc's physical skips. On its initial release, Select noted in their review that Oval [...] "sound unlike any other combo" [...] on Diskont '94. The review went on to note that group have been described in desperation as techno and critiqued this reference stating [...] "try dancing {{to the sort of}} erratic pulsing and hiccuping that comes over like the read-out from a dying alien's electrocardiograph".|$|R

25|$|Numerous acts of {{vandalism}} against art exhibits are known and some objects, such as Mona Lisa, Night Watch and The Little Mermaid, have been intentionally damaged several times. Many vandals {{were diagnosed with}} a mental disorder and some, such as Hans-Joachim Bohlmann, {{had a history of}} attacking artworks. A vast amount of damage consists of leaving a minor scratch, a stuck chewing gum, a pencil mark and so on, and usually escapes publicity. More visible acts {{of vandalism}} were premeditated, as the tool of destruction– a <b>knife,</b> <b>paint,</b> acid or hammer– was intentionally brought to the scene. In most cases, the artworks were restored. Restorations were costly and time-consuming and in many cases were followed by shielding the artwork from future attacks.|$|R
50|$|Arnold-Graboné became {{well known}} for his unique style of Palette <b>knife</b> <b>painting.</b> His {{technique}} used the texture of thickly applied paint to create an actual three-dimensional representation of a landscape. In Graboné’s works, the colors are remarkable for their brilliance, distinguishing his landscapes from those of other pallet-knife painters. The brilliance {{is a result of}} Graboné’s color-separation technique in knife-painting. His favorite subjects were of the Alps of Bavaria and South Tirole, the Isle of Capri, the English Garden in Munich, the lake region surrounding Starnberg, and fishing boats on the North Sea. His unusual signature is incised into the wet paint with {{the opposite end of the}} brush, almost invariably on the bottom left hand of his oil paintings (and on the bottom right for watercolors).|$|R
50|$|Alongside Lyrical Abstract {{painters}} in France, the Automatistes favoured a fluid, painterly technique {{over the}} comparatively reserved, hard-edge abstraction so {{popular in the}} U.S. and Eastern Europe at the time. Much like a nonfigurative Group of Seven, they were looking to create a distinctively Canadian artistic identity. Heavily influenced by Surrealist manifestos and poetry, their work was largely stream-of-consciousness inspired, believing {{this to be a}} truer means of communicating subconscious emotions and sensory experiences; they wanted to be liberated from intention, reason, and any kind of structure, in order to communicate a universal human experience without bias. This resulted in increasingly crude or intuitive methods such as applying <b>paint</b> with palette <b>knives</b> and fingers and painting blindfolded, their efforts contradicting their claims of working without intention.|$|R

50|$|Many of Backus' earlier {{paintings}} {{dating from}} the 1930s to the late 1960s are categorized as being more impressionistic than most of his later works and were often done with a palette <b>knife.</b> <b>Paint</b> {{was applied to the}} canvas or board with impetuous and generous strokes. The palette knife was used deftly and with great boldness. The juxtaposition of color next to color created a new and different reality for the viewer. Other than the early 20th century vacationing artists such as Winslow Homer or the Hudson River School icon Herman Herzog, Backus was the first artist to truly see the subtle beauty of Florida and to attempt to capture it on canvas. Backus was the seminal Florida landscape painter. All those who followed were in some way trying to emulate his work.|$|R
5000|$|Marats {{figure is}} idealized. For example, the {{painting}} contains {{no sign of}} his skin problems, his skin appears clean and unblemished. David, however, drew other details from his visit to Marats residence {{the day before the}} assassination: the green rug, the papers, and the pen. David promised his peers in the National Convention that he would later depict their murdered friend invocatively as [...] "écrivant pour le bonheur du peuple" [...] (writing {{for the good of the}} people). The Death of Marat is designed to commemorate a personable hero. Although the name Charlotte Corday can be seen on the paper held in Marats left hand, she herself is not visible. Close inspection of this painting shows Marat at his last breath, when Corday and many others were still nearby (Corday did not try to escape). Therefore, David intended to record more than just the horror of martyrdom. In this sense, for realistic as it is in its details, the painting, as a whole, from its start, is a methodical construction focusing on the victim, a striking set up regarded today by several critics as an [...] "awful beautiful lie"— certainly not a photograph in the forensic scientific sense and barely the simple image it may seem (for instance, in the <b>painting,</b> the <b>knife</b> is not to be seen where Corday had left it impaled in Marats chest, but on the ground, beside the bathtub).|$|R

THE COMPUTER BEFORE THE JACQUARD I continuously worked to develop a specific approach combining the theoretical principles of weaving with my interest in abstract art with a specific interest in color blending, or color separation, color juxtaposition. Images before jacquard were not so important to me, they served as a tool to experiment on color blending, on material, on weave structures themselves. I would compare my approach to other art field experimentation, like [...] .

5000|$|In 1954 Hünerfauth {{received}} private training by {{the informal}} painter :de:Conrad Westpfahl (1891-1976) which {{led her to}} abstract painting. In 1958 she attended courses on etching and lithography. In 1959, shewas awarded with the Prixd'Unions des Femmes Peintres in Paris for her painting titled [...] "Düsternis" [...] (Gloom). Two female artists (Lentz and Strauss) expressed their disapproval {{and one of them}} cut her <b>painting</b> with a <b>knife.</b> Hünerfauth had it restored. The art critic Franz Roh (1890-1965) and his wife Juliane Roh were early supporters and patrons of Hünerfauth's work. They encouraged her and featured her work very positively in their publications. Hünerfauth was dealt a hard blow when Franz Roh died and printed a series of 10 lithographies [...] "In Memory of Franz Roh, 1966". In 1962, she attended a course on welding and subsequently began creating her first sculptures made out of scrap metal. In 1964 she received the advancement award from the Herbstsalon München (Autumn exhibition Art Salon Munich).|$|R
25|$|Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{paintings}} at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It is viewed by about 4,000 to 5,000 visitors daily with its value estimated at $925,000 in the 1970s. The painting was vandalized on several occasions. On 13 January 1911, an unemployed navy cook tried to cut it with a knife, but could not cut through the thick varnish on the painting. In 1975, William de Rijk, an unemployed school teacher, cut dozens of zigzag lines in the <b>painting</b> with a <b>knife</b> before he was wrestled by the guards. The day before, de Rijk had been turned away from the museum because he arrived after closing time. After the event, he was identified with a mental disorder; he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and committed suicide there on 21 April 1976. It took six months to restore the painting, and traces of the cuts still remain. In 1990, a man threw acid on the painting. The guards managed to quickly dilute it with water so that it penetrated only the varnish layer, and the painting was restored again.|$|R

6000|$|If {{the visitor}} is {{inclined}} to carry away any little memorial of Warwick, he had better go to an Old Curiosity Shop in the High Street, {{where there is a}} vast quantity of obsolete gewgaws, great and small, and many of them so pretty and ingenious that you wonder how they came to be thrown aside and forgotten. As regards its minor tastes, the world changes, but does not improve; it appears to me, indeed, that there have been epochs of far more exquisite fancy than the present one, in matters of personal ornament, and such delicate trifles as we put upon a drawing-room table, a mantel-piece, or a whatnot. The shop in question is near the East Gate, but is hardly to be found without careful search, being denoted only by the name of [...] "REDFERN," [...] painted not very conspicuously in the top-light of the door. Immediately on entering, we find ourselves among a confusion of old rubbish and valuables, ancient armor, historic portraits, ebony cabinets inlaid with pearl, tall, ghostly clocks, hideous old china, dim looking-glasses in frames of tarnished magnificence,--a thousand objects of strange aspect, and others that almost frighten you by their likeness in unlikeness to things now in use. It is impossible to give an idea of the variety of articles, so thickly strewn about that we can scarcely move without overthrowing some great curiosity with a crash, or sweeping away some small one hitched to our sleeves. Three stories of the entire house are crowded in like manner. The collection, even as we see it exposed to view, must have been got together at great cost; but the real treasures of the establishment lie in secret repositories, whence they {{are not likely to be}} drawn forth at an ordinary summons; though, if a gentleman with a competently long purse should call for them, I doubt not that the signet-ring of Joseph's friend Pharaoh, or the Duke of Alva's leading-staff, or the dagger that killed the Duke of Buckingham (all of which I have seen), or any other almost incredible thing, might make its appearance. Gold snuff-boxes, antique gems, jewelled goblets, Venetian wine-glasses (which burst when poison is poured into them, and therefore must not be used for modern wine-drinking), jasper-handled <b>knives,</b> <b>painted</b> Sevres teacups,--in short, there are all sorts of things that a virtuoso ransacks the world to discover.|$|R
