High-risk postpartum period is {{the period of time}} when <b>post-partum</b> women <b>care</b> for their babies in the neonatal ICU, and experience high stress levels. Methods: it is a qualitative study with narrative approach based on Florence Nightingale's theory, conducted at a public institution in southern Brazil, from January to March 2010. Seven mothers over 18 years with newborns admitted to the neonatal ICU were the research subjects. Results: the contextualization of their narratives, the caring environment in which they experienced this particular stage in their lives, indicates that high-risk puerperal women seek ties and support. Conclusions: the challenge of spending an indefinite period of time in a strange environment, away from home, with their babies under the care of health professionals, while apart from their relatives, highlights the need for nursing care during this stage...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that the receipt of {{adequate}} prenatal care is associated with improvements in pregnancy outcome, particularly a reduction in the risk of low birth weight. Since medical costs for these low birth weight infants are several times higher than for normal birth weight infants, one would expect that medical costs for newborns would be lower for babies whose mothers have had adequate prenatal care than for those with inadequate prenatal care. Explored in this paper is whether the reduction in Medicaid costs for newborn and <b>post-partum</b> maternal <b>care</b> is greater than the increase in prenatal costs for a Medicaid population. The analysis used a file of 12, 023 Missouri Medicaid records linked with the corresponding 1988 birth certificates. A modified version of the Kessner index was used to define the adequacy of prenatal care. Prenatal care costs were $ 233 higher for pregnancies with adequate prenatal care than for those in which prenatal care was inadequate. Newborn and post-partum costs starting within 60 days after the birth were $ 347 lower for the adequate prenatal care pregnancies, resulting in a savings of $ 1. 49 for each extra $ 1 spent on prenatal care. Among the other factors studied in determining this benefit to cost ratio were global billing, Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and participation in Medicaid under the expanded eligibility provisions that were effective in Missouri in 1988...|$|R
40|$|To explore {{traditional}} {{beliefs and}} practices, to assess puerperal morbidity, {{and to understand}} care-seeking behaviors, a qualitative and quantitative {{study was conducted in}} low socio-economic settlements of Karachi, Pakistan. Five focus group discussions and 15 in-depth interviews were conducted in July and August 2000. 525 Muslim women, who were 6 - 8 weeks post-partum, were then interviewed at home. Maternal care was relatively good [...] more than three-quarters of recent mothers sought antenatal care and more than half (267 / 525) delivered in a hospital or maternity home. Counseling to attend post-partum clinics among facility deliveries was 16 % (43 / 267), of which only 26 % (11 / 43) attended. Practices during the delivery and puerperium, such as massaging the vaginal walls with mustard oil during labor to facilitate delivery and inserting vaginal or rectal herbal pessaries to facilitate 'shrinkage of the uterus' and/or 'strengthening of the backbone', were pervasive. The core symptoms that are clinically significant during the puerperium are heavy vaginal bleeding and high fever, since they are potentially fatal symptoms if appropriate and timely care is not sought. About half of the study women (53. 3 %) reported at least one illness symptom, high fever (21. 1 %), heavy vaginal bleeding (13. 9 %), and foul smelling vaginal discharge (9. 6 %). Women did not know the underlying biologic cause of their perceived post-partum morbidity; weakness was frequently mentioned. Women sought care initially from close relatives or traditional healers and if they continued to suffer from their morbidity they finally approached a trained health care (allopathic) provider. The high prevalence of perceived post-partum morbidity illustrates the demand for <b>post-partum</b> community-based health <b>care</b> programs. We suggest promoting maternal health education that encourages women to seek appropriate and timely care by accessing public or private health services.

While Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) might play a role in <b>post-partum</b> <b>care,</b> research exploring their attitudes and practices during this period is scarce. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} explore TBAs’ practices and perceptions in <b>post-partum</b> <b>care</b> in rural Tanzania. Qualitative in-depth interview data were collected from eight untrained and three trained TBAs. Additionally, five multiparous women who were clients of untrained TBAs were also interviewed.

Our study found that TBAs take care of women during post-partum with rituals appreciated by women. They report lacking formal <b>post-partum</b> <b>care</b> training, which makes them ill-equipped to detect and handle post-partum complications. Despite their lack of preparation, they try to provide care for some post-partum complications which could put the health of the woman at risk. TBAs perceive that utilization of hospital-based post-partum services among women was only important for the baby and for managing complications which they cannot handle. They are poorly linked with the health system. This study found that the TBAs conducted close follow-ups and some of their practices were appreciated by women. However, the fact that they were trying to manage certain post-partum complications can put women at risk. These findings point out the need to enhance the communication between TBAs and the formal health system and to increase the quality of the TBA services, especially in terms of prompt referral, through provision of training, mentoring, monitoring and supervision of the TBA service...|$|E

With universal coverage of midwifery interventions for maternal and newborn health, excluding family planning, for the countries with the lowest HDI, 61 % of all maternal, fetal, and neonatal deaths could be prevented. Family planning alone could prevent 57 % of all deaths because of reduced fertility and fewer pregnancies. Midwifery with both family planning and interventions for maternal and newborn health could avert a total of 83 % of all maternal deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths.

Objective: To assess the effect of maternal receipt of financial assistance from JSY on childhood immunizations, <b>post-partum</b> <b>care,</b> breastfeeding practices, and care-seeking behaviors. Methods: We use data from the latest district-level household survey (2007 – 2008) to conduct a propensity score matching analysis with logistic regression. We conduct the analyses at the national level as well as separately across groups of states classified as high-focus and non-high-focus.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was used to look at 844 women who had given birth in {{the previous five years}} in Sodo town. The study employed a multistage-sampling scheme. Codes were given for all identified women in selected kebeles (neighbourhoods) and a simple random sampling technique was used after generating random numbers using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).

40|$|Purpose - Many {{public health}} systems have {{struggled}} with the dual questions of: why the uptake rate of maternal health (MH) services is low among some subpopulations; and how to raise it. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess the uptake rate of a new set of MH services in poor rural areas of China. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on the survey responses of women's representatives and village cadres from almost 1, 000 villages in June 2012 as part of a wide-scale public health survey in Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan provinces in the western part of China. Findings - The authors find that the uptake rate of MH services (including in-hospital delivery, antenatal care visits and <b>post-partum</b> <b>care</b> visits) in poor rural areas of Western China are far below average in China, and that the rates vary across provinces and ethnic groups. The analyses demonstrate that distance, income, ethnicity and availability appear to be systematically correlated with low uptake rates of all MH services.

Child’s visits to a health care provider, on the other hand, increased with greater numbers of chronic conditions, development of a new medical condition, and increased mothers’ visits to a doctor. Child’s utilization of pediatric health care services decreased with higher levels of maternal depression, greater numbers of total children in the household, if the mother had HMO/private health care coverage, if the mother was pregnant, and if the mother was Latina/African American. Mother’s use of health care services decreased with her age, increased number of child’s chronic conditions, income as a percent of the federal poverty line, and if child had HMO/private health care insurance. The study expands the econometric techniques available for assessing maternal and pediatric health care use and the results contribute to an understanding of how rural, low-income mothers choose the level of health care services use for themselves and for their child.

Optimising outcomes for this population is an important public health issue and requires the identification of modifiable determinants of risk and the provision of high quality clinical care. My thesis addresses the importance of a continuum of care before, during and after pregnancy for women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In this thesis, I firstly report pregnancy outcomes for a regional cohort of women with pregestational diabetes in the West of Ireland over a decade, and examine in detail the issues of gestational weight gain (GWG) and diabetic retinopathy. Employing a number of different methodological and statistical approaches, I outline the clinical and economic benefits of a regional approach to prepregnancy care for women with diabetes. Next, I describe a protocol for developing a core outcome set (COS) for studies evaluating prepregnancy care for women with pregestational diabetes, and report the study results and the final COS. Finally, I examine women at 12 months post-partum {{to assess the impact of}} pregnancy and prepregnancy care on longer-term treatment goals in women with diabetes.

40|$|Abstract Background In Tanzania, {{more than}} 90 % of all {{pregnant}} women attend antenatal care {{at least once}} and approximately 62 % four times or more, yet less than five in ten receive skilled delivery care at available health units. We conducted a qualitative study in Ngorongoro district, Northern Tanzania, {{in order to gain}} an understanding of the health systems and socio-cultural factors underlying this divergent pattern of high use of antenatal services and low use of skilled delivery care. Specifically, the study examined beliefs and behaviors related to antenatal, labor, delivery and postnatal care among the Maasai and Watemi ethnic groups. The perspectives of health care providers and traditional birth attendants on childbirth and the factors determining where women deliver were also investigated. Methods Twelve key informant interviews and fifteen focus group discussions were held with Maasai and Watemi women, traditional birth attendants, health care providers, and community members. Principles of the grounded theory approach were used to elicit and assess the various perspectives of each group of participants interviewed. Results The Maasai and Watemi women's preferences for a home birth and lack of planning for delivery are reinforced by the failure of health care providers to consistently communicate the importance of skilled delivery and immediate <b>post-partum</b> <b>care</b> for all women during routine antenatal visits. Husbands typically serve as gatekeepers of women's reproductive health in the two groups - including decisions about where they will deliver- yet they are rarely encouraged to attend antenatal sessions. While husbands are encouraged to participate in programs to prevent maternal-to-child transmission of HIV, messages about the importance of skilled delivery care for all women are not given emphasis. Conclusions Increasing coverage of skilled delivery care and achieving the full implementation of Tanzania's Focused Antenatal Care Package in Ngorongoro depends upon improved training and monitoring of health care providers, and greater family participation in antenatal care visits. </p...|$|E

This paper does this {{in the context of an}} inter-organizational network. In Nicaragua, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local NGOs formed the NicaSalud Federation. Using Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), 14 member organizations took baselines measures of maternal safe motherhood and child health behavior indicators during November 1999 and August 2000, respectively, and final evaluation measures in December 2001. In April 2002, retrospective interviews were conducted with supervisors and managers in the 14 organizations to explore changes made to community health strategies, factors associated with the changes, and impacts they attributed to participating in NicaSalud. Physical capital (density of health huts), human capital (density and variety of paramedical personnel) and social capital (density of health committees) were associated with pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) 3 + times, and/or retaining ANC cards. The variety of paramedic personnel was also associated with women making post-partum visits to clinics. Physical capital (density of health huts) and social capital (density of health committees and mothers' clubs) were associated with child diarrhea case management indicators. One safe motherhood indicator (delivery of babies by a clinician) was not associated with intervention strategies. At the management level, NicaSalud's training of members to use LQAS for M&E was associated with the number of strategic and tactical changes they subsequently made to interventions (organizational learning). Organizational learning was related to changes in maternal and child health behaviors of the women (including changes in the proportion using <b>post-partum</b> <b>care).</b> As the latter result would not have occurred without NicaSalud, we conclude that this inter-organizational network provided added value by instigating organizational learning.

Midwives’ knowledge of, experience of and attitudes towards pregnancy and childbirth in women with ID were evaluated with questionnaires (IV). Mothers with ID were more often teenagers, smoked more during pregnancy and had more Caesarean Sections. Their children had {{a higher proportion of}} pre-term births, were small-for-gestational-age, stillborn or died in the perinatal period. The women with ID struggled to attain motherhood and feared to lose custody of the child. The pregnancy was seen as a happy event, even though relatives did not always approve. Parent education was considered important, but not adequately adapted to their needs. The birth process was overwhelming and difficult to understand, but the child was welcomed with warm feelings, and breastfeeding was natural. Midwives stated it was different to care for women with ID and requested additional knowledge. The majority of midwives affirmed that women with ID could not manage the mother role satisfactorily, and one-third expressed that women with ID should refrain from having children. A majority of the midwives considered that the children should grow up with the parents with support from family and society, but one out of five stated that the children should grow up in foster care. Conclusion: Women with ID and their children should be considered as risk groups in pregnancy and childbirth. Professionals in maternity services need to elucidate their knowledge and skills for counselling and supporting this particular group of pregnant women in pre-, intra- and <b>post-partum</b> <b>care...</b>|$|E
40|$|In India, {{although}} {{the proportion of}} institutional births is increasing, there are concerns regarding quality of care. We assessed {{the effectiveness of a}} nurse-led onsite mentoring program in improving quality of care of institutional births in 24 / 7 primary health centres (PHCs that are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) of two high priority districts in Karnataka state, South India. Primary outcomes were improved facility readiness and provider preparedness in managing institutional births and associated complications during child birth. All functional 24 / 7 PHCs in the two districts were included in the study. We used a parallel, cluster randomized trial design in which 54 of 108 facilities received six onsite mentoring visits, along with an initial training update and specially designed case sheets for providers; the control arm received just the initial training update and the case sheets. Pre- and post-intervention surveys were administered in April- 2012 and August- 2013 using facility audits, provider interviews and case sheet audits. The provider interviews were administered to all staff nurses available at the PHCs and audits were done of all the filled case sheets during the month prior to data collection. In addition, a cost analysis of the intervention was undertaken. Between the surveys, we achieved coverage of 100 % of facilities and 91. 2 % of staff nurse interviews. Since the case sheets were newly designed, case-sheet audit data were available only from the end line survey for about 80. 2 % of all women in the intervention facilities and 57. 3 % in the control facilities. A higher number of facilities in the intervention arm had all appropriate drugs, equipment and supplies to deal with gestational hypertension (19 vs. 3, OR (odds ratio) 9. 2, 95 % C. I 2. 5 to 33. 6), postpartum haemorrhage (29 vs. 12, OR 3. 7, 95 % C. I 1. 6 to 8. 3); and obstructed labour (25 vs. 9, OR 3. 4, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 8. 3). The providers in the intervention arm had better knowledge of active management of the third stage of labour (82. 4 % vs. 35. 8 %, AOR (adjusted odds ratio) 10, 95 % C. I 5. 5 to 18. 2); management of maternal sepsis (73. 5 % vs. 10. 9 %, AOR 36. 1, 95 % C. I 13. 6 to 95. 9); neonatal resuscitation (48. 5 % vs. 11. 7 %, AOR 10. 7, 95 % C. I 4. 6 to 25. 0) and low birth weight newborn care (58. 1 % vs. 40. 9 %, AOR 2. 4, 95 % C. I 1. 2 to 4. 7). The case sheet audits revealed that providers in the intervention arm showed greater compliance with the protocols during labour monitoring (77. 3 % vs. 32. 1 %, AOR 25. 8, 95 % C. I 9. 6 to 69. 4); delivery and immediate <b>post-partum</b> <b>care</b> for mothers (78. 6 % vs. 31. 8 %, AOR 22. 1, 95 % C. I 8. 0 to 61. 4) and for newborns (73. 9 % vs. 32. 8 %, AOR 24. 1, 95 % C. I 8. 1 to 72. 0). The cost analysis showed that the intervention cost an additional $ 5. 60 overall per delivery. The mentoring program successfully improved provider preparedness and facility readiness to deal with institutional births and associated complications. It is feasible {{to improve the quality of}} institutional births at a large operational scale, without substantial incremental costs. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 02004912...|$|E
40|$|Background:While current {{research}} has demonstrated significant health and societal benefits of breastfeeding, the national breastfeeding rate remains below the Healthy People 2010 goal of 75 % initiation and 50 % continuation at 6 months (while 73. 8 % initiated, at 6 months only 41. 5 %, were breastfeeding and 11. 3 % were exclusively breastfeeding). A 1997 chart review of Family Health Center of Worcester (FHCW) patients also found low initiation and high attrition rates within the diverse, low-income population served by the FHCW; 56 % were breastfeeding at 4 days or less post-partum (42 % exclusively), while 42 % were still breastfeeding at 15 days post-partum (15 % exclusively). Previous {{studies have found that}} predictors of breastfeeding initiation and attrition include the woman’s knowledge about benefits of breastfeeding, messages received about breastfeeding, and availability of breastfeeding support. In order to improve breastfeeding rates at the FHCW, this study investigated postpartum women’s perceptions of how the FHCW counseled and supported them around breastfeeding. Objectives:This study lays the groundwork for identifying ways in which the Family Health Center of Worcester can improve breastfeeding initiation and duration among its patients. By directly interviewing postpartum women, the study seeks to determine what messages FHCW patients receive about breastfeeding, as well as to assess how the FHCW prepares pregnant and post-partum women for breastfeeding and supports those who choose to breastfeed. Methods:This cross-sectional analysis involved voluntary interviews of postpartum women who came to the FHCW for a previously scheduled appointment during a three-week period in March, 2008. Eligible patients had received all their prenatal and <b>post-partum</b> <b>care</b> through the FHCW and had delivered a live baby within the past 6 months. The surveys were administered, either immediately before or after the patients’ appointments, by a medical student investigator in English or Spanish. Questions addressed participants’ attitudes about breastfeeding, the messages and information they were given about breastfeeding, and their personal experiences with breastfeeding. The study was exempted by the UMass IRB and approved by the FHCW Board. Results: (Preliminary data) Of the fifty-one women who were interviewed, forty-nine were included in the data analysis. The mean age of women who participated in the survey was 25, 53 % were born outside the U. S., and 59 % identified themselves as Hispanic. Twenty-four of the women had more than one child, and 20 of these women had attempted to breastfeed a previous baby. ¾ of the women interviewed agreed with the statement “breast milk is the best food for babies” while 20 % agreed that “formula and breast milk together is the best…”. Women who thought that breast milk is best were the most likely to breastfeed. Fifty-nine percent of women (29 of 49) had made a feeding decision before the end of their first trimester. Women who made a feeding choice either before they got pregnant or in their first or second trimester were more likely to plan on breastfeeding than women who decided during their third trimester or after they left the hospital. Forty-two women (86 %) reported that when they left the hospital they had planned to mostly breastfeed, while 7 women (14 %) reported that they had planned to mostly formula feed. The most common reasons for choosing formula over breast milk included “I was sick or on medicine”, “I didn’t want to breastfeed in public”, “I went back to work or school”, and “I was worried breastfeeding would be painful”. Of the 42 women who planned to mostly breastfeed, 52 % (22 women) were still breastfeeding or pumping breast milk {{at the time of the}} interview. Of the women who had stopped, 4 (10 %) stopped within the first 2 weeks post-partum, 9 (21 %) had stopped by 4 weeks, and 14 (33 %) had stopped by 6 weeks. The most common reasons to stop included “I did not produce enough milk”, “Breast milk alone did not satisfy my baby”, “My baby had difficulty nursing”, “I had trouble breastfeeding”, and “My milk dried up”. When asked how well the FHCW prepared breastfeeding women for the challenges of breastfeeding, 66 % of women (27 of 40) rated the FHCW either “well” or “very well”. When asked about their experience in the hospital where their baby was born, 55 % of women (23 of 42) reported that staff had encouraged them to supplement their breast milk with formula. Upon discharge, greater than 90 % (38 of 42) felt confident that they would have the breastfeeding support that they needed. Women were asked whether they remembered anyone telling them particular facts about infant feeding. Fifteen women (33 %) remembered being told that “giving a baby formula can affect how much milk a breastfeeding woman makes”, 22 (50 %) remembered “some women have pain or get infections with breastfeeding”, and 18 (41 %) remembered “breastfeeding can reduce a woman’s risk of some cancers”. Discussion:The results of this study support that women are deciding whether or not to attempt breastfeeding very early in their pregnancies, and that those who decide earlier are more likely to breastfeed. Such early decisions highlight the importance of counseling women early in their pregnancies (or pre-conception) about the benefits of breastfeeding. The large number of women who stopped breastfeeding within the first 6 weeks post-partum is representative of trends nationwide. Such results support the need for improved interventions for breastfeeding women during the first few weeks post-partum. In particular, since many women stopped because of concerns about their milk supply or breastfeeding technique, these results suggest that breastfeeding women should receive more counseling around these specific issues. The data suggest that patients did not remember being told some of the benefits, challenges, and facts of breastfeeding. Since our study was based on participant recall, we cannot distinguish between providers not giving this information to pregnant women, the women not understanding this information, or women not recalling that they were ever told this information. Our study is limited by its small sample size and not knowing for how long the “still breastfeeding” women would continue to breastfeed. Conclusion:These results suggest that women who receive care through the FHCW are making decisions about whether or not to breastfeed early in their pregnancies, and that there is a significant breastfeeding attrition rate in the first few weeks post-partum. This study lays the groundwork for future studies that will help the FHCW identify ways to improve breastfeeding initiation and duration among its patient population...|$|E
