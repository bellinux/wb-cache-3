This <b>protection</b> <b>requirement</b> can also be designated as a negative private sphere and thus creates a heuristic tool, {{in order to be able}} to differentiate between voluntary participation and the need for protection; however, this leads to a dichotomy which should be resolved in the following section.|$|R

500|$|A bypass of Clackline {{was also}} constructed, {{realigning}} [...] of Great Eastern Highway [...] {{north of the}} town. Works began in January 2007, and were completed in February 2008. The project also involved constructing overtaking lanes between Clackline and Bakers Hill, upgrading intersections in Clackline, and constructing a pedestrian underpass for a heritage trail. Clackline Brook was realigned through a large box culvert, allowing a safer crossing than the narrow Clackline Bridge on the original alignment. The bypass was originally allocated $2.4million of funding in 2006, but by January 2007 it was expected to cost almost $11million. The final project value was $9.2million. Issues and challenges in the project's design and construction included extensive rock <b>protection</b> <b>requirements</b> for the Clackline Brook culvert, drilling and blasting close to the existing highway, and protecting heritage and environmentally sensitive areas. The Clackline community welcomed the bypass, but there were concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost. The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008.|$|E

This ensures that anonymised data will be actually useful to data users in their applications and sufficiently protected for data owners.

2500|$|Around {{the time}} Lockheed Martin withdrew its protest some {{potentially}} crucial data from JLTV testing was revealed. The 472–page annual {{report from the}} Pentagon's independent Director of Operational Test & Evaluation revealed that in testing Oshkosh's JLTV prototype lasted nearly six times longer between significant breakdown than the next closest, Lockheed Martin's prototype. The Oshkosh vehicle achieved 7,051 Mean Miles Between Operational Mission Failure (MMBOMF), Lockheed Martin's vehicle achieving 1,271 MMBOMF. AM General's vehicle achieved just 526 MMBOMF. The target for JLTV is 2400 MMBOMF, the current up-armored HMMWV achieving 2,968 MMBOMF. [...] Information on protection levels was also released. It was found in testing that both Oshkosh and Lockheed prototypes met all threshold force <b>protection</b> <b>requirements</b> and some objective-level requirements. This level of protection is better than that of up-armored HMMWVs, and similar to MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) All-Terrain Vehicles (M-ATV) without the underbody improvement kit across all spectrum of tested threats. AM General's prototype would need a significant redesign to meet threshold <b>protection</b> <b>requirements.</b> More details on vehicle protection were included in a classified report.|$|E
2500|$|The Dupont Plaza Hotel {{fire and}} other fires {{of the era}} gave rise to several {{amendments}} to security policies in hotels around the world. One {{of the biggest problems}} at the time was the lack of standard fire safety requirements. The hotel included an unsprinklered 17-story tower that housed 423 guest rooms. The fire alarm system in the tower was not working, and many guests were not aware of the fire until they saw or smelled it, heard someone shouting [...] "Fire", or heard firefighters responding.
