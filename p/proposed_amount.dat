The costs of both studies, totalling €1.3 million, were shared equally between the DB {{and the state of}} Baden-Württemberg. The additional costs have now been determined, depending on the option, to be €450-780 million. The Federal Ministry of Transport requested that the state of Baden-Württemberg meet half of these costs. The state rejected this demand.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{appreciated}} that {{our understanding of}} non-equilibrium phenomena has not kept pace with its equilibrium counterpart. In recent years, however, consideration of the above question, posed at the microscopic level of statistical mechanics, has yielded some intriguing theoretical results distinguished by two common features. First, they remain valid far from equilibrium, that is, even if the system is disturbed violently from its initial equilibrium state. Second, they incorporate information {{about the history of}} the system over some span of time: effectively, these are statistical predictions about what we would see if we could watch a movie of the system filmed at the atomic level, rather than predictions about individual snapshots. To date, this work has been theoretical, though supplemented with numerical simulations. However, in the current issue of PNAS, Hummer and Szabo [1] show how to combine these theoretical advances with single molecule manipulation experiments, so as to extract useful equilibrium information from non-equilibrium laboratory data. What these authors <b>propose</b> <b>amounts</b> to a novel method of deducing the equilibrium mechanical properties of individual molecules...|$|R

As he had with the other Frenchmen in the Order that he thought to be of some use to him, the General proposed Doublet accompany him to Egypt. Because of Doublet's age - he was almost 50 years old - and his family for which he was the only support, Doublet declined the proposal courteously but firmly. His refusal angered Napoleon, who did not appreciate anyone denying his will, but the future emperor confided to Junot, his aide-de-camp, that this man had good qualities because he had substance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{advocate}} {{the use of}} quadratic phase profiles in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {{with the aim of}} enhancing the achievable reconstruction quality from an incomplete k-space coverage for sparse or compressible signals, in the final perspective of accelerating the acquisition process relative to a standard complete coverage. The technique <b>proposed</b> <b>amounts</b> to the modulation of the image probed by a linear chirp. We analyze the related spread spectrum phenomenon {{in the context of the}} recent theory of compressed sensing, and we prove its effectiveness in enhancing the quality of image reconstruction, through a detailed analysis at each scale of a wavelet decomposition. We also establish the stability of this spread spectrum technique relative to noise, as well as its flexibility in terms of the chirp rate value required for optimal reconstruction. Our results rely both on theoretical considerations relative to the mutual coherence between the wavelet sparsity basis and the k-space sensing basis, as well as on extensive numerical simulations on the Shepp-Logan phantom.

40|$|The results {{presented}} in this article identify the role of costs in the scientific and grey freight terminal handling literature and analyses the handling costs of different terminal sizes. The literature review shows that handling costs only play a marginal role in the scientific research in intermodal rail freight terminals (IRT). This is remarkable given the large role costs occupy in decision-making in freight transport. Furthermore, the used cost levels show a wide range of <b>proposed</b> <b>amounts</b> and terminal sizes or handling technologies are seldom addressed. Finally, many of the scientific papers do not make it clear whether the average transhipment cost or market price is referred to. Next, the analysis of the investment in, and cost structure of, IRTs shows that IRT investments are very capital-intensive leading to relatively high average costs per handling. However, given the cost characteristics of IRTs, the average cost per handling represents the underlying cost structure and are – in this sense – representative. The cost analysis demonstrates that extra-large IRTs actually have the lowest average handling costs, followed by small IRTs. </p...|$|R

50|$|For {{implementing}} the Pooled Finance Development Scheme (PFDF), a state pooled finance entity (SPFE) needs to e established in every state. The SPFE {{could be a}} Trust, Special purpose entity, provided that the entity is just a pass through vehicle. The SPFE are expected to exhibit higher degrees of efficiency as compared to Urban local bodies since {{they will be able}} to generate goodwill in the bond markets and help the ULB to take advantage of scaled-up operations. With mutual co-operation, the SPFE will also hedge risks against the larger spectrum of activities of the Urban Local Bodies. The Central Government would be responsible for the funding of these State pooled finance entities through the PFDF. The Central Government makes funds available for the PFDF each year. 5 percent of this fund is utilized for project development assistance while, the remaining 95 percent would be utilized for the contribution to the Credit Rating Enhancement Fund (CREF) to improve the credit rating of the municipal bonds to investment grade. The cost of each project of the Municipality/ULBs will be estimated. 75 percent of these costs will be reimbursed by the Central Government and 25 percent by the state governments. The contribution by the Central Government will be one time in nature. It will comprise 10 percent of the <b>proposed</b> <b>amount</b> of bond issue or 50 percent of the CREF requirement as determined by a credit rating agency, whichever is less. In the event of default of the CREF, the Central Government will not be held responsible and the denouncement will be on the credit rating agency guaranteeing the ULB. At the maturity of the bonds issued, the share of the Center and state in the CREF will rest with the state entities for further leveraging of funds for infrastructure investment in Municipalities. The SPFE will be responsible for the management of accounts of the CREF and it shall not merge it with the accounts of other activities it undertakes. The funds in the CREF will be invested in bonds/notes of Government of India or bonds/accounts of other financial institutions rated by credit agencies as AAA(highest category). The bonds issued under the pooled finance scheme will have tax-free status under the Ministry's Guidelines for tax-free municipal bonds. However, the interest and dividend income earned from the CREF corpus will not be exempt from the levy of Income Tax. In order to provide exemption for the interest on bonds issued by the SPFE the Central Government by notification in the official gazette section 10(15)(vii) of the Income Tax Act has been suitably amended under Finance Act, 2007 enacted on 11 May 2007. Also, the State Pooled Financial Entity (SPFE) has been defined therein to mean such entity which is set up in the accordance with the guidelines of the Pooled Finance Development Scheme notified by the Central Government in the Ministry of Urban Development.|$|E
