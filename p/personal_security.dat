5|$|Kaspersky {{lives in}} Moscow, Russia {{with his wife}} and five children. He and his first wife were {{divorced}} in 1998. On 21 April 2011, his son, Ivan, then 20, was kidnapped for a $4.4 million ransom. Kaspersky worked with a friend at the FSB and Russian police to trace the ransomer's phone call. They set up a trap for the ransomers, where they rescued his son and arrested many of the kidnappers. The incident had an influence on Kaspersky's sense of <b>personal</b> <b>security.</b> He now travels with a bodyguard and security detail.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{rooms were}} {{positioned}} {{on the first}} floor of a range of buildings that ran around the outside of the ward, facing onto a courtyard. The four towers that protected the Inner Ward contained service facilities, with the Chapel Tower containing the private royal chapel. Each tower has an additional watchtower turret, probably intended both for security and to allow the prominent display of the royal flag. The arrangement was originally similar to that of the 13th century Gloriette at Corfe Castle, and provided a combination of privacy for the king while providing extensive <b>personal</b> <b>security.</b> The two sets of apartments were later unified into a single set of rooms, including a great chamber, outer chamber and inner chamber.|$|E

40|$|The Study Group on a European Civil Code has {{presented}} {{a set of}} rules on <b>personal</b> <b>securities.</b> <b>Personal</b> <b>securities</b> for commercial transactions {{play an important role in}} world trade today and inde-pendent securities such as on demand guarantees and stand by let-ters of credit have gained in importance during the last decades. The proposed rules are tested on court cases from Denmark and Sweden. When applied to real cases, the results are very similar to those reached by applying already existing rules on independent securities. If the court found the guarantee to be independent, the same result was reached by applying the rules of DCFR. The weaker part of the proposed rules is the effects of the clas-sifications. The novel approach in DCFR not to establish explicit rules on the right to reimbursement and subrogation to other secu-rities when the guarantee is independent, but rather to state that the rules on dependent <b>personal</b> <b>securities</b> should be applied with ap-propriate adaptations, is criticized as too vague...|$|R
5000|$|In turn, {{international}} development experts {{recognized in the}} mid-1990s that reform {{of the law of}} security interests was a major reason for the prosperity of both Canada and United States, in that it had enabled their businesses to finance growth through forms of secured lending which simply did not exist elsewhere.
