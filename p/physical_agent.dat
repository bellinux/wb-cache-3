6000|$|If it is {{replied that}} no physiologist, however spiritual his leanings, dreams of supposing that simple sensations require a [...] "spirit" [...] for their production, then I must {{point out that}} we are all agreed that {{consciousness}} is a function of matter, and that particular tenet must be given up as a mark of Materialism. Any further argument will turn upon the question, not whether consciousness {{is a function of the}} brain, but whether all forms of consciousness are so. Again, I hold it would be quite correct to say that material changes are the causes of psychical {227} phenomena (and, as a consequence, that the organs in which these changes take place have the production of such phenomena for their function), even if the spiritualistic hypothesis had any foundation. For nobody hesitates to say that an event A is the cause of an event Z, even if there are as many intermediate terms, known and unknown, in the chain of causation as there are letters between A and Z. The man who pulls the trigger of a loaded pistol placed close to another's head certainly is the cause of that other's death, though, in strictness, he [...] "causes" [...] nothing but the movement of the finger upon the trigger. And, in like manner, the molecular change which is brought about in a certain portion of the cerebral substance by the stimulation of a remote part of the body would be properly said to be the cause of the consequent feeling, whatever unknown terms were interposed between the <b>physical</b> <b>agent</b> and the actual psychical product. Therefore, unless Materialism has the monopoly of the right use of language, I see nothing materialistic in the phraseology which I have employed.|$|E

Notwithstanding {{that the}} effects appear only at the making and {{breaking}} of contact, (the current remaining unaffected, seemingly, in the interval,) I cannot resist the impression {{that there is some}} connected and correspondent effect produced by this lateral action of the elements of the electric stream during the time of its continuance (60. 242.). An action of this kind, in fact, is evident in the magnetic relations of the parts of the current. But admitting (as we may do for the moment) the magnetic forces to constitute the power which produces such striking and different results at the commencement and termination of a current, still {{there appears to be a}} link in the chain of effects, a wheel in the physical mechanism of the action, as yet unrecognised. If we endeavour to consider electricity and magnetism as the results of two forces of a <b>physical</b> <b>agent,</b> or a peculiar condition of matter, exerted in determinate directions perpendicular to each other, then, it appears to me, that we must consider these two states or forces as convertible into each other in a greater or smaller degree; i.e. that an element of an electric current has not a determinate electric force and a determinate magnetic force constantly existing in the same ratio, but that the two forces are, to a certain degree, convertible by a process or change of condition at present unknown to us. How else can a current of a given intensity and quantity be able, by its direct action, to sustain a state which, when allowed to react, (at the cessation of the original current,) shall produce a second current, having an intensity and quantity far greater than the generating one? This cannot result from a direct reaction of the electric force; and if it result from a change of electrical into magnetic force, and a reconversion back again, it will show that they differ in something more than mere direction, as regards that agent in the conducting wire which constitutes their immediate cause.|$|E
6000|$|If the {{doctrine}} of vortices had meant, not that vortices existed, [...] but only that the planets moved {{in the same manner}} as if they had [...] been whirled by vortices; if the hypothesis had been merely a mode [...] of representing the facts, not an attempt to account for them; if, [...] in short, it had been only a Description; it would, no doubt, have [...] been reconcilable with the Newtonian theory. The vortices, however, [...] were not a mere aid to conceiving the motions of the planets, but a [...] supposed <b>physical</b> <b>agent,</b> actively impelling them; a material fact, [...] which might be true or not true, but could not be both true and not [...] true. According to Descartes’s theory it was true, according to [...] Newton’s it was not true. Dr. Whewell probably means that since the [...] phrases, centripetal and projectile force, do not declare the nature [...] but only the direction of the forces, the Newtonian theory does not [...] absolutely contradict any hypothesis which may be framed respecting [...] the mode of their production. The Newtonian theory, regarded as a [...] mere description of the planetary motions, does not; but the [...] Newtonian theory as an explanation of them does. For in what does [...] the explanation consist? In ascribing those motions to a general law [...] which obtains between all particles of matter, and in identifying [...] this with the law by which bodies fall to the ground. If the planets [...] are kept in their orbits by a force which draws the particles [...] composing them toward every other particle of matter in the solar [...] system, they are not kept in those orbits by the impulsive force of [...] certain streams of matter which whirl them round. The one [...] explanation absolutely excludes the other. Either the planets are [...] not moved by vortices, or they do not move by a law common to all [...] matter. It is impossible that both opinions can be true. As well [...] might it be said that there is no contradiction between the [...] assertions, that a man died because somebody killed him, and that he [...] died a natural death.|$|E
