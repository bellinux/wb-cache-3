40|$|A {{new method}} of <b>pulsed</b> <b>powering</b> the {{magnetron}} discharge using a pulsed switching of the anode has been developed. Practically, this hybrid pulse mode {{is a combination}} of the conventional unipolar and bipolar <b>pulsed</b> <b>powering,</b> where the time slices of both pulse modes can be freely adjusted at a time scale smaller than 1 ms, i. e. much shorter than necessary for the deposition of one monolayer. This allows varying the average plasma parameters freely between the typical values of unipolar and bipolar pulse mode. During deposition of piezoelectric AlN, the film stress could be shifted in a wide range by changing the pulse mode ratio. In combination with the other known process parameters, it was possible to shift the film stress between compressive and tensile while maintaining piezoelectric properties. Hence, in addition to classical deposition parameters such as pressure or temperature, this new parameter gives an additional degree of freedom for optimization of film properties independent from sputtering power and deposition rate...|$|R

50|$|Both {{radio-frequency}} and direct-current glow discharges can {{be operated}} in pulsed mode, where {{the potential is}} turned on and off. This allows higher instantaneous powers to be applied without excessively heating the cathode. These higher instantaneous powers produce higher instantaneous signals, aiding detection. Combining time-resolved detection with <b>pulsed</b> <b>powering</b> results in additional benefits. In atomic emission, analyte atoms emit during different portions of the pulse than background atoms, allowing the two to be discriminated. Analogously, in mass spectrometry, sample and background ions are created at different times.|$|R
25|$|Sandia, with {{extensive}} experience in <b>pulsed</b> <b>power</b> delivery, designed the capacitor banks used to feed the flashlamps, completing the first unit in October 1998. To everyone's surprise, the <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Power</b> Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed {{that there was no}} way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing. Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Z <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Power</b> Facility, informally {{known as}} the Z machine, is the largest high {{frequency}} electromagnetic wave generator {{in the world and}} is designed to test materials in conditions of extreme temperature and pressure.

25|$|Lovell {{continued}} {{his work on}} the production antenna design using klystrons and wrapped up this work on 22 July. The team then began adapting the various bits of equipment to work together as a single radar unit based on the magnetron. J. R. Atkinson and W. E. Burcham, both sent to the AIS team from the Cavendish Laboratory at University of Cambridge, produced a <b>pulsed</b> <b>power</b> source, and Skinner and A. G. Ward, also from Cavendish, worked on a receiver. At the time the team had no solution to switching the antenna from transmit to receive, so they initially used two antennas side-by-side, one on the transmitter and one on the receiver. On 8 August they were experimenting with this setup when they received a signal from a nearby fishing hut. With the antenna still pointed in the same direction, they accidentally detected an aircraft which flew by the site at 6pm on 12 August. The next day, Dee, Watt and Rowe were on hand, but with no convenient aircraft available the team instead demonstrated the system by detecting the returns from a tin sheet being held by someone bicycling across a nearby cliff. With this demonstration of the radar's ability to reject ground returns and detect targets at basically zero altitude, interest in the 1.5m systems began to wane.|$|E
