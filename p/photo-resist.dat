A special proprietary resist has been developed by Molecular Imprints which holds the promise of being the material of choice to define the incredibly small feature sizes required in future generation electronic devices.

Magnetron sputtering involves ionizing a flowing gas, typically Ar, which is accelerated toward a target (Cr) with enough energy to eject target atoms through the background gas and onto the sample. The higher the background gas pressure, the more likely there will be collisions with the ejected target atoms, leading to a more anisotropic deposition, but at a reduced rate.

50|$|In {{preliminary}} research, one of {{the processes}} investigated for creating prototypes was ion beam proximity lithography. Ion beam proximity lithography uses stencil masks to produce patterns in ion-sensitive material (resist) which is transferred to magnetic material. The stencil mask contains a thin free standing silicon nitride membrane in which openings are formed. The pattern to be generated is first formed on a substrate that contains a <b>photo-resist</b> using electron beam lithography. Next the substrate is used to transfer the given pattern onto the nitride membrane (stencil mask) using the process of plasma etching. To create sufficient substrates is to maintain size uniformity of the openings which is transferred to the mask during the fabrication process (etching). Many factors contribute to the achievement and maintenance of size uniformity in the mask, such as: pressure, temperature, energy (amount of voltage), and power used when etching. To optimize the process of etching uniform patterns correctly under these parameters, the substrate {{can be used as}} a template to fabricate stencil masks of silicone nitride through the process of ion proximity beam lithography. The stencil mask can then be used as a prototype to create pattern media.|$|E
50|$|The MWNTs are {{synthesized}} by the arc-discharge technique, {{suspended in}} 1,2-dichlorobenzene and deposited on degenerately doped silicon substrates with a 1 µm of SiO2. The MWNT can be aligned according to pre-made markings on the substrate {{by using an}} atomic force microscope (AFM) or a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The rotor, electrodes and the 'in-plane' stators are patterned using electron beam lithography using an appropriately masked <b>photo-resist.</b> Gold with a chromium adhesion layer is thermally evaporated, lifted off in acetone and then annealed at 400 °C to ensure better electrical and mechanical contact with the MWNT. The rotor measures 250-500 nm on a side. An HF etch is then used to remove sufficient thickness (500 nm of SiO2) of the substrate {{to make room for}} the rotor when it rotates. The Si substrate serves as the gate stator. The MWNT at this point displays a very high torsional spring constant (10−15 to 10−13 N m with resonant frequencies in the tens of megahertz), hence, preventing large angular displacements. To overcome this, one or more outer MWNT shells are compromised or removed in the region between the anchors and the rotor plate. One simple way to accomplish this is by successively applying very large stator voltages (around 80 V DC) that cause mechanical fatigue and eventually shear the outer shells of the MWNT. An alternative method involves the reduction of the outermost MWNT tubes to smaller, wider concentric nanotubes beneath the rotor plate.|$|E

There are still several major issues such as the development of 157 nm <b>photo-resists</b> and pellicles, as well as calcium-fluoride lens material availability. The extension of the 193 nm lithography down to the 65 - and 45 -nm half pitch technologies is now considered as a serious alternative. This requires several technical challenges with the use of phase shift masks (PSM), optical proximity effects corrections or liquid immersion. Simulation gives information on expected process latitudes and is an important tool to help this technical choice. Previous works [1, 2] have shown that the "Diffused Aerial Image Model" (DAIM) [3] is accurate for CD prediction. Reliable process latitudes can be extracted from the simulated focus-exposure matrices (FEM). The model is used for the process latitudes evaluation of the different lithography approaches possibly used to print the 65 - and 45 -nm half pitches. 193 nm illumination in addition to PSM is compared to 157 nm lithography associated with conventional or optimized illumination schemes. This work shows that PSM at 193 nm gives generally better exposure latitude for all pitches and CD, and confirms that 193 nm lithography is a possible alternative to achieve 45 nm and 70 nm half pitches patterning.

40|$|The present PhD Thesis {{is about}} the {{development}} of new fabricative strategies to obtain microfluidic devices suitable for InfraRed MicroSpectroscopy (IRMS) studies on living cells in physiological environment and the demonstration of the screening and diagnostic capabilities of this technique for bio-medical applications. IRMS detects the vibrational pattern of molecules allowing the label-free characterization of the chemical profile of a biological specimen and its correlation with the sample morphology. Although powerful and versatile, this technique has been limited until recent years to the study of fixed or dried samples, in order to bypass the problem of water absorptions in the infrared spectral region. The use of microfabrication techniques for the production of Visible-Infrared (Vis-IR) transparent devices has recently opened an innovative approach, able to release some of the constrains encountered when dealing with living cells. Moreover, microfabrication is the best option to achieve long-range reproducibility of the optical path, which is mandatory for an accurate water subtraction in order to disclose cellular IR features. At first, we aimed to develop an IR-Vis transparent microfluidic chip with long-time stability in experimental conditions. The optical transparency was granted by the use of CaF 2 or BaF 2 as substrates, but their low surface energies imposed a challenge in order to establish reliable microfabrication protocols.

40|$|Photopolymerization, {{which uses}} light rather than heat to {{initiate}} polymerization, is a facile technique used to fabricate adhesives, protective coatings, thin films, <b>photo-resists,</b> dental restoratives, and other materials. Epoxide monomers, which are polymerized via cationic photoinitiation, have received less attention in fundamental research {{in comparison to}} free radical polymerized acrylate monomers. The characterization of propagation mechanisms, network structures, and physical properties is yet lacking. This project focused on the reactivity and physical properties of 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexylmethyl- 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexane carboxylate (EEC), and the kinetic and physical effects of chain transfer agents (CTAs) in EEC based formulations were characterized. This characterization was carried out using real-time Raman spectroscopy, real-time infrared spectroscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, simple gel fraction measurements, and atomic force microscopy. The effects of water, organic alcohols, processing conditions (e. g., UV light intensity, humidity, post-illumination curing temperature), and photoinitiation systems were investigated. In general, increasing the concentration of CTAs in a crosslinking epoxide resin increases the rate of polymerization and the overall epoxide conversion level. High CTA levels also correspond to lower glass transition temperatures (Tg) and lower crosslink densities. A post-illumination annealing was critical in obtaining stable physical properties for high Tg epoxide materials. In addition, humidity (water being the most universal contaminant type of CTA) was found to impact the surface properties of an epoxide polymer negatively by reducing the surface hardness. Hybrid acrylate-epoxide systems are much more complex and unpredictable in curing behavior. The use of hydroxy acrylates in hybrid systems allows for grafting between the epoxide and the acrylate domains, via the AM mechanism. Another intricacy of hybrid systems is the initiation system. In order to maximize the conversion of both the epoxide and the acrylate moieties, the free-radical photoinitiator must not hinder the polymerization of the epoxide monomer. Some very efficient free-radical photoinitiators limit the epoxide polymerization by absorbing {{the majority of the}} deep-UV incident photons. Finally, a renewable acrylate oligomer was synthesized to provide a green alternative to petroleum-based oligomers currently used. The oligomer was freely miscible and readily photopolymerized {{with a wide range of}} commercial monomers. The Tg relationship between the commercial monomers and the parent resin followed the Fox equation. The results of this research provide strategies for controlling epoxide kinetics and physical properties in neat and hybrid systems. This information is useful for tailoring resin formulations to specific end-use applications, especially in films, coatings, and adhesives. Hybrid epoxide-acrylate photopolymerization affords the unique opportunity to structure polymer networks in time and to engineer advanced material properties. These hybrid systems are based on formulations that contain both an epoxide moiety, which undergoes cationic ring-opening photopolymerization, and an acrylate moiety, which undergoes free-radical photopolymerization. Through the combination of these two independent reactive systems, hybrid polymers exhibit lower sensitivity to oxygen and moisture and offer advantages such as increased cure speed and improved film-forming properties. The ability to design the polymer network architecture and to tune mechanical properties can be realized through control of the cationic active center propagation reaction relative to the cationic chain transfer reaction. Specifically, grafted polymer networks can be developed through the covalent bonding of the epoxide chains to the acrylate chains via hydroxyl substituents. This work demonstrates the formation of these grafted polymer networks and overviews the physical properties obtained through control of hydroxyl content and hybrid formulation composition...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} thorough investigation of how mask roughness induces speckle in the aerial image that leads to line-edge roughness (LER) effects in extreme ultraviolet lithography. As next generation lithography techniques such as extreme-ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) push to ever smaller critical dimensions, achieving the stringent requirements for line-edge and -width roughness (LER/LWR) is increasingly challenging. For this reason, discovering the principle causes leading to LER demands immediate attention. Until recently, LER has been considered a resist-limited effect. Now, however, it is better understood that system-level effects can greatly influence LER. Thus, {{in order to achieve}} adequately low LER levels for next generation projection lithography, we must understand not only the basic material properties of the resist, but also how resist effects and mask effects can each contribute to the LER that is ultimately printed. Much research has already been conducted to fully characterize <b>photo-resists</b> available to next generation lithography methods. Other studies have documented how the LER on the mask couples to the printed LER. The issue of mask roughness induced LER is one that has up to this point been neglected by the industry and requires attention from the International Roadmap of Semiconductors (ITRS) in its specifications tables for the successful manufacture of transistor devices in future nodes by EUVL. Specifically, the extent to which system-level effects such as mask surface roughness, defocus, and illumination conditions are currently factoring into LER limits and how to distinguish mask effect from resist effect in practice. Potential levels for mask roughness induced LER contribution are presented for realistic mask surface roughnesses, providing a strong motivation for this work. To be precise, for the 22 nm half pitch nodes, the mask roughness induced LER can consume the entire LER budget for an ideal mask roughnesses at - 100 nm defocus. This thesis focuses on characterizing requirements on mask surface roughness specifications from an LER budget perspective in future nodes where EUVL will likely be employed, and devising simplified models based on 2 D thin mask modeling for mask roughness induced LER prediction. A 2 D height map of mask surface roughness itself is characterized by mainly two statistical parameters: the first being replicated surface roughness (RSR), which describes the height deviations of roughness on the top surface of the mask, and the second being the correlation length, which {{is a measure of the}} lateral surface roughness. The corresponding phase map is constructed by a simple transformation of OPD into phase space with an additional factor of 2 for EUVL reflective mode. The simplified model is then constructed using thin mask modeling of that clearfield rough mask to calculate the resulting speckle statistics, which are an intensity perturbation, and uses fast 1 D modeling of the image-log-slope (ILS) to map that intensity perturbation to line-edge movement (LER). This is then verified against fully simulated LER, also in the thin mask approximation. The power of this simplified model lies in the simple physicality of the formulation, elucidating the principle causes of mask roughness induced LER: poor speckle, and bad imaging quality (ILS). The formulation also provides a significant speed enhancement by removing modeling redundancy of multiple feature types on top of the same surface roughness characterizations: only one clearfield speckle simulation is needed for the speckle statistics, which can then be mapped to any feature size through the ILS, and be used by the simplified equation to predict the mask roughness induced LER. The second simplified model is based on a geometric argument of mask slope error, for special cases of mask surface roughness that are globally smooth. In this regime, the mask roughness induced LER collapses to a single value trend across all illumination partial coherence values- hence a geometric regime. Recognizing this fact, the further simplification employs the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system assuming full incoherence, convolved with the rough mask object, to give a simple image of the mask from the wafer plane. Taking the slope of that image and propagating through focus, the mask roughness induced LER contribution can be readily predicted for this geometric limit, and provides an even further speed enhancement to modeling by reducing the redundancy of illumination partial coherence type. Beyond developing simplified models, characterizations of problematic aberrations are made extensively for the 22 nm and 16 nm half-pitch nodes. This is firstly done through random distributions across the principle Zernike aberrations (Fringe Zernikes 5 - 16) to determine the overall acceptable level of aberrations in the system of 0. 25 nm rms from a mask roughness induced LER perspective. A complete aberration sensitivity matrix is then constructed to identify individual Zernikes that are problematic, specific to the node, source shape, and optical system. In addition, mask roughness induced LER mitigation strategies utilizing an alternative source shape called `strip' illumination, or, extended dipole, is explored. By using the physicality of the simplified model's equation, we recognize that by increasing incoherence by extending a traditional dipole laterally should help mitigate the speckle, while at the same time, confined coherence orthogonal to the lines and spaces should maintain good imaging quality through the ILS. Thus, overall, the simplified model would predict a reduction in mask roughness induced LER. We compare these results to other illumination candidates specifically for the 22 nm node and find that overall, the mask roughness induced LER does benefit minimally for about 0. 2 nm LER for 100 nm defocus conditions, but there lies a significant potential benefit in throughput in comparison to traditional dipole illuminations if one is employing limiting source shapes to manufacture the partial coherence. Lastly, this work studies potential mask roughness induced LER effects introduced by mask cleaning strategies employed for EUVL. We look at effects on lithographic performance of lines and spaces, LER, and contacts based on a repetitive cleaning process and monitor that performance through number of cleans. Overall, we find that the cleaning process does not introduce significant deterioration of the cleaned mask in comparison to a reference mask, up through a 33 × cleaning cycle. Since EUVL expects to employ cleans through 22 × over the typical lifetime of a mask, the 33 × good performance confirms the viability of the cleaning process within a safe margin...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{characterization}} of post etch residues after a metal etch process with Cl 2 /BCl 3 plasma etch gases. Plasma etching processes are important for the fabrication of integrated circuits because these processes have {{a great impact on}} the size {{and the quality of the}} semiconductors on the wafer. As the semiconductor industry con-tinues to scale down the dimensions of the structures, a more and more precise control of the line shape profile of the etched features is required. The post etch residues formed mainly, but not only, on the sidewalls of structures after the completed plasma etching are regarded as a reliability risk and, thus, have to be re-moved. The removal process can be run in many ways with different chemistries due to different characteristics of the post etch residues. One of the influence factors on the features of the post etch residues is the <b>photo-resist</b> removal process (DSQ). Depending on the DSQ process, the molecular structure of the residues will differ. The chemical characteristics and changes in the molecular structure of the post etch residues were investigated, also, the cause of different solubility in the hydroxylamine-based solutions was subjected to analyses. Following analytical methods were used to characterize the residues: EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometry), AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), XPS (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), ToF-SIMS (Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry), Raman-Spectroscopy and FT-IR-Spectroscopy. Different metallization systems and the two main <b>photo-resist</b> removal modes were used to find out about the relationship between the structures, concentration of the elements, cross-linking of the residues and the process flow in the metallization block. The application of AES and EDX methods allowed the characterization of the surface of the post etch residues; by using TEM, structural information was obtained and the mate-rial characterization carried out; and by applying XPS, data about the concentration as well as the chemical and oxidation states of elements was collected; and the ToF-SIMS method provided specific molecular information. The results of the analytical methods verified the known facts about post etch residues consisting of aluminum, hydrogen, chlorine, carbon, titanium and other elements used in metallization systems. The chemi-cal bonding of the elements was also investigated. Using FT-IR and Raman spectros-copy, organic and inorganic molecular groups of the <b>photo-resist</b> were characterized. The organic compounds of the post etch residues could be identified as the incompletely oxidized or decomposed <b>photo-resist</b> molecules. By applying the Raman spectroscopy, it became evident that, depending on the DSQ mode, the cross-linking of the carbon-containing molecules in the post etch residues changes. A big impact on this effect can be ascribed to water that may be used in the first step of the DSQ <b>photo-resist</b> removal process. In the case of its application the ten-dency towards stronger cross-linking during the DSQ-process could be observed already after the first step of the process. As to the possible mechanisms of the cross-linking, various suggestions have been made...|$|E

40|$|Large-sized {{gratings}} {{are essential}} optical elements in laser fusion and space astronomy facilities. Scanning beam interference lithography {{is an effective}} method to fabricate large-sized gratings. To minimize the nonlinear phase written into the <b>photo-resist,</b> the image grating must be measured to adjust {{the left and right}} beams to interfere at their waists. In this paper, we propose a new method to conduct wavefront metrology based on phase-stepping interferometry. Firstly, a transmission grating is used to combine the two beams to form an interferogram which is recorded by a charge coupled device(CCD). Phase steps are introduced by moving the grating with a linear stage monitored by a laser interferometer. A series of interferograms are recorded as the displacement is measured by the laser interferometer. Secondly, to eliminate the tilt and piston error during the phase stepping, the iterative least square phase shift method is implemented to obtain the wrapped phase. Thirdly, we use the discrete cosine transform least square method to unwrap the phase map. Experiment results indicate that the measured wavefront has a nonlinear phase around 0. 05 lambda@ 404. 7 nm. Finally, as the image grating is acquired, we simulate the print-error written into the <b>photo-resist...</b>|$|E
