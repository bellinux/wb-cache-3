25|$|Griffin {{scored a}} coup when Tonight Show host Jack Paar accidentally emerged onto {{the set of}} <b>Play</b> <b>Your</b> Hunch during a live broadcast, and Griffin got him {{to stay for a}} {{spontaneous}} interview. After Paar left The Tonight Show, but before Johnny Carson took over (Carson was still hosting Who Do You Trust? for ABC), Griffin was one of the many guest hosts who presided over Tonight in the interim. Griffin was considered the most successful of the guest hosts, and was rewarded with his own daytime talk show on NBC in 1962. This live, 55-minute program was not successful however, and was cancelled in 1963.|$|E
25|$|From 1958 to 1962, Griffin {{hosted a}} game show {{produced}} by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman called <b>Play</b> <b>Your</b> Hunch. The show appeared on all three networks, but primarily on NBC. He also hosted a prime time game show for ABC called Keep Talking. Additionally, he substituted for {{a week for the}} vacationing Bill Cullen on The Price Is Right, and also for Bud Collyer on To Tell the Truth. In 1963, NBC offered him the opportunity to host a new game show, Word for Word, which Griffin produced. He also produced Let's Play Post Office for NBC in 1965; Reach for the Stars for NBC in 1967; and One in a Million for ABC in 1967.|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, Virgin/EMI label {{executives}} asked European {{radio stations}} to remove [...] "Who's That Chick?" [...] from their playlists because Rihanna had multiple {{songs on the}} chart. Due to how Rihanna's Loud was released {{at the same time}} as Guetta's album, label executives asked radio stations to favor her work instead. In an interview for the Daily Star, Guetta addressed the song being removed from European radio stations playlists, saying [...] "My record label sent letters to all the radio stations asking them to stop playing Who's That Chick as Rihanna's album was out at the same time. It was strange because normally record labels ask radio stations to <b>play</b> <b>your</b> music." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith told Matthews [...] "there are no {{shackles}} here... express yourself... <b>play</b> <b>your</b> {{own game}} and {{whatever you do}} on the pitch, {{do it in the}} knowledge that you have my full support." [...] He assembled a talented frontline in Matthews, Stan Mortensen, Jimmy McIntosh, and Alex Munro; with an emphasis on entertaining football. The Seasiders finished in ninth place and reached the 1948 FA Cup Final. On 23 April 1948, the eve of the final, Matthews won the inaugural Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award. Despite taking the lead twice in the match, Blackpool lost out 4–2 to Matt Busby's Manchester United in the final, with Matthews assisting Mortensen for Blackpool's second.|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{selection}} process, early contributor Chris Vrenna told Gannett News [...] "coming {{from the same}} emotional background, I feel, {{is more important than}} how well you can <b>play</b> <b>your</b> instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger". [...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So I took some young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it. [...] The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' [...] " ...|$|E

500|$|Particularly {{for smaller}} indie developers, {{the nature of}} the procedural-generated world allows teams to deliver many hours worth of game content without having to spend {{resources}} and development time on fleshing out detailed worlds. This also allows developers to devote more time in building out complex gameplay features and their interacting systems {{that are part of the}} enjoyment of roguelike and roguelike-like games. McMillen of The Binding of Isaac stated that incorporating roguelike elements into other game genres can be difficult due to overcoming the complex interfaces roguelikes tend to have, but once a means to do so is found, [...] "it becomes an increasingly beautiful, deep, and everlasting design that allows you to generate a seemingly dynamic experience for players, so that each time they <b>play</b> <b>your</b> game they're getting a totally new adventure".|$|E
500|$|Two days later, Stevens' Bulldogs met second-seeded Kansas State in the {{regional}} finals. Perhaps feeling the effects of their double overtime 101–96 win two days prior, Kansas State {{got off to a}} slow start, scoring just 20 points in the first half to trail 27–20. Butler kept the lead in the upper single digits for most of the second half, before Kansas State went on a 13–2 run and took a 52–51 lead. Stevens immediately called time out and re-focused the team. [...] "Play your game. Just <b>play</b> <b>your</b> game," [...] he told them. On the ensuing possession, Butler regained the lead for good. They outscored Kansas State 12–4 {{the rest of the way}} and won the game 63–56. In the post game celebration, Stevens and walk-on forward Emerson Kampen connected on a flying back-bump that became one of the iconic images of the tournament.|$|E
500|$|Halifax {{started off}} Game 5 {{at home on}} a low note, with Liam McMorrow {{committing}} four personal fouls {{in the first three}} minutes. Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple of us can play like that, myself included, and we came out tonight and I told them 'hey, let me take the hits, I'm used to that. You guys <b>play</b> <b>your</b> normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E

500|$|Colts {{head coach}} Weeb Ewbank cited {{injuries}} to fullback Alan Ameche {{as the key}} reason for the team's inability to win a third straight NFL championship. Ewbank hoped Perry could fill in the role if Ameche was not ready when the season began. Ameche retired prior to the season, and Perry filled in to lead the Colts in rushing in 1961, while catching a career-high 34 passes for 322 yards. [...] "Joe {{was the kind of}} guy you'd love to <b>play</b> <b>your</b> whole career with," [...] said Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. [...] "He was older when we got him, but he did well for us. He was amazing on the screen pass, like McElhenny. And Joe clawed and scratched for every yard." [...] A thigh ligament injury caused him to miss several games in 1962 which, along with an injury to halfback Lenny Moore, severely hampered the Colts' running game. He was traded back to San Francisco in 1963, where he played a diminished role in his final nine games before retiring at age 36.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} Radiohead met while {{attending}} Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and bassist Colin Greenwood {{were in the}} same year, guitarist Ed O'Brien and drummer Phil Selway the year above, and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, brother of Colin, two years below. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to the band's usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became the lead guitarist; he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician Nigel Powell and Yorke's brother Andy Yorke. According to Colin, the band members picked their respective instruments because they wanted to play music together, rather than through an interest in the particular instrument: [...] "It was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else <b>play</b> <b>your</b> instrument, then that was really cool." [...] At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an {{extended}} period of touring. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with influences Pennywise, NOFX, and Social Distortion. [...] "The Warped Tour is really more of a traveling-band barbecue," [...] commented DeLonge. [...] "You hang out with the other bands all day, you <b>play</b> <b>your</b> set, and then hang out again." [...] In late 1997 and early 1998, the band would be on the road for nine months straight, only coming home to San Diego {{for days at a time}} before striking out on the next tour. [...] "When we did our longest tour stretch, it was right when I started dating my fiancee," [...] recalled DeLonge. [...] "We were all new and in love, and I had to leave. It was just, 'Hey, I'll see you in nine months.' It was really hard." [...] In addition to the hefty touring schedule, the trio grew tired of other commitments, including interviews and TV appearances due to the success of [...] "Dammit".|$|E

500|$|Although {{for much}} of his career he made his living as a church organist, Fauré greatly {{preferred}} the piano. He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, [...] "In piano music there's no room for padding – one has to pay cash and make it consistently interesting. It's perhaps the most difficult genre of all." [...] Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Fauré said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as [...] "Piano piece No X". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity; he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, [...] "the greater they are, the worse they play me." [...] Even a virtuoso such as Franz Liszt said that he found Fauré's music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Fauré, [...] "I've run out of fingers". [...] Fauré's years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using arpeggiated figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists. This tendency may have been even stronger because Fauré was ambidextrous, and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns wrote to him in 1917, [...] "Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very much like to know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to <b>play</b> <b>your</b> music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to {{get to the end of}} it by dint of absolute determination." ...|$|E

2500|$|Budgie {{was hailed}} in 2013 by peer Stewart Copeland of the Police {{as one of}} the 16 most {{interesting}} drummers. Copeland described Budgie's playing as [...] "very economical and offbeat", adding, [...] "Budgie didn’t <b>play</b> <b>your</b> standard hi-hat–kick–snare; {{there were a lot of}} tom-toms and a big throb." [...] Ari Up of the Slits praised him as [...] "a very sensitive drummer", saying, [...] "He could go from reggae to punk to funk to jazz [...] but still very steady." [...] NME named Budgie the best drummer of 1983.|$|E
2500|$|According to Greenwood, {{he began}} playing bass out of necessity, {{teaching}} himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. He said: [...] "We {{were people who}} picked up their respective instruments {{because we wanted to}} play music together, rather than just because we wanted to play that particular instrument. So {{it was more of a}} collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else <b>play</b> <b>your</b> instrument, then that was really cool. I don’t think of myself as a bass player anyway. I’m just in a band with other people." [...] Among his musical influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield.|$|E
