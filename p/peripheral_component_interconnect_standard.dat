40|$|Abstract—The growing {{interest}} in pulse-mode processing by neural networks is encouraging the development of hardware implementations of massively parallel networks of integrate-and-fire neurons distributed over multiple chips. Address-event representation (AER) has long been considered a convenient transmission protocol for spike based neuromorphic devices. One missing, long-needed feature of AER-based systems {{is the ability to}} acquire data from complex neuromorphic systems and to stimulate them using suitable data. We have implemented a general-purpose solution {{in the form of a}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>component</b> <b>interconnect</b> (PCI) board (the PCI-AER board) supported by software. We describe the main characteristics of the PCI-AER board, and of the related supporting software. To show the functionality of the PCI-AER infrastructure we demonstrate a reconfigurable multichip neuromorphic system for feature selectivity which models orientation tuning properties of cortical neurons.

50|$|PCI-X, {{short for}} <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> eXtended, is a {{computer}} bus and expansion card standard that enhances the 32-bit PCI local bus for higher bandwidth demanded mostly by servers and workstations. It uses a modified protocol to support higher clock speeds (up to 133 MHz), but is otherwise similar in electrical implementation. PCI-X 2.0 added speeds up to 533 MHz, with a reduction in electrical signal levels.|$|R
50|$|Front-side buses usually {{connect the}} CPU {{and the rest}} of the {{hardware}} via a chipset, which Intel implemented as a northbridge and a southbridge. Other buses like the <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> (PCI), Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), and memory buses all connect to the chipset in order for data to flow between the connected devices. These secondary system buses usually run at speeds derived from the front-side bus clock, but are not necessarily synchronized to it.|$|R

5000|$|The {{computer}} {{consists of}} 32 nodes, {{each of which}} contains a GRAPE-6A board ("mini-GRAPE") in a <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> (PCI) slot. The GRAPE boards use pipelines to compute pairwise forces between particles at a speed of 130 Gflops.

50|$|The GPUs of {{the most}} {{powerful}} class typically interface with the motherboard by means of an expansion slot such as PCI Express (PCIe) or Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and can usually be replaced or upgraded with relative ease, assuming the motherboard is capable of supporting the upgrade. A few graphics cards still use <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> (PCI) slots, but their bandwidth is so limited that they are generally used only when a PCIe or AGP slot is not available.|$|R

50|$|PCI Express (<b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> Express), officially {{abbreviated}} as PCIe or PCI-e, is {{a high-speed}} serial computer expansion bus standard, designed {{to replace the}} older PCI, PCI-X, and AGP bus standards. PCIe has numerous improvements over the older standards, including higher maximum system bus throughput, lower I/O pin count and smaller physical footprint, better performance scaling for bus devices, a more detailed error detection and reporting mechanism (Advanced Error Reporting, AER), and native hot-plug functionality. More recent revisions of the PCIe standard provide hardware support for I/O virtualization.|$|R
25|$|Conventional PCI, often {{shortened}} to PCI, is a {{local computer}} bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer.

The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor's native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space. It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock.|$|R

In a plug and play system, a device manager first performs a scan on different hardware buses, such as <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> (PCI) or Universal Serial Bus (USB), to detect installed devices, then searches for the appropriate drivers.|$|R
30|$|Several bus {{specifications}} like Industry <b>Standard</b> Architecture or <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> (PCI) {{have been}} implemented to support the communications between the CPU and the peripherals. Today, the PCI Express bus is used in most personal computers and servers. There are three main types of PCI Express devices. The root of the bus hierarchy, called the root complex, {{is connected to the}} CPU, thanks to the host bridge and to the first-level PCI Express children devices. These devices can be endpoints (so-called peripherals in the paper) and bridges. A bridge connects two different logical bus domains with an upstream and a downstream port.|$|R

50|$|SBus is a {{computer}} bus system {{that was used in}} most SPARC-based computers (including all SPARCstations) from Sun Microsystems and others during the 1990s. It was introduced by Sun in 1989 to be a high-speed bus counterpart to their high-speed SPARC processors, replacing the earlier (and by this time, outdated) VMEbus used in their Motorola 68020- and 68030-based systems and early SPARC boxes. When Sun moved to open the SPARC definition in the early 1990s, SBus was likewise standardized and became IEEE-1496. In 1997 Sun started to migrate away from SBus to the <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> (PCI) bus, and today SBus is no longer used.|$|R
50|$|These {{concepts}} are demonstrated in Lauron's products, one of {{such is the}} LT-PCI-CF. This PCI (<b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect)</b> adapter uses a RAID bridge IC which is the host bus adapter. The RAID interface can be configured as a 4 port data path. Doing such improves performance since data is transferred on all 4 ports simultaneously. It also offers the improved endurance ratings as less write cycles are needed {{for the same amount}} of data written to the device. CompactFlash is used for the media, which is consistently less expensive than SSD modules. CompactFlash endurance specifications range, but industrial versions offers the endurance of 2,000,000 write cycles.|$|R
