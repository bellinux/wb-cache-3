5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also <b>prominent,</b> <b>and</b> literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is <b>prominent</b> <b>and</b> has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|Isaac D'Israeli {{had never}} taken {{religion}} very seriously, but had remained a conforming member of the Bevis Marks Synagogue. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a <b>prominent</b> <b>and</b> devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave when he fell out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute. Isaac's friend Sharon Turner, a solicitor, convinced him that although he could comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the children if they did so. Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.|$|E
