5|$|The {{physician}} André du Laurens (1558–1609) {{claimed that}} Clovis I (r. 481–511) {{was the first}} king who touched for scrofula, but the medievalist Marc Bloch (1886–1944) {{argued that it was}} probably Philip I. Modern scholars, most notably Frank Barlow (1911–2009), agree that the French practice most likely originated from Saint Louis IX (r. 1226–1270). The earliest direct evidence of the royal touch in England are the financial records dating from the reign of Edward I (r. 1272–1307). The crusading Edward I did not arrive in England until 1274 but the custom of giving one penny to each <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> become well established by 1276, suggesting that the practice dated at least from the reign of his father, Henry III (r. 1216–1272). Henry III, known for insisting on his arbitrary decisions, loved public displays and was as pious as his beloved brother-in-law, Saint Louis IX, all of which makes it likely that he introduced the practice in England.|$|E

25|$|During its {{development}} for fibromyalgia, milnacipran was evaluated utilizing a composite responder approach. To {{be considered as}} a responder for the composite ‘treatment of ﬁbromyalgia’ endpoint, each <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> to show concurrent and clinically meaningful improvements in pain, physical function and global impression of disease status. A systematic review in 2015 showed moderate relief for a minority of people with fibromyalgia. Milnacipran was associated with increased adverse events and discontinuing use of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Webster was {{a central}} figure in the Terri Schiavo case which {{involved}} a dispute between relatives on whether to remove the feeding tube of an unconscious {{woman who had been}} in a persistent vegetative state for years. In March 2005, he introduced SB 804 that would have prohibited such patients from being denied food and water if family members disagreed on the patient's wishes and if the <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> not expressed his wishes in writing when competent. The bill failed to pass the Senate by three votes.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam {{interacts with}} the {{antibiotic}} erythromycin which is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, which affects concentration peak time. This interaction is not believed to be clinically important. However, anxiety, tremor, and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin to the patient, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> acute pneumonia and renal failure. Coadministration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other significant physical complications.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the concomitant systemic diseases with postmenopausal osteoporosis and {{to investigate the}} points {{to be considered in}} treatment approach of patients with osteoporosis. Materials and Methods: The study included 110 female patients admitted to our clinic and followed up after postmenopausal osteoporosis diagnosis. Besides the demographic data; the concomitant diseases of the patients such as hypertension, hypo-hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease, malignancy, osteoarthritis, gastrointestinal system diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - asthma and depression were also recorded. Results: The mean age of the patients included in our study was 65. 9 ± 9. 8 years. When the concomitant systemic diseases were examined; 40 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> hypertension, 32 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> osteoarthritis, 24 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> gastrointestinal tract problems, 22 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> thyroid disease, 21 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> depression, 15 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> hyperlipidemia, 12 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> diabetes mellitus, 10 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> COPD - asthma, 7 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> cardiac diseases, 5 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> malignancy and 2 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> Alzheimer disease. Conclusion: Osteoporosis is a common disease in the geriatric population. As a chronic disease with an increasing incidence with aging; it can cause many health problems, prevalently pathological bone fractures, in our country and all over the world. Constitutively, prophylaxis of osteoporosis should be the first step. Because systemic diseases with increasing incidence with aging may affect the severity of osteoporosis and impair the treatment; it is important for both clinicians and the society to have sufficient information about osteoporosis...|$|R
30|$|Eleven <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> two {{metacarpal}} fractures.

25|$|On 29 April 1952, Straffen {{went with}} an {{attendant}} and another patient to clean some outbuildings that {{were close to}} the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his duster and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.|$|E
25|$|Psychosurgery and the {{surgical}} implantation of hormones to reduce male sexual drive {{were classified as}} irreversible treatments {{that could only be}} carried out on consenting patients (section 57 of part IV of the Act); ECT was classified as a slightly less serious treatment that could be given to non-consenting patients if certain procedures were followed (section 58). The <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> to be detained (if they were not already detained), then a psychiatrist from the Mental Health Act Commission had to authorise treatment. If the treating psychiatrist decided there was an urgent need for ECT it could go ahead without authorisation from a Mental Health Act Commission psychiatrist (section 62).|$|E
25|$|The next morning, at 8.30, Adams {{called the}} coroner {{to make an}} {{appointment}} for a private post-mortem. The coroner asked when the <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> died and Adams said she had not yet. Harris visited again that day and Adams still made no mention of potential barbiturate poisoning. When Harris had left, Adams gave a single injection of 10cc of the Megimide. Hullett developed broncho-pneumonia and on the 23rd at 6.00 a.m. Adams gave Hullett oxygen. She died at 7.23 a.m. on 23 July. The results of a urine sample taken on 21 July were received after Hullett's death, on the 24th. It showed she had 115grains of sodium barbitone in her body – twice the fatal dose.|$|E

25|$|Working through {{abandonment}} {{depression is}} a complicated, lengthy and conflicted {{process that can}} be an enormously painful experience {{in terms of what}} is remembered and what must be felt. It involves mourning and grieving for the loss of the illusion that the <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> adequate support for the emergence of the real self. There is also a mourning for the loss of an identity, the false self, which the person constructed and with which he or she has negotiated much of his or her life. The dismantling of the false self requires relinquishing the only way that the patient has ever known of how to interact with others. This interaction was better than not to have a stable, organized experience of the self, no matter how false, defensive, or destructive that identity may be.|$|E
25|$|Patient A {{suffers from}} schizophrenia. Their {{treatment}} included {{a combination of}} ziprasidone, olanzapine, trazodone and benzotropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transition to quetiapine. Trazodone was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduction into their treatment due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, cogwheeling, tremor and night sweats. When benztropine was added they experienced blurry vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain, sedation, developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, cogwheel and dyskinetic ocular movements. A pharmacogenomics test later proved the <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> a CYP2D6 *1/*41, with has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with predicted phenotype of IM as well.|$|E
25|$|The Renaissance saw {{significant}} {{advances in}} anatomy and surgery, and surgeons became increasingly open to surgery on the trachea. Despite this, {{the mortality rate}} failed to improve. From 1500 through 1832 there are only 28 known descriptions of successful tracheotomy in the literature. The first detailed descriptions on tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently. Vesalius wrote that the technique could be life-saving. Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara treated a patient suffering from peritonsillar abscess by tracheotomy after the <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> been refused by barber surgeons. The patient apparently made a complete recovery and Brassavola published his account in 1546. This operation {{has been identified as}} the first recorded successful tracheostomy, despite many ancient references to the trachea and possibly to its opening.|$|E
