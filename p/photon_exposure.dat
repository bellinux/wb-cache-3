40|$|Photoinactivation of Photosystem II (PS II), the light-induced loss {{of ability}} to evolve oxygen, inevitably occurs under any light {{environment}} in nature, counteracted by repair. Under certain conditions, the extent of photoinactivation of PS II depends on the <b>photon</b> <b>exposure</b> (light dosage, x), rather than the irradiance or duration of illumination per se, thus obeying the law of reciprocity of irradiance and duration of illumination, namely, that equal <b>photon</b> <b>exposure</b> produces an equal effect. If the probability of photoinactivation (p) of PS II is directly proportional to an increment in <b>photon</b> <b>exposure</b> (p = kDeltax, where k is the probability per unit <b>photon</b> <b>exposure),</b> it can be deduced {{that the number of}} active PS II complexes decreases exponentially as a function of photon exposure: N = Noexp(-kx). Further, since a <b>photon</b> <b>exposure</b> is usually achieved by varying the illumination time (t) at constant irradiance (I), N = Noexp(-kI t), i. e., N decreases exponentially with time, with a rate coefficient of photoinactivation kI, where the product kI is obviously directly proportional to I. Given that N = Noexp(-kx), the quantum yield of photoinactivation of PS II can be defined as -dN/dx = kN, which varies with the number of active PS II complexes remaining. Typically, the quantum yield of photoinactivation of PS II is ca. 0. 1 micromol PS II per mol photons at low <b>photon</b> <b>exposure</b> when repair is inhibited. That is, when about 10 (7) photons have been received by leaf tissue, one PS II complex is inactivated. Some species such as grapevine have a much lower quantum yield of photoinactivation of PS II, even at a chilling temperature. Examination of the longer-term time course of photoinactivation of PS II in capsicum leaves reveals that the decrease in N deviates from a single-exponential decay when the majority of the PS II complexes are inactivated in the absence of repair. This {{can be attributed to the}} formation of strong quenchers in severely-photoinactivated PS II complexes, able to dissipate excitation energy efficiently and to protect the remaining active neighbours against damage by light...|$|E

30|$|The photon {{absorption}} potential coefficient (PAPC) is the tool we have proposed to better represent the instantaneous {{status of the}} atom, while interacting with its environment, as regards its ability to absorb energy. Since the ionization energies {{are based on the}} non-interacting atomic energy levels, they are a subset of the actual (effective) energy an atom is interacting with [1, 2]. For instance, according to the ionization energy principles, two hydrogen atoms are the same even if one is in a supercooled environment and the other in a plasma. Anyway, since the hydrogen energy level system is less complicated, one may agree but this is not always the case with heavier atoms. In the work of Giovanni et al. [3], there is a form of chemical reaction that takes place when some polymers are exposed to KeV energies. It was also reported that there are interface and interdiffusion effects in systems, such as Co/Si, MgO, and TiO_ 2 when exposed to photon beams [4, 5]. Brumer and Shapiro [6] studied and reported the relatively small response of biological molecules to {{photon absorption}}. The literatures reviewed confirm the existence of some unique responses of molecules to photon absorption but did not associate their findings to the ionization patterns of the molecules studied. They were only interested in their responses to those <b>photon</b> <b>exposure.</b> On the contrary, our focus is to study (theoretically) the distribution, sharing and response of atoms, within a molecule, to <b>photon</b> <b>exposure.</b> The response of atoms to photon absorption will, therefore, be a function of order of ionizations within the molecule. The molecule is a mixture of competing ionizations, and the order of ionization, within the molecule, is of interest leading the way to understanding the nature of responses different molecules exhibit when exposed to photon.|$|E

Agardh] {{from the}} west coast of Ireland has a {{heteromorphic}} life history in culture. Tetrasporangia are formed on uniseriate, filamentous tetrasporophytes, mainly under short-day conditions, at (7 -) 9 - 17 -degrees-C. Although photoperiodic induction occurs, night-breaks of 1 h {{in the middle of a}} 16 -h night are ineffective in suppressing this response. Tetraspores form further uniseriate filaments which produce multiaxial gametophytic thalli, mainly under long-day conditions at (7 -) 9 - 17 -degrees-C. The critical daylength is not constant over this temperature range. Night-breaks promote the initiation of multiaxial thalli, and nine photoinductive long-day cycles induce a 50 % response.

These experiments focus on the relative biological effectivness(RBE) determination and are predominantly applied in high linear energy transfer (LET) radiations i. e. fast neutrons, as the RBE values for such radiations vary greatly.

The existence of such a relationship allows inferences about transport history to be made from observations of chemical tracers. This paper lays down the conceptual foundations for the relationship between age and tracer amount for long-lived tracers, developed within a Lagrangian framework. Although the photochemical oss depends not only on the age of the parcel but also on its path, we show that under the "average path approximation " that the path variations are less important than parcel age. The average path approximation then allows us to develop a formal relationship between the age spectrum and the tracer distribution. Using this relationship, tracer-tracer correlations can be interpreted as the result of mixing which connects parts of the "single-path photochemistry curve, " a universal path-independent curve that describes the photochemical oss in terms of the total <b>photon</b> <b>exposure.</b> This geometric interpretation of mixing gives rise to constraints on trace gas correlation curves {{as can be seen in}} the atmospheric trace molecule spectroscopy observations. 1...|$|E

However, Tradescantia albiflora, a facultative shade plant, is unable to modulate its light-harvesting components and has the same Chi a/Chl b ratios and number of functional PS II and PS I reaction centres on a Chi basis at all growth irradiances. With increasing growth irradiance, Tradescantia leaves have the same relative amount of chlorophyll-proteins of PS II and PS I, but increased xanthophyll cycle components and more zeaxanthin formation under high light. Despite high-light leaves having enhanced xanthophyll cycle content, all Tradescantia leaves acclimated to varying growth irradiances have similar non-photochemical quenching.

Under the unusual circumstances in light-acclimated Tradescantia where the numbers of functional PS II and PS I reaction centres and their antenna size are unaltered during growth under different irradiances, the extents of PS II photoinactivation by high irradiances are comparable.

In this regard, two HNSCC cell lines were irradiated with photons or 72 MeV/n carbon ions at a dose rate of 0. 5, 2 or 10 Gy/min. For both radiosensitive and radioresistant cells, the change in dose rate significantly affected cell survival in response to <b>photon</b> <b>exposure,</b> this variation of radiosensitivity was associated to the number of initial and residual DNA double-strand breaks. By contrast, the dose rate change did not affect neither cell survival nor the residual DNA double-strand breaks after carbon ion irradiation. As a result, the Relative Biological Efficiency at 10 % survival increased when the dose rate decreased. In conclusion, in the radiotherapy treatment of HNSCC, it is advised to remain very careful when modifying the classical schemes towards altered-fractionation. At the opposite, as the dose rate does not seem to have any effects after carbon ion exposure, there is less need to adapt hadrontherapy treatment planning during active system irradiatio...|$|E
40|$|The AIT Austrian Institute of Technology {{coordinates}} {{the project}} MATSIM (MATROSHKA Simulation) {{in collaboration with}} the Vienna University of Technology and the German Aerospace Center, to perform FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations of the MATROSHKA numerical phantom irradiated under reference radiation field conditions {{as well as for the}} radiation environment at the International Space Station (ISS). MATSIM is carried out as co-investigation of the ESA ELIPS projects SORD and RADIS (commonly known asMATROSHKA), an international collaboration of more than 18 research institutes and space agencies from all over the world, under the science and project lead of the German Aerospace Center. During MATSIM a computer tomography scan of the MATROSHKA phantom has been converted into a high resolution 3 -dimensional voxel model. The energy imparted and absorbed dose distribution inside the model is determined for various radiation fields. The major goal of the MATSIM project is the validation of the numerical model under reference radiation conditions and further investigations under the radiation environment at ISS. In this report we compare depth dose distributions inside the phantom measured with thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs) and an ionization chamber with FLUKA Monte Carlo particle transport simulations due to Co- 60 <b>photon</b> <b>exposure.</b> Further reference irradiations with neutrons, protons and heavy ions are planned. The fully validated numerical model MATSIM will provide a perfect tool to assess the radiation exposure to humans during current and future space missions to ISS, Moon, Mars and beyond...|$|E
40|$|The delayed {{luminescence}} {{of biological}} tissues is an ultraweak reemission of absorbed <b>photons</b> after <b>exposure</b> to external monochromatic or white light illumination. Recently, Wang, Bókkon, Dai and Antal (Brain Res. 2011) presented the first experimental {{proof of the}} existence of spontaneous ultraweak biophoton emission and visible light induced delayed ultraweak photon emission from in vitro freshly isolated rat's whole eye, lens, vitreous humor and retina. Here, we suggest that the photobiophysical source of negative afterimage can also occur within the eye by delayed bioluminescent photons. In other words, when we stare at a colored (or white) image for few seconds, external photons can induce excited electronic states within different parts of the eye that is followed by a delayed reemission of absorbed photons for several seconds. Finally, these reemitted photons can be absorbed by nonbleached photoreceptors that produce a negative afterimage. Although this suggests the photobiophysical source of negative afterimages is related retinal mechanisms, cortical neurons have also essential contribution in the interpretation and modulation of negative afterimages.

40|$|Characterization of {{phytoplankton}} community {{composition is}} critical to understanding the ecology and biogeochemistry of the oceans. One approach to taxonomic characterization takes advantage of differing pigmentation between algal taxa and thus differences in fluorescence excitation spectra. Analyses of bulk water samples, however, may be confounded by interference from chromophoric dissolved organic matter or suspended particulate matter. Here, we describe an instrument that uses a laser trap based on a Nikon TE 2000 -U microscope to position individual phytoplankton cells for confocal fluorescence excitation spectroscopy, thus avoiding interference from the surrounding medium. Quantitative measurements of optical power give data {{in the form of}} photons emitted per <b>photon</b> of <b>exposure</b> for an individual phytoplankton cell. Residence times for individual phytoplankton in the instrument can be as long as several minutes with no substantial change in their fluorescence excitation spectra. The laser trap was found to generate two-photon fluorescence from the organisms so a modification was made to release the trap momentarily during data acquisition. Typical signal levels for an individual cell are in the range of 106 photons∕s of fluorescence using a monochromated 75 W Xe arc lamp excitation source with a 2 % transmission neutral density filter...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} methods of phase-contrast imaging is the Talbot grating interferometry. We report about the optimization of the method for fast imaging, requiring reduced exposure times by keeping sufficient imaging contrast. To do this a new Talbot interferometer working with a broad energy bandwidth beam has been installed at the Topo-Tomo beamline at ANKA. We demonstrate the method with a filtered white beam and without the need of a source grating that is commonly used at moderate-emittance synchrotron sources. Taking advantage of a higher <b>photon</b> flux, the <b>exposure</b> time is significantly reduced. At the same time, images obtained with this setup show a sufficient visibility contrast of 25 % on average, which opens the way for new applications in real-time measurements...|$|R
