40|$|Several {{studies have}} linked {{nosocomial}} transmission airborne diseases to airflow in healthcare settings. Quasi-experimental methods are developed {{to observe the}} aerodynamic transport behavior of synthetic respiratory particles in corridors of a hospital. Computational models, validated by experimental results, are then developed to explore the spatial relationships of supply-exhaust air ventilation in <b>patient</b> <b>corridors.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to determine optimal HVAC design strategies to contain and remove airborne contaminants in healthcare environments. ^ In addition to occupant comfort, hospital HVAC systems are designed to provide ventilation and directional airflow to contain, dilute and remove contaminants including airborne disease. Of 183 epidemiological studies published worldwide from 1960 - 2005, however, only 10 studies were deemed by a panel of international experts as having conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of ventilation to control the spread of airborne disease in healthcare settings. ^ Two experimental tests were conducted; one placing <b>patient</b> <b>corridors</b> under directional airflow and the second placing the corridors under non-directional airflow. The purpose of these tests was to observe the spatial-temporal movement of artificially-generated aerosols with respect to particle size and ventilation mode and to assess the probability of contamination from infectious sources inside and outside of the patient area. Next, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models were developed and validated by experimental results to test several ventilation rates with modified supply-exhaust air system configurations in <b>patient</b> <b>corridors.</b> ^ Results suggest that dissemination of bio-aerosols in hospital corridors could be exacerbated by directional airflow caused by either the spatial arrangement of supply-exhaust air ventilation, or, the pressure relationship between the corridor and surroundings spaces. Within the non-directional or ‘neutral’ airflow regime, modified supply-exhaust air system configurations reduced average particle concentration 30 % and transport distance more than 60 % without increasing air change rate. Aerosols ≤ 0. 5 μm, however, were observed more than 30 m from the source with comparatively less regard to airflow mode or supply-exhaust air system configuration. Ventilation arrangements can potentially reduce concentrations and improve distributions of particles. And, higher ventilation rates do not necessarily culminate in better results. ...|$|R

40|$|Contamination with radiopharmaceuticals {{in nuclear}} {{medicine}} centers {{in addition to}} being a health concern requires time-consuming decontamination efforts. According to NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) contamination should be monitored in nuclear medicine centers where radiopharmaceuticals are prepared and administrated at the end of each working session; otherwise, contamination spread to other areas not only equipment but also personnel and other people will be expected. The wipe test for the presence of radioactivity is accomplished by wiping the surface over an area approximately 100 cm² with an absorbent paper, then counting it in an appropriate radiation detector. In this study, contamination monitoring of patient’s rooms (4 rooms), entrance <b>corridor,</b> <b>patient’s</b> <b>corridor,</b> waiting room, control room (Nursing station), radiopharmaceutical storage room in therapy unit of Research Institute for Nuclear Medicine, Shariati hospital was performed by indirect method. Based on the results, some areas including storage room were contaminated. There was also a direct relationship between dose administrated and levels of contamination in patient’s rooms. Regarding high uptake of iodine by thyroid gland and damaging effects of Na¹³¹I, weekly wipe tests are required to determine the level of contamination. Patient’s rooms after discharging the patients and before rehospitalization specially should be checked. If these tests reveal contamination over standard levels, appropriate decontamination procedures should be carried out immediately...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} a nosocomial spread of Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. hominis (P. carinii hominis), air filter samples from rooms of P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) <b>patients,</b> adjacent <b>corridors,</b> and other hospital environments have been investigated for the presence of P. carinii hominis. Amplified DNA from air filters and sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage samples from the PCP patients have been genotyped with the P. carinii hominis genes of the mitochondrial large-subunit (mtLSU) rRNA and the internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and ITS 2) of the rRNA. Genotypes of the two loci were identified by direct sequencing, and for site 85 of the mtLSU locus, three allele-specific PCR assays were used. P. carinii hominis DNA was identified in the air of five of seven PCP patient rooms and in the air of two of four air filtrations from the ward corridors. The P. carinii hominis genotypes were the same in four of the five room air samples as those in the corresponding patients, suggesting a risk of person-to-person transmission of P. carinii hominis from PCP patients. Three of 16 air samples collected in infectious disease wards without the presence of PCP patients and one sample from a cardiology unit in a separate hospital building were also positive, which further strengthens the possibility of acquisition of P. carinii hominis from the environment...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivePhysicians and {{patients}} consider the limited walking distance and perceived disability {{when they make}} decisions regarding (invasive) treatment of intermittent claudication (IC). We investigated the relationship between walking distances estimated by the <b>patient,</b> on the <b>corridor</b> and on a treadmill, and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) in patients with IC due to peripheral arterial disease. MethodsThis was a single-center, prospective observational cohort study at a vascular laboratory in a university hospital in the Netherlands. The study consisted of 60 patients (41 male) with a median age of 64 years (range, 44 - 86 years) with IC and a walking distance ≤ 250 m on a standardized treadmill test. Main outcome measures were differences and Spearman rank correlations between pain-free walking distance, maximum walking distance (MWD) estimated by the <b>patient,</b> on the <b>corridor</b> and on a standardized treadmill test, and their correlation with the WIQ. ResultsThe median patients' estimated, corridor, and treadmill MWD were 200, 200, and 123, respectively (P <. 05). Although the median patients' estimated and corridor MWD were not significantly different, {{there was a difference}} on an individual basis. The correlation between the patients' estimated and corridor MWD was moderate (r = 0. 61; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 42 - 0. 75). The correlation between patients' estimated and treadmill MWD was weak (r = 0. 39; 95 %, CI 0. 15 - 0. 58). Respective correlations for the pain-free walking distance were comparable. The patients’ estimated MWD was moderately correlated with WIQ total score (r = 0. 63; 95 %, CI 0. 45 - 0. 76) and strongly correlated with WIQ distance score (r = 0. 81; 95 % CI, 0. 69 - 0. 88). The correlation between the corridor MWD and WIQ distance score was moderate (r = 0. 59; 95 % CI, 0. 40 - 0. 74).

40|$|While time is {{certainly}} {{an issue for}} many, {{a significant number of}} people remain intensely distrustful of social media. Worries about invasion of privacy, concern about personal security (particularly in relation to children) and fear of cyber-bullying are all valid reasons to steer clear.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The six minute walking {{distance}} (6 MWD) test is a commonly used test to estimate functional exercise capacity {{in patients with}} chronic diseases including chronic obstructive lung disease. Surprisingly, no attempt {{has been made to}} establish normal values for the 6 MWD. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the 6 MWD in healthy elderly volunteers and to evaluate its determining factors. Fifty-one healthy subjects aged 50 ± 85 yrs volunteered to participate in the trial. All subjects were free of diseases that could interfere with performance in a walking test. Tests were performed in a quiet 50 -m long hospital <b>corridor.</b> <b>Patients</b> were encouraged every 30 s to continue walking as quickly as possible. Walking distance averaged 63193 m and was 84 m greater in the male compared to female subjects (p< 0. 001). The 6 MWD showed significant correlations with age (r =- 0. 51, p< 0. 01) and height (r= 0. 54, p< 0. 01). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that age, height, sex and weight were independent contributors to the 6 MWD in healthy subjects, thus explaining 66 % of the variability. It is concluded that the six minute {{walking distance}} can be predicted adequately using a clinically useful model in healthy elderly subjects. Its variability is explained largely by age, sex, height and weight. Results of the six minute walking distance may be interpreted more adequately if expressed {{as a percentage of the}} predicted value...|$|R
