40|$|Preconditions and postconditions {{are widely}} used in {{execution}} models for software processes. The conditions that control software processes, however, can be complex and di cult to evaluate {{in the context of}} ongoing development activities. If evaluations and tasks are conducted in parallel, evaluations may be blocked for lack of access to data that are held by tasks. Conversely, task initiations and terminations may be blocked because their controlling conditions cannot be evaluated. Costly delays or even deadlocks may result. Potential con icts between condition evaluations and process tasks can be reduced by anumber of strategies, such as limiting the extent of conditions, or serializing evaluations and tasks. However, each of these strategies has its drawbacks (such as failure to capture full process semantics, or reduced process concurrency). This paper introduces a new strategy for condition-based process execution, specifically, <b>provisional</b> <b>execution</b> of process tasks. When {{it is not possible to}} completely evaluate all preconditions or postconditions because of con icts with ongoing activities, a manager may allow some tasks to be executed provisionally. Thatis,atask may be initiated before all its preconditions are satis ed, or terminated before all its postconditions are satis ed. The blocked conditions are not ignored � rather, their evaluation is deferred but still required. These conditions must be satis ed or the task is subject to abort. <b>Provisional</b> <b>execution</b> allows increased exibility in both the execution of process tasks and the evaluation of controlling conditions. It can lead to increased concurrency, reduced concurrency con icts, and generally greater adaptability in process execution. 2...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{problems}} involved in the <b>provisional</b> <b>execution</b> of the sentence in the Brazilian criminal procedural system, especially {{with respect to the}} constitutional guarantee of the presumption of innocence, here in its political-constitutional value. In the current national context in which it is heavily invested in relativizations of fundamental guarantees and in false punitive solutions, it is essential that the criminal procedure be imposed from the principles enshrined in the 1988 Constitution. It intends to demonstrate the new contours of the position built by the Federal Supreme Court on the subject, its possible criticisms and impacts on the commitment of the legitimacy of the decisions made in criminal matters by the Judiciary...|$|E

Para esta corte, a incidência dessa multa, de natureza coercitiva, só teria sua razão de ser nas execuções definitivas, cujo trânsito em julgado da sentença garantiria a efetividade esperada do direito material do credor.

ABSTRACT: This article aims {{to discuss}} the trial Special Appeal n. 1, 059, 478 /RS of 15 / 12 / 2010 (STJ Newsletter n. 460) which held that the art. 475 -J of the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply in the provisional executions by the debtor because he´s exercising his right to appeal of unfavorable court of appointments. To this Court, the incidence of this fine, which has a coercive nature, it would have its meaning in the final execution whose unappealable sentence would ensure the expected effectiveness of the substantive law of the creditor.
