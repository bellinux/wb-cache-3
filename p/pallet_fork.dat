5000|$|The <b>pallet</b> <b>fork</b> is a {{component}} of the lever escapement of a mechanical watch. The <b>pallet</b> <b>fork</b> and the lever form one component that sits between the escape wheel and the balance wheel. Its purpose is to lock the escape wheel, and release it one tooth at a time at each swing of the balance wheel, and also give the balance wheel small pushes to keep it going.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{bucket of}} many skid loaders {{can be replaced}} {{with a variety of}} specialized buckets or attachments, many powered by the loader's hydraulic system. These include backhoe, hydraulic breaker, <b>pallet</b> <b>forks,</b> angle broom, sweeper, auger, mower, snow blower, stump grinder, tree spade, trencher, dumping hopper, ripper, tillers, grapple, tilt, roller, snow blade, wheel saw, cement mixer, and wood chipper machine.|$|R
50|$|In {{industry}} {{the most}} common attachment for a tele-handler is <b>pallet</b> <b>forks</b> and {{the most common}} application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a conventional forklift. For example, telehandlers {{have the ability to}} remove palletised cargo from within a trailer and to place loads on rooftops and other high places. The latter application would otherwise require a crane, which is not always practical or time-efficient.|$|R
50|$|A {{telescopic}} handler, {{also called}} a telehandler, teleporter, or boom lift, is a machine {{widely used in}} agriculture and industry. It is somewhat like a forklift but has a , making it more a crane than a forklift, with the increased versatility of a single telescopic or articulating boom that can extend forwards and upwards from the vehicle. On {{the end of the}} boom the operator can fit one of several attachments, such as a bucket, <b>pallet</b> <b>forks,</b> muck grab, or winch. Telehandlers are sometimes called cherry pickers in North America, as that name can refer to any truck or heavy equipment that has such a boom.|$|R
5000|$|... in watchmaking, {{due to its}} {{low melting}} {{temperature}} (about 80-100 Â°C), to adjust and adhere pallet stones to the <b>pallet</b> <b>fork.</b> Also for securing small parts to a 'wax chuck' ( [...] faceplate [...] ) in a watchmakers' lathe.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, Kiu Tai-Yu, a Chinese watchmaker {{residing}} in Hong Kong, created a semi-flying tourbillon with only an abbreviated carriage for the escapement wheel and <b>pallet</b> <b>fork,</b> the upper pivot {{of the balance}} wheel being supported in a sapphire bridge.|$|E
50|$|Pallet jewels {{are on the}} <b>pallet</b> <b>fork</b> and {{interact}} with the escape wheel. They are the surfaces which, 5 times a second in a typical escapement, lock the gear train of the watch and then transfer power to the balance wheel.|$|E
50|$|While the {{front-end}} loaders on CUT size tractors {{are capable}} of many tasks, given their relatively small size and low capacities when compared to commercial loaders, the compact loaders can be made more useful with some simple options. A toothbar is commonly added to {{the front edge of}} a loader bucket to aid with digging. Some loaders are equipped with a quick coupler, otherwise known as a quick attach (QA) system. The QA system allows the bucket to be removed easily and other tools to be added in its place. Common additions include a set of <b>pallet</b> <b>forks</b> for lifting <b>pallets</b> of goods or a bale spear for lifting hay bales.|$|R

5000|$|Material {{handling}} {{methods and}} equipment {{are independent of}} waving. Each set of methods (e.g., order picking, batch picking, bulk picking) and equipment (e.g., conveyor and sorter, ASRS, order picker, <b>pallet</b> jack, <b>fork</b> lift) will yield a different expected productivity rate for management to use in determining the number of staff-hours to assign to each function by wave.|$|R
5000|$|The roller jewel, {{also called}} the impulse jewel or simply impulse pin, is a thin rod of ruby or sapphire, usually {{in the shape of}} a letter [...] "D". The roller jewel is {{responsible}} for coupling the motion of the balance wheel to that of the <b>pallet</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
50|$|A front-loader or loader is {{a tractor}} with an {{engineering}} tool {{which consists of}} two hydraulic powered arms {{on either side of}} the front engine compartment and a tilting implement. This is usually a wide-open box called a bucket, but other common attachments are a <b>pallet</b> <b>fork</b> and a bale grappler.|$|E
50|$|More highly jeweled watches add jewels {{to other}} pivots, {{starting}} with the <b>pallet</b> <b>fork,</b> then the escape wheel, fourth wheel, third wheel, then finally the center wheel. Jeweling like this to the third wheel adds eight jewels, giving 15 jewels in total. Jeweling to the center wheel adds two more giving 17 jewels in total. Thus, a 17 jewel watch {{is considered to be}} fully jeweled.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variety of}} {{specialty}} farm tractors {{have been developed}} for particular uses. These include [...] "row crop" [...] tractors with adjustable tread width to allow the tractor to pass down rows of corn, tomatoes or other crops without crushing the plants, [...] "wheatland" [...] or [...] "standard" [...] tractors with fixed wheels and a lower center of gravity for plowing and other heavy field work for broadcast crops, and [...] "high crop" [...] tractors with adjustable tread and increased ground clearance, often used in the cultivation of cotton and other high-growing row crop plant operations, and [...] "utility tractors", typically smaller tractors with a low center of gravity and short turning radius, used for general purposes around the farmstead. Many utility tractors are used for nonfarm grading, landscape maintenance and excavation purposes, particularly with loaders, backhoes, <b>pallet</b> <b>forks</b> and similar devices. Small garden or lawn tractors designed for suburban and semirural gardening and landscape maintenance also exist in a variety of configurations.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} {{separate}} buildings providing modern self-contained units for catering supply companies. Over 9688 sq ft {{of office space}} is also provided, and there are five ancillary accommodation units with cafes, toilets and maintenance facilities. The services of a diesel/propane supplier, specialist <b>pallet</b> services and <b>fork</b> lift truck maintenance companies are also available. Security for the market {{is provided by the}} Market Constabulary.|$|R
5000|$|Rider {{order picking}} truck - {{commonly}} called an [...] "Order Picker"; {{like a small}} Reach Truck, except the operator rides in a cage welded to the fork carriage, while wearing a specially designed safety harness to prevent falls. A special toothed grab holds the <b>pallet</b> to the <b>forks.</b> The operator hand transfers the load onto the pallet one article at a time. This is an efficient way of picking less than pallet load shipments, and is popular for use in large distribution centers.|$|R
5000|$|Gravity has {{a direct}} effect on the most {{delicate}} parts of the escapement, namely the <b>pallet</b> <b>fork,</b> balance wheel and hairspring. Most notably is the hairspring, which functions as the timing regulator for the escapement and is thus the part most sensitive to any exterior effects, such as magnetism, shocks, temperature, as well as inner effects such as pinning positions (inner collet), terminal curve, and heavy points on the balance wheel.|$|E
50|$|Additional jewels beyond 17 {{are used}} to either add cap jewels, or to jewel the {{mainspring}} barrel of the watch. Watches with 19 jewels, particularly those made by Elgin and Waltham, will often have a jeweled mainspring barrel. Alternatively a 19 jewel watch will have additional cap jewels on the escape wheel. 21 jewel watches commonly have cap jewels on both the <b>pallet</b> <b>fork</b> and escape wheel. 23 jewel watches will have a jeweled barrel and fully capped escapement. The timekeeping value of jewels beyond 17 for a time-only movement is often debated.|$|E
5000|$|Self-winding {{mechanisms}} {{continue working}} {{even after the}} mainspring is fully wound up. If a simple mainspring was used, this would put excessive tension on the mainspring. This could break the mainspring, {{and even if it}} did not, it can cause a problem called [...] "knocking" [...] or [...] "banking". The excessive drive force applied to the watch movement gear train can make the balance wheel rotate with excessive amplitude, causing the impulse pin to hit the back of the <b>pallet</b> <b>fork</b> horns. This will make the watch run fast, and could break the impulse pin. To prevent this, a slipping clutch device is used on the mainspring so it cannot be overwound.|$|E
50|$|Telescopic {{handlers}} {{are like}} forklift trucks {{that have a}} telescoping extendable boom like a crane. Early telescopic handlers only lifted {{in one direction and}} did not rotate; however, several of the manufacturers have designed telescopic handlers that rotate 360 degrees through a turntable and these machines look almost identical to the Rough Terrain Crane. These new 360-degree telescopic handler/crane models have outriggers or stabiliser legs that must be lowered before lifting; however, their design has been simplified {{so that they can be}} more quickly deployed. These machines are often used to handle pallets of bricks and install frame trusses on many new building sites and they have eroded much of the work for small telescopic truck cranes. Many of the world's armed forces have purchased telescopic handlers and some of these are the much more expensive fully rotating types. Their off-road capability and their on site versatility to unload <b>pallets</b> using <b>forks,</b> or lift like a crane make them a valuable piece of machinery.|$|R
40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} the design, construction, {{and evaluation of}} a portable RPC (Reusable Plastic Container) dumper. This RPC dumper is one piece of a citrus processing system to package citrus. Bee Sweet currently utilizes man power in order to dump its RPCs whereas this design will decrease the amount of man power needed to dump RPCs during high workloads. The goal of this project was to design, construct, and test a custom fabricated RPC dumper that will decrease {{the number of people}} needed to dump RPCs and also the amount of damage on the oranges when being dumped from the RPC by hand. The finished RPC dumper functions well, it dumps 4 RPCs per minute and is portable in that it can be moved by both <b>pallet</b> jack and <b>fork</b> lift. The RPC dumper also functions well in that it reduces the velocity change that the fruit sees by 80 % and also decreases the impact duration by 38 %...|$|R
50|$|The {{predominant}} use of jewel bearings is {{in mechanical}} watches, where their low and predictable friction improves watch accuracy {{as well as}} improving bearing life. Manufacturers listed the number of jewels prominently on the watch face or back, as an advertising point. A typical fully jeweled time-only watch has 17 jewels: two cap jewels, two pivot jewels, an impulse jewel for the balance wheel, two pivot jewels, two pallet jewels for the <b>pallet</b> <b>fork,</b> and two pivot jewels each for the escape, fourth, third, and center wheels. In modern quartz watches, the timekeeper is a quartz crystal in an electronic circuit, so accuracy of timekeeping is not dependent on low friction of the mechanical parts and jewels are not often used.|$|E
5000|$|In early {{watches the}} <b>pallet</b> <b>fork</b> and the lever were made as {{separate}} components and joined together. In later watches {{they were made}} as a single component {{as shown in the}} picture. The combined component is often referred to simply as the [...] "lever". In a straight line Swiss lever type escapement, the lever is shaped like a 'T' or an anchor, which gives this escapement its alternative name of anchor escapement. The lever is pivoted in the center; in operation it rocks back and forth. [...] On the arms of the 'T' are angled surfaces called pallets which alternately engage the teeth of the escapement's escape wheel. The central shaft of the lever ends in a fork, which gives pushes to the balance wheel's impulse pin, which is set off center in a disk on the balance wheel's shaft. To reduce friction, the pallets are made of precisely shaped pieces of ruby jewel. The pallet which the teeth first contact is called the entry pallet, while the other one is called the exit pallet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract â This paper {{presents}} a new method for the signature analysis of mechanical watch movements. Contrary {{to the existing}} method, it analyzes the time-frequency features of mechanical watch movement {{through a combination of}} reassigned scalogram and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). By mapping the signal into a 2 D domain of time and frequency, the reassigned scalogram reveals the frequency components of the shocks at different time. On the other hand, FEA gives the modal frequencies of the movements. By comparing the frequency components at different shocks to the modal frequencies of the movement, possible malfunctions of the movement can then be detected. A number of demonstration examples are included. Index Terms â Signature analysis, Mechanical watch, Reassigned scalogram, Finite element analysis, Fault diagnosis. clockwise until it hits the banking pin. As the intensity of the shocks in the drop phase is the largest, the vibration of the escape wheel may cause vibration on the fourth wheel. The instantaneous sound frequencies correspond to the modal frequencies of the vibrating parts, including the balance wheel, the <b>pallet</b> <b>fork,</b> the escape wheel and the fourth wheel.

40|$|MHWirth {{has given}} the thesis of {{designing}} a new lifting yoke as a multidisciplinary project. The new yoke is required to lift more than the parallel yoke currently supplied by the company. The necessary instrumentation and hydraulic components to operate it safely and efficiently is required. A cost estimation from both disciplines on the yoke parts will be done. The project group has through a concept phase, designed a new lifting yoke approved by the company. The design {{is based on a}} design of a <b>pallet</b> <b>fork.</b> In the pre-engineering phase the group was divided into the respective disciplines. A complete mechanical design and a hydraulic system have been developed, along with a through selection of electrical components. The hydraulic system, together with the mechanical movements has been analyzed to compare the new yoke with the parallel yoke, in terms of operational efficiency. The new yoke is potentially more efficient than the parallel yoke due to the amount of pipes transported simultaneously. An analysis of the time used on mechanical movements has shown that the yoke is able to compete on an equal level of efficiency as existing equipment. The new yoke fulfills the requirements of lifting capabilities set from the company. The project group has done a cost estimation based on NOK/kg, and a supplied parts list for the electrical and hydraulic equipment on the parallel yoke. The total cost of 443 kNOK for the new yoke will act as a recommendation to continue the engineering of the yoke...|$|E
