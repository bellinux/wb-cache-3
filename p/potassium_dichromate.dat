40|$|Aims Heavy metals are {{the main}} {{pollutants}} in nature. Chromium is a heavy metal which is widely used. Hexavalent chromium solubility and mobility in aqueous solutions is so high and it is easily reduced.

The present study aimed to determine the capability of powdered Spirogyra to remove chromium from synthetic aqueous solutions under the influence of process parameters includes pH, algal dosage, and metal initial concentration. Materials & Methods This study was empirically carried out in laboratory scale through a batch system in Kashan region, Iran, in September 2014.

40|$|Background: Majority of {{parasitic}} {{infections in}} rodents have zoonotic importance. This study aimed {{to determine the}} frequency and intensity of intestinal protozoa infections of rodents including Meriones persicus, Mus musculus and, C ricetulus migratorius. Methods: This survey was conducted in Meshkin Shahr district in northwestern Iran from Mar. to Dec. of 2014. Intestinal samples of 204 rodents including M. persicus (n= 117), M. musculus (n= 63) and C. migratorius (n= 24) were parasitologically examined. Formalin-ether concentration method was done for all of rodents stool samples and observed with light microscope. All of suspected cases were stained with trichorome staining Method. Cultivation in <b>dichromate</b> <b>potassium</b> 2. 5 % was carried out for all of coccidian positive samples. Acid fast and aniline blue staining methods were used for detecting of coccidian oocysts and intestinal microsporidial spores, respectively. Results: About 121 (59. 3 %) of the caught rodents were generally infected with intestinal protozoa. Entamoeba muris 14 (6. 9 %), Trichomonas muris 55 (27. 0 %), Chilomastix betencourtti 17 (8. 3 %), Giardia muris 19 (9. 3 %), Eimeria spp. 46 (22. 5 %), Isospora spp. 4 (2 %) and Cryptosporidium spp. 1 (0. 5 %) were found from the collected rodents. Microsporidian spores were identified in 63 (31 %) out of the 204 collected rodents using aniline blue staining method. Conclusion: Since some of the infections are zoonotic importance thus, control of rodents can be decreased new cases of the parasitic zoonoses in humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{concern about}} the {{environment}} has required {{that the effects of}} drilling fluids (muds) on surrounding areas be known. This study was initiated to investigate the effects of various muds on plant growth and on soils. In preliminary studies in Phase I (31 individual mud components), it was concluded that the obvious dominant effects on plant growth of detrimental drilling fluid components included excess soluble salts, excess exchangeable sodium percentage, possibly a high pH in some mixtures, and undesirable physical conditions. The latter resulted from the sodium and/or starch, gums, and bentonite. Phase II, the second year 2 ̆ 7 s study of the effect of drilling fluid on six soils and on the plant growth (which is this report) was designed to use seven typical drilling fluids at ratios of 1 : 4 (called the low rate), and 1 : 1 (called the high rate) by volume of liquid mud to disturbed and settled soils using green beans and sweet corn as the test plants. The seven mud mixtures were potassium chloride mud (PCM), diesel oil emulsion mud (DOEM), high pH lime mud (HPLM), lignite lignosulfonate sodium mud (LLSM), lignite lignosulfonate <b>potassium</b> mud (LLPM), <b>dichromate</b> mud (DTM), and a mud base (MB). Each mud contained bentonite and barite plus sodium or potassium hydroxide plus a few other substances. Too much soluble salts or too high an exchangeable sodium percentage was the major cause of reduced plant growth. The dispersing problem of mud-treated soils caused by high exchangeable sodium percentages results from the high sodium hydroxide contents added to the muds. Early attempts at leaching the soils with tap water were unsuccessful because of low permeability. Releaching all samples finally with salty water, first with 1 percent Ca(NO 3) 2, and later with 0. 2 percent Ca(NO 3) 2, and finally with tap water was effective and plant growth improved in all mud mixtures. In unleached treatments the muds PCM, DOEM, and DTM were most limiting to plants growth. Reclamation of soils into which drilling fluids (muds) are mixed seems to require primarily (1) the removal of excess salts, and (2) a lowering of the content of exchangeable sodium with some additions of chemical amendments (calcium salts) and adequate leaching...|$|R

25|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> is an {{oxidising}} agent in organic chemistry, and is milder than potassium permanganate. It {{is used to}} oxidize alcohols.

Secondary alcohols are converted into ketones. For example, menthone may be prepared by oxidation of menthol with acidified dichromate. Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic assay : The {{photovoltaic}} assay, {{used only}} in the dated Photo Electric Intoximeter (PEI), {{is a form of}} breath testing rarely encountered today. The process works by using photocells to analyze the color change of a redox (oxidation-reduction) reaction. A breath sample is bubbled through an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate,</b> and silver nitrate. The silver nitrate acts as a catalyst, allowing the alcohol to be oxidized at an appreciable rate. The requisite acidic condition needed for the reaction might also be provided by the sulfuric acid. In solution, ethanol reacts with the <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate,</b> reducing the dichromate ion to the chromium (III) ion. This reduction results in a change of the solution's color from red-orange to green. The reacted solution is compared to a vial of non-reacted solution by a photocell, which creates an electric current proportional to the degree of the color change; this current moves the needle that indicates BAC. Like other methods, breath testing devices using chemical analysis are somewhat prone to false readings. Compounds that have compositions similar to ethanol, for example, could also act as reducing agents, creating the necessary color change to indicate increased BAC.|$|E

The cell was also known as the 'chromic acid cell', but principally as the 'bichromate cell'.

25|$|Pasteur {{publicly}} {{claimed his}} success in developing the anthrax vaccine in 1881. However, his admirer-turned-rival Toussaint {{was the one who}} developed the first vaccine. Toussaint isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named Pasteurella in honour of Pasteur) in 1879 and gave samples to Pasteur who used them for his own works. On July 12, 1880, Toussaint presented his successful result to the French Academy of Sciences, using an attenuated vaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep. Pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at Pouilly-le-Fort on 5 May 1881. Pasteur gave a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort. He used <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> to prepare the vaccine. The promotional experiment was a success and helped Pasteur sell his products, getting the benefits and glory.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, Pasteur's rival Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint, a {{veterinary}} surgeon, used {{carbolic acid}} to kill anthrax bacilli and tested the vaccine on sheep.

He thought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent. In early 1881, Pasteur discovered that growing anthrax bacilli at about 42 °C made them unable to produce spores, and he described this method {{in a speech to the}} French Academy of Sciences on February 28. Later in 1881, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Société d'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine. Pasteur agreed, and the experiment, conducted at Pouilly-le-Fort on sheep, goats and cows, was successful. Pasteur did not directly disclose how he prepared the vaccines used at Pouilly-le-Fort.
