50|$|In the 1960s, Ohio {{governor}} James A. Rhodes envisioned joint vocational {{schools as}} a way to provide <b>proper</b> <b>technical</b> <b>training</b> for rural school districts that did not offer them as their larger city district counterparts had. Six districts initially made up Lorain County JVS before it expanded to its current 13. In the 1980s, the curriculum expanded to include 23 programs, and after the technological boom in the 1990s, more opportunities arose while partnerships with area colleges provided college credits. A 2,400 sq. ft. greenhouse was eventually added as well.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Presentation of {{features}} and {{example of the}} use of the offered determination algorithm of optimum geometrical parameters for the components of freight cars {{on the basis of the}} generalized mathematical models, which is realized using computer. Methodology. The developed approach to search for optimal geometrical parameters can be described as the determination of optimal decision of the selected set of possible variants. Findings. The presented application example of the offered algorithm proved its operation capacity and efficiency of use. Originality. The determination procedure of optimal geometrical parameters for freight car components on the basis of the generalized mathematical models was formalized in the paper. Practical value. Practical introduction of the research results for universal open cars allows one to reduce container of their design and accordingly to increase the carrying capacity almost by 100 kg with the improvement of strength characteristics. Taking into account the mass of their park this will provide a considerable economic effect when producing and operating. The offered approach is oriented to the distribution of the software packages (for example Microsoft Excel), which are used by technical services of the most enterprises, and does not require additional capital investments (acquisitions of the specialized programs and <b>proper</b> <b>technical</b> staff <b>training).</b> This proves the correctness of the research direction. The offered algorithm can be used for the solution of other optimization tasks on the basis of the generalized mathematical models...|$|R

2500|$|On 1 June 1939, the Air Corps Technical School at Chanute Field was {{elevated}} to the Command level, being re-designated as Air Corps <b>Technical</b> <b>Training</b> Command.

50|$|Requirements in {{the combat}} theaters for {{graduates}} of <b>technical</b> <b>training</b> schools and even pilots {{proved to be}} smaller than initially expected, so the Army Air Forces reduced the size of these training programs in January 1944.

30|$|Since <b>technical</b> <b>training</b> is an {{integral}} part of most apprenticeship programs, accessing this training should increase the probability of completion. Indeed, preliminary work using these data showed that accessing any type of <b>technical</b> <b>training</b> greatly increased the probability of completion. Table  4 further investigates this preliminary result by addressing the specific types of training undertaken. The other category includes those few individuals who took multiple types of <b>technical</b> <b>training</b> as well as individuals who took types of <b>technical</b> <b>training</b> not elsewhere categorized. Taking no <b>technical</b> <b>training</b> is the reference group. Those who took only long-block training (three weeks or more per year) show higher probabilities of completion. Although those with day training (one or two days per week) and self-paced training (including alternative forms of training such as distance education) also have higher completion probabilities.|$|R
