40|$|From an {{elevation}} of 38 km, the balloon-borne ANtarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) is designed to detect the up-coming radio frequency (RF) signal resulting from a sub-surface neutrino-nucleon collision. Although no neutrinos have been discovered thus far, ANITA is nevertheless the only experiment to self-trigger on radio frequency emissions from cosmic-ray induced atmospheric air showers. In {{the majority of those}} cases, down-coming RF signals are observed via their reflection from the Antarctic ice sheet and back up to the ANITA interferometer. Estimating the energy scale of the incident cosmic rays therefore requires an estimate of the fractional power reflected at the air-ice interface. Similarly, inferring the energy of neutrinos interacting in-ice from observations of the upwards-directed signal refracting out to ANITA also requires consideration of signal coherence across the interface. By comparing the direct Solar RF signal intensity measured with ANITA to the surface-reflected Solar signal intensity, as a function of incident elevation angle relative to the surface Θ, we estimate the <b>power</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> R(Θ).

40|$|The {{contribution}} of brine layers to observed reflective anisotropy of sea ice at 100 MHz is quan-titatively assessed, and a theoretical explanation for observed reflective anisotropy is proposed {{in terms of}} anisotropic electric flux penetration into the brine layers. The sea ice {{is assumed to be}} a stratified dielec-tric consisting of pure ice containing ellipsoidal conducting inclusions (brine layers) uniformly aligned with their long axes perpendicular to the preferred crystallographic axis direction. The asymmetrical geometry of the brine layers is shown to produce an anisotropy in the complex dielectric constant of sea ice. The {{contribution of}} these layers to the reflective anisotropy is examined with a numerical method of approximating the reflected power of a radar pulse incident on a slab of sea ice. Mixture dielectric per-mittivities are calculated for both the electric fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis direction. These permittivities are then used to calculate <b>power</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> at each interface in the air/sea ice/sea water system. Significant bottom reflection (R = 0. 09) occurs when the polarization is parallel to the c axis. However, when the polarization is perpendicular to the c axis, the return is almost completely extinguished (R < 0. 003). This extinction is due primarily to absorptive loss associated with the con-ducting inclusions and secondarily to an impedance match at the ice/water interface that results in trans-mission rather than reflection of the wave...|$|R

An interpretation model has been developed that allows the depth variation of temperature, heat flux, pressure, density, ice velocity, depositional age, and thermal and dielectric properties to be calculated.

A high power waveguide double-stub tuner is under development for use with the Alcator C-Mod lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) system at 4. 6 GHz. The amplitude and relative phase shift between adjacent columns of an LHCD antenna are critical for control of the launched n|| spectrum.

This effect can be compensated by adjusting the phase of the low power microwave drive for each klystron amplifier. Cross-coupling of the reflected power between columns of the launcher must also be considered.
