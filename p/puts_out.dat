The water <b>puts</b> <b>out</b> the fire, which causes the warm updraft going into the chimney to cease; this updraft was actually holding Seven's barge in stasis all of this time. The barge comes crashing down into the kingdom, and Jake uses his stretching powers to save Finn. Thence, Finn, Jake, and Seven escape.|$|E

It turns out that he is only able to keep on living due to an enchanted spike that is lodged into his chest and, without such, the spell is broken. Angelika is drowned by her father, becoming the 12th victim. The Brothers reach the tower while the Queen breathes an ice wind that <b>puts</b> <b>out</b> the forest fire.

5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady <b>puts</b> <b>out</b> fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} the events of , protagonist George Stobbart and his girlfriend, Nicole Collard, visit an {{archaeologist}} named Professor Oubier to learn about a mysterious Mayan stone Nico uncovered while researching a newspaper story. At Oubier's home, they are ambushed by two Central Americans, who kidnap Nico, tie George to a chair and set the building ablaze. George unties himself and <b>puts</b> <b>out</b> the fire. He contacts Andre Lobineau, who reveals that Nico had suspected that something would go wrong and had left the stone with him. Lobineau tells him of a gallery owner who can tell him more about Mayan art. George discovers that Oubier supplies the gallery with Mayan artifacts, which he imports through a company named Condor Transglobal. Following this lead, George finds the two Central Americans who kidnapped Nico. One of them, whose name is later revealed to be Pablo, is shown threatening and berating the other (later revealed to be called Titipoco). George knocks Pablo unconscious and discovers that Condor Transglobal has links with Quaramonte City in Central America. He also frees Titipoco, who had been manacled by Pablo. George finds Nico, who reveals that, while trying to expose a drug ring run {{by a man named}} Karzac, she was sent the stone instead, prompting her to arrange the appointment with Oubier.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which <b>puts</b> <b>out</b> a series of flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant {{to get a good}} crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E

25|$|A driver with {{a higher}} maximum power rating cannot {{necessarily}} be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100W driver ("A") rated at 92dB for 1W @ 1m sensitivity <b>puts</b> <b>out</b> twice as much acoustic power as a 200W driver ("B") rated at 89dB for 1W @ 1m when both are driven with 100W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or loudness as speaker B would produce with 200W input. Thus, a 3dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.|$|E

The two boys become fast friends, and Superboy builds Lex a fully stocked laboratory to allow him to conduct his experiments. Lex uses the lab to search for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite. Just after Lex discovers the cure, a fire breaks out in his lab. When Superboy <b>puts</b> <b>out</b> the fire, the antidote is destroyed, along with a protoplasmic life form that Lex created, and Lex also loses all his hair. Lex blames Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance. Lex swears that he will prove to the world that he is superior to Superboy. Lex does this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's winds up backfiring, requiring Superboy to intervene. This series of setbacks results in Lex dedicating his life to destroying Superboy. In the years that follow, Lex becomes Superboy's (and then Superman's) archfoe. Superboy soon acquires a small rogues gallery of recurring villains, including Lex.|$|E
