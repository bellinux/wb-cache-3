50|$|In her epistle to Mistress Toppe, Cavendish {{stated that}} her {{main reason for}} writing was her desire for fame. Again, Cavendish {{acknowledged}} her writing as a digression from accepted gender norms and asked for acceptance. While Cavendish often spoke of her writing in metaphors of domestic or stereotypically feminine activities, here she attempted to excuse her desire for fame by distancing her ambition from the feminine. She described her ambition as a quest for glory, perfection, and praise, which, she stated, was not effeminate. Further, she pointed out that even while writing and pursuing fame she had remained modest and honourable and noted that she had done nothing to dishonour her family. Cavendish attributed her confidence, in what she describes as a time of censor, to her belief {{that there was no}} evil, only innocence in her desire for fame. As to her writing without permission, Cavendish excused herself by stating that it was easier to get a pardon after the fact than to obtain permission before. She <b>privileged</b> <b>writing</b> over gossiping, which she treated as a common and negative female activity. She consided writing to be a comparatively harmless pastime. She credited her books as tangible examples of her contemplation and contrasted her self-proclaimed harmless ideas with wild thoughts which, she stated, led to indiscreet actions.|$|E
40|$|Because Mennonite {{communities}} have traditionally valued religious conformity and ethnic solidarity above individual artistic expression, Mennonite writers and their readers {{have tended to}} view realistic story-telling {{as an act of}} revolt against the community. Criticism has, for the most part, also <b>privileged</b> <b>writing</b> above belonging. My argument in this dissertation is that an historically informed awareness of the dialectic between self and community that is intrinsically part of Mennonite theology makes such an either/or reading of Mennonite narratives misleading and incomplete. Accordingly, Chapter One reviews the historical roots of Russian Mennonite communities in Canada and examines their understanding of the self in light of two views of the individual, Western modernism and more recent social constructionism. Using Weintraub's distinction between personality and individual and Lanham's distinction between rhetorical man and serious man, I discuss the nature of the dilemma faced by the Mennonite writer. Chapters Two through Six examine, in roughly chronological order, the various narrative strategies that have allowed writers such as Arnold Dyck, Rudy Wiebe, Al Reimer, Anne Konrad, Armin Wiebe, Doug Reimer, Elizabeth Falk, and Magdalene Falk Redekop, to gain a voice within their own communities. Essentially all of these writers choose either to emphasize the ethnic component of Mennonite identity in order to defuse theological objections to the subversive act of writing, or to examine the theological component of Mennonite identity in order to adopt or extend the officially accepted act of prophetic utterance. Either way, Mennonite writers contribute to the continuance of Mennonite community even as they can be accused of undermining it. They do not choose to write or to belong so much as they contribute to the shaping of what they belong to, since the community that once resisted artistic expression now needs that expression in order to forge a new and viable identity in a changing urban world...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{representation}} of domestic servants within mid-twentieth century novels of female development, which are written by middle class women. The comparison is between the following authors: Rosario Castellanos from Mexico, Jean Rhys from the West Indies, and Clarice Lispector from Brazil. Postcolonial women writers have needed to tackle hegemonic structures within their own fiction, as they confront the privilege of the modern writing subject who frames herself {{in opposition to the}} silence of colonized female characters. Working to rewrite history, and to develop texts that speak from the margins, there is a conscious effort to incorporate subaltern voices into their narratives. Nevertheless, anxiety arises within those texts of middle-class writers who are preoccupied with the management of differences, stemming from a realization that in fact there is no place within the <b>privileged</b> <b>writing</b> subject's text from which the subaltern can actually speak. Therefore the authors struggle to write within a masculine-centered literary tradition that privileges certain voices over others, {{while at the same time}} recognizing their complicity with that system that works through exclusions. While the servant is silenced, the writing also shields her from being appropriated and defined by the mistress who needs her as a caregiver while she pursues a personal growth and awakening. That is, silences are used to form a protective space in which the marginalized woman cannot be merely the embodiment of alterity for the narrator's quest for subjectivity. An element of shame is therefore revealed by means of an implied author, which reminds them that they are expressing an ideal that they themselves have not lived up to. The marginal character becomes a negative element that points to the inability of the narrative to adequately represent her. It questions the model of solidarity through shared oppression that readings of women's and postcolonial writings often take, suggesting that new forms of community need to be imagined that take into account inequalities and injustices between women...|$|E

These classification schemes were constructed within a philosophical framework which viewed man as the central focus in the universe, which believed in progress through science and research, and which <b>privileged</b> <b>written</b> documentation over other forms.

Of particular interest in determining how knowledge is represented in classification schemes are the following: - Main classes: classification theorists have attempted to discipline epistemology in the sense of imposing main class structures with the view to simplifying access to knowledge in documents for library users. - Notational language: a number of classification theorists were particularly interested in the establishment of symbolic languages through notation.

This collection of essays by major historians, anthropologists, and literary scholars demonstrates that the European settlement of the Americas and European interaction with Native peoples were shaped just as much by communication challenges as by traditional concerns such as religion, economics, and resources...|$|R

40|$|This special double {{issue of}} Great Plains Quarterly {{has been a}} long time in the making. Unlike the yearly special issues that {{showcase}} papers from our annual symposia, this number of the Quarterly contains four articles submitted at various times, revised and expanded, and collected together. All deal with EuroNorth Americans 2 ̆ 7 misperceptions of indigenous peoples and the consequences of those misperceptions for all peoples of the Great Plains. In 2 ̆ 2 The Sacred Black Hills, 2 ̆ 2 Linea Sundstrom painstakingly contradicts the view many researchers have proposed that Cheyenne and Lakota beliefs and oral traditions about the sacredness of the Black Hills had been conveniently developed by contemporary people seeking to buttress contemporary claims to the area. Because history, as a scholarly discipline, has always <b>privileged</b> <b>written</b> texts over oral ones and because of the common folk belief among literate peoples that oral texts are less reliable than written ones, ethnohistorians have had to learn from indigenous peoples and from other disciplines, such as archaeology, how to deal with oral and pictographic texts. Sundstrom 2 ̆ 7 s methodology here, however, is to compile written texts more than fifty years old that support the oral and pictographic claims for the sacredness of the Black Hills. Her research makes clear that the oral histories were right all along. Not only have the Black Hills been sacred to the Cheyennes and Lakotas, but also to the Arapahos, Kiowas and Kiowa-Apaches, Arikaras, and Mandans, who had all known the area. Although Sundstrom cannot answer questions about the more distant past-such as whether the Lakotas had known the sacred Black Hills thousands of years earlier and then returned more recentlyshe does make it clear that the area was sacred to the Lakotas and Cheyennes when the United States seized the land and even that its sacred status was known-and disregarded- by Euro-American reporters at the time. In 2 ̆ 2 Mapping the Marias, 2 ̆ 2 Barbara Belyea looks at one decision made by Lewis and Clark on their long trek from St. Louis to the Pacific. For nine days they paused where two rivers converged, exploring and checking their maps to discover which should be considered the Missouri-and followed to its source to reach what they supposed would be a portage that led to the headwaters of the Columbia and hence to the Pacific-and which they should declare a tributary and leave unexplored. The stream coming from the northwest they eventually named the Marias, and continued along what is still called the Missouri, flowing in from the southwest. Subsequent historians have praised their choice as a victory for scientific methods of observation. Yet had they chosen to follow the river Clark named for his cousin Maria, they would have found a shorter and easier passage to the Pacific. Belyea points out that both the captains 2 ̆ 7 Native informants and the Native mapmakers whose information had been incorporated into their most recent European map depicted rivers less in terms of European conventions of watersheds and tributaries and more, at least in these cases, as passageways through the mountains. The captains hesitated at the Marias not because Native understanding of the relationships between rivers was sketchy or unreliable, as historians have implied, but because Lewis 2 ̆ 7 s and Clark 2 ̆ 7 s own preconceptions about rivers, tributaries, and watersheds prevented them from understanding the full import of the information available to them...|$|R

30|$|We are <b>privileged</b> to <b>write</b> this {{editorial}} 1 at such {{a significant}} moment for the Postgraduate Psychology Program at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil as we celebrate the 30 th anniversary of its first course in 1988. Paired {{with the beginning of}} the postgraduate psychology program, our journal was launched, and we would like to take this opportunity to talk about its path as well. In Brazil, many scientific journals have been launched and continue to be associated with higher education institutions. Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica is one of these journals, affiliated with the Postgraduate Program in Psychology of Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The journal actually appeared in 1986 with a modest regional proposal to discuss current ideas on the relations between psychology as a profession and science, hence the original title in Portuguese of reflexão (reflection) and crítica (criticism). In 1985, after 31  years of military dictatorship, democracy was reestablished in the country, and universities were discussing the best options for their administrative and academic policies. Thus, Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica emerged, in the midst of these hearty discussions, as a precursor to the Postgraduate Program in Psychology created in 1987 and beginning its activities in March 1988. In its modest proposal, the journal adopted a scientific editorial style and soon attracted articles from researchers from leading Brazilian universities. The growing development of the Postgraduate course in psychology at UFRGS and the recognizable importance of the journal Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica can be related, as the journal played a great role in documenting the history of the program, the diffusion of the research and the discussions regarding the advances in postgraduate studies in psychology in Brazil. Through time, Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica became a singular periodical and a model in our context of pioneering initiatives towards internationalization (Remor, 2016). Mindful of its international vocation, the journal has been published under the SpringerOpen brand by Springer Nature since volume 29 of 2016. The journal also had its name updated in English to reflect better the scope of the journal, to be known as Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica | Psychology: Research and Review (Remor, 2016).|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} has been to {{describe}} the complex influences governing the production of fashionable furniture in C 18 th England and France in order to reassess the connection between material practices, the cultures in which they reside and the philosophical ideas from which they emerge. This has been achieved by detailing the factors influencing the design and production of late C 18 th furniture in England and France and developing a comparative model developed around the Harewood Library Table by Thomas Chippendale and The Wallace Collection F 302 Secrétaire á abattant by Riesener, in order to isolate, identify and interpret differences between them. This innovative case study sits {{at the heart of}} this thesis and describes in detail how these pieces were designed and constructed and how they relate to the wider cultures from which they emerged. The result of this is apparent in a number of outcomes. Firstly, the thesis offers a definitive summary of the key characteristics of Chippendale’s and Riesener’s work which will better enable practitioners (conservators, curators, collectors, etc.) to identify pieces made by these makers, analyze their condition and help conserve these important pieces of furniture: furniture history currently is over‐dependent on much more subjective approaches to this process of identification. Secondly, the thesis examines different aspects of furniture making in England and France (literature on the workshops, information on economic conditions, evidence relating to tools and materials etc.) and integrates them in such a way as to provide an authoritative account of the complex processes involved in the commissioning of such fashionable furniture. The thesis not only helps us better understand furniture making in England and France at a structural level during this key period of transition but also provides an original and systematic approach to writing a history around such material cultures, demonstrating how important it is to the full(est) comprehension of history that such fashionable objects be understood. Where other frequently more <b>privileged</b> objects (<b>written</b> documents, paintings and sculptures etc.) have been seen to provide valuable historical insights, this thesis argues that fashionable furniture can now be seen to provide its own unique perspectives on the time and on the society in which it was created...|$|R
40|$|Following the Second World War, a {{theological}} re-examination of ―suffering and hope‖ arose, led by authors such as Moltmann and Sölle; however, {{little has been}} written on the topic since the 1970 s. Given this length of time, the question arose for me as to whether, {{in the light of}} a rapidly changing world, this past theology continues to provide a meaningful way of talking about suffering and hope. Would the reflections of contemporary Christians who have supported others in the depths of suffering have anything to add to how theologians explore the issue of suffering and hope? In order to answer this, I decided to interview Australian Christians who had supported asylum seekers during a time of particularly severe immigration detention policies. Conditions experienced within Australia‘s detention centres have contributed to the distress of already traumatised refugees; thus advocates who supported them have a unique experience of suffering and hope. Drawing on phenomenology, a social research methodology that seeks to explore the meaning made out of experiences, I systematically reviewed themes arising from the reflections of some advocates and compared these themes alongside the theologies of Moltmann and Sölle. The themes, many and varied in their scope, have been divided into three sections. The first section explores the issue of suffering, including the necessity for Christian theology to hold the darkness of life without turning too quickly towards hope, and the nature of sin and evil. In the second section, hope is explored starting with the question of whether it is permissible for theologians from a relatively <b>privileged</b> background to <b>write</b> about hope and progressing to explore Christian anthropology, compassion and forgiveness. Finally, I consider the question of what can be learnt from these reflections about the nature of God...|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{critical}} {{attention has been paid}} over the last twenty years at least to the relation of 'self and 'Other'. But what happens when the external 'other' is displaced to the periphery of the concerns of textual production? In order to explore this question Methodological Embodiments employs an interdisciplinary praxis that {{is not limited to the}} classic model of written theory. At the same time, it does not negate this form that has historical and ideological precedence within an academic context. The aim of this thesis is to juxtapose written theory with artistic practices in order to initiate, develop and represent a dialogue between subjectivity and methods of theoretical engagement. The performative negotiation between the embodied experience of the practitioner and the investigative forms constitute a tripartite relation that implicates 'performance' as a third term in the methodological formulation. The final submission includes 1) a written dissertation, Methodological Embodiments :: Psychical Corporeal Performances of Subjective Specific Auto[erotic]-Representations; 2) an exhibition, I::Matter; and 3) the live performance, I::Do. My thesis argues for, and enacts, a positive framing of individual embodied experience within a dialogue between linguistic and artistic practices. Academia has traditionally <b>privileged</b> the <b>written</b> word in the definition of 'theory'. This has limited the understanding of how meaning is made and how the subject as scholar is implicated within the production of knowledge. At the same time, within classic psychoanalysis, subjectivity has also come to be understood through, and in relation to, language. While language clearly has a significant part to play in the making of both theory and a/the subject, it must be situated in relation to individual embodiment. Classic psychoanalysis falls short of this insofar as it fails to take into account the implications of sexual difference. This neglect has resulted in the construction of phallocentric frameworks that not only misrepresent women as a 'model' of disease and lack, but problematically foreclose the possibility of symbolic agency for a/the woman. The relation between materiality and image as regards representation is significant to these discourses of subjectivity, language and art, respectively and at the points in which they overlap. Throughout the thesis many specific terms and concepts have been either coined or reappropriated in order to situate and accurately define the concerns of my work. Two important examples are cited here. First, my recourse to the psychoanalytic term psychical corporeality, which suggests that embodiment simultaneously informs and inscribes the psychical perceptions of the subject in relation to surrounding environments and a sense of self. Secondly, in place of the psychoanalytic use of Narcissism is my use of autoeroticism that seeks to re-define the literary genre of autobiography and the traditional understanding of self-portraiture in the visual arts, to what I have called auto[erotic] - representation(s) within my own textual production...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I read Derrida�s {{critique}} of the �sign� over against {{the challenges of the}} metaphysics of presence as featured in Western theology and philosophy. Derrida argues that logocentric interpretive interest in theology and philosophy is widely held and contradict by the West, as this somehow reveals the Western belief of the metaphysics of presence. He argues that the idea of metaphysics of presence which is strongly held in Christianity and Judaism is somehow privileged speech (Logos) over against writing which is seen as death and alienated from existential and transcendental reality. Derrida focuses on the reading of Saussure and how presence has been perceived over against writing in Western discourse in terms of the interpretation from Plato to Rousseau. Derrida prefers to deconstruct presence, which is perceived in Western theology and philosophy as truth and the ideal moment of pure, unmediated firstness. This article focuses on the reading of the work of Saussure, who has been greatly influential in the study of oral traditions, verbal arts and the interpretive interest of the sign. For Derrida writing has been suppressed by Western discourse for almost 400 years, as speech has been <b>privileged</b> over <b>writing.</b> The function of deconstruction is to deconstruct the binary opposition between speech and writing. Derrida provides clear examples of his deconstructive activity, which turns the text in traces of more text in opposing speech as unmediated firstness of presence. Derrida�s {{critique of}} speech hopes to expose the dishonesty and false consciousness in a Western interpretive discourse that suppressed writing and perceived speech as presence. This relation is both oppositional and hierarchical, with writing as secondariness understood as a fall or lapse from firstness. For Derrida, �there is nothing outside of the text�. In the original French, Derrida wrote: � Il n�y a pas de hors-texte � [There is no outside-text]. Language is a constant movement of differences and everything acquires the instability and ambiguity inherent in language (Callinicos 2004). The implications of Derrida�s reading based on his work Of Grammatology (1976) have impacted everything in the humanities and social sciences, including law, anthropology, linguistics and gender studies, as the meaning of the text is not only inscribed in the sign (signifier and the signified), but everything is a �text� and meaning and representation are how we interpret it. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: Derrida sought to subvert the �sign� in structuralism, as it opens the door to dialogue with the socially constructed �Other� in relation to the �sign� and the false consciousness construction of the text by the West. This challenges the existing interpretive paradigm and open oral and written dialogue of the text for the �other� in terms of the meaning and representation of the oral text, the oral archival memory of the other, indigenous knowledge systems, African rituals, folklore, storytelling and verbal arts. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{responds to}} a lacuna in both ecocriticism and Chicana/o literary history. The former lacks input from ethnic American literatures, {{while the latter}} offers very little commentary on environmental aspects of Chicana/o writing. Why have these two fields remained separate despite often overlapping institutional histories? My study points to their common roots in activist movements, and how this early period critically preconditioned a disengagement with Chicanas/os as environmentalists. I engage these two fields to get at a literary history that is only weakly understood at the moment. What emerges is {{a greater understanding of}} the ways that the social construction of nature has operated to reinforce the oppression of people of color, as well as the ways that Chicana/o writing has transcended this subjugation. Environmental literary study has <b>privileged</b> introspective nature <b>writing</b> and individual exploration of nature. While this perspective is understood in certain Anglo American contexts, it is becoming increasingly obvious that it is insufficient as a paradigm for the study of other environmental literatures. More particularly, it cannot account for non-Anglo American mediations of nature. Chicana and Chicano writers, with their concern for social justice and community, nonetheless take up their pens to reflect on the natural environment, albeit differently than conventional ecocriticism expects. Curiously, Chicana/o literary study has been complicit with overlooking Chicana/o writers' environmental insights, largely because the environment has been perceived to be a lesser priority than the seemingly more immediate needs of social equity. However, broadening the category of nature writing to environmental writing, and considering the close ties between social justice and environmental issues reveals the ways that Chicana/o writers demonstrate how human interaction with the environment differs along lines of ethnicity and class. This study investigates what's behind these differences. Specifically, I explore the writings of four Chicana/o environmental writers: Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton, Jovita Gonzalez, Jimmy Santiago Baca, and Cherrie Moraga. Their environmental writing provides valuable insights about how Chicanas/os maintain a sustainable relationship with the environment...|$|R
40|$|Invention {{should be}} <b>privileged</b> in the <b>writing</b> classroom. This {{is the most}} {{important}} implication resulting from extensive interviews with seven published writers about how they write. There are vast differences in their approaches to writing, but one thing common to all of them is that invention is central. ^ Invention was central for Aristotle and for early eighteenth century pedagogical theorists, and it was again privileged by the theorists involved {{in the early days of}} the writing process movement of the 1960 s, but historically it has always been gradually neglected. One predominant pedagogy today, often labeled current-traditional rhetoric, privileges form and correctness. The attempts to discredit current-traditional pedagogies have long been raging, and yet writing textbooks continue to teach their methods. Three important approaches to composition often associated with the process approach—expressionism, cognitive rhetoric, and social constructionism—represent a pulling apart of Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s important proofs of ethos, pathos, and logos. The pedagogies of invention that are usually associated with these theories tend to emphasize one proof over another, and the unfortunate result is a narrowing of the concept of invention. ^ Until we privilege and enrich invention we may never see the changes needed in the conceptualization and teaching of the process approach. We need to broaden our perception of a writer 2 ̆ 7 s process of writing to understand when invention is occurring and to recognize its powerful drive. Because of its serendipitous nature we need to be less rigid in our pedagogy to allow for and validate a writer 2 ̆ 7 s proclivities. ^ Pedagogical implications from this study include the need for student writers to begin their writing and to be continually nourished by their own inventions. They will be motivated by their ideas to improve their writing. Student writers need to know the importance of recognizing and recording their inventions and to trust their individual writing processes that produce the inventions. Student writers will benefit by sharing in-process writing with people they trust, and they will benefit from the positive comments of teachers in response to their writing. Invention centered pedagogy, fortunately, promotes writing worthy of praise by teachers. ...|$|R

They had just come the length of your immortal definition of boyhood in the concrete, and I had the pleasure to see the whole party dissolve under its influence with inextinguishable laughter. I thought this was not half bad for arthritic gout! Depend upon it, sir, when I go into the arthritic gout business, I shall be done with literature, or at least with the funny business. It is quite true I have my battlefields behind me. I have done perhaps as much work as anybody else under the most deplorable conditions. But two things fall to be noticed: In the first place, I never was in actual pain; and in the second, I was never funny. I'll tell you the worst day that I remember. I had a haemorrhage, and was not allowed to speak; then, induced by the devil, or an errant doctor, I was led to partake of that bowl which neither cheers nor inebriates - the castor-oil bowl. Now, when castor-oil goes right, it is one thing; but when it goes wrong, it is another. And it went WRONG with me that day. The waves of faintness and nausea succeeded each other for twelve hours, and I do feel a legitimate pride in thinking that I stuck to my work all through and wrote a good deal of Admiral Guinea (which I might just as well not have written for all the reward it ever brought me) in spite of the barbarous bad conditions. I think that is my great boast; and it seems a little thing alongside of your GLEAMS OF MEMORY illustrated by spasms of arthritic gout. We really should have an order of merit in the trade of letters. For valour, Scott would have had it; Pope too; myself on the strength of that castor-oil; and James Payn would be a Knight Commander. The worst of it is, though Lang tells me you exhibit the courage of Huish, that not even an order can alleviate the wretched annoyance of the business. I have always said that there is nothing like pain; toothache, dumb-ague, arthritic gout, it does not matter what you call it, if the screw is put upon the nerves sufficiently strong, there is nothing left in heaven or in earth that can interest the sufferer.

40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU for CHE, 1999 The {{decade of}} the eighties {{was a period of}} {{unprecedented}} resistance to apartheid as well as unprecedented violence in South Africa. Political violence and the struggle by blacks/coloureds caused many deaths during the years of the apartheid rule. This work revises critical assumptions about the role that the South African regime played to stir up violence in the country. The South African Police were in the forefront in carrying out instructions given to them by their senior officials. The 1976 school riots is one example, where black/coloured children were shot and killed in large numbers. John Miles and Abraham Philips's novels are filled with violent incidents that contribute to a portrait of blacks and coloureds as miserable creatures, whose aspirations are destructive delusions. Despite the shared theme, the ultimate effect of the violence in the novels to the reader is not uniform. My introductory chapter provides background information on the roots of the violence in the three texts that are intertwined. The brutality of the South African police on blacks/coloureds is emphasized by both authors. Miles is a white man from the <b>privileged</b> people. He <b>writes</b> about a black policeman who was assaulted by his white colleagues. Phillips is a coloured and he writes about the mysterious death of his brother, allegedly murdered by the police. White on black/coloured violence and black on black violence, as well as coloured on coloured violence was provoked by the government of the day. Apartheid forced blacks and coloureds to resist the regime, causing conflict, aggression, anger, hatred, resistance, resentment and intimidation amongst people of different races. Chapter II, Ill and IV discuss the codes of violence in the three texts explicitly. The concepts apartheid, police, racism, fire, misuse of alcohol are some of the aspects discussed in the chapters aforesaid. These concepts are synonymous in the three texts, the codes are intertextual. Chapter V discusses the historical background of the black/coloured people under the oppression of the South African government. A comparison of the texts investigates the motivation of the violence to determine whether it is realistic, in comparison with the South African history during the years of apartheid. People of different races could not live, pray, play, go to school together and get married to each other. In each of the novels there are victim(s) whose cases are differently treated according to race. The white victim's case is treated differently from the black and coloured victims. The two coloured men who killed the white man were imprisoned and later hanged in Pretoria Central Prison (Erfenis van die noodlot). The black victim in Kroniek uit die doofpot is murdered. His death as well as his wife's death is a mystery. The perpetrators are never found. In Die verdwaalde land the victim is a coloured whose murderers are not found, although there is evidence. These victims were discriminated against because of the colour of their skin. Lastly there is a summary of the three texts in a rubrical form, categorising forms of violence. All texts address themes of politically motivated violence in South Africa. What is most significant are the different techniques each author uses in depicting the brutality of the prevailing regime's authoritarianism and dictatorship. These authors were ignored and denied the opportunity of writing about such controversial issues, during the apartheid era, and only in the 90 's were they able to publish their works without police harassment. According to Miles this novel, Kroniek uit die doofpot, is based on realities. He hopes to have the victims' death resolved one day. Phillips unlike Miles, pleads to all South Africans to be one nation. He believes that Mandala's imprisonment for twenty eight years is evidence that he was set free to relieve all those who were oppressed by the chains of subservience. Both authors' visions and hopes are a dream come true in the New South Africa. Some changes are being effected. Phillips in Die verdwaalde land concludes by saying that nations of different cultures, traditions, norms and colour need to respect each other, so that the blacks/coloureds can see that their struggle was not in vain. South Africans can do away with violence. Master...|$|R
