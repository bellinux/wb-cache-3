40|$|Researchers have {{repeatedly}} {{found that the}} use of mobile technology (MT) in the West is a double-edged sword that produces both positive and negative psychological experiences for <b>employees.</b> <b>MT</b> blurs the boundaries between work and non-work contexts, limiting employees 2 ̆ 7 personal space and time as a result, and possibly having a negative impact on their work engagement. Our findings in Japan, however, were different. Japanese workers 2 ̆ 7 total MT usage (i. e., during office and non-office hours) had a positive impact on their work autonomy, which, in turn, led to greater work engagement. Emotional exhaustion was not related to MT usage. The findings from this study imply that MT can result in positive psychological experiences for employees and present some managerial implications for boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess the effects of Mindfulness Training (<b>MT)</b> on <b>employee</b> well-being. Mindfulness is the {{awareness}} of one’s thoughts, emotions, sensations, actions, and surroundings in the present moment. Methodology – We used pre-post training measures and a four week follow-up on a sample of 23 employees from a UK-based organization. The MT group (n= 12) received a weekly two-hour training over eight weeks whilst the control group (n= 11) received no training. Qualitative interviews (n= 36) were conducted with the MT group at 3 time points to further assess the subjective experiences of training participants. Findings – Compared to the control group, the MT group significantly increased their mindfulness skills including observing and acting with awareness. Scores on well-being i. e. satisfaction with life, hope, and anxiety also improved and were generally maintained at follow-up. Some improvements were seen in the control group too but there was a larger difference in change scores in the MT group on most variables. Qualitative data show additional benefits of MT such as improved concentration at work and better interpersonal relationships. More practice at home led to greater benefits suggesting a dose-response relationship between the amount of practice and substantial benefits. Research limitations/implications – Inviting participants to have a greater amount of practice between sessions may further increase the benefits of mindfulness. Future research should consider a longer follow-up period to further explore the sustainability of the training benefits. Originality/value – Employing a mixed method approach, this study showed that MT is a viable psychological intervention for enhancing employee well-bein...|$|R

This text may be printed {{and placed in the}} patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by <b>MTs</b> who are <b>employees</b> in a hospital or who work at home as telecommuting employees for the hospital; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a hospital, clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their database gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of allergies, and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate healthcare delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.|$|R

40|$|Zygosaccharomyces bailii is {{a common}} yeast in various food fermentations. Understanding the {{metabolic}} properties and genetic mechanisms of Z. bailii is important for its industrial applications. Fermentation characteristics of Z. bailii MT 15 from Chinese Maotai-flavor liquor fermentation were studied. Z. bailii MT 15 produced various flavor compounds, including 19 alcohols, six acids, three esters, three ketones, and two aldehydes. Moreover, production of acids and aldehydes were increased by 110 and 41 %, respectively, at 37 °C (the maximum temperature in liquor fermentation) compared with that at 30 °C, indicating its excellent flavor <b>productivity.</b> Z. bailii <b>MT</b> 15 is a diploid with genome size of 20. 19 Mb. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that 12 genes related to amino acid transport were significantly up-regulated (2. 41 - to 5. 11 -fold) at 37 °C. Moreover, genes ARO 8, ARO 9, and ALDH 4 involved in amino acid metabolism also showed higher expression levels (> 1. 71 -fold) at 37 °C. Increased substrate supply and a vigorous metabolism might be beneficial for the increased production of acids and aldehydes at 37 °C. This work revealed the potential contribution of Z. bailii to various flavor compounds in food fermentation, and produced insights into the metabolic mechanisms of Z. bailii in flavor production...|$|R
40|$|China's {{cultivated}} land has been undergoing dramatic changes {{along with its}} rapidly growing economy and population. The impacts of land use transformation on food production at the national scale, however, have been poorly understood {{due to the lack}} of detailed spatially explicit agricultural productivity information on cropland change and crop productivity. This study evaluates the effect of the cropland transformation on agricultural productivity by combining the land use data of China for the period of 1990 - 2000 from TM images and a satellite-based NPP (net primary production) model driven with NOAH/AVHRR data. The cropland area of China has a net increase of 2. 79 Mha in the study period, which causes a slightly increased agricultural <b>productivity</b> (6. 96 <b>Mt</b> C) at the national level. Although the newly {{cultivated land}}s compensated for the loss from urban expansion, but the contribution to production is insignificant because of the low productivity. The decrease in crop production resulting from urban expansion is about twice of that from abandonment of arable lands to forests and grasslands. The productivity of arable lands occupied by urban expansion was 80 % higher than that of the newly cultivated lands in the regions with unfavorable natural conditions. Significance of cropland transformation impacts is spatially diverse with the differences in land use change intensity and land productivity across China. The increase in arable land area and yet decline in land quality may reduce the production potential and sustainability of China's agro-ecosystems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} the recent calls for {{additional}} research {{in order to enhance}} the understanding of potential contingency factors which explain the adoption of management accounting practices (MAPs). This, allied to a lack of knowledge in relation to current use of MAPs, especially in developing countries, is the motivation for this research. Thus, this research attempts to explore the adoption and perceived benefit of MAPs as well as to examine their relationships with contingency factors affecting organizational performance in a developing country, Thailand. Two potential contingency factors are adopted for this research including a comprehensive set of strategic typologies and management techniques (MTs). Three forms of contingency fit, selection, interaction, and systems approaches, have been adopted in order to develop research questions and hypotheses. A triangulation approach combining a survey and interviews is used in this research. The questionnaire was delivered to 'accounting managers' of 451 companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). There were 135 returned and usable responses, resulting in 29. 9 percent response rate. Semi-structured interviews of seven companies provide qualitative findings, which are in line with, but explain further, those from the survey. The findings confirm the popularity of the use of, and high perceived benefit from, traditional MAPs and reveal disappointing adoption rates of, and relatively low perceived benefit from, contemporary MAPs. There are some alignments between MAPs and strategic typologies and between MTs and strategic typologies. However, only a few moderation effects are detected. In line with expectations, the companies under differentiation/ prospector/ entrepreneurial/ build strategies tend to have higher organizational performance when they obtain higher benefit from contemporary MAPs and <b>MTs</b> concerning quality, <b>employee</b> empowerment, customization and flexibility. It was also found that the companies pursuing cost leadership/ defender/ conservative/ harvest strategies tend to have higher performance when they obtain higher benefit from traditional MAPs and MTs relating to cost reduction processes. This study adds to the limited body of knowledge of MA in Asian countries, in particular Thailand. It represents a comprehensive survey and explanation of MAPs in Thailand. It is anticipated that this research will make academics and practitioners aware of the capability of alternative MAPs combined with the right match of MTs to improve firms' efficiency and effectiveness as well as its fit with the strategies. It is also expected that the findings of this research will provide valuable insights into the nature of MAPs, and assist the academics and practitioners in improving management accounting rules and practices in Thailand.
