40|$|The {{modified}} CG 2000 crystal grower construction, installation, {{and machine}} check out was completed. The process development check out proceeded with several dry runs and one growth run. Several machine calibrations and functional problems were discovered and corrected. Exhaust gas analysis system alternatives were evaluated and an integrated system approved and ordered.

50|$|The indri is a {{vertical}} clinger and leaper and thus holds its body upright when traveling through trees or resting in branches. It has long, muscular legs which it uses to propel itself from trunk to trunk. Its large greenish eyes and black face are framed by round, fuzzy ears that some say {{give it the}} appearance of a teddy bear. Unlike any other living lemur, the indri has only a rudimentary tail. The silky fur is mostly black with white patches along the limbs, <b>neck,</b> <b>crown,</b> and lower back. Different populations of the species show wide variations in color, with some northern populations consisting of mostly or entirely black individuals. The face is bare with pale black skin, and it is sometimes fringed with white fur.|$|R

50|$|Bonaparte's gulls begin {{breeding}} at {{two years}} of age; they {{are thought to be}} monogamous. The breeding season begins in mid-June. Courting pairs perform swooping display flights, calling loudly and diving at each other, and then drop down to perch on a branch. Crouched and facing each other, with <b>neck</b> and <b>crown</b> feathers erected and wings slightly raised, they scream at each other with bills opened wide, bobbing up and down as they do so. This display can continue for several minutes before ending abruptly; afterwards, the birds may sit quietly together for some time before separating again.|$|R

500|$|Johann Bayer {{used the}} Greek letters Alpha to Eta to label the most {{prominent}} eight stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Delta (named Delta1 and Delta2). John Flamsteed numbered fourteen stars, discerning a third star he named Delta3; his star 12 Canis Minoris was not found subsequently. In Bayer's 1603 work Uranometria, Procyon {{is located on the}} dog's belly, and Gomeisa on its neck. Gamma, Epsilon and Eta Canis Minoris lie nearby, marking the dog's <b>neck,</b> <b>crown</b> and chest respectively. Although it has an apparent magnitude of 4.34, Gamma Canis Minoris is an orange K-type giant of spectral class K3-III C, which lies [...] away. Its colour is obvious when seen through binoculars. It is a multiple system, consisting of the [...] spectroscopic binary Gamma A and three optical companions, Gamma B, magnitude 13; Gamma C, magnitude 12; and Gamma D, magnitude 10. The two components of Gamma A orbit each other every 389.2 days, with an eccentric orbit that takes their separation between 2.3 and 1.4 astronomical units (AU). Epsilon Canis Minoris is a yellow bright giant of spectral class G6.5IIb of magnitude of 4.99. It lies [...] from Earth, with 13 times the diameter and 750 times the luminosity of the Sun. Eta Canis Minoris is a giant of spectral class F0III of magnitude 5.24, which has a yellowish hue when viewed through binoculars as well as a faint companion of magnitude 11.1. Located 4 arcseconds from the primary, the companion star is actually around 440 AU from the main star and takes around 5000 years to orbit it.|$|R

50|$|Ranging from 30 to 36 cm in length, {{it is one}} of the {{smallest}} species of duck. It has a 48 to 60 cm wingspan. It has a small bill and compact form. The breeding male has a predominantly dark green back, <b>neck</b> and <b>crown,</b> white cheeks and dark green, pale grey and white scalloped underparts. The tail and primary flight feathers and primary coverts are black, while the secondary flight feathers are white. The secondary coverts are a dark iridescent green. This iridescence is lost outside of the breeding season and the plumage is duller. It exhibits sexual dimorphism, the female has a barred rather than green neck and otherwise resembles the non-breeding male. Immature birds are duller, and have mottled dark brown heads.|$|R

The male has a simple chattering song and the birds have various guttural flight and alarm calls.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a small}} {{species at}} 36 to 38 cm in length, with a short neck and longish bill. The male is uniformly dull yellow above and buff below.

In flight, from above it shows rufous-chestnut flight feathers and the rufous uppertail, and from below it has a grey body, white underwing coverts, and greyish flight feathers and undertail. The juvenile is duller and browner, with a brown-grey head and white supercilium.|$|R
5000|$|The Tibetan {{sandgrouse}} {{is about}} 30-41 cm long, with a small, pigeon-like head and neck, but sturdy compact body. It has long pointed wings and pin tail.

Male has unspotted buff wing while the female has barred wing coverts, upperparts and upper belly than the male. Juvenile lacks the tail pin, has narrower barrings and has less orange on the face. White belly and dark underwings are distinctions from the related Pallas's sandgrouse, with which its range overlaps. As with that species, its small feet lack a hind toe, {{and the three}} front toes are fused together. The upper surface is feathered, and the underneath has a fleshy pad.

50|$|Lightweight diving {{helmets and}} bandmasks usually use a demand {{controlled}} breathing gas supply {{as the standard}} mode, as it is more economical on gas consumption - the amount of gas supplied is the amount needed for the diver's respiratory requirements. However, {{there may be a}} freeflow valve to provide gas at a constant flow at a rate determined by the valve which is operated by the diver. One of the functions of freeflow supply is to defog the faceplate. Another is for breathing gas supply in case of demand valve malfunction, and a third is to assist with clearing water from a leaking helmet, or to prevent inflow through a leaking exhaust <b>port</b> or <b>neck</b> seal.The demand valve of a lightweight helmet can also freeflow for some of the same reasons as can happen with a scuba demand valve.|$|R

So now, while he, utterly taken aback, was staring at her open-mouthed and bewildered, she turned away, cold and full of disdain, gathering her draperies round her, and started to walk slowly toward the stairs.

40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is an {{inherited}} dental disease of enamel formation in humans, {{and there are}} various phenotypes due to the combi-nation of enamel quality and quantity. We encountered four female IGS rats with spontaneous AI including odontogenic cysts in the incisor teeth. Histopathologically, in the incisors of the rats, the enamel organ was disorganized with the remaining enamel matrix residing within the enamel space. The expanding cysts derived from the enamel organ were formed in the periosteal connective tissue on the labial side. At {{the bottom of the}} tooth germs, the precursor cells of the epithelial root sheath were arranged regularly and the enamel organs were preserved to the same degree as those of normal rats. In the molar teeth of the affected rats an enamel matrix remained on the <b>neck</b> and <b>crown</b> of the erupted teeth; however, no abnormality was observed at the tooth root.
