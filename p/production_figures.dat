5|$|Fluorite mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 {{million metric tons}} of ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production has since been increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of US$550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 <b>production</b> <b>figures</b> of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion. Froth flotation separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Official figures state 2,139 Do 17s {{were built}} on German {{assembly}} lines. At the Dornier factory at Oberpfaffenhofen, 328 Do 17Es were built {{along with a}} further 77 Do 17Fs and 200 Do 17M variants. Do 17Z <b>production</b> <b>figures</b> for Oberpfaffenhofen stand at 420. At Friedrichshafen, 84 Do 17Ks were built, {{some of which were}} sold to the Yugoslav Royal Air Force. Do 17P production was spread out over different factory lines. At Siebel/Halle, eight were built. At the Henschel factory at Berlin-Schönefeld 73 were constructed. At the HFB plant in Hamburg 149 were built. Henschel also produced some 320 Do 17Zs, HFB contributed to construction of 74 at its Hamburg plant, and another 73 were built at Siebel. Some 105 examples of the Dornier Do 215B was later built at Oberpfaffenhofen.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{local leaders}} were {{pressured}} into falsely reporting ever-higher grain <b>production</b> <b>figures</b> to their political superiors. Participants at political meetings remembered <b>production</b> <b>figures</b> being inflated up to 10 times actual production amounts as {{the race to}} please superiors and win plaudits—like the chance to meet Mao himself—intensified. The state was later able to force many production groups to sell more grain than they could spare based on these false <b>production</b> <b>figures.</b>|$|E

25|$|The T-34-85 {{gave the}} Red Army a tank with better armour and {{mobility}} than the German Panzer IV tank and StuG III assault gun. While {{it could not}} match the armour or weapons of the heavier Panther and Tiger tanks, its improved firepower made it much more effective than earlier models. In comparison with the T-34-85 program, the Germans instead chose an upgrade path based on the introduction of completely new, expensive, heavier, and more complex tanks, greatly slowing the growth of their tank production and aiding the Soviets in maintaining a substantial numerical superiority in tanks. By May 1944, T-34-85 production had reached 1,200 tanks per month. In the entire war, <b>production</b> <b>figures</b> for all Panther types reached no more than 6,557, and for all Tiger types 2,027. <b>Production</b> <b>figures</b> for the T-34-85 alone reached 22,559.|$|E

Because the first XIVs were converted from existing Mk VIII airframes the first true production serial No. is listed. Protracted development of the Mk 21 meant that this variant did not reach operational service until January 1945.|$|E
