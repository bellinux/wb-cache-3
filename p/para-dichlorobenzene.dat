40|$|Abstract – Bee {{products}} can be contaminated from different sources. The contamination can arise from beekeeping practices {{or from the}} environment. Environmental contaminants are covered {{in the first part}} of the review. They are: the heavy metals lead, cadmium and mercury, radioactive isotopes, organic pollutants, pesticides (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and bactericides), pathogenic bacteria and genetically modified organisms. The second part of the review discusses contaminants from beekeeping. The main ones are acaricides: lipophylic synthetic compounds and non-toxic substances such as organic acids and components of essential oils; and antibiotics used for the control of bee brood diseases, mainly tetracyclines, streptomycine, sulfonamides and chloramphenicol. Other substances used in beekeeping play a minor role: <b>para-dichlorobenzene,</b> used for the control of wax moth and chemical repellents.

Under such new conditions, the hydrodehalogenation of aromatic halides, even of sterically hindered ones, proceeds quickly at low temperatures (20 - 50 degrees C) and affords the corresponding non-halogenated hydrocarbons in substantially quantitative yields. The addition of a quaternary onium salt to the multiphase system may induce remarkable effects both in the enhancement of the reduction rate and in the regio- and chemo-selectivity of the reaction. For instance, when Aliquat 336 (tricaprylmethylammonium chloride) is used, the isomeric chloroethylbenzenes react 50 times faster, <b>para-dichlorobenzene</b> is reduced slower than the ortho isomer, and halogenated aromatic ketones can be effectively dehalogenated, without any reduction of the carbonyl group.

40|$|Abstract: Both {{the recent}} {{classification}} of naphthalene {{as a possible}} human carcinogen and its ubiquitous presence motivate this critical review of naphthalene’s sources and exposures. We evaluate the environmental literature on naphthalene published since 1990, drawing on nearly 150 studies that report emissions and concentrations in indoor, outdoor and personal air. While naphthalene is both a volatile organic compound and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, concentrations and exposures are poorly characterized relative to many other pollutants. Most airborne emissions result from combustion, and key sources include industry, open burning, tailpipe emissions, and cigarettes. The second largest source is off-gassing, specifically from naphthalene’s use as a deodorizer, repellent and fumigant. In the U.

40|$|In this thesis, we perform {{fundamental}} spectroscopic {{studies of}} organic fluorescent chromophores (dyes) for temperatures from 1 – 10 Kelvins. We use confocal and wide-field fluorescence microscopy techniques. We analyzed the spectroscopic properties of well-known dyes, such as perylene, terrylene and dibenzoterrylene embedded in different solids. By doing this systematically, we correlate {{the presence of}} methyl groups in the host-crystal (Chapter 2) with the strong spectral diffusion of the resonant line, which lead to spectral broadening and frequency instabilities of the guest DBT. In contrast, the absence or substitution of methyl groups by chloride showed any of these effects.

The aim of {{present study was to}} evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physical, thermal, and spectroscopic properties of p-dichlorobenzene. The p-dichlorobenzene sample was divided into two groups that served as treated and control. The treated group received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Subsequently the control and treated samples were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. XRD result showed an increase in crystallite size (4. 93 %) along with alteration in peak intensity of treated sample as compared to control. Furthermore, DSC analysis results showed that the latent heat of fusion of treated p-dichlorobenzene was considerably reduced by 8. 66 % as compared to control. The reduction I in melting point of treated sample (54. 99 °C) also observed as compared to control (57. 01 °C) p-dichlorobenzene. Moreover, TGA/DTG studies showed that Tmax (temperature, at which sample lost maximum of its weight) was increased by 6. 26 % and weight loss per degree celsius (°C) was decreased by 12. 77 % in biofield treated p-dichlorobenzene as compared to control sample. It indicates that thermal stability of treated p-dichlorobenzene sample might increase as compared to control sample. However, no change was found in UV-Vis spectroscopic character of treated p dichlorobenzene as compared to control. These findings suggest that biofield treatment has significantly altered the physical and thermal properties of p-dichlorobenzene, which could make it more useful as a chemical intermediate...|$|E

Mean levels of major aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons were higher indoor (platforms and mezzanines) than outdoor with average indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios of 1. 1 - 9. 5, whereas no significant indoor/outdoor differences were found except for benzene and TrCE. The highly significant mutual correlations (p 0. 01) for BTEX between indoor and outdoor and their significant correlation (p 0. 05) with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a marker of traffic-related emission without other indoor and outdoor sources, indicated that BTEX were introduced into the subway stations from indoor/outdoor air exchange and traffic emission should be their dominant source.

PPS {{can also be}} made containing branches (using a trifunctional monomer) and with crosslinked microstructure (when curing the monomer at high temperature {{in the presence of}} oxygen). PPS is made from the condensation reaction between <b>para-dichlorobenzene</b> and sodium sulfide with the assistance of a catalyst (to lower the activation barrier). The synthesis conditions for making PPS has evolved since its invention in the 1960 's to the optimal conditions developed by the Philips Corporation in the 1970 's. The resulting polymer consists of chemically stable molecular moieties such as benzene rings and ether like sulfur linkages between the aromatic rings. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) is extremely resistant to gamma irradiation, caustic solution, and dilute nitric acid. PPS is the material of construction for the coalescers used in the Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU).

40|$|Background: Limited {{data are}} {{available}} to assess human exposure to thousands of chemicals currently in commerce. Information that relates human intake of a chemical to its production and use can help inform understanding of mechanisms and pathways that control exposure and support efforts to protect public health. Objectives: We introduce the intake-to-production ratio (IPR) as an economy-wide quantitative indicator {{of the extent to}} which chemical production results in human exposure. Methods: The IPR was evaluated as the ratio of two terms: aggregate rate of chemical uptake in a human population (inferred from urinary excretion data) divided by the rate that chemical is produced in or imported into that population's economy. We used biomonitoring data from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with chemical manufacturing data reported by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other published data, to estimate the IPR for nine chemicals in the United States. Results are reported in units of parts per million, where 1 ppm indicates 1 g of chemical uptake for every million grams of economy-wide use. Results: Estimated IPR values for the studied compounds span many orders of magnitude from a low of 0. 6 ppm for bisphenol A to a high of > 180, 000 ppm for methyl paraben. Intermediate results were obtained for five phthalates and two chlorinated aromatic compounds: 120 ppm for butyl benzyl phthalate, 670 ppm for di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, 760 ppm for di(n-butyl) phthalate, 1, 040 ppm for <b>para-dichlorobenzene,</b> 6, 800 ppm for di(isobutyl) phthalate, 7, 700 ppm for diethyl phthalate, and 8, 000 - 24, 000 ppm (range) for triclosan.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. 					 This thesis concerns the attempted synthesis of two strained nonbenzenoid, conjugated bicyclic systems, 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene (butalene or para-benzyne, 28) and the 1, 4 -dehydrotropylium ion (30 c). Both 28 a and 30 c contain a fused cyclobutadiene ring with [ [...] . ] its accompanying antiaromaticity but overall possess 4 n+ 2 [pi] electrons. The concept of nonbenzenoid aromaticity {{as it applies}} to compounds such as these is reviewed. The synthetic approach to 28 and 30 systems is based on the pyrolytic cyclization of a 1, 5 -hexadiyne moiety to form a dimethylenecyclobutene, thereby introducing the strain and unsaturation of the fused four-membered ring in one step. In Part I, the synthesis and pyrolysis of cis- 1, 6 -dideutero- 1, 5 -hexadiyn- 3 -ene (cis- 60 a) is described. By a combination of nmr and ms techniques, it is demonstrated that cis- 60 a undergoes a degenerate rearrangement at 200 ?C in the gas phase at atmospheric pressure, interconverting cis- 60 a with its 3, 4 -dideuteroisomer cis- 60 b with an equilibration half-life of 30 sec. None of the single exchange isomer cis- 60 c or any trans- 60 was formed in this pyrolysis. These data require a transition state or intermediate between cis- 60 a and cis- 60 b with [ [...] . ] symmetry, i. e., [ [...] . ] 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene. Similarly prepared trans- 60 a did not undergo isomerization or rearrangement at these temperatures. Pyrolysis of cis- and trans- 60 in solution provided a high yield of benzene in the presence of hydrogen donors at the expense of cis- 60. In carbon tetrachloride, <b>para-dichlorobenzene</b> was the major product. In methanol, a 10 % yield of benzyl alcohol but no anisole was formed. Since these are typical products of radical abstraction, it is suggested that the symmetrical species implicated in the deuterium scrambling is a true intermediate and of 1, 4 -benzenediyl structure 28 d or e (instead of 28 a). [ [...] . ]. While traces of benzene were seen in the atmospheric and vacuum pyrolysis of cis- and trans- 60, no satisfactory gas phase trapping experiment has been performed. Neither have substantial levels of deuterium scrambling been demonstrated in liquid phase pyrolysis. These points together with some indication of the stereospecificity of the benzene forming reaction in solution remain to be answered. The added complication of a possible triplet ground state for the 1, 4 -benzenediyl (28 d) must also be resolved before a truly consistent story can be told. A possible direct route to a triplet 28 d, photosensitized irradiation of cis- 60 a, failed to produce scrambling in competition with a demonstrated approach to the photostationary state. No transfer of acetylenic label was observed also under direct (254 nm) irradiation of cis- 60 a. In Part II, toward formation of the 1, 4 -dehydrotropylium ion (30 c) as well as the 1, 4 -dehydrotropyl anion (30 a) and the bicyclo [3. 2. 0]heptatrien- 3 -one (52), the synthesis of [ [...] . ] bicyclo[3. 2. 0]hepta- 1, 4, 6 -trienes substituted in the 3 -position is discussed. The required 3 -substituted 1, 2 -diethynylcyclopropanes were approached via carbene addition to hexadiynenes, eneynes, and via y-elimination routes. Of these, only the addition of propargyl carbene to methoxybuten- 3 -yne (150) provided any cyclopropane product. The 3 -methoxy- 1, 2 -diethynylcyclopropane (61 d) [ [...] . ] prepared in < 1 % isolated yield by this method readily isomerized to the air sensitive 3 -methoxybicyclo[3. 2. 0]hepta- 1, 4, 6 -triene (62 d) upon pyrolysis under atmospheric pressure flow conditions at 305 ?C (contact time 10 sec). Attempted formation of 30 a by ether cleavage reduction of 62 d with potassium led only to polymer without any evidence for formation of an anion. However, treatment of 62 d with SbF 5 containing a catalytic amount of HOSO 2 F in a soft matrix at - 180 ?C gave evidence in the nmr of formation of 30 c although at such low concentrations that a clear spectrum was not obtained. This interesting result is currently under reinvestigation...|$|E
