50|$|Sinusoidal {{capillaries}} (also {{known as}} a discontinuous capillary) are a special type of open-pore capillary, that have larger openings (30-40 µm in diameter) in the endothelium. These types of blood vessels allow red and white blood cells (7.5 µm - 25 µm diameter) and various serum proteins to <b>pass,</b> <b>aided</b> by a discontinuous basal lamina. These capillaries lack pinocytotic vesicles, and therefore utilize gaps present in cell junctions to permit transfer between endothelial cells, and hence across the membrane. Sinusoid blood vessels are primarily located in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and adrenal glands. Some sinusoids are distinctive in {{that they do not}} have the tight junctions between cells. They are called discontinuous sinusoidal capillaries, and are present in the liver and spleen, where greater movement of cells and materials is necessary.A capillary wall is only 1 cell thick and is simple squamous epithelium.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Low-complexity near-optimal {{detection}} of signals in MIMO systems with large number (tens) of antennas is getting increased attention. In this paper, first, we propose {{a variant of}} Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm which i) alleviates the stalling problem encountered in conventional MCMC algorithm at high SNRs, and ii) achieves near-optimal performance for large number of antennas (e. g., 16 × 16, 32 × 32, 64 × 64 MIMO) with 4 -QAM. We call this proposed algorithm as randomized MCMC (R-MCMC) algorithm. Second, we propose another algorithm based on a random selection approach to choose candidate vectors to be tested in a local neighborhood search. This algorithm, which we call as randomized search (RS) algorithm, also achieves near-optimal performance for large number of antennas with 4 -QAM. The complexities of the proposed R-MCMC and RS algorithms are quadratic/sub-quadratic in number of transmit antennas, which are attractive for detection in large-MIMO systems. We also propose message <b>passing</b> <b>aided</b> R-MCMC and RS algorithms, which are shown to perform well for higher-order QAM...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{deformation}} twinning in {{the texture}} evolution of pure polycrystalline silver subjected to equal channel angular extrusion (Route A, three passes) has been examined. Microstructural characterization using electron backscattering diffraction and {{transmission electron microscopy}} revealed high twinning activity in every pass, as well as significant grain refinement. Polycrystal modelling combined with experimental analysis shows that texture evolution {{is a result of}} slip and deformation twinning that occurs in every pass. It is shown that the primary consequence of twinning is the reorientation of the $A_ 1 $ ideal component into the $A_ 2 $ orientation. This process results in a weak $A_ 1 $ and a strong $A_ 2 $ component. This twinning mechanism is repeated in each <b>pass</b> <b>aided</b> by the strain path changes associated with Route $A$ and an apparent regeneration of the microstructure. As a result, with each pass the $A_ 1 $ and C ideal shear components weaken, whereas the B/B components strengthen, tendencies that are distinct from those of high stacking fault fcc metals like Al, Cu and Ni...|$|R
