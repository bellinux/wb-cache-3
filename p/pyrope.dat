40|$|Mineral {{data from}} Yakutian kimberlites allow {{reconstruction}} {{of the history of}} lithospheric mantle. Differences occur in compositions of mantle <b>pyropes</b> and clinopyroxenes from large kimberlite pipes in the Alakit and Daldyn fields. In the Alakit field, Cr-diopsides are alkaline, and Stykanskaya and some other pipes contain more sub-calcic <b>pyropes</b> and dunitic-type diamond inclusions, while in the Daldyn field harzburgitic <b>pyropes</b> are frequent. The eclogitic diamond inclusions in the Alakit field are sharply divided in types and conditions, while in the Daldyn field they show varying compositions and often continuous Pressure–Temperature (P–T) ranges with increasing Fe# with decreasing pressures. In Alakit, Cr-pargasites to richterites were found in all pipes, while in Daldyn, pargasites are rare Dalnyaya and Zarnitsa pipes. Cr-diopsides from the Alakit region show higher levels of light Rare Earth Elements (LREE) and stronger REE-slopes, and enrichment in light Rare Earth Elements (LREE), sometimes Th-U, and small troughs in Nb-Ta-Zr. In the Daldyn field, the High Field Strength Elements HFSE troughs are more common in clinopyroxenes with low REE abundances, while those from sheared and refertilized peridotites have smooth patterns. Garnets from Alakit show HREE minima, but those from Daldyn often have a trough at Y and high U and Pb. PTXfO 2 diagrams from both regions show similarities, suggesting similar layering and structures. The degree of metasomatism is often higher for pipes which show dispersion in P–Fe# trends for garnets. In the mantle beneath Udachnaya and Aykhal, pipes show 6 – 7 linear arrays of P–Fe# in {{the lower part of the}} mantle section at 7. 5 – 3. 0  GPa, probably reflecting primary subduction horizons. Beneath the Sytykanskaya pipe, there are several horizons with opposite inclinations which reflect metasomatic processes. The high dispersion of the P–Fe# trend indicating widespread metasomatism is associated with decreased diamond grades. Possible explanation of the differences in mineralogy and geochemistry of the mantle sections may relate to their tectonic positions during growth of the lithospheric keel. Enrichment in volatiles and alkalis possibly corresponds to interaction with subduction-related fluids and melts in the craton margins. Incorporation of island arc peridotites from an eroded arc is a possible scenario...|$|R
40|$|Titanium-rich clinohumite and layered {{structure}} minerals are observed in kimberlite and as inclusions in pyropic garnets from the Moses Rock dike, a kimberlite-bearing breccia dike in San Juan County, Utah. Associated clinopyroxenes observed as inclusions within similar <b>pyropes</b> {{and also in}} kimberlite are estimated to have equilibrated at depths ranging from about 50 to 150 km at modest temperatures, generally less than 1000 °C. The presence of titanoclinohumite, a high-density hydrous phase, is of considerable interest as a possible site for volatiles in the earth's upper mantle. The dehydration of hydrous phases such as titanoclinohumite within the upper mantle (1) may provide water as a free phase, (2) could be important in the genesis of kimberlite and alkali-basalt magma, and (3) may be one means of producing a low-velocity zone in the upper mantle...|$|R

In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as tephroite, Mn2SiO4. The garnet group has a general formula of X3Y2(SiO4)3, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group.

40|$|Peridotitic garnet and clinopyroxene xenocrysts {{from the}} 1. 2 Ga Lentiira–Kuhmo and the 760 Ma Kuusamo {{kimberlite}} fields, emplaced within the Central Karelian Craton, {{have been studied}} using major and trace element geochemistry to obtain information on the stratigraphy,compositional variability, and evolutionary history of the underlying lithospheric mantle. An earlier study on the 600 Ma Kaavi–Kuopio kimberlite field showed that near the SW margin of the craton the 230 -km-thick subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) exhibitsa well-developed 3 -layer structure indicative of episodic construction. New Ni in garnet thermometry on samples farther into the craton, from Kuhmo, Lentiira, and southern and northern Kuusamo, gives temperature ranges of 800 – 1400, 700 – 1450, 700 – 1450 and 600 – 1300 °C, respectively, and when extrapolated to the geotherm determined for the Kaavi-Kuopio area, indicates sampling intervals of c. 100 – 240, 80 – 250, 80 – 250 and 65 – 210 km, respectively. The results demonstrate that the SCLM of the Karelian Craton reaches itsgreatest thickness in the Lentiira-Kuhmo and southern Kuusamo area and thins towards the North and South. The mantle stratigraphy of the craton core, compared to the craton edge, shows less compositional variation, with only two distinguishable horizons correspondinggenerally to the two deepest layers at Kaavi-Kuopio. Additionally, based on the Mg# of <b>pyropes,</b> the level of depletion of peridotites comprising the mantle lithosphere in the central craton is significantly higher than at the craton edge represented by Kaavi-Kuopio.

40|$|Mineralogical {{studies and}} U–Pb dating {{have been carried}} out on rutile {{included}} in peridotitic and eclogitic garnets from the Internatsionalnaya pipe, Mirny field, Siberian craton. We also describe a unique peridotitic paragenesis (rutile + forsterite + enstatite + Cr-diopside + Cr-pyrope) preserved in diamond from the Mir pipe, Mirny field. Compositions of rutile from the heavy mineral concentrates of the Internatsionalnaya pipe and rutile inclusions in crustal almandine-rich garnets from the Mayskaya pipe (Nakyn field), as well as from a range of different lithologies, are presented for comparison. Rutile from cratonic mantle peridotites shows characteristic enrichment in Cr, in contrast to lower-Cr rutile from crustal rocks and off-craton mantle. Rutile with Cr₂O₃ > 1. 7 wt% is commonly derived from cratonic mantle, while rutiles with lower Cr₂O₃ may be both of cratonic and off-cratonic origin. New analytical developments and availability of standards have made rutile accessible to in situ U–Pb dating by laser ablation ICP-MS. A U–Pb age of 369 ± 10 Ma for 9 rutile grains in 6 garnets from the Internatsionalnaya pipe is consistent with the accepted eruption age of the pipe (360 Ma). The equilibrium temperatures of <b>pyropes</b> with rutile inclusions calculated using Ni-in-Gar thermometer range between ~ 725 and 1030 °C, corresponding to a depth range of ca ~ 100 – 165 km. At the time of entrainment in the kimberlite, garnets with Cr-rich rutile inclusions resided at temperatures well above the closure temperature for Pb in rutile, and thus U–Pb ages on mantle-derived rutile most likely record the emplacement age of the kimberlites.

40|$|Archean cratons are {{underlain}} by highly depleted subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). However, xenolith and xenocryst data [1; references therein] {{suggest that}} Archean SCLM {{has been extensively}} refertilized by metasomatic processes, {{with the addition of}} Fe, Ca, and Al to depleted protoliths. The distribution of sub-calcic garnets in the SCLM beneath the Siberian craton suggests (1) sub-calcic garnets and diamonds are metasomatic phases in the cratonic SCLM; (2) the distribution of both phases is laterally heterogeneous on relatively small scales and related to ancient structural controls [2]. Re-Os isotopic compositions of sulfide inclusions in lherzolitic Cr-pyropes from four Siberian middle Paleozoic diamond mines have been determined by laser ablation MC-ICP-MS: Mir (n= 17) and Internationalnaya (n= 109), Malobotuobiya field, Udachnaya (n= 17), Daldyn field, and Nyurbinskaya (n= 12), Nakyn field. Most analysed sulfides (approximately 84 %) have very low Re/Os ratios (< 0. 07), and their Re-depletion ages (T (sub RD)) fall between 2. 2 and 3. 0 Ga (+ or - 0. 03 Ga, mean 2 s analytical uncertainty). 10 to 15 % of the sulfides give younger T (sub RD) down to 600 Ma. Our previous study [3] of sulfide inclusions in megacrystic olivines from the Udachnaya pipe suggests that most of the SCLM beneath the Daldyn kimberlite field formed at 3 - 3. 5 Ga, and that lithosphere formation culminated at ca 2. 9 Ga.

PT estimates for <b>pyropes,</b> Cr-diopsides and picroilmenites reveal similar geothermal conditions of 37 - 40 mW/m 2. This is slightly higher than the values determined for the Catoca pipe. Higher temperature conditions 45 mW/m 2 were determined for low-Cr pyroxenes and omphacites. The similar general mineralogy and suggested mantle lithology, as well as reconstructed layering of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), are similar for Camitongo I-II {{as well as for}} Caquele and Catoca pipes. Heating at depths of 7. 5 - 4. 5 GPa (240 - 140 km) is a general feature of the SCLM beneath the field. The high temperature trend for low-Cr and hybrid pyroxenes {{from the base of the}} SCLM up to 30 GPa (100 km) represents the PT path of the protokimberlite melts. PT conditions for ilmenites mainly correspond to colder conditions of crystallization in wall rocks and the outer parts of magmatic channels. Individual geochemical features of the minerals for each SCLM suggest pervasive metasomatism in lower part of the SCLM. Clinopyroxene trace element patterns from the Caquele pipe reveal a lherzolitic affinity; they are LILE-enriched with Ba peaks due to phlogopite melting, while those from Camitongo I-II show Ta-Nb enrichment and Pb troughs. The ilmenite trends trace the mantle column from deep to shallow mantle, evolving to Fe-ilmenites due to advanced AFC of protokimberlite magma that also produced abundant Fe-rich clinopyroxenes. The rise of calculated fO 2 correlates with the position of protokimberlites.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The Moses Rock dike is a well-exposed, four-mile long, kimberlite-bearing breccia intrusion {{in the east}} central Colorado Plateau, one of eight known kimberlite-bearing diatremes in the province. The dike occurs in gently dipping beds of the Permian Cutler Formation, 2 {{miles west of the}} Comb Ridge monocline in eastern Monument Valley, Utah. Contacts are little altered and the wall rocks generally undeformed. The present erosion surface is probably about 5, 000 feet below the surface at the time of emplacement. By volume, the breccia in the dike consists of Cutler formation blocks, 72 %; limestone fragments from underlying Paleozoic formations, 13 %; crystalline rock fragments, 3 %;and kimberlite, 12 %. Essentially undiluted kimberlite occurs only locally, and occupies only about l% of the exposed parts of the dike. Mineral constituents of kimberlite are generally dispersed through the unconsolidated breccias. The breccias, including kimberlite, were probably emplaced as a fluidized solid-volatile system. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (1) No silicate melt was intruded at the level present erosion surface, (2) the breccias are particulate on all scales, (3) the particle size frequency distributions of the breccias are like those produced in comminution processes, (4) different types of breccias are intricately mixed, and (5) the mineral constituents of the kimberlite are commonly highly diluted with rock debris. Relationships of the breccia units suggests that flow of the fluidized system was concentrated in channels, now occupied by breccias that contain the largest upward displaced fragments and the largest crystalline rock fragments. Apparently the dike was emplaced along a fissure on which channels soon developed. A local joint system parallel to the contact, which cross-cuts regional joints, apparently {{played a key role in}} the dike formation and brecciation process. Crystalline rock and mineral fragments found in the dike range from acid to ultramafic types and are believed to represent rocks derived from the vent walls during the eruption. On the basis of the relative size and abundance of the xenoliths, it is inferred that metabasalt, granite and granite gneiss are abundant in the upper part of the crust, along the dikewalls; diorite, gabbro, mafic amphibolite constitute intermediate crystal layers; and mafic granulite and possibly hydrated ultramafic rocks constitute the lower crust. The suite of presumed crustal rocks is predominantly metavolcanic or metaplutonic, not metasedimentary. Dense and ultramafic fragments possibly derived from the mantle include antigorite-tremolite schist, jadeite-rich clinopyroxenite, eclogite, spinel-websterite, and spinel-lherzolite. The presence of garnet-periodotite at depth is inferred from the suite of mineral inclusions observed within pyropic garnets. Kimberlite of the Moses Rock dike is believed to be derived mechanically from physically disaggregated spinel and garnet peridotite in the mantle. All other rocks are believed to be accidental inclusions from the vent walls. Tentative P-T assignments to kimberlite clinopyroxenes based on their compositions suggests they are derived from various depths ranging from 50 to about 150 kilometers where the indicated temperatures are modest, about [ [...] . ] C. Titanoclinohumite observed in kimberlite and as inclusions in <b>pyropes</b> may contain most of the water in the upper mantle. The Mohorovicic discontinuity apparently occurs in a petrologically complex region and may coincide with phase and compositional transitions, including hydration. A compositional transition between spinel and garnet periodotite with increasing depth in the mantle is consistent with the observations. The variety of ultramafic types and the complexity of the textures in the xenoliths suggest the mantle may be as complicated as the crust in composition and history. Numerical hydrodynamic models of eruption show that flow velocities are probably controlled by viscous losses and expansion of a volatile phase near the surface. Field observations of the largest blocks transported upward in the dike suggest flow velocities of 10 to 50 m/sec at the level of the present surface. Upward extrapolation by use of theoretical models suggests velocities of about 400 m/sec for the erupting fluidized system as it reached the earth's surface. The Moses Rock dike probably formed by eruption of kimberlite from a large reservoir in the mantle. The eruption was driven by volatiles, apparently mostly [ [...] . ].
