50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{its life}} hot metal {{composition}} in newspapers was kept alive by the <b>proof</b> <b>press.</b> As each page was set and locked up, it was moved on a turtle (a rolling table with an accurately flat steel surface) to the manual <b>proof</b> <b>press</b> where it was hand inked and a single very high quality proof was pulled. This proof could then be photographed and converted to a negative.|$|E
50|$|Prices for {{the early}} model rocker presses were from US$140 to $175 {{depending}} on the size. Forty years later the model 0 <b>proof</b> <b>press</b> was still only $175. Other prices in 1955 were: $1965 for a model 4 and $23,650 for a model 604. In 1958, The Universal I cost $2150.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{letterpress}} <b>proof</b> <b>presses,</b> Vandercook {{also made}} offset <b>proof</b> <b>presses.</b> The flat bed presses were the model 20-26 (wet) and 15-20 (dry). In 1968, {{they came out}} with model RO4-29. This unique 4 color model was an offset <b>proofing</b> <b>press</b> that featured a common impression cylinder surrounded by the 4 printing units. This press was capable of running 1500 sheets per hour and automatically producing progressive proofs. They also made 4 color letterpress wet proof presses; model 604 which was brought out in 1947 and 10 years later replaced by model 30-26 which was made until 1972.|$|R

50|$|In September 1909, Robert Vandercook founded Vandercook & Sons in Chicago, Illinois. The first {{press was}} a “rocker” <b>proof</b> <b>press,</b> {{made with a}} geared cylinder. Before the {{development}} of this press, all proofs were either made on a roller press, which depended on gravity for impression or on a Washington Hand Press.|$|E
50|$|Vandercook & Sons was a {{manufacturer}} of proof presses, founded in 1909 by Robert Vandercook. They dominated the 20th century <b>proof</b> <b>press</b> industry by developing {{the first and the}} most widely used proof presses that did not rely on gravity for the force of their impression. As a result, Vandercook's geared presses were easier and more precise for an operator to use.|$|E
50|$|Before {{beginning}} {{her career}} as a full-time artist, Azarian taught in a one-room schoolhouse for three years. After she finished her three years of teaching, she decided she wanted to make a living selling woodcut prints. She began producing her prints by hand and in black and white. Eventually, she began adding color to her prints by hand. Finally, she found an old Vandercook <b>proof</b> <b>press</b> and began using it to produce the prints.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to evening courses and daytime workshops in the marketing communications field, SVC {{also has the}} largest public letterpress printing teaching shops in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. The school {{offers a variety of}} letterpress classes, giving students access to three Vandercook flatbed <b>proofing</b> <b>presses,</b> three clamshell platen presses, and a completely restored Reliance iron hand press.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Color {{matching}} between <b>proofs</b> and <b>press</b> sheets has {{not been}} a trivial task. Differences in colorants, solid ink density, and dot gain between hard copy output devices are some of the reasons that <b>proofs</b> and <b>press</b> sheets don’t match. The Inter-national Color Consortium (ICC) has developed a system-level color management tool which is aimed at improving color rendering between various imaging devices. In this paper, the ICC-based color matching experiments were performed {{with the use of a}} four-color sheet-fed offset press, a film-based color proofer, and a thermal dye transfer process. Specifically, we investigated if ICC-based CMS can help an analog color proofer and a continuous-tone digital color proofer improve its color matching to a reference press sheet. Experimental findings based on observer analysis using rank ordering, and colorimetric analysis between <b>proofs</b> and <b>press</b> sheets were discussed...|$|R
50|$|In 2011 John Bonadies and Jeff Adams {{created a}} virtual {{letterpress}} {{that runs on}} an iPad (and later the Mac) and replicates {{each step of the}} letterpress process. LetterMpress was funded from a Kickstarter campaign enabling the developers to collect and digitize wood type from around the world. The app's press is modeled after a Vandercook SP-15 (considered to be a top-of-the-line <b>proof</b> <b>press</b> in its time, and coveted by artists and designers today).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, graphic {{designer}} Lance Kagey {{was introduced to the}} art of letterpress printing through a visit to a British Columbia studio and through a program at Seattle's School of Visual Concepts. Kagey purchased a circa-1950's Challenge <b>proof</b> <b>press</b> through eBay for $50. After paying more than 12 times that amount in shipping and after months of self-education and experimentation, Kagey and copywriter and author Tom Llewellyn began producing posters.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the first}} days of Johannes Gutenberg, {{proofing}} has just been <b>press</b> <b>proofs</b> - one makes a short run on the press in order to verify {{what is to be done}} on a production run. As technology evolved to lower the per-copy cost of a printing job, the cost of starting a production run continued to rise. Today, it can be very costly to start up a production press, and thus it is cost-prohibitive to run a <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b> While some people may think a <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> is the ultimate proof quality, this is not necessarily so, especially if the production run is done days or weeks later when press conditions may have changed, or the production run is done on a different press than the <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b>|$|R
40|$|Halftone gravure {{has become}} the {{accepted}} front end imaging procedure for the publication gravure industry. Halftone gravure refers to using screened or halftone film when imaging a gravure cylinder. This procedure has allowed the publication gravure industry {{to benefit from the}} prepress advantages of offset printing. Therefore, the possibilities of an allowable color tolerance between a halftone gravure print and a SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> in hue, saturation, and brightness needed to be studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether an allowable color tolerance could be achieved between the gravure production print and the SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b> The experimental design involved the research of the effects of clear extender varnish modifications of gravure inks used to produce an allowable color tolerance between a gravure print and a SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b> It was important to compare the gravure print to the SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> because the publication gravure industry recognized the SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> as the standard or control parameter.

RBS's printing-house comprises 200 cases of printing type (including the 48-case Annenberg collection of wood type), a small Brand etching press, and various pieces of hand bookbinding equipment.|$|E
50|$|To produce prints, {{the plate}} is {{dampened}} with a glycerine/water mixture which is slightly acidic, then blotted before inking with collotype ink using a leather or velvet roller. A hard finished paper such as Bristol is then put {{on top of}} the plate and covered with a tympan before being printed typically using a hand <b>proof</b> <b>press.</b> Collotypes are printed using less pressure than is used in printing intaglio or stone lithography. While it is possible to print by hand using a roller or brayer, an acceptable consistency of pressure and even distribution of ink is most effectively achieved using a press.|$|E

50|$|The couple {{moved back}} to New York in 1920, where Leslie was {{employed}} by the McGraw Hill Company as the first industrial doctor in the city. At McGraw Hill, he met Sol Cantor, a printer for the Carey Printing Company. The men became business partners, forming The Composing Room, Inc. in 1927. The Composing Room employed advanced type-setting methods that boasted quick turnarounds and high-quality work for high-circulation magazines including Vogue, Vanity Fair, and House and Garden. The Composing Room worked directly with font foundries like Linotype and encouraged ligatures to be created for bad letter combinations. It was the first typography house {{to be able to}} produce a range of font sizes (5-144pt) at all times; a <b>proofing</b> <b>press</b> for transparencies; and the first to install the All-Purpose-Linotype (APL) machines.|$|R
50|$|In White’s day, the {{newspaper}} was printed by the hot lead method. Type {{was set on}} a linotype using molten lead or by hand from cases full of individual letters. Illustrations for ads were poured using mats as molds. This continued for over fifty years, {{with the addition of}} an engraver for photographs, until Dick David bought electronic type-setting equipment that allowed {{the newspaper}} to be printed by the offset method. The equipment was updated, and a darkroom installed, carrying the newspaper into the 1980s when the Ajo Copper News finally entered the era of typesetting on computers. Some of the old type cases and a <b>proof</b> <b>press</b> can be seen at the Ajo Historical Society Museum.|$|E
5000|$|The flatbed E model {{bidirectional}} web fed press {{which used}} the type directly was replaced {{about a decade}} later by a Goss Suburban web fed offset press of six units, two stacked (total of 4) and two additional inline. The page makeup was still hot metal as before. But each page was now pulled on a hand operated <b>proof</b> <b>press.</b> The photo areas were masked out with black paper and this was photographed on a large Litho camera to produce a tabloid size page negative for each page. The photos were processed separately and pasted into the [...] "windows" [...] produced by the black rectangles on the proof pages. These page negatives were then burned in pairs onto hand sensitized aluminum plates with an arc exposure unit and hand developed and mounted on the offset press units. A typical press run for the 14,000 or so copies printed was 40 minutes. For many years it continued in this hybrid mode using a backshop staffed by trained journalism students working as paid student labor {{under the direction of}} a professional backshop supervisor and offset pressmen. As a tabloid the six units could print 48 tabloid pages which was almost more than its quarter folder could handle. Typically this press ran 12 to 32 tabloid pages daily, 16 pages or 24 pages being favored sizes, a much more comfortable size for the folder. It could register and print full page process color with high quality and did on occasion, using the two stacked units. The backshop and offset press occupied a large area {{on the north side of}} the first floor of Copeland Hall.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to quantitatively analyze off-press color {{proofing}} methods for advertising material appearing in halftone publication gravure printing. This type of proofing has been an area of debate for the publications industry, especially in reference to the print quality of advertising material. The correlation between dot gain characteristics and the resulting color differences of off-press color proofing methods has been the center of greatest controversy. This paper has tested to determine if a correlation exists between dot gain characteristics and the resulting colorimetric-matching ability for color proofing methods used in halftone publication gravure. The variable dot-gain feature of an electrophotographic proofing system was tested to determine if this feature improved the color matching ability of the off-press proof to the SWOP offset <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b> This system was analyzed by its 2 ̆ 7 ability to objectively match the SWOP offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> for dot gain aimpoints. These aimpoints are used as the quality control tool for advertising material appearing in both halftone gravure and web offset publications printing. The experiment concluded that the dot gain characteristic curve of the electrophotographic off-press proof could be altered to quantitatively match closer to the dot gain of an offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> printed to SWOP/GAA Specifications. However, the data did not completely support the authors 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis. A direct correlation between dot gain and the resulting delta E values could not be established. None of the data collected from the electrophotographic test sets completely proved that a change in dot gain produced a closer colorimetric match to the SWOP/GAA Offset <b>Press</b> <b>Proof...</b>|$|R
