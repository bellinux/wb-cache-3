5|$|Eventually she {{expanded}} beyond make-up artistry to {{body painting}} {{to express her}} own artistic vision. In August 1991, Demi Moore caused international artistic commotion by appearing {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue in the photo More Demi Moore, with Gair as the make-up artist and Annie Leibovitz as the photographer. Exactly one year later, she returned to the cover of the same magazine nude as a product of Gair and Leibovitz in a nearly equally as shocking body painting, Demi's Birthday Suit (pictured right). Gair was the <b>primary</b> <b>body</b> painter of this art and the magazine cover art propelled Gair to fame. Fifteen years later, it continues to be considered the most well-known example of modern body painting. The 1992 cover that entailed a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. The shooting was storied because photographer Annie Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses. The pop culture attention given to Gair and her body painting led Absolut Vodka to consider an Absolut Gair body painting promotion in 1993.|$|E

The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a Helicarrier with Maria Hill, James Rhodes and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate civilians.

40|$|The photo-gravitational {{problems}} {{of two or}} more bodies have attracted much attention during the last decades. In this paper, radiation is considered as an additional factor influencing the particle motion in a regular polygon formation of N big bodies where the v = N - 1 <b>primary</b> <b>bodies</b> have equal masses and are located at the vertices of a regular polygon and the Nth primary has different mass and is located at the mass center of the system. We assume that some or all the <b>primary</b> <b>bodies</b> are radiation sources and we numerically explore various cases where symmetry of the resultant force field with respect to the same axis is preserved. For the purposes of our investigation we adopt Radzievski's theory and assumptions. The material gathered helps us to estimate the radiation effect on the evolution of periodic orbits and their characteristics, such as their periods and their stability.

2500|$|The {{conservation}} of angular momentum {{is used in}} analyzing central force motion.

This is the case with gravitational attraction in the orbits of planets and satellites, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the <b>primary</b> <b>body</b> and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the Bohr model of the atom.|$|E

Removal of the embedding methacrylate from relatively thick sections permitted {{large numbers of}} viral particles to be seen but caused extensive alteration of cellular components as well as variable distortion of viral structure.

The nuclei of infected cells contained small, dense, <b>primary</b> <b>bodies</b> (30 to 40 mµ in diameter) as well as slightly larger and less dense particles (40 to 50 mµ in diameter) surrounded by a single membrane (70 to 100 mµ in diameter).
