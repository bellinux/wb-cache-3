2500|$|The dime {{novel is}} a form of late 19th-century and early 20th-century U.S. popular fiction issued in series of {{inexpensive}} <b>paperbound</b> editions. The term dime novel {{has been used as a}} catchall term for several different but related forms, referring to dime novels, story papers, five- and ten-cent weeklies, [...] "thick book" [...] reprints, and sometimes early pulp magazines.

Dime novels are the antecedent of today's mass-market paperbacks, comic books, television shows and movies based on dime-novel genres. In the modern age, the term dime novel has been used to refer to quickly written, lurid potboilers, usually as a pejorative to describe a sensationalized but superficial literary work.|$|E
