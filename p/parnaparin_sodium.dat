40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{administration}} of <b>parnaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> as oral colon-release tablets (CB- 01 - 05 MMX) {{has been proposed}} as a novel approach {{for the treatment of}} ulcerative colitis (UC). AIM: To assess the efficacy and the tolerability of 8 weeks' oral daily {{administration of}} 210 mg of <b>parnaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> compared with placebo in subjects treated with stable-doses of oral aminosalicylates. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind proof of concept trial compared the efficacy of CB- 01 - 05 MMX 210 mg tablets to placebo in 141 subjects with mild to moderately active left-sided UC treated with stable-doses of aminosalicylates. The efficacy was assessed by clinical activity index (CAI), endoscopic index (EI) and histological score (HS). RESULTS: A total of 121 subjects (61 in test group and 60 in control group) formed the per protocol (PP) population. After 8 weeks of treatment, clinical remission was achieved in 83. 6...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>parnaparin</b> {{is a low}} {{molecular}} weight heparin (LMWH). The introduction of this drug class has represented a medical advancement in the prevention and therapy of thromboembolic pathologies, as they maintain the same efficacy of unfractionated heparin, but with simplified dosing regimens and reduced side effects. Parnaparin has demonstrated its thromboprophylactic efficacy on both high- and moderate risk surgical patients, besides resulting effective in treating established deep vein thromboses and thrombosis-associated phlebopathies. Alongside these clinical advantages, parnaparin and other LMWHs allow outpatient or home-based therapy {{of a large number}} of subjects that should otherwise be treated in hospital, with important savings of health resources and enhanced quality of life for the patients. In Italy, parnaparin drug acquisition cost is among the lowest in its class for many applications, permitting marginal savings in health costs at the same efficacy level. In summary, the use of parnaparin in thrombotic pathologies has very good efficacy and safety profiles, and has positive clinical and economical outcomes for patients, health system and society as a whole...|$|R
