[...] In June 1931, when Dora Richter/Dörchen R. was about 40 years old, her penis was amputated by the Institute physician Dr. Levy-Lenz, and then an artificial vagina was surgically grafted by the Berlin surgeon Prof. Dr. Gohrbandt. Dora becomes the first trans woman of whom records remain to undergo vaginoplasty. According to Dr. Felix Abraham, a psychiatrist working at the Institute for Sexual Science, her [...] "first step to feminization was made by means of castration" [...] in 1922. [...] "After this there was a long pause, until {{the beginning of the year}} 1931, when the penis amputation was done and in June, the here described surgery" [...] - a highly experimental vaginoplasty performed by Dr. Erwin Gohrbandt, (1890-1965). The highly experimental operation (which included the first attempt at vaginoplasty) was a remarkable success and the resulting publicity was enough to lure Lili to the Institute. Lili's case was far more high-profile that Dorchen's. Lili became the second trans woman to undergo Gohrbandt's vaginoplasty technique in 1931. Her castration and penectomy had been performed by Dr. Ludwig Levy-Lenz (1889-1966) the previous year. These preliminaries have sometimes caused confusion over the date of Lili's reassignment surgery. Gohrbandt's surgery deliberately leaves remnants of the scrotum intact, with a view to modifying these into labia at a later date, but, for reasons that are unclear, he did not perform this further procedure himself. Instead, Elvenes' case was taken over by the Nazi Party member Dr. Kurt Warnekros (1882-1949) at the Dresden Women's Clinic. Here, the labiaplasty and a subsequent surgical revision led to Lili's death from infection in September 1931. The ritual book-burning at the Institute for Sexual Science by Nazi students in May 1933 and the destruction of the Dresden Women's Clinic and its records in the Allied bombing raids of February 1945 has left gaps in knowledge of the life of Lili Elbe.|$|E
40|$|Carcass {{quality of}} local sheep fed {{fermented}} rice straws supplemented with soybean oil ABSTRACT. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine if supplementation of soybean oil in the ration in order to increase conjugated linoleic acid of meat has concurrent effects on carcass characteristics and qualities of thin-tailed sheep. Sheep were fed fermented ricestraws supplemented with 0, 3 and 6 % soybean oil. The experimental design used was a Randomized Completely Block Design. Eighteen sheep with initial age of 6 - 8 months and initial bodyweight of 17. 46 ± 1. 61 kg were used. The treatments consisted of soybean oil supplementation 0, 3 and 6 %. Variables measured were carcass conformation, GR thickness, backfat thickness, subcutaneous fat score, and kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> score. Result showed that sheep fed ration with 0 % soybean oil produced carcass with carcass conformation score of 8. 50 ± 1. 05, GR thickness 11. 50 ± 1. 05 mm, back fat thickness 2. 67 ± 0. 82 mm, subcutaneus fat score 3. 50 ± 0. 55 mm, kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> score 2. 00 ± 0. 00. Sheep feed ration with 3 % soybean oil; carcass conformation score 8. 67 ± 1. 21, GR thickness 11. 67 ± 1. 21 mm, back fat thickness 2. 83 ± 0. 98 mm, subcutaneus fat score 3. 50 ± 0. 55, kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> score 1. 83 ± 0. 4. Sheep feed ration with 6 % soybean oil; carcass conformation score 9. 00 ± 1. 26, GR thickness 12. 50 ± 1. 52 mm, back fat thickness 3. 33 ± 0. 82 mm, subcutaneus fat score 3. 50 ± 0. 55, kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> score 1. 83 ± 0. 41. Score of carcass conformation, thickness of GR, thickness of back fat, score of subcutaneus fat, and score of kidney-pelvic fat were not influenced by supplementation of soybean oil.

40|$|Summary A genomic {{screening}} {{to detect}} quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting growth, carcass composition and meat quality traits was pursued. Two hundred nineteen microsatellite markers were genotyped on 176 of 620 (28 %) progeny from a Brahman · Angus sire mated to mostly MARC III dams. Selective genotyping, based on retail product yield (%) and fat yield (%), {{was used to}} select individuals to be genotyped. Traits {{included in the study}} were birth weight (kg), hot carcass weight (kg), retail product yield, fat yield, marbling score (400 slight 00 and 500 small 00), USDA yield grade, and estimated kidney, heart and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> (%). The QTL were classified as significant when the expected number of false positives (ENFP) was less than 0. 05 (F-statistic greater than 17. 3), and suggestive when the ENFP was < 1 (F-statistic between 10. 2 and 17. 3). A significant QTL (F 19; ENFP 0. 02) was detected for marbling score at centimorgan (cM) 54 on chromosome 2. Suggestive QTL were detected for fat yield at 50 cM, for retail product yield at 53 cM, and for USDA yield grade at 63 cM on chromosome 1, for marbling score at 56 cM, for retail product yield at 70 cM, and for estimated kidney, heart and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> at 79 cM on chromosome 3, for marbling score at 44 cM, for hot carcass weight at 49 cM, and for estimated kidney, heart and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> at 62 cM on chromosome 16, and for fat yield at 35 cM on chromosome 17. Two suggestive QTL for birth weight were identified, one at 12 cM on chromosome 20 and the other at 56 cM on chromosome 21. An additional suggestive QTL was detected for retail product yield, for fat yield, and for USDA yield grade at 26 cM on chromosome 26. Results presented here represent the initial search for quantitative trait loci in this family. Validation of detected QTL in other populations will be necessary...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the variation of creatine, creatinine, carnosine, and anserine contents in longissimus muscle of Angus cattle and their correlations with carcass and palatability traits. Longissimus muscle samples were collected from 2, 342 Angus cattle fed in Iowa (n= 1, 114), Texas (n= 455), Colorado (n= 391), and California (n= 382). Creatine, creatinine, carnosine, and anserine were extracted from beef and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentrations of these compounds then were correlated with carcass and palatability traits including hot carcass weight (HCW), kidney <b>pelvic</b> heart <b>fat</b> percentage (KPH), ribeye area, fat thickness, marbling score, calculated yield grade, sensory panel scores, Warner Bratzler shear force (WBSF), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Statistical analysis showed that the gender of cattle significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) affected the concentrations of creatine, creatinine, carnosine, and anserine. Bulls contained greater creatine content than did steers (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) but produced lower amount of carnosine than did heifers (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Significant variation from feeding location was also observed. The correlations with carcass quality and sensory scores were significant but weak, which suggested that beef quality, especially tenderness, juiciness, and flavor, would not be strongly affected by selecting for higher creatine and carnosine contents...|$|R

The independent measurements included the weights of live body, empty body, hot carcass, cold carcass, kidney fat, <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat,</b> hump fat, plate cut, lean in plate cut, fat in plate cut and bone in plate cut. The {{results revealed that}} cold carcass weight and lean weight in plate cut were the most reliable parameters for predicting the weights of carcass separable lean, carcass fat-free lean, carcass separable fat and total carcass fat. The independent variables for the best predictive equation for estimating carcass bone weight were live body weight, cold carcass weight and fat weight in plate cut...|$|E
40|$|The Agricultural Marketing Service {{proposed}} a revision to the yield grade standards {{to provide the}} industry with an option regarding the retention or removal of kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> (KPF) depending on market requirements. The proposal was subsequently withdrawn. The present yield grades are determined by consideration of external fat thickness, hot carcass wt, ribeye area, and estimated percent KPF. The proposed revision would eliminate consideration of KPF in the determination of yield grades. The present study used 2, 550 observations of retail yield of carcasses obtained from steers with genetically diverse growth rates and fattening characteristics to: 1) examine by yield grade the frequency, mean yield grade, and mean cutability for the present USDA 1980 equation, the present USDA 1980 equation omitting KPF, and the proposed newly developed equation (USDA 1984);and 2) compare precision of the USDA 1980 equation and the proposed equation (USDA 1984) for estimating yield...|$|E
40|$|One hundred forty-four medium-framed {{crossbred}} steers averaging 857 lb {{were used}} to evaluate steer performance and determine net energy (NE) values of finishing diets that included dried bakery product (DBP). DBP replaced corn in the control diet at 15 or 30 % of dietary DM. DM intake was depressed 6. 5 % by inclusion of 30 % DBP. No differences in daily gain (P>. 3) or feed efficiency (P>. 9) were observed by replacing corn with DBP. Dietary values of NEm and NEg, calculated from animal performance, were not affected (P>. 7) by the inclusion of DBP. Kidney, <b>pelvic,</b> and heart <b>fat</b> (KPH) (P<. 05) and 12 th rib fat thickness (P<. 1) were increased linearly with inclusion of DBP, whereas other carcass characteristics were unaffected. These data indicate the DBP (10 % rice hulls included) has an energy value {{similar to that of}} corn grain, although the optimal inclusion level of DBP appears to be below 30 % of dietary DM...|$|R
40|$|Steers {{produced}} in Cycle I of the Texas A & M University McGregor Genomics Project (n = 232, F 2 Nellore-Angus) were evaluated for carcass composition, visceral organ weights, and model predicted residual consumption (MPRC), {{a measure of}} feed efficiency. Hot carcass weight was strongly correlated with liver weight (r = 0. 70, P < 0. 001) heart weight (r = 0. 58, P < 0. 001), and viscera weight (r = 0. 55, P < 0. 001) but not spleen weight (r = - 0. 01, P = 0. 83). Liver, heart and viscera weights were moderately positively correlated with external and kidney <b>pelvic</b> heart <b>fat</b> (KPH), but not with marbling. None of the organ weights were correlated with MPRC. A subset of 54 animals was selected for extreme values of residuals of MPRC after a mixed model analysis that included fixed effects of sire and family nested within sire, and these animals were evaluated for insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) expression in liver samples collected at harvest through quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). IGFI relative quantity (IGFI RQ) was collected from qRT-PCR and was correlated with liver (r = - 0. 23, P = 0. 09), spleen (r = 0. 48, P < 0. 001) and viscera weight (r = 0. 24, P = 0. 08), but not any carcass trait or MPRC residual. Gene breed types were determined for 4 candidate genes of feed efficiency: insulin like growth factor- 1 (IGF 1), leptin (LEP), neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and ghrelin (GHRL). Gene breed types were represented as AA, AN, NA, and NN where A and N denote Angus and Nellore, respectively, and paternal inheritance is listed first. Given that contemporary group significantly influenced most traits (MPRC, all carcass traits, liver weight and viscera weight), effects of gene breed type and contemporary group were evaluated together in analyses. GHRL influenced liver (P = 0. 02) and viscera weight (P = 0. 02), IGF 1 influenced kidney, <b>pelvic,</b> and heart <b>fat</b> (P = 0. 05), NPY influenced liver weight (P = 0. 03) and hot carcass weight (P = 0. 04), and LEP influenced ribeye area (P = 0. 05) and hot carcass weight (P = 0. 04) with a tendency to influence liver weight (P = 0. 06). Alternate heterozygotes for GHRL were statistically different in liver weight and viscera weight where NA was heavier than AN. Alternate heterozygotes for LEP {{did not differ in}} ribeye area, hot carcass weight, or liver weight. Alternate heterozygotes for NPY differed in liver weight (NA heavier than AN), but did not differ in hot carcass weight. Carcasses with AA for LEP and NPY were 18 to 19 kg heavier (P < 0. 05) than those with NN, with heterozygotes intermediate...|$|R
40|$|One hundred eighty {{yearling}} steers (743 lb) {{were blocked}} by weight; implanted with Synovex® (S), Synovex plus Finaplix® (SF), or not implanted (C); and fed diets containing 11. 75 % (L), 13. 0 % (M), or 14. 25 % (H) crude protein with all supplemental protein above 11. 75 % being supplied by corn gluten meal and blood meal in a 50 : 50 ratio (crude protein basis). An addition al protein level fed to S and SF implanted cattle was H {{for the first}} 70 days on feed and L thereafter (H-L). Animals were reimplanted on day 70. Steers treated with SF gained faster and more efficiently than non-implanted cattle. Differences in protein level {{had no effect on}} fat deposition in control steers, but cattle receiving SF and consuming M had more back <b>fat</b> and kidney, <b>pelvic,</b> heart (KPH) <b>fat</b> than those fed either H or L and also had more marbling than those fed H. Also, no apparent differences occurred between cattle fed M throughout the trial and those switched from H to L at 70 days...|$|R
40|$|Of 359 {{patients}} with colorectal cancer admitted {{over a period}} of about 11 years, 17 (4. 7 %) were 40 years of age or younger (group 1) and 342 (group 2) were older. In group 1 at the time of diagnosis, there were 9 men and 8 women; the average age was 34. 2 years. Abdominal pain and diarrhea were the most common presenting symptoms. The average delay between onset of symptoms and treatment was 8. 2 months (7. 2 in group 2). Tumor stage at the time of diagnosis or at laparotomy was not more advanced than in group 2, the incidence of Dukes C lesions being 17. 6 % and 24. 8 %, and distant metastasis 17. 6 % and 18. 7 %, respectively. Analysis of tumor according to the stage (Astler and Coller classification), <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> involvement, lymph node metastases and grading revealed no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. The age factor had no impact on survival. It is concluded that in the present series, colorectal cancer in young patients differs in no respect from the disease in older patients...|$|E
40|$|Carcasses from 1, 121 steers (progeny of Hereford or Angus cows mated to Hereford, Angus, Charolais, Simmental, Limousin, South Devon, or Jersey sires by {{artificial}} insemination) {{were examined}} to develop equations to estimate percentage of retail product. The independent variables chosen and resultant {{accuracy of the}} equations developed, reflect different kinds of measurements {{that could be used}} to predict cutability over a wide range of data collection conditions. Of 18 traits readily obtained in the cooler, adjusted fat thickness, rib eye area, estimated kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat,</b> hot carcass weight, and marbling score were the most important in predicting percentage of retail product. A multiple regession equation involving these five independent variables accounted for 79. 2 % of the variation in percentage of retail product. Results showed that adequate alternatives other than complete cutout of carcasses do exist to determine yields of retail product. Reasonably precise estimates of percentage or retail product can be made based on prediction equations involving independent variables measured on carcasses in the cooler alone or in combination with partial cutout data. These estimates should be especially useful when a large number of carcasses are to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Ram lambs, wethers and wethers {{implanted}} with Silastic capsules containing crystalline testerone {{were placed}} on test at 14. 9 ± 1. 1 kg and evaluated for differences in growth, performance, carcass characteristics and composition. Silastic implants that were able to maintain physiological concentrations of serum testosterone provided appropriate replacement therapy in wethers. Growth rate, efficiency of feed utilization and carcass yield of intact ram lambs and testosterone-implanted wethers were superior to the corresponding traits of wethers. Wethers had greater backfat thickness and percentage kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat,</b> and their carcasses graded {{higher than those of}} ram lambs or wethers implanted with a high dosage of testosterone. Empty body composition was significantly affected by treatment. Thus, intact rams contained more water and protein but less fat and gross energy than wethers. Testosterone-implanted wethers were intermediate in composition. Carcass water and protein were not significantly affected by treatment; however, carcass fat and gross energy were highest for wethers and lowest for intact rams. The relationship between testosterone and carcass fat and energy was dose dependent; i. e., decreased fat and energy were associated with proincreased serum testosterone. In conclusion, testosterone appears to be the principal testicular hormone responsible for the superior performance and preferred carcass traits characteristic of young market rams...|$|E
50|$|In 1997, the {{official}} standards were revised {{to restrict the}} Select grade to A maturity carcasses, and to raise the minimum marbling score to qualify for Choice to modest for B maturity cattle. These changes were implemented to improve the uniformity and consistency of the grading system.Yield grades are intended to estimate the pounds of boneless closely trimmed retail cuts from the carcass. Closely trimmed refers to approximately ¼ inch of external fat. Yield grade is determined by considering 4 carcass characteristics: external <b>fat,</b> Kidney, <b>pelvic</b> and heart <b>fat</b> (KPH), Ribeye area (REA), and Hot carcass weight (HCW). The amount of external fat is measured at the ribbed surface between the 12th and 13th ribs. The ribbing of carcasses is described in the U.S. standards for beef grading. External fat is measured {{at a distance of}} ¾ the length of the ribeye from the chine bone end. This initial number can be adjusted up or down depending on any abnormal fat deposits. As the amount of external fat increases, the percent of retail cuts decreases.|$|R
40|$|Forty Kacang doe (average initial BW, 10. 2 kg) {{were used}} in 4 x 2 {{factorial}} arrangement to determine carcass characteristics. Dose of the testosterone as first factor were assigned to four levels, i. e. : control (T 0), 1 dose of testosterone propionate (T 1), 2 doses of TP (T 2), and 3 doses of TP (T 3). The age of animals as the second factor, i. e. : 7 - 8 months of age (U 1) and 9 - 12 months of age (U 2), referred to chevon method. The treatment combinations were replicated 5 times, respectively, so that there were 40 heads of doe. Animals were injected with 0. 77 mg of TP/kg BW/d weekly for first dose and the goats were fed for 90 days. The diet were assigned to met or exceed 50 g ADG. The variables included slaughter weight, carcass weight, pelt weight, and Kidney <b>Pelvic</b> Heart (KPH) <b>fat</b> weight. There were significant interaction (P< 0. 01), except on KPH weight. The best carcass characteristics were significantly resulted from injection of 49 mg TP head- 1 week- 1 treated on 9 kg of Kacang doe...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} the supplementation of feed additives on carcass quality in beef cattle, 72 Nellore steers (339. 5 kg, 20 -month old) were feedlot finished and fed for 91 days one of the following diets: 1) control with no additives; or added of 2) live yeast culture; 3) monensin; or 4) the association of both additives. After slaughter, renal, <b>pelvic,</b> and inguinal <b>fat</b> and hot carcass weights were recorded and carcass was split into muscle, bone, and trimmable fat. Carcass Longissimus muscle area and subcutaneous fat thickness at the 12 th rib were measured and steaks of Longisimus muscle were taken to determine meat color, shear force, drip, and cooking losses. Yeast increased carcass dressing percentage but there were no effects on hot carcass weight, Longissimus area, subcutaneous fat thickness, percentage and weight of retail cut yield and trimmings. Feed additives had no effect on carcass pH, meat color, fat content, shear force, and drip losses. Supplementation of yeast, monensin or the association of both additives had no important effects on carcass traits and on meat quality of feedlot finished steers...|$|R
