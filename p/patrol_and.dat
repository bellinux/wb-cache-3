5|$|Another {{crucial role}} in the Clan is that of the deputy. When a new Clan leader is appointed, or the old deputy dies or retires, a new cat will be chosen to fulfill this role.

Although the Clan deputy still sleeps in the warriors den, they are respected by other members of the Clan. Often, a cat will come to the deputy first when asking for advice. When a Clan leader dies, the current deputy will take on the new role of leader, and receive their nine lives from StarClan.|$|E
