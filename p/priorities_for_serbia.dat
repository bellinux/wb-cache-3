2500|$|In June 2008 Greece's {{ambassador}} to Serbia Christos Panagopoulos said Greece consistently backs Serbia’s development and {{wants it to}} assume {{its place in the}} EU. He stated that political leadership of Greece wish is <b>for</b> <b>Serbia</b> to take its place in the European family and that Greece believes that is the best <b>for</b> <b>Serbia</b> and <b>for</b> regional stability. According to Panagopoulos, Greece is conducting a policy of support to Serbia’s development and improving the lives of its citizens, as reflected in the large aid that Serbia received after 2000, as well as investments that exceed 2.5 billion EUR. He recalled that in 2001 and 2002 the serious situation in the country dictated that aid was predominantly of a humanitarian character, but that this was followed by development aid. Greece adopted an important aid program, dubbed the [...] "Hellenic Plan for the Economic Reconstruction of the Balkans", which earmarked 230 million EUR <b>for</b> <b>Serbia.</b> The bulk of this sum, about 80 percent, was intended for infrastructure, including Corridor X, which was a <b>priority</b> both <b>for</b> <b>Serbia</b> and Greece. Of the overall costs of construction of Corridor 10, amounting to about 300 million EUR, 100 million will constitute a net donation from the Greek government. He underlined that one of Athens and its Belgrade-based embassy’s goals was the promotion of economic relations, which had a very positive dynamism, since Greece topped the list of countries making direct and indirect investment in Serbia. He said that Greece is present in all strategic branches of the economy, meaning that Greek investors came to Serbia to stay and that Greek investment will create more than 27,000 jobs for Serbian citizens. Panagopoulos expressed his hope that this trend would shortly be expanded with Serbian investment in Greece.|$|R
