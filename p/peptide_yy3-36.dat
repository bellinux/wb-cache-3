25|$|The stomach {{contains}} receptors {{that can}} detect {{the presence of}} nutrients, but there are detectors in the intestines as well, and the satiety factors of the stomach and intestines can interact. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone secreted by the duodenum that controls the rate of stomach emptying. CCK is secreted {{in response to the}} presence of fats, which are detected in by receptors in the duodenum. Another satiety signal produced by cells is <b>peptide</b> <b>YY3-36</b> (PYY), which is released after a meal in amounts proportional to the calories ingested.|$|E

50|$|Peptide YY {{is related}} to the {{pancreatic}} peptide family by having 18 of its 36 amino acids located in the same positions as pancreatic peptide. The two major forms of peptide YY are PYY1-36 and PYY3-36, which have PP fold structural motifs. However, {{the most common form of}} circulating PYY immunoreactivity is PYY3-36, which binds to the Y2 receptor (Y2R) of the Y family of receptors. <b>Peptide</b> <b>YY3-36</b> (PYY) is a linear polypeptide consisting of 34 amino acids with structural homology to NPY and pancreatic polypeptide.|$|E
