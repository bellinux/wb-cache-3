40|$|Good {{results were}} {{achieved}} by the National Reference Laboratories of the 25 European member states during the quality control on Salmonella typing in 2007. Six laboratories were found to require a follow-up. The laboratories have been under obligation {{to participate in this}} quality test (the inter-laboratory comparison study for typing of Salmonella) since 1992. Each member state has appointed one laboratory, the National Reference Laboratory (NRL), which detects and types Salmonella from samples isolated from animals and/or food products. The performance of these laboratories is tested yearly using 20 Salmonella strains to which they have to assign the correct name. Enter-Net laboratories (ENLs) also participate in these studies, these laboratories examine mainly samples isolated from humans. The NRLs proved to be able to correctly name 95 percent of the strains, while the ENLs correctly named 91 percent of the strains. Some NRLs and ENLs are also tested the <b>phage</b> <b>typing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> on the basis of 10 strains of each Salmonella types; Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium. The NRLs typed 98 per cent of the S. Enteritidis strains correct and the ENLs 89 percent. The typing of S. Typhimurium strains proved to be more troublesome, with the NRLs typing 91 percent of the strains correctly and the ENLs 89 percent.

40|$|Salmonella {{isolates}} harbour a {{range of}} resident prophages which can influence their virulence and ability to compete and survive in their environment. Phage gene profiling of a range <b>of</b> <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.

Simultaneous re-sistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were present in 84 strains (75. 7 %). Nalidixic acid resistance was only observed in 2 multidrug-resistant strains (1. 8 %). Twenty-one strains (18. 9 %) were completely susceptible to all drugs tested. All 111 strains were susceptible to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cipropfloxacin.

The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns obtained with XbaI and BlnI from 38 pigeon strains were compared with those obtained from 89 porcine, poultry, and human strains of variant Copenhagen. Identical patterns with XbaI and four closely related patterns with BlnI were obtained with the pigeon strains, whereas 16 XbaI patterns were found with the other strains. The XbaI patterns of the pigeon strains showed a low genetic similarity to the patterns of the porcine, poultry, and human strains and invariably showed a low-molecular-weight band that was absent in the majority of the other strains. The virulence genes shdA, spvR, pefA, sopE, and spvB were uniformly present in six pigeon isolates representing the genetic diversity found with BlnI. These six pigeon-derived strains were highly cytotoxic for pigeon macrophages compared to three porcine strains. After experimental infection of pigeons with a pigeon strain, clinical symptoms, fecal shedding, and colonization of internal organs were more pronounced than those after infection with a porcine strain.

40|$|Passerine {{salmonellosis}} is a well-recognized {{disease of}} {{birds in the}} order Passeriformes, which includes common songbirds such as finches and sparrows, caused by infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Previous {{research has suggested that}} some subtypes <b>of</b> S Typhimurium-definitive <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> (DTs) 40, 56 variant, and 160 -are host adapted to passerines and that these birds may represent a reservoir of infection for humans and other animals. Here, we have used the whole-genome sequences of 11 isolates from British passerines, five isolates of similar DTs from humans and a domestic cat, and previously published S Typhimurium genomes that include similar DTs from other hosts to investigate the phylogenetic relatedness <b>of</b> passerine <b>salmonellae</b> to other S Typhimurium isolates and investigate possible genetic features of the distinct disease pathogenesis of S Typhimurium in passerines. Our results demonstrate that the 11 passerine isolates and 13 other isolates, including those from nonpasserine hosts, were genetically closely related, with a median pairwise single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference of 130 SNPs. These 24 isolates did not carry antimicrobial resistance genetic determinants or the S Typhimurium virulence plasmid. Although our study does not provide evidence <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> transmission from passerines to other hosts, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that wild birds represent a potential reservoir <b>of</b> these <b>Salmonella</b> subtypes, and thus, sensible personal hygiene precautions should be taken when feeding or handling garden birds. IMPORTANCE: Passerine salmonellosis, caused by certain definitive <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> (DTs) <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> Typhimurium, has been documented as a cause of wild passerine mortality since the 1950 s in many countries, often in the vicinity of garden bird feeding stations. To gain better insight into its epidemiology and host-pathogen interactions, we sequenced the genomes of a collection of 11 isolates from wild passerine salmonellosis in England and Wales. Phylogenetic analysis showed these passerine isolates to be closely related {{to each other and to}} form a clade that is distinct from other strains of S Typhimurium, which included a multidrug-resistant isolate from invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease that shares the same <b>phage</b> <b>type</b> as several <b>of</b> the passerine isolates. Closely related to wild passerine isolates and within the same clade were four S Typhimurium isolates from humans as well as isolates from horses, poultry, cattle, an unspecified wild bird, and a domestic cat and dog with similar DTs and/or multilocus sequence types. This suggests the potential for cross-species transmission, and the genome sequences provide a valuable resource to investigate passerine salmonellosis further.

40|$|Het negende ringonderzoek voor de typering van Salmonella werd in de lente van 2004 georganiseerd door het Communautair Referentie Laboratorium voor Salmonella (CRL-Salmonella, Bilthoven, Nederland) in samenwerking met Health Protection Agency (HPA, Londen, Verenigd Koninkrijk) en het Centraal Instituut voor Dierziekte Controle (CIDC, Lelystad, Nederland). Vijfentwintig Nationale Referentie Laboratoria voor Salmonella (NRLs-Salmonella) inclusief Noorwegen en Kandidaat lidstaat Roemenie en 18 Enter-Net Laboratoria (ENLs) namen deel aan de studie. Twintig stammen van species Salmonella enterica {{subspecies}} enterica werden geselecteerd voor de serotypering. Tien stammen van Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) en 10 stammen van Salmonella Typhimurium (STM) werden geselecteerd voor faagtypering. Tien stammen van Salmonella spp. werden geselecteerd voor antimicrobiele gevoeligheidsbepalingen. In het algemeen werden geen problemen gevonden met de typering van de O-antigenen. Enkele laboratoria hadden problemen met het typeren van de H-antigenen. Veel problemen traden op met de onderscheiding tussen S. Banana en S. California. Achtennegentig procent van alle deelnemende laboratoria typeerden de O-antigenen correct. De H-antigenen werden correct getypeerd door 90 % van de NRLs en door 96 % van de ENLs. Negentig procent van de NRLs en 95 % van de ENLs gaven de 20 serotyperingsstammen de goede serovar naam. De faagtypering van enkele van de Salmonella Enteritidis stammen zorgden voor problemen voor zowel de NRLs als de ENLs. De meeste laboratoria testten de antimicrobiele gevoeligheids bepalingen tegen een {{panel van}} veertien antibiotica. Sommige problemen deden zich voor met de interpretatie van de resultaten verkregen met de antibiotica amoxicillin-clavanulaat en trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. Deze studie toonde aan dat minder afwijkende resultaten werden verkregen met de Minimal Inhibition Concentration methode dan met de disk diffusie test. The ninth interlaboratory comparison {{study on the}} <b>typing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> was organised by the Community Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (CRL-Salmonella, Bilthoven, the Netherlands) {{in collaboration with the}} Health Protection Agency (HPA, London, United Kingdom) and the Central Institute for Animal Disease Control (CIDC, Lelystad, the Netherlands) in spring 2004. Twenty-five National Reference Laboratories for Salmonella (NRLs-Salmonella) including Norway and Candidate Country Romania and eighteen Enter-Net Laboratories (ENLs) participated in the study. In total, 20 strains <b>of</b> the species <b>Salmonella</b> enterica subspecies enterica were selected for serotyping. Ten strains <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> Enteritidis (SE) and 10 strains <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> Typhimurium (STM) were selected for <b>phage</b> <b>typing.</b> Ten strains <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> spp. were selected for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In general, no problems were encountered with the <b>typing</b> <b>of</b> the O-antigens. Some laboratories had problems with <b>typing</b> <b>of</b> the H-antigens. Many problems occurred with the distinction between S. Banana and S. California. Ninety-eight percent of all participating laboratories were able to correctly type the O-antigens. The H-antigens were typed correctly by 90 % of the NRLs and by 96 % of the ENLs. Ninety percent of the NRLs and 95 % of the ENLs indicated correct serovar names for the 20 serotyping strains. The <b>phage</b> <b>typing</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> the <b>Salmonella</b> Enteritidis strains caused problems for the NRLs {{as well as for the}} ENLs. Most laboratories performed the antimicrobial susceptibility testingtowards a panel of fourteen antibiotics. Some problems occurred with the interpretation of the results obtained with antibiotics amoxicillin-clavanulate and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. This study demonstrated that less deviating results were produced by Minimal Inhibition Concentration determinations than by disc diffusion. ...|$|R
