40|$|Ductwork {{installed}} in unconditioned attics can significantly increase the overall {{heating and cooling}} costs of residential buildings. In fact, estimated duct thermal losses for single-family residential buildings with ductwork {{installed in}} unconditioned attics range from 10 % to 45 %. In a study of three single-story houses in Florida, the Building America research team Consortium for Advanced Residential Buildings (CARB) investigated the strategy of using buried and/or encapsulated ducts (BED) to reduce duct thermal losses in existing homes. The BED strategy consists of burying ducts in loose-fill insulation and/or encapsulating them in closed cell <b>polyurethane</b> <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> (ccSPF) insulation. There are three possible combinations of BED strategies: (1) buried ducts; (2) encapsulated ducts (with ccSPF); and (3) buried and encapsulated ducts. The best solution for each situation depends on the climate, age of the house, and {{the configuration of the}} HVAC system and attic. For new construction projects, the team recommends that ducts be both encapsulated and buried as the minimal planning and costs required for this will yield optimal energy savings. The encapsulated/buried duct strategy, which utilizes ccSPF to address condensation concerns, is an approach that was developed specifically for humid climates...|$|E

This Measure Guideline covers {{the technical aspects of}} BEDs as well as the advantages, disadvantages, and risks of BEDs compared to other alternative strategies. This guideline also provides detailed guidance on installation of BEDs strategies in new and existing homes through step-by-step installation procedures. This Building America Measure Guideline synthesizes previously published research on BEDs and provides practical information to builders, contractors, homeowners, policy analysts, building professions, and building scientists. Some of the procedures presented here, however, require specialized equipment or expertise. In addition, some alterations to duct systems may require a specialized license. Persons implementing duct system improvements should not go beyond their expertise or qualifications. This guideline provides valuable information for a building industry that has struggled to address ductwork thermal losses in new and existing homes. As building codes strengthen requirements for duct air sealing and insulation, flexibility is needed to address energy efficiency goals. While ductwork in conditioned spaces has been promoted as the panacea for addressing ductwork thermal losses, BEDs installations approach - and sometimes exceed - the performance of ductwork in conditioned spaces...|$|E

40|$|Steel {{reinforcing}} bar (rebar) corrosion due to chlorine ingress {{is the primary}} degradation mechanism for bridge decks. In areas where rock salt {{is used as a}} de-icing agent, salt water seeps into the concrete through cracks, causing corrosion of the rebar and potentially leading to catastrophic failure if not repaired. This project explores the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags as low-cost corrosion sensors. RFID tags, when embedded in concrete, will fail due to corrosion {{in the same manner as}} rebar after prolonged exposure to salt water. In addition, the presence of salt water interferes with the ability to detect the tags, providing a secondary mechanism by which this method can work. During this project, a fieldable RFID equipment setup was constructed and tested. In addition to a number of laboratory experiments to validate the underlying principles, RFID tags were embedded and tested in several actual bridge decks. Two major challenges were addressed in this project: issues associated with tags not functioning due to being in close proximity to rebar and issues associated with portland concrete coming in direct contact with the tags causing a detuning effect and preventing the tags from operating properly. Both issues were investigated thoroughly. The first issue was determined to be a problem only if the tags are placed in close proximity to rebar. The second issue was resolved by encapsulating the tag.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and analyzes the experimental {{results from a}} full-wall (guarded hot box) thermal testing study performed by Architectural Testing, Inc., of York, PA.

In addition, thermal performance {{of a combination of}} ccSPF and polyisocyanurate insulated sheathing is also measured. This full-scale test method goes beyond simple thermal conductivity testing of insulation materials and includes real-world effects of air infiltration and mean temperature. Specifically, it includes the effect of air infiltration by simulating a 15 mph wind applied to the outside surface of the test walls. In addition, the effect of mean test temperature on wall thermal performance is measured using outdoor temperatures of- 15 ºF, 25 ºF and 115 ºF. A Wall Performance Index (WPI) is determined for the different walls tested, providing a rating of actual versus expected thermal performance. Results show WPI is dependent upon mean temperature and air infiltration. The WPI for fiber glass insulated walls are significantly reduced by wind loading and changes in the mean test temperature. Walls made from open-cell foam show consistent WPI values that are lower than expected, but relatively unaffected by wind load and external temperature. Closed-cell <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> shows WPIs that are consistently at or above expected values, regardless of mean temperature and air infiltration.
