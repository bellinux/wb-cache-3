Depending on country/state specific requirements, the interpreter is often required to have some knowledge of medical terminology, common procedures, the patient interview and exam process.

Using an approach based on critical discourse analysis (Fairclough 2000, 2003; Fowler 1991) the article begins by examining a small corpus of media reports in which the twin societal aims of community cohesion and integration are often seen as being hindered by translation and interpreting services. The issue of whether interpreting services play or should play a role in integration and cohesion amidst the ongoing processes of welfare reform in Britain is then examined and contrasted with a broader understanding of welfare that foregrounds the role of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> in the processes of resettlement and socialisation.

Using data on Gini coefficients before and after government intervention allows us to apply a measure of fiscal redistribution which reflects the effect of taxes and transfers on income inequality. We find that dictatorial regimes redistribute more than democracies through taxes and transfers. Our empirical findings remain robust across several different specifications and estimation techniques. Subsequently, we employ fiscal policy data in an attempt to enlighten this puzzling - at a first glance - empirical finding. Our results indicate that democracies and dictatorships actually follow different patterns of redistribution.

40|$|The interpreter’s {{professional}} status {{can be said}} {{to be one of the}} least debated issues in Interpreting Studies, especially in <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting.</b> Several studies (Angelelli 2004; Ricoy et al. 2009; De Pedro Ricoy 2010; Sela-Sheffy & Shlesinger 2011) have speculated that the status of public service interpreters is generally low and that <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> is still undergoing a professionalisation process (Wadensjö 2010), although these assumptions have never been empirically and extensively investigated. Nevertheless, a thorough analysis of the status of public service interpreters may contribute to understanding issues concerning codes of ethics, new developments in the T&I market, the interpreter’s role, pedagogical shortcomings and public opinions about the profession. Despite the growing amount of literature on the professionalisation process of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> (Mikkelson & Jourdenais 2015), there are still a few questions which need to be asked: what is the current state of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting?</b> How do interpreters perceive their status? Which measures would prove fruitful to enhance the professionalisation process? What are the most feared “threats” to the development of the profession? Drawing on sociological theories (Brinkerhoff 2013), this paper presents the results of a survey on the status of public service interpreters, which was completed by 888 respondents worldwide, with a special focus on training, the interpreters’ perception of status, the value of interpreting in society and the future of the profession. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{principle of}} welfare economics states that an efficient resources allocation {{can be achieved}} in a competitive economy when market prices {{are in line with}} social marginal costs. When applied to the transport sector, this implies that the price of the various transport modes should be made equal to the sum of marginal production and external costs, like congestion, accidents, pollution, and road maintenance. It is sometimes argued that the internalisation of external costs would bring about a change in demand patterns with a shift towards public transport and cleaner modes. But, public transport is already favoured by a discriminatory fiscal treatment. Whereas <b>public</b> <b>services</b> are normally (heavily) subsidised, private transport is taxed in several ways and, in some countries, quite substantially so. The application of the pricing principle, therefore, critically depends on how the subsidisation of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> is <b>interpreted.</b> This paper addresses the issue of optimal pricing of urban transport, using different hypotheses about the treatment of <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> After reviewing some traditional arguments in favour of public transport subsidisation, a new approach, based on uncertainty and option values, is discussed. The implications of this approach are investigated by means of an applied model, where optimal prices for urban transport services in the city of Bologna are computed under alternative assumptions...|$|R

Interpreting with English is a major feature that prevails throughout the eleven chapters which cover genres in as many interpreting scenarios. English is recognized worldwide as being a major lingua franca today in numerous interlinguistic communicative settings and is increasingly being adopted internationally as a language for business, science and international negotiation. Though the principal aim of interpreting to transfer a message from one language to another (be it spoken or signed) remains unchanged, modes of transfer have adapted according to work requirements, from simultaneous interpreting in traditional conference settings, to consecutive, whispering or remote interpreting in various kinds of meeting or <b>public</b> <b>service</b> encounters. <b>Interpreting</b> follows all areas of human activity, thus, interpreters are confronted with an infinite range of linguistic, textual, cultural and generic features in the workplace.

Public service interpreters {{play a vital role in}} helping these professionals communicate effectively {{with people who are}} limited in their proficiency of the English language. However, limited research has been conducted into the emotional and psychological impact of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> in the UK. The aim of this study is to address this gap in the literature through gaining further understanding of the emotional and psychological effects of interpreting within public services using a constructivist grounded theory approach. Ten spoken-language interpreters, recruited through <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> courses in south Wales, engaged in semi-structured interviews about their emotional and psychological experiences while interpreting in public service settings. Five themes were identified, relating to the nature of ‘Public services’; participants’ ‘Relationships with clients’; the ‘Emotional experience’; ‘Psychological changes’ and ‘Coping’. Participants’ experiences were characterised by the short-term experience of distressing emotions, such as anger and sadness, and longer-term psychological changes related to personal growth. The separation of personal and professional boundaries appeared to be a core mediating factor of the emotional and psychological impact of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting.</b> These findings are discussed in relation to existing literature about the emotional and psychological impact of working with people who are emotionally distressed. The clinical and service delivery implications of this study’s findings include the need for the establishment of formal support systems for public service interpreters and the need for professionals working alongside interpreters to be trained to work with them.

40|$|To translators and {{translation}} scholars, the emancipating role of translation, including interpreting, is obvious. We all {{are aware}} of hundreds of examples illustrating exactly that liberating function: from the historical examples of the identity-building function of translation in certain nations, over the social role of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> translation and <b>interpreting,</b> up to institutionalized translation policies in multilingual countries. The recent success of the translations in the online version of the Handbook of Translation Studies shows that this emancipating role also holds true at an academic meta-level in our own discipline. Recently however, there are also counterexamples that question such a role, particularly in politically delicate contexts. A famous example is the discussion about the so called integration-hindering function of translation {{on the occasion of}} the report of the ‘Commission on Integration and Cohesion’ in the UK. In a similar vein, this presentation will also deal with the recent protests in some South-African universities against translation and interpreting. In this case translation (or non-translation) policy is part of a complex combination of political, historical, didactic, emancipatory and imagological factors: the triangle English-Afrikaans-African languages, their roles and images as symbols of oppressing or being oppressed, the efficiency of teaching through interpreting, etc. Such cases problematize our traditional view on the role of translation, and might bring it in conflict with a more negative image of translation in multicultural societies. status: publishe...|$|R

Our major cities in particular are rapidly becoming “super-diverse” communities with many different (cultural) minorities. Many immigrant groups are, at least in the initial phase of their residence in a new community, often unable to communicate effectively in the official language. This poses important challenges for public service providers, who {{ought to be able to}} ensure equal access to their services to anyone who requires them. Yet, not all public service providers in Europe are prepared or equipped to operate in such a multilingual environment, and in many countries both comprehensive policies and structural funding are still lacking. As a result, <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> and translation are available and made use of very unevenly. Following earlier initiatives to put <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> and translation (PSIT) on the agendas of the European Commission and EU member states, such as the report drawn up by the European Language Council’s Special Interest Group on Translation and Interpreting for Public Services (SIGTIPS) in 2011, more recently the European Network for <b>Public</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Interpreting</b> and Translation (ENPSIT) was founded.

40|$|URL] Interpreting between {{peoples of}} {{different}} languages {{is an ancient}} practice, and one that has traditionally been viewed as fraught with ambiguities of trust, status, power and agency. In {{the last quarter of}} a century, both national and transnational governmental institutions have addressed particular concerns about interpreting for migrants using public services in their host countries. In order to remove the burden of responsibility for such interpreting from the children to whom it often fell, and in order to ensure social justice for migrants in access to services, considerable resources have been invested worldwide in creating professional infrastructures for <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> (PSI), including training, qualifications and registration for specialist practitioners. This thesis investigates in depth, through the narratives of public service interpreters themselves, the complex nature of their work. It builds on previous critiques which have challenged the profession’s formal prescriptions of supposed ‘invisibility’, as if these practitioners were just ‘translating machines’ who do not participate in the social interactions they interpret. However, it also goes beyond existing research by drawing on the sociologies of professions and of workplace learning to highlight aspects of this work that have not hitherto been considered. The research was conducted within a critical interpretive paradigm that seeks to understand the relationship between the micro-level subjective experiences of individuals and macro-level institutional and structural factors. The data were generated through lengthy narrative interviews with 11 experienced public service interpreters in England, and analysed initially through open coding and then through a process of narrative synthesis. Key findings are that public service interpreters, in addition to their overt linguistic and cultural work, are also involved in three hidden forms of work: -managing professional boundaries, which are frequently disrupted by public service providers and users; -addressing unpredictable ethical challenges arising in those interactions; -and performing a range of emotional labour. The formal training and rubrics of the <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> profession appear inadequate for acknowledging or supporting these challenges in practice. The findings also point to the fragile professional status of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> in an increasingly hostile climate generated by political moves to restrict immigration and reduce public spending. The thesis makes a number of original and significant contributions to knowledge. It presents a fine-grained account of PSIs’ work from their own perspectives, which until now have remained underexplored. It focuses on three largely hidden aspects of their work: boundary work, ethics work, and emotional labour. It has demonstrated that these aspects not only constitute forms of work in themselves for PSIs, but also that they are thoroughly integrated, both together and with the more overt practices of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting.</b> It locates these clearly in wider sets of social power relations, revealing that national and international policy-makers represent a fourth party in interpreted public service encounters. The thesis builds on and extends existing knowledge of this topic through an innovative interdisciplinary approach bringing together critical interpreting studies with sociological understandings of professions and of workplace learning; and offers a holistic synthesis of these perspectives, integrating them through the lens of Bourdieu’s theoretical framework. It ends with a series of recommendations for policy and practice to enhance the effectiveness of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> through a more comprehensive understanding of its practice...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>interpreting</b> (PSI) has gain greater {{visibility}} {{and has become a}} thriving field of research evolving towards a specialization according to settings. Different studies and research projects focus more and more on specific contexts like medical interpreting in emergency departments, interpreting for victims of gender-based violence or interpreting for women in penitentiaries. The aim {{of this article is to}} describe the positive impact and promote the awareness of combining several empirical methodologies during the data collection process especially in contexts where confidentiality and special protocols turn the access to data into a tedious process. The article describes different research projects developed by the members of Group FITISPos-UAH which have combined several types of questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, recordings, direct observation and field notes. A more detailed description of these typologies of research is presented and it is argued that the empirical framework must be shaped or modeled in such a way that it serves to overcome institutional obstacles...|$|E
