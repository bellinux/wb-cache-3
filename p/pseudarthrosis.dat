50|$|<b>Pseudarthrosis</b> (commonly {{referred}} to as a nonunion or false joint) is a bone fracture that has no chance of mending without intervention. In <b>pseudarthrosis</b> the body perceives bone fragments as separate bones and does not attempt to unite them. Often this is the result of inadequate healing after the fracture, though it can also be the result of a developmental failure. In the U.S., FDA guidelines allow a period of 9 months for fracture union, after which intervention is considered to facilitate union.|$|E
50|$|Nonunion is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of a fracture and may occur when the fracture moves too much, has a poor blood supply or gets infected. Patients who smoke have {{a higher incidence of}} nonunion. The normal process of bone healing is interrupted or stalled. In some cases a pseudo-joint (<b>pseudarthrosis)</b> develops between the two fragments with cartilage formation and a joint cavity. More commonly the tissue between the ununited fragments is scar tissue.|$|E
5000|$|The Greek stem [...] "pseudo-" [...] means false and [...] "arthrosis" [...] means joint. <b>Pseudarthrosis,</b> then, {{is a false}} joint. In {{the case}} of a [...] "non-union", a {{fracture}} that does not heal, this is often evidenced by the obliteration of the medullary cavity of a long bone {{at the site of the}} non union. This non union is not a true joint, and has no ligamentous support, but often has motion, and remodels into a rounded end that looks like a true joint.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980 {{during the}} Cold War era, Carlo Mauri, an Italian mountaineer, {{explorer}} and photojournalist, on the urgings of his Russian colleague Yuri Senkevich, travelled to Kurgan, in the Soviet Union. He {{was to be}} treated by Ilizarov for a tibial fracture that healed incorrectly after a skiing accident ten years earlier. Italian doctors had long given up hope of any surgical improvement to the leg. Ilizarov distracted the stiff non-union in his tibia by 2 cm, healing the <b>pseudarthrosis,</b> corrected an equinus deformity by distraction and lengthened his leg. Mauri dubbed Ilizarov [...] "the Michelangelo of Orthopaedics". On his return to Italy, the healing of Mauri's leg amazed orthopaedic surgeons. Subsequent to this, Ilizarov was invited by Antonio Bianchi-Maiocchi and Roberto Cattaneo to be a guest speaker at the AO Italy conference in 1981 in Bellagio. He gave three lectures at the conferences to more than 200 participants from Italy, France, Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. At {{the end of the}} lectures, Ilizarov earned a ten-minute standing ovation. This was the first time Ilizarov spoke outside of the Iron Curtain.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} rhBMP-7 (a.k.a. OP-1; Stryker Biotech) for {{a humanitarian}} device exemption {{as an alternative}} to autograft in long bone nonunions. In 2004, the humanitarian device exemption was extended {{as an alternative to}} autograft for posterolateral fusion. In 2002, rhBMP-2 (Infuse; Medtronic) was approved for anterior lumbar interbody fusions (ALIFs) with a lumbar fusion device. In 2008 it was approved to repair posterolateral lumbar <b>pseudarthrosis,</b> open tibia shaft fractures with intramedullary nail fixation. In these products, BMPs are delivered {{to the site of the}} fracture by being incorporated into a bone implant, and released gradually to allow bone formation, as the growth stimulation by BMPs must be localized and sustained for some weeks. The BMPs are eluted through a purified collagen matrix which is implanted in the site of the fracture. rhBMP-2 helps grow bone better than any other rhBMP so it is much more widely used clinically. There is [...] "little debate or controversy" [...] about the effectiveness of rhBMP-2 to grow bone to achieve spinal fusions, and Medtronic generates $700 million in annual sales from their product.|$|E

40|$|A {{consecutive}} {{series of}} 23 aseptic pseudarthroses of the tibial shaft is proposed.

Twelve times the <b>pseudarthrosis</b> developed after a primary treatment with an external fixation device, 6 times after plaster cast immobilization, and 5 times after plate osteosynthesis.

40|$|Background: There {{have been}} few {{detailed}} reports concerning <b>pseudarthrosis</b> following spinal instrumentation and arthro-desis in adults with spinal deformity since the introduction of modern segmental fixation techniques. The {{purposes of this study}} were to analyze the prevalence, risk factors, and outcome scores on the Scoliosis Research Society Instrument- 24 associated with <b>pseudarthrosis</b> following instrumentation and arthrodesis for the treatment of spinal deformity in adults. Methods: A clinical and radiographic assessment of 232 adults with spinal deformity who were treated surgically at a single institution was conducted. The average age of the patients was 40. 8 years, and the operation was a primary procedure in 150 patients and a revision procedure in eighty-two patients. All patients who underwent a long (four ver-tebrae or more) spinal instrumentation and arthrodesis with a minimum follow-up of two years were included in the analysis. Clinical outcomes were assessed with the Scoliosis Research Society questionnaire. Results: Forty patients had a <b>pseudarthrosis.</b> Factors that were found to be significantly associated with pseudar-throsis were preoperative thoracolumbar kyphosis of> 20 Â° (p < 0. 0001), an age of more than fifty-five years (p = 0. 001), arthrodesis to S 1 compared with arthrodesis to L 5 or a cephalad level (p = 0. 002), and arthrodesis of more than twelve vertebrae (p = 0. 037).

These include conservative plaster cast treatment, bone graft without osteosynthesis, bone graft with Kirschner wires, percutaneous screws and bone graft with compression screws.

40|$|A {{complication}} after spinal fusion {{surgery is}} <b>pseudarthrosis,</b> but its radiological diagnosis is of limited value. F- 18 -fluoride PET with {{its ability to}} assess bone metabolism activity could be of value. The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the clinical feasibility of calculating the static standardized uptake value (SUV) from a short dynamic scan without the use of blood sampling, thereby obtaining all dynamic and static parameters in a scan of only 30 min. This approach was tested on a retrospective patient population with persisting pain after spinal fusion surgery. In 16 patients, SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean) and kinetic parameters (K (1), k (2), k (3), v (b), K (i,NLR), K (1) /k (2), k (3) /(k (2) + k (3)), K (i,patlak)) were derived from static and dynamic PET/CT scans of operated and control regions of the spine, after intravenous administration of 156 - 214 MBq F- 18 -fluoride. Parameter differences between control and operated regions, as well as between <b>pseudarthrosis</b> and fused segments were evaluated. SUVmean at 30 and 60 min was calculated from kinetic parameters obtained from the dynamic data set (SUVmean, 2 TCM). Agreement between measured and calculated SUVs was evaluated through Bland-Altman plots. Overall, statistically significant differences between control and operated regions were observed for SUVmax, SUVmean, K (i,NLR), K (i,patlak), K (1) /k (2) and k (3) /(k (2) + k (3)). Diagnostic CT showed <b>pseudarthrosis</b> in 6 / 16 patients, while in 10 / 16 patients, segments were fused. Of all parameters, only those regarding the incorporation of bone [K (i,NLR), K (i,patlak), k (3) /(k (2) + k (3)) ] differed statistically significant in the intervertebral disc space between the <b>pseudarthrosis</b> and fused patients group. The mean values of the patient-specific blood clearance rate differed statistically significant between the <b>pseudarthrosis</b> and the fusion group, with a p value of 0. 011. This may correspond with the lack of statistical significance of the SUV values between <b>pseudarthrosis</b> and fused patients. Bland-Altman plots show that calculated SUVmean, 2 TCM values corresponded well with the measured SUVmean values.
