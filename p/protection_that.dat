5|$|The NSS {{is headed}} by Baek San (Kim Yeong-cheol), its {{standing}} deputy director only in title and {{the man responsible for}} the recruiting of Hyun-jun and Sa-woo. The named director of the NSS comes and goes with each change of power in the presidency, but it is the deputy director that oversees the organization. Baek San's motivations for many of his actions are mysterious, occasionally outright inconsistent with that of the general national interests. Due to the very existence of the organization being kept secret, he enjoys a state of personal <b>protection</b> <b>that</b> few others do.|$|E
5|$|The initial Windows {{release was}} criticized by players for several {{perceived}} shortcomings. The game was shipped with SecuROM copy <b>protection</b> <b>that</b> required activation from 2K Games' servers over the Internet; the unavailability of these servers was reported {{as the reason}} for the cancellation of the game's midnight release in Australia. Players found that the SecuROM limited the number of times the game could be activated to two; user feedback led to 2K Games to increase the activation count to five, and later offer a tool that allowed users to revoke previous activations on their own. Ultimately 2K Games removed the activation limit, though retail versions of the game still required the activation process. Levine admitted that their initial approach to the activation process was malformed, harming their reputation during the launch period.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the prior}} three {{films in the}} series, the U.S. rating was PG-13 rather than R. An unrated version {{contained}} more strong profanity and violence not shown in the theatrical version, and {{was included in the}} DVD release. For the DVD release, 20th Century Fox pioneered a new kind of DRM, Digital Copy <b>protection</b> <b>that</b> tries to weaken the incentives for consumers to learn how to rip discs by offering them a downloadable version with studio-imposed restrictions. The score for the film was released on July 2, 2007. The fifth film in the series, titled A Good Day to Die Hard, was released on February 14, 2013.|$|E

5|$|Coke {{used his}} role in Parliament as a leading {{opposition}} MP to attack patents, a system he had already criticised as a judge. Historically, English patent law was based on custom and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents {{as a form of}} economic protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the Crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law concerning patents. To boost England's economy, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering letters of <b>protection</b> <b>that</b> protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather they acted as a passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade. This process continued for three centuries, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies. The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch because of the potential for raising revenue; a patentee was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest {{as a result of the}} patent was normally directed at the patentee, not the monarch.|$|E
5|$|Kosovo Albanians were {{generally}} less hospitable to Jews {{than their counterparts}} in Albania. Due to their historical experiences with Serbs and the Ottoman Empire, they tended to be more unfriendly towards local non-Albanians. Many enthusiastically supported the Germans as a result. Claims have been made that Kosovo Albanians protected Jews after German forces took over territories that Italian authorities had controlled during the war, but the <b>protection</b> <b>that</b> Jews received in Kosovo {{in the early years of}} the war was due more to the Italian authorities than to the local Albanian population. It is estimated that 210 Jews from Kosovo perished during the war. An official Yugoslav state report published in 1964 recorded 74 Jewish wartime fatalities in the region. Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Albania, Kosovo and other Albanian-controlled territories during the war. A somewhat greater number, as well as several hundred refugees, hid and survived with the assistance of the local Albanian population.|$|E
5|$|Pownall's work {{identified}} him as supportive of American liberty. Although he feared that Britain was losing control of its colonies, he wrote that the Americans were entitled to the same rights of representative government as their fellow subjects in England, Scotland, and Wales. At the same time, he insisted that the military <b>protection</b> <b>that</b> the colonists received from Britain created equally extensive obligations {{to help pay for}} some of the cost. He was also convinced of the need for a strong, central legislature capable of making common policies that would be binding for every member of the British empire, including the fractious provinces in North America. Pownall eventually decided that the only solution lay in creating an imperial parliament with representatives from both Britain and the colonies. Although he was not the only British commentator to embrace the idea of an imperial parliament, most Americans found it anathema, so much so that John Dickinson singled out his centralized plan of legislative reform for particular criticism in his influential Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania (1768).|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} released for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, running at a display resolution of 320Ã—200 pixels. These versions received less play-testing than other versions, making for a less-fluid game, but the Amiga's sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports. The game released on the Atari ST is identical, {{but with a}} less refined sound, and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga. These versions had code wheel <b>protection</b> <b>that</b> {{made it difficult to}} use unauthorized copies, forcing the player to enter a code (series of figures) looked up from a code wheel that came with the game. The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game is loaded in order to reload the game. Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester would yell as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions; this feature was omitted from most other versions.|$|E
5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more room than geared turbines to allow for better underwater <b>protection</b> <b>that</b> wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their optimum speed, without regard to propeller speed, which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that the motors could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Also, the ship could go astern at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy to reverse this decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of machinery spaces and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E
