The general trend in the world division of labour is for hi-tech, financial and marketing services to be located in the richer countries, which hold most intellectual property rights and actual physical production to be located in low-wage countries. Effectively, Marxian economists argue, this means that the labour of workers in wealthy countries is valued higher than the labour of workers in poorer countries.

30|$|The {{parameter}} ρ is also {{crucial for}} explaining {{the impact of}} υ (n) on both the total unpaid work (i.e. h[1 +υ (n)]) and paid work. We can distinguish three cases. If ρ < 1, {{an increase in the}} time spent rearing children per unit of home labor will raise the number of total unpaid hours worked and reduce that of <b>paid</b> <b>hours.</b> This is because the increase in the marginal cost of home labor cannot be offset with the rise in intermediate goods, given that c^x and h are close complements. Moreover, given that leisure does not depend on υ (n), the increase in υ (n) has the opposite effect on <b>paid</b> <b>hours.</b> If ρ = 1, the increase in υ (n) will have no effect on the total time devoted to unpaid labor, since households offset the rise of υ (n) with a proportional increase in intermediate goods. And if ρ > 1, a rise in υ (n) leads to a drop in the total number of unpaid hours because households substitute home labor for intermediate goods.|$|E
40|$|Using {{cross-sections}} of microdata from Surveys of Consumer Finance and Surveys of Labour and Income Dynamics, we document {{changes in}} the availability {{of time and money}} in Canadian two-parent families between 1971 and 2006 as the paid work hours of mothers have increased. While long hours of paid work were mostly characteristic of higher-income families during the 1970 's, by 2006 over half of families supplying more than 80 <b>paid</b> <b>hours</b> are from {{the bottom half of the}} income distribution.

Canadian time use data from 1992 and 2006 confirm larger increases in parental time stress for low-income than for high-income families. Since, controlling income, high paid work hours are negatively correlated with life satisfaction, our results suggest that inequality of well-being may have increased even more than inequality of income over recent decades. While some policy attention has been directed at supporting incomes of modest income families with children, we identify a policy gap in alleviating time pressures for these families, after the first year...|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} causes and {{consequences}} of <b>paid</b> working <b>hours</b> and housework hours among {{women and men in}} Sweden and Europe. It consists of four studies. Study I investigates changes in the division of housework in Swedish couples when they become parents. The study shows that women adjust their housework hours to the number and age of children in the household, whereas men do not. Longer parental leave periods among fathers have the potential to counteract this change towards a more traditional division of housework. Study II explores the associations between psychological distress and <b>paid</b> working <b>hours,</b> housework hours and total role time in Sweden. The results suggest that women’s psychological distress decreases with increasing <b>paid</b> working <b>hours</b> and housework hours, but that a long total role time is associated with high levels of distress. The gender difference in time spent on housework accounts for 40 per cent of the gender difference in psychological distress. Study III asks whether <b>hours</b> spent on <b>paid</b> work and housework account for the European gender difference in well-being, and whether the associations between well-being and <b>hours</b> of <b>paid</b> work and housework is influenced by gender attitudes and social comparison. The results indicate that gender differences in time spent on paid work and housework account for a third of the gender difference in well-being. Gender attitudes and social comparison do not to any great extent influence the associations between well-being and paid work and housework, respectively. Study IV examines possible differences between European family policy models in the associations between well-being and <b>hours</b> of <b>paid</b> work and housework. Some model differences are found, and they are accounted for by experiences of work-family conflict among men, but not among women. For both women and men, work-family conflict appears to suppress positive aspects of <b>paid</b> working <b>hours...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives. We {{describe}} how paid and unpaid home care hours received by older unmarried Americans change {{in response to}} disability dynamics. We test whether responses to disability declines and improvements are symmetric; that is, we test whether reductions in care hours that are due to disability improvements are of similar magnitude to increases in care hours that are due to disability declines. Methods. Using a national sample of older unmarried Americans, we examine changes in total hours, <b>paid</b> <b>hours,</b> and unpaid hours of care in response to declines and improvements in personal care (activities of daily living, or ADLs) and routine care (instrumental ADLs, or IADLs) disability. We model changes in the total hours of care received {{in the past month}} and jointly model changes in unpaid and <b>paid</b> <b>hours,</b> using Tobit models. Results. Changes in the total hours of care received respond to both increases and decreases in the count of ADL limitations and appear close to symmetric. In contrast, responses to IADL disability dynamics appear to be far less symmetric: Although increases in the count of IADL limitations are met with substantial increases in the total hours of care, decreases are not met with correspondingly large declines in care. The same general pattern is found for unpaid and paid care, and for Medicaid-funded home care. Discussion. Disability and care are not static constructs in old age. Older unmarried persons experience worsening, stabilizing, and recovery of function, and their care hours change accordingly. Evaluations of home care programs must b...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to identify various determinants of human capital development among Canadian youth. Three mediating agents are examined: parents, schools, and government. Considerable attention is paid throughout to identifying causal relationships with empirical data. The first chapter introduces the thesis by discussing its main goals, {{as well as the}} importance of the topic. This chapter also summarizes each of the following substantive chapters. I explore the relationship between family size and various components of the child quality production function in the second chapter. The findings suggest that larger families lead to reduced parental investments in children. Despite this, standardized test scores do not decline with family size. Three possible reasons for this puzzle are explored. In the third chapter, I estimate the relationship between fertility and the allocation of paid and unpaid labour among couples. Results indicate that additional children lead to a reduction in <b>paid</b> <b>hours</b> and to an even larger increase in unpaid hours among mothers. Additional children are not related to paternal <b>paid</b> <b>hours,</b> although fathers spend slightly more time performing unpaid childcare. In the fourth chapter, I estimate the impact of schooling on academic performance in high school. Additional schooling is associated with significant improvements in reading, mathematics, and science performance, but it confers the same benefits in each area to students across the conditional distribution of academic performance, as well as to both sexes and to students from high and low income families. I examine the relationship between prospective student debt load and postsecondary attendance in the fifth chapter. The results indicate that reduced prospective debt load raise university enrolment only among students facing lower net returns to attending. The final chapter summarizes the findings, highlights the contributions to the literature, discusses policy implications, and sets forth directions for future research.

40|$|Over {{the last}} forty years, {{the gap between}} men and women with respect to labor-market outcomes, <b>paid</b> <b>hours</b> of work, hours working at home, occupations, college majors, and {{education}} levels in the United States has narrowed or disappeared. We ask whether these substantial changes in women's lives—changes in precisely the variables that have seemed to matter so much to our understanding of political participation—have enabled women's political action in the United States. We find that they have not, and we suggest that the brakes on the translation of education and occupation into political participation come from continuing ambivalence about jobs and careers. Of course, these ambivalent attitudes may very well reflect a reality about the complications of workforce participation in a world with unequal and limited access to childcare, parental leave, high-paying jobs, and opportunities for career advancement...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the nature, extent {{and costs of}} injuries to health care workers caused by physical abuse. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Large acute and tertiary care teaching hospital in Winnipeg. PARTICIPANTS: All health care workers at the hospital who filed reports of abuse-related injuries and of verbal abuse and threatening behaviour from Apr. 1, 1991, to Mar. 31, 1993. OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of physical and verbal abuse of hospital personnel according to job category, type of injury, hours of staff time lost and estimates of costs compensated for abuse-related injuries. RESULTS: Of the 242 reported abuse-related injuries 194 (80. 2 %) occurred among the nursing personnel. The nurses in the medical units filed most (33. 1 %) of the reports. Although the psychiatric nurses filed fewer reports (35 [14. 5 %]) they had {{the highest rate of}} injuries per 100, 000 <b>paid</b> <b>hours</b> among the nursing staff. Not surprisingly, the security officers were at highest risk, 53. 5 % having reported an abuse-related injury for a rate of 16. 8 such injuries per 100, 000 <b>paid</b> <b>hours.</b> Male staff members had a higher injury rate than their female counterparts in all occupational groups. Bruising or crushing was the most frequent type of injury (in 126 cases); the next most frequent were cuts and lacerations (in 47) and human bites and exposures to blood or body fluids (in 23). However, the 36 sprains and strains resulted in the largest amount of time lost. In all, over 8000 hours were lost due to abuse-related injuries, and over $ 76, 000 was paid in workers' compensation benefits. Concurrently, 646 incidents of verbal abuse and threatening behaviour were reported. Only three abuse-related injuries and two incidents of verbal abuse were reported by physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Abuse-related injuries to health care workers in an urban hospital are prevalent, serious and can be costly in terms of time off work and compensation.
