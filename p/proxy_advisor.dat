Motivated by regulatory concerns about third party proxy advisors that provide summarized voting recommendations to subscribing shareholders, this study investigates: i) the determinants of proxy advisors 2 ̆ 7 recommendations on auditor ratification (For or Against), ii) whether these recommendations affect voting outcomes, and iii) whether an Against recommendation leads to subsequent changes in the auditor-client relationship. The results indicate that proxy advisors {{are more likely to}} recommend that shareholders vote Against auditor ratification when the engagement letter limits the auditor 2 ̆ 7 s liability, when the auditor provides excessive nonaudit services, and when audit quality appears to be low. While the association between <b>proxy</b> <b>advisor</b> recommendations and shareholder voting is statistically significant, it {{does not appear to be}} economically significant when compared with the results from prior studies examining the influence of proxy advisors in other settings. Finally, when using a matched sample design, neither <b>proxy</b> <b>advisor</b> recommendations nor shareholder voting outcomes are associated with subsequent changes in the auditor-client relationship, suggesting that companies do not respond to voiced concerns about the auditor. These findings should be of interest to researchers examining the impact of the auditor ratification vote and to regulators evaluating the involvement of proxy advisors in auditor ratification...|$|E

Moreover, we also find that proxy advisory recommendations have become more supportive of shareholder proposals.

40|$|<b>Proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> have {{dramatically}} transformed shareholder voting. Traditionally, even large institutional investors tended {{to follow the}} Wall Street Rule — vote with management or sell your stock — because the economics did not justify incurring any expense in deciding how to vote. The emergence of <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> who perform <b>proxy</b> research for a modest fee paid by each of thousands of institutions now enables these investors to vote intelligently. New laws and rules have also expanded the range of matters on which shareholders vote. Because of these developments, business managements can no ignore but must cater to shareholder interests. However, corporate managers resent being dethroned. They are mounting a campaign to press the SEC to impose new regulations to hobble <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> and, thereby, to neutralize institutional shareholders. This article reviews the charges leveled against <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> and the new regulations proposed by their critics. It finds the complaints mostly unwarranted.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{information}} content {{and consequences of}} third-party voting advice issued during proxy contests. Focusing on recommendations by a leading <b>proxy</b> <b>advisor,</b> we find significant abnormal stock returns around the dates recommendations become public. The economic interpretation is that voting advice conveys new information to the market. To investigate the precise nature of this information, we develop a two-stage procedure for decomposing price changes in response to interim news about future events into two components: The price impact of revisions in outcome-contingent expected valuations and the price impact of updated outcome probabilities. Applying this decomposition to interim voting recommendations and the subsequent contest outcomes, we find a robust statistical association between recommendations and contest outcome probabilities after controlling for contest characteristics, voting rules, and ownership levels of dissidents and incumbents. We also find evidence that advisory recommendations play a certification role by conveying information to investors about outcome-contingent stock valuations. The implication of our findings is that proxy advice plays a dual informationa...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{regulatory}} changes increasing shareholder voting authority {{have focused}} attention {{on the role of}} proxy advisors. In particular, greater shareholder empowerment raises the question of how much proxy advisors influence voting outcomes. This Article analyzes the significance of voting recommendations issued by four proxy advisory firms in connection with uncontested director elections. We find, consistent with press reports, that Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is the most powerful <b>proxy</b> <b>advisor</b> and that, of the others, only Glass, Lewis 2 ̆ 6 Co. seems to have a meaningful impact on shareholder voting. This Article also attempts to measure the impact of voting recommendations on voting outcomes. Unlike prior literature, it distinguishes correlation from causality by examining both the recommendation itself and the underlying factors that may influence a shareholder’s vote. Using several different tests, we conclude that popular accounts substantially overstate the influence of ISS. Our findings reveal that the impact of an ISS recommendation is reduced greatly once company- and firm-specific factors important to investors are taken into consideration.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two distinct chapters. In the first chapter, I study the outsourc-ing of corporate governance to proxy advisory firms, which are third-party advisors that help institutional investors decide which way to vote on corporate governance issues. Advising equity assets in trillions of dollars, these advisors play a powerful role in shaping corporate governance. First, I model how conflicts of interest arise when a <b>proxy</b> <b>advisor</b> provides advisory services to investors as well as consulting services to corporations on the same governance issues. The advisor can issue biased voting recommendations when expected reputation costs are low, compared to consulting fees. I then study how increased competi-tion can alleviate these conflicts. Using a unique dataset on voting recommendations, I show that the entry of a new advisory firm reduces favorable recommendations for management proposals by the incumbent advisor. This is consistent with our theory as the incumbent is subject to conflicts of interest by serving both investors and corporations.

40|$|In {{anticipation}} of proxy season-the springtime ritual where companies prepare and deliver proxy statements {{in preparation for}} annual shareholder meetings-U. S. public companies typically reexamine their corporate governance structures and policies. Many corporate governance structures that were acceptable ten years ago are now considered outmoded or even evidence of managerial entrenchment. For example, consider the classified board of directors. In recent years, many companies have shifted from a classified board of directors to an annually elected board. A company might adopt an annually-elected board structure {{for a number of}} reasons. A classified board can serve as an entrenchment device, for instance, and so the company may hope to increase the accountability to shareholders that such a structure entails. Likewise, there may be legitimate reasons to retain a classified board of directors, such as the negotiating leverage a classified structure provides the board {{in the context of a}} hostile takeover. As a company considers such a change, however, high-minded considerations of the optimal governance structure do not always, and probably do not regularly, drive the discussion. Instead, the primary consideration is often that Institutional Shareholder Services (2 ̆ 2 ISS 2 ̆ 2) or another <b>proxy</b> <b>advisor</b> is opposed to classified boards, and the firm feels compelled to make the change in order to improve its corporate governance rating even though the change may have no beneficial effect on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s corporate governance or performance...|$|E
40|$|Using a dataset of proxy {{recommendations}} and voting results for uncontested director elections from 2005 and 2006 at S 2 ̆ 6 P 1500 companies, we examine how advisors make their recommendations. Of the four firms we study, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), Proxy Governance (PGI), Glass Lewis (GL), and Egan Jones (EJ), ISS {{has the largest}} market share and {{is widely regarded as}} the most influential. We find that the four proxy advisory firms differ substantially from each other both in their willingness to issue a withhold recommendation and in the factors that affect their recommendation. It is not clear that these differences, or the bases for the recommendations, are transparent to the institutions that purchase proxy advisory services. If the differences are not apparent, investors may not accurately perceive the information content associated with a withhold recommendation, and investors may rely on those recommendations based on an erroneous understanding of the basis for that recommendation. To the extent that proxy advisors aggregate information for the purpose of facilitating an informed shareholder vote, these limitations may impair the effectiveness of the shareholder franchise. If the differences are apparent, our results show that investors, though selecting a <b>proxy</b> <b>advisor,</b> can indirectly choose the bases for their vote on directors. To that extent, it is likely that proxy advisory firms will retain more investor clients if their recommendations are based on factors that their clients consider relevant...|$|E
40|$|Proxy {{advisory}} firms wield large {{influence with}} voting shareholders. However, {{conflicts of interest}} may arise when an advisor sells services to both investors and issuers. Using a unique data set on voting recommendations, I find that for most types of proposals, competition from a new entrant reduces favoritism toward management by an incumbent advisor that serves both corporations and investors. The results are not driven by factors that influence the entrant’s coverage decision, such as the marginal cost of new coverage or previously biased recommendations by the incumbent. Similar to other information intermediaries, biased advice by <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> is shown to have real, negative consequences that allow management to enjoy greater private benefits.

40|$|The {{literature}} on shareholder voting has mostly {{focused on the}} influence of <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> on shareholder votes.

Analyzing shareholder votes on the frequency of future say on pay (SOP) votes, we find that a management recommendation for a particular frequency is associated with a 26 percent increase in voting support for that frequency. Additional tests suggest that the documented association is likely to capture a causal effect. Management influence varies across firms and is smaller at firms where perceived management credibility is lower. Compared to firms adopting an annual frequency, firms following management's recommendation to adopt a triennial frequency are significantly less likely to change their compensation practices in response to an adverse SOP vote, consistent with the notion that a less frequent vote results in lower management accountability...|$|R

The second chapter of the thesis assesses the value of access to public transportation in Beijing, a megacity suffering from severe traffic congestion. Existing urban economic theory states that traffic congestion is welfare reducing. In practice, policymakers in congested cities invest heavily in public transit systems to reduce transportation costs. However, not all public transit modes are created equal [...] those that help alleviate traffic congestion are the most desirable. Using a unique panel dataset of Beijing's residential properties on sale between 2003 and 2005, I find strong evidence that traffic delays translate into lower housing prices, confirming that congestion is costly. Moreover, I show that announcements of metro line construction inflate prices of properties near future stations, and the increase is even more staggering for more congested areas. This suggests that metro lines are expected to reduce adverse impacts of congestion. However, additional bus routes are not capitalized into prices because buses move slowly in the gridlocked city, often exacerbating rather than alleviating congestion.

40|$|Following the {{publication}} of the ESMA Final Report and Feedback Statement on the Consultation Regarding the Role of the Proxy Advisory Industry in February 2013, a number of industry members formed a committee under the independent chairmanship of Prof. Dr. Dirk Andreas Zetzsche, LL. M. (Toronto), to develop an industry code of conduct. The “Best Practice Principles for Providers of Shareholder Voting Research & Analysis” were published in April 2014. With this report, the chair aims to make the committee’s work and discussions transparent to facilitate the application of the provisions and enhance understanding of the reasoning behind their adoption. The report also aims to enhance transparency and understanding on the functioning of Providers of Shareholder Voting Research & Analysis (to which is commonly referred to as the <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors)</b> and their role in corporate governance and assist in creating a more informed discussion. The report is structured as follows: After an introduction (sub 1.), I describe the composition and work organization of the drafting committee for the Principles (sub 2.), before I explain the Committee’s as well as the Chair’s position on the certain provisions of the Principles (sub 3.). The report discusses, inter alia, the scope of the Principles, the Committee’s general approach, the delineation of responsibility between <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors,</b> institutional investors and issuers that forms the basis of the Principles, the attitude of the industry towards local governance standards, and how Signatories should deal with conflicts of interests. A major section of the report is devoted to the communication between issuers and Providers of Shareholder Voting Research & Analysis (sub 4.). In particular I explain why a mandatory distribution of research report to issuers would put the providers’ commitment vis-à-vis their clients (the investors) at risk.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the economic role of <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> (PAs) {{in the context}} of mandatory “say on pay” votes, a novel and complex item requiring significant firm-specific analysis. PAs are more likely to issue an Against recommendation at firms with poor performance and higher levels of CEO pay and do not appear to follow a “one-size-fits-all” approach. PAs’ recommendations are the key determinant of voting outcome but the sensitivity of shareholder votes to these recommendations varies with the institutional ownership structure, and the rationale behind the recommendation, suggesting that at least some shareholders do not blindly follow these recommendations. More than half of the firms respond to the adverse shareholder vote triggered by a negative recommendation by engaging with investors and making changes to their compensation plan. However, we find no market reaction to the announcement of such changes, even when material enough to result in a favorable recommendation and vote the following year. Our findings suggest that, rather than identifying and promoting superior compensation practices, PAs' key economic role is processing a substantial amount of executive pay information on behalf of institutional investors, hence reducing their cost of making informed voting decisions. Our findings contribute to the literature on shareholder voting and the related policy debate...|$|R
40|$|Research Question/Issue: We {{investigate}} the indirect effect of board’s demographic diversity on firm performance via board monitoring {{in a context}} where boards are relatively homogenous with respect to structural diversity, using data from Turkey. We contextualize our investigation by exploring the influence of ownership configurations {{on the effect of}} diversity. Research Findings/Insights: We find a positive and non-linear relationship between demographic diversity and performance, mediated by the board’s monitoring efforts. The effect of monitoring is found to be contingent upon (moderated by) the controlling shareholders’ propensity to expropriate, measured by the deviation of control rights from cash flow rights, i. e. the wedge. We report that demographic diversity enhances firm performance by mitigating the negative effect of wedge on board monitoring. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results provide empirical support for the importance of contextual factors in the relationship between diversity and performance. Our framework and t confound diversity and board-monitoring indices we constructed may prove useful to researchers. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators can use our findings in formulating recommendations or regulations related to desirable characteristics of boards. Our results are also instructive for investors and <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> and indicate that the mere existence of monitoring vehicles may be insufficient to prevent expropriation by dominant shareholders, but diverse boards may mitigate the propensity to expropriate. Board members and shareholders should also benefit from the findings in creating boards that are more diligent monitors...|$|R
40|$|This {{symposium}} essay summarizes our ongoing ethnographic {{research on}} corporate board diversity. This research {{is based on}} fifty-seven interviews with corporate directors and {{a limited number of}} other persons of interest (including institutional investors, executive search professionals, and <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors)</b> regarding their views on race and gender diversity in the boardroom. Using a method rooted in anthropology and discourse analysis, we have worked from a general topic outline and conducted open-ended interviews in which respondents are encouraged to raise and develop issues of interest to them. The interviews range from forty-five minutes to two hours in length and each interview is taped and transcribed. As a group, we then listen to each taped interview at least once with transcript in hand, analyzing each interview qualitatively with a focus on the themes that the respondents identify, the emphases given to these themes, the stories (or narratives) that they tell, and the details of the language that they use. We also thematically code the transcripts and use sorting software to get another, complementary view of the frequency and distribution of the various themes. As we discuss at length in other published work, there are numerous tensions in directors’ accounts of race and gender in the boardroom. In this essay, we discuss what we view as the central tension in our respondents’ views on corporate board diversity—their overwhelmingly enthusiastic support of board diversity coupled with an inability to articulate coherent accounts of board diversity benefits that might rationalize that enthusiasm...|$|R
40|$|The “comply or explain” {{principle}} {{has already}} acquired significant importance in corporate {{law and regulations}} and {{is considered to be}} the preferred regulatory tool in the EU for increasing transparency and disclosure of market participants’ strategies and activities. The flexibility of the principle is perceived as the most suitable way to create indirect coordination of practices amongst market actors, as well as better mutual understanding of their different priorities. Having initially shown its considerable appeal in the area of corporate governance statements issued by corporate entities, it has now expanded its influence into other areas serving similar transparency imperatives, such as the exercise of stewardship responsibilities by institutional investors and <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors.</b> In this paper, we will focus on the merits and shortfalls of the “comply or explain” principle in all the above-mentioned areas, both at national and at EU levels, and will critically challenge its effectiveness in the current regulatory framework. Moreover, we will seek to justify its continued use by demonstrating its future potential role as a veritable dialogue spectrum between different market participants. Lastly, we will emphasise the need for a soft monitoring process from national regulators which will enable both the “comply or explain” principle and its users to participate in a holistic effort for the adoption of sound investment strategies via the fruitful exchange of views and ideas and better communication with regard to their respective role in capital markets...|$|R
40|$|Institutional {{investors are}} often criticized for their {{insufficient}} “engagement”with listed companies. Actually, information and other transaction costs limit {{their capacity to}} actively monitor investee firms, and to engage with their management. A partial solution is offered by <b>Proxy</b> <b>Advisors</b> (PAs), providing <b>proxy</b> voting services on a subscription basis. We use Say-On-Pay (SOP) in Italian listed firms to investigate PA activity and (institutional) shareholder voting behavior. Making use of a unique dataset, including information on how each shareholder voted in 2012, we analyze the behavior of different classes of shareholders and their relation with PA recommendations. Our main results can be summarized as follows: i) while shareholder dissent on SOP is low, {{in line with what}} happens in other developed countries, dissent by institutional investors is surprisingly high; ii) the voting behavior of institutional investors is strongly correlated with PA recommendations. The influence of PAs is higher on nonblockholders (mostly internationally diversified pension and mutual funds) than on blockholders; iii) preliminary estimates show that the influence of PAs in Italy is at least as strong as (and probably stronger than) that observed in the US. This is coherent with the weight of non-domestic institutions, which can be hardly expected to independently analyze thousands of firms; and it is especially so in Italy, where most listed firms may be classified as small/medium cap firms on a comparative basis; iv) institutional investors, however, do not take PA recommendations at face value, but focus on the specific reasons of concern underlined in the reports (in particular, on the structure and long-term value creation of the remuneration policy).

40|$|Eighty-two {{percent of}} public firms have golden parachutes (or “chutes”) under which CEOs and senior {{officers}} may be paid {{tens of millions}} of dollars upon their employer’s change in control. What justifies such extraordinary payouts? Much of the conventional analysis views chutes as excessive compensation granted by captured boards, focusing on the payouts that occur following a takeover. Those explanations, if they ever were complete, miss the mark today. This Article demonstrates, theoretically and empirically, that chutes are less relevant to a firm during a takeover than they are before a takeover, particularly in relation to firms that invest in innovation. Chutes assure managers of realizing the long-term value of their work, even if the firm is later acquired. As a result, managers are more likely to make specific investments in innovation whose value may not be realized for some time — but that which are essential to sustaining long-term performance. Moreover, when granted, a chute’s expected cost is a small fraction of what may be paid, reflecting the real likelihood a payment will never be made. That cost is more than offset by the value of the specific investments in innovation that managers are now more likely to make. Consequently, granting chutes tends to increase the value of innovative firms — promoting, rather than jeopardizing, shareholder interests in such firms. Nevertheless, an analysis of chutes as a valuable tool in promoting innovation is largely missing from the corporate law scholarship, with important consequences. Two, in particular, are the negative view of <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> on chutes, and recent federal Say-on-Golden-Parachute legislation that mandates certain types of disclosure regarding chutes. We recommend changes that properly reflect the low expected cost of chutes and their positive effect on innovation...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrity}} of shareholder voting {{is critical to}} the legitimacy of corporate law. One threat to this process is proxy “bundling,” or the joinder of more than one separate item into a single proxy proposal. Bundling deprives shareholders of the right to convey their views on each separate matter being put to a vote and forces them to either reject the entire proposal or approve items they might not otherwise want implemented. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of the anti-bundling rules adopted by the SEC in 1992. While we find that the courts have carefully developed a framework for the proper scope and application of the rules, the SEC and proxy advisory firms have been less vigilant in defending this instrumental shareholder right. In particular, we note that the most recent SEC interpretive guidance has undercut the effectiveness of the existing rules, and that, surprisingly, proxy advisory firms do not have well-defined heuristics to discourage bundling. Building on the theoretical framework, this Article provides the first large-scale empirical study of bundling of management proposals. We develop four possible definitions of impermissible bundling, and, utilizing a data set of over 1, 500 management proposals, show that the frequency of bundling in our sample ranges from 6. 2 percent to 28. 8 percent (depending on which of the four bundling definitions is used). It is apparent that bundling occurs far more frequently than indicated by prior studies. We further examine our data to report the items that are most frequently bundled and to analyze the proxy advisors’ recommendations and the voting patterns associated with bundled proposals. This Article concludes with important implications for the SEC, <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors,</b> and institutional investors as to how each party can more effectively deter impermissible bundling and thus better protect the shareholder franchise...|$|R
40|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) {{appears to}} be on the verge of {{requiring}} investment advisers to undergo third party examinations. One justification for the rulemaking is that the Commission lacks sufficient resources to examine advisers frequently enough. Another is to create indirectly a self-regulatory organization (SRO) for investments advisers. Both may leave a rulemaking particularly vulnerable to challenge as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act. This Article considers three novel grounds on which a rulemaking may be successfully challenged. Congress has repeatedly rejected SEC requests to provide additional funding for examinations or to create an adviser SRO. This Article speculates that the rulemaking could be successfully challenged on the grounds that it usurps Congress’s power of the purse by imposing an unauthorized tax on investment advisers, and/or Congress’s authority to authorize the creation of an adviser SRO. On firmer ground, the Article discusses the risk that Section 206 (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, under which a third party examination rule would likely be adopted, does not authorize such broad rulemaking. Such a challenge could not only defeat the rulemaking, but also undermine the viability of other rules adopted under Section 206 (4). This Article also considers some of the numerous examples of third party examiners that could provide useful models for a third party examination rule for advisers. It surveys seven types of third party examiners in order to provide a framework for thinking about how a third party compliance rule might be designed: nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; <b>proxy</b> firm <b>advisors,</b> the CFA Institute, public company auditors, compliance consultants, chief compliance officers, and surprise and internal controls auditors. Each examiner serves a distinctly different third party examination role and their regulation is equally varied, if not always consistent...|$|R
40|$|Eumedion is a Dutch {{foundation}} {{representing the}} interests of Dutch and foreign institutional investors with investments in Dutch listed companies. In particular, it represents {{the interests of}} these participants {{in the field of}} corporate governance and sustainability. The foundation was established in 2006 with the objective to maintain and develop good corporate governance and sustainability performance by listed companies and institutional investors in the Netherlands and Europe. In this report, we address the following research question: To what extent has Eumedion contributed to the development and improvement of corporate governance and sustainability in the Netherlands during the 2006 - 2015 period? We analyze Eumedion’s contribution by using a theoretical framework that describes the process of developing norms of corporate governance and sustainability. These norms describe how (good) corporate governance and sustainability should look like. The process of developing norms can be broken down in three stages, i. e. norm setting, norm spreading and norm implementation. Our analysis describes how Eumedion is actively involved in all three stages. The analysis in this report is based on a large data base consisting of documents that are publicly available from Eumedion’s website as well as documents we obtained from Eumedion’s secretariat and consists of Eumedion’s Corporate Governance Manual, policy plans (beleidsplannen), annual reports, position papers, comment letters, consultation documents, focus letters, company dialogues, company alerts, and annual evaluations of annual general meetings of shareholders (AMGs). Moreover, we collected information about the media attention for Eumedion. The data covers the period 2005 - 2016. Finally, we held interviews with fourteen important actors in the Dutch and international corporate governance field who shared their experiences with and ideas and perceptions about the activities of Eumedion. Our analysis reveals the following results. In the norm setting stage, norms regarding corporate governance and sustainability are established. Eumedion has been actively involved in this process, first of all by writing consultation reactions and sending comment letters to Dutch and European institutions directly involved in setting norms. In particular, it is frequently communicating with the Dutch Ministry of Finance, the European Union Institutions and (committees of) the Dutch House of Representatives, because they are most important in setting corporate governance and sustainability norms. The analysis also shows that Eumedion is discussing a wide range of corporate governance and sustainability topics in its interactions with these institutions. Yet, over time the emphasis of topics discussed shifted from more traditional corporate governance topics (such as shareholder rights and remuneration) to financial and non-financial reporting {{and the role of the}} internal auditing function and external auditor. During the 2008 - 2012 it was particularly active on issues related to the financial markets and banking industry as a consequence of the global financial crisis. Finally, our analysis reveals that Eumedion has joined committees and boards of organizations that are important in establishing corporate governance and sustainaibilty norms, both in, as well as outside, the Netherlands. Next to the consultation reactions and comment letter, Eumedion produces position papers (since 2008), which are aimed at boosting discussions about norm setting and/or changes. Eumedion has been very active in writing these papers, especially during the years 2014 - 2016, signaling its active role in debates as a thought leader. The majority of these papers deal with topics related to the powers of shareholders and disclosures. Eumedion is also active in several Dutch and international committees in which norm setting regarding corporate governance and sustainability is discussed and developed. Eumedion’s network of organizations in which it participates has widened considerably over the years. During the second stage, norms are spread, or diffused, to the parties in the field who are supposed to act according to these norms. In order to make sure they act upon the norms, they should be made aware of them. Most importantly, Eumedion is active at this stage of the norm development process by annually issuing so-called focus letters, which are sent to Dutch listed companies and in which it communicates the most important topics for institutional investors for the next reporting and AGM season. Our review of these letters shows that they discuss a wide range of topics with an emphasis on the procedures regarding the organization of AGMs, content and accountability of remuneration policies, corporate risk analysis, risk management and control and reporting issues. The overview also shows that over the years the focus of the focus letters has shifted towards addressing risk and reporting issues. Evaluating the effectiveness of the focus letters suggests that they have had a significant impact on corporate governance behavior of Dutch listed companies and other related actors. The fact that Eumedion puts and keeps issues on the agenda of discussions about corporate governance between management and shareholders stimulates companies to address these issues. During its early years (2006 - 2009) Eumedion was mostly involved in norm setting and norm spreading. Since 2009, it became more and more involved in the third stage of the norm development process. During this stage, it is evaluated whether and to what extent norms are being implemented by companies. Eumedion again is actively involved in this stage. First of all, it has annual dialogues with a selection of Dutch listed companies, during which it communicates its observations and discusses its opinion on how norms should be applied by a specific company. Moreover, in case of controversial proposals made by company management at the AGM it may start the so-called alert procedure, which may lead to sending out an official alert to the company and Eumedion’s participants. In this alert, it describes why it would like to see the proposal to be withdrawn or changed. Our evaluation of the use of company dialogues and alert service suggests that they played an important role in making norm implementation by participants a coordinated activity, i. e. it helped professionalizing the norm implementation process. They also helped Eumedion becoming increasingly influential in determining the debates over governance and sustainability both within the board room as well as during AGMs. Combining the empirical evaluation of the documents with the content of the expert interviews reveals the following picture. First, although Eumedion is a small organization, it has been able to make a significant and positive contribution to all three stages of the norm development process in the Netherlands during the past ten years. It is taken into account as a serious partner in discussions during policy developments by important decision makers, management and supervisory board of companies and other relevant parties, both domestically as well as internationally. Moreover, Eumedion is seen as a serious knowledge centre and an active and respected organization representing shareholder interests. Second, Eumedion has been actively involved in discussing a broad spectrum of corporate goverance and sustainability issues, i. e. from traditional corporate governance topics, such as shareholder rights and remuneration to corporate social responsibility and tax avoidance. Third, Eumedion has helped creating an environment in which there is a permanent dialogue between company management and investors during, but certainly also outside, the AGM. It has been successful in getting and keeping important governance issues on the agenda, in establishing closer and more informative relationships between management and shareholders, and in helping to make sure that shareholders are taken more seriously. It has also stimulated institutional investors to take their role as engaged shareholders more seriously. Fourth, with respect to the implementation of norms, Eumedion may have been less effective in some cases in changing company behavior because it is a relatively small player. For some of the companies with which it has a dialogue and/or sends out an alert, Eumedion represents only a small part of outstanding shares. Moreover, companies focus more on internationally operating <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors</b> such as ISS and Glass Lewis, because foreign institutional investors mostly look at the advice given by these <b>proxy</b> <b>advisors,</b> instead of looking at the alerts issued by Eumedion. Fifth, Eumedion has a limited mandate to speak on behalf of its participants in its communication with companies. The issue of the mandate of the representative of institutional investors in the Netherlands has been on the table ever since its predecessor, the SCGOP was established; Eumedion as its successor “inherited” this discussion. It may signal controversial governance issues, yet its participants ultimately decide for themselves how they deal with these issues. Obviously, this reduces Eumedion’s direct power in influencing company behavior. Sitxh, Eumedion focuses on corporate governance and sustainability. Since in many cases corporate governance and sustainability issues are not really integrated in portfolio management and analysis of both investors and companies, the effectiveness of Eumedion in representing interests of its participants with respect to these issues is reduced. Looking at the future, we suggest Eumedion to elaborate on the following three issues. First, given its experience and knowledge in the field of corporate governance and sustainability, it can play an important role in facilitating the discussion on how to integrate CSR decisions in portfolio management decisions, both within companies and institutional investors, as well as between companies and their investors. In communications they have with both these parties, it could more forcefully stress the fact that firm value and CSR are complements rather than substitutes, at least in the long-term. Second, Eumedion could focus on stimulating, and perhaps even leading, the current debate on engaged share-ownership, both within and outside the Netherlands. Recently, Eumedion has voiced its concerns about the lack of an engaged and stable shareholder base in Dutch listed companies and the potential consequences of this for the long-term sustainability of these companies and its owners. It has also raised its voice in criticizing the use of loyalty shares as a way to create a stable shareholder base. This signals Eumedion has a clear stance in the debate on how to deal with developing an engaged and stable shareholder base. It could therefore become one of the thought leaders on this issue in the coming years. Third, the fact that it has a limited mandate to act on behalf of its participants is a weakness of the model of interest representation used in the case of Eumedion. Strengthening its position as a representative of its participants vis-à-vis company management would leverage the effectiveness of the association in the process of norm implementation. This would also mean that Eumedion is allowed and is able to take a more activist position in case of controversial proposals and/or decisions made by company management. Participants of Eumedion may therefore reconsider the foundation’s mandate to make it more powerful in discussions with company management...|$|R
40|$|Article {{published}} in law review. For many years academics have debated {{whether it is}} better to permit hostile acquirers to use tender offers to gain control over unwilling target companies, or to force them to use corporate elections of boards of directors in these efforts. The Delaware courts have expressed a strong preference for shareholder voting as a change of control device in hostile acquisitions. To force acquirers to accept their preferences, the Delaware courts have developed a jurisprudence permitting the effective classified board (ECB), a poison pill combined with a classified board, to protect target company management from removal by a hostile tender offer alone, or through a single corporate election. For companies with ECBs, this means that a determined acquirer must engage in two corporate elections over a period of two years to force entrenched managers to give up power. In this Article, Professors Edelman and Thomas examine whether proxy contests, tender offers, or combined proxy contest/tender offers are more likely to result in value maximizing outcomes for shareholders when target companies are able to deploy defensive tactics. The authors begin by showing that prior work suffers from serious flaws involving the use of voting models that are inappropriate for analyzing proxy contests. To develop a more realistic approach to these questions, the authors employ a probabilistic version of a standard weighted voting model that explicitly incorporates two critical features of corporate voting: first, that shares are normally voted in large blocks rather than in single shares; and second, that independent third party <b>proxy</b> voting <b>advisors</b> play an important, and often pivotal, role in determining the outcome of corporate elections. In addition, the authors explicitly incorporate information about the size of different corporate constituencies and their voting preferences. Using their model, Professors Edelman and Thomas show experimentally how the distribution of shares among various investor constituencies will affect the outcome of different types of voting contests. Using this model, and these different sets of assumptions, the authors find that neither proxy contests, tender offers, nor combined proxy contests and tender offers will always lead to the desirable outcome for target company shareholders in any scenario. With each type of acquisition technique, bidders succeed in obtaining control of the target company in some value decreasing transactions, and are defeated in their acquisition efforts in some value increasing transactions. These results hold whether the authors permit existing defensive tactics or eliminate them. Professors Edelman and Thomas conclude that in order to properly analyze the role of defensive tactics, courts must take into account the underlying shareholder ownership patterns. This requires them to engage in a fact sensitive analysis of whether defensive tactics are impeding or facilitating the maximization of shareholder value. When the authors examine the Delaware Chancery Court's decisions, the reasonableness analysis that the courts have employed to decide whether to overturn defensive tactics permits them to do so. The authors recommend that the courts continue to apply this type of analysis in the future with more direct consideration {{of the impact of the}} underlying ownership structure in determining whether the defenses are being used to maximize shareholder value...|$|R

40|$|ACQUISITIONS {{are among}} the most studied areas in {{corporate}} finance research. Still, many questions about acquisitions are unanswered and regularly debated in the literature. One of these questions is whether acquisitions create value for shareholders as well as stakeholders and what factors are related to value creation. The overarching question raised in this thesis is whether and how financial stakeholders and shareholders profit from acquisitions in different scenarios, i. e. : 	Do bidder shareholders profit when financial advisors are involved in corporate acquisitions, and does the quality of financial advisors matter? Do high-quality advisors create more bidder shareholder value than lower quality advisors? 	Do firms and SPAC shareholders profit from SPAC acquisitions? How do these firms (SPAC target firms) perform in comparison to firms that use an IPO to go public? This thesis consists of three empirical articles in which I address the above outlined questions. The first article focuses on the European market and asks whether the involvement of advisors in corporate acquisitions matters for bidder value creation. Although theoretical frameworks predict a positive relationship between advisor involvement and shareholder value creation, it is not confirmed by empirical evidence (see, e. g., Servaes and Zenner, 1996; Wang and Whyte, 2010). My results suggest that advisors provide value to their clients only when both the bidder and the target are located in the UK. Moreover, a difference-in-difference analysis, using a major European regulatory reform, indicates that advisors matter for shareholder value creation in acquisitions. The second article focuses not only on the question whether an advisor is involved in an acquisition but also on whether the quality of the advisor plays a role. In theory, high-quality advisors should be able to create more shareholder value for their clients than lower-quality advisors (see, e. g., Golubov et al., 2012). However, different authors find an insignificant, negative or positive relationship between advisor quality and value creation. Since these studies rely on advisor market shares or related measures to assess advisor quality and since evidence suggests that advisor market shares are not a good predictor of advisor performance (Bao and Edmans, 2011), we develop a new <b>proxy</b> to capture <b>advisor</b> quality. We define high-quality advisors as advisors that have won an award of excellence (i. e., best M&A house) and focus on the North American market. The results suggest that there is a positive relationship between award winners and value creation. Moreover, clients of award winners seem to outperform clients of non-award winners in the long term and seem to realize greater synergies. The results hold when we consider the endogenous choice of an advisor. Finally, it seems that award winners put more effort into acquisitions that are more visible. The last article focuses on SPAC acquisitions, which combine acquisitions with initial public offerings to enable firms a fast and cheap listing at a public stock exchange. We compare firms that use SPAC acquisitions to access the public market with firms that use IPOs to access the public market. The results from the analysis of 127 SPAC acquisitions and 1, 128 IPOs during the wave of new-generation SPACs starting in 2003 suggest that SPAC acquisitions profit firms that are small, highly levered and have low growth opportunities in times with turbulent market environments. It seems that venture capital and private equity investors rather stick to the traditional way, the IPO, to bring their portfolio firms to the public market. Furthermore, firms that access the market via SPAC acquisitions underperform the market and similar IPO firms in the long run. The results of this thesis provide some evidence that financial advisors do play a crucial role and that shareholders might profit from their involvement in acquisitions. Moreover, innovations in financial markets that promise to improve the protection of shareholder interests, such as SPAC acquisitions, should be analyzed by the market participants with great care. On the one hand, they might provide value for certain firms (that are not able to access the public markets via an IPO); on the other hand, they seem to hurt shareholders that are interested in long-term gains...|$|R
