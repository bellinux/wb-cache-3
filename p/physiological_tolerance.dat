5|$|Teleosts {{have four}} major life stages: the egg, the larva, the {{juvenile}} and the adult. Species may begin {{life in a}} pelagic environment or a demersal environment (near the seabed). Most marine teleosts have pelagic eggs, which are light, transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes. Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care. When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim. They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. Parental care is much more common among freshwater fish. Unlike their pelagic counterparts, demersal larvae are able to swim and feed {{as soon as they}} hatch. Larval teleosts often look very different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerance</b> and sensitivity, ecological and behavioural competence.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} Anomura has long been controversially discussed. One aspect that has received little attention is the dissimilarity in <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the related families Paguridae and Lithodidae to environmental conditions, and how this may have determined the divergence and radiation of the families into different distribution ranges, in particular {{with regard to the}} limited penetration of the deep sea by the Paguridae. This study investigates the <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the temperate shallow-water hermit crab, Pagurus cuanensis, to various temperature (5, 10, 15, 20 °C) and pressure regimes (1 to 100 atm) by measuring the standard metabolic rate (SMR) and behavioural changes. SMR was primarily affected by temperature, with a notably low rate at 5 °C throughout all pressures. Behaviour was primarily affected by pressure, with an increase in pressure from 50 to 100 atmospheres (atm) resulting in reduced activity. It is suggested that this species can tolerate hydrostatic pressures greater than those found in its natural bathymetric range. It is hypothesised that a lack of <b>physiological</b> cold <b>tolerance</b> and the need to find gastropod shells for protection are the principal restrictions maintaining P. cuanensis to a maximum depth of approximately 250 m.

25|$|The ant faces many {{respiratory}} challenges due to {{its highly}} variable environment, which can cause increased desiccation, hypoxia, and hypercapnia. Hot, humid climates cause an increase in heart rate and respiration which increases energy and water loss. Hypoxia and hypercapnia can result from red imported fire ant colonies living in poorly ventilated thermoregulatory mounds and underground nests. Discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) may allow ants to survive the hypercapnic and hypoxic conditions frequently found in their burrows; it is ideal for adapting to these conditions because it allows the ants to increase the period of O2 intake and CO2 expulsion independently through spiracle manipulation. The invasion success of the red imported fire ant may possibly be related to its <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerance</b> to abiotic stress, being more heat tolerant and more adaptable to desiccation stress than S. richteri. This means that the ant is less vulnerable to heat and desiccation stress. Although S. richteri has higher water body content than the red imported fire ant, S. richteri was more vulnerable to desiccation stress. The lower sensitivity to desiccation {{is due to a}} lower water loss rate.

Although rarely defined in such studies, ecological divergence is almost always approximated using multivariate climatic data associated with sets of specimens (i. e., the "climatic niche"); the justification for {{this approach is that}} species-specific climatic envelopes act as surrogates for <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Using identical statistical procedures, we evaluated the usefulness and validity of the climate-as-proxy assumption by comparing performance of genetic (nDNA SNPs and mitochondrial DNA), phenotypic, and climatic data for objective species delimitation in the speckled rattlesnake (Crotalus mitchellii) complex. Ordination and clustering patterns were largely congruent among intrinsic (heritable) traits (nDNA, mtDNA, phenotype), and discordance is explained by biological processes (e. g., ontogeny, hybridization). In contrast, climatic data did not produce biologically meaningful clusters that were congruent with any intrinsic dataset, but rather corresponded to regional differences in atmospheric circulation and climate, indicating an absence of inherent taxonomic signal in these data. Surrogating climate for <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> adds artificial weight to evidence of species boundaries, as these data are irrelevant for that purpose.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{altering}} phenology and distributions of many species and further changes are projected. Can species physiologically adapt to climate warming? We analyse thermal tolerances {{of a large}} number of terrestrial ectotherm (n =  697), endotherm (n =  227) and plant (n =  1816) species worldwide, and show that tolerance to heat is largely conserved across lineages, while tolerance to cold varies between and within species. This pattern, previously documented for ectotherms, is apparent for this group and for endotherms and plants, challenging the longstanding view that <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> of species change continuously across climatic gradients. An alternative view is proposed in which the thermal component of climatic niches would overlap across species more than expected. We argue that hard physiological boundaries exist that constrain evolution of tolerances of terrestrial organisms to high temperatures. In contrast, evolution of tolerances to cold should be more frequent. One consequence of conservatism of upper thermal tolerances is that estimated niches for cold-adapted species will tend to underestimate their upper thermal limits, thereby potentially inflating assessments of risk from climate change. In contrast, species whose climatic preferences are close to their upper thermal limits will unlikely evolve <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> to increased heat, thereby being predictably more affected by warming. © 2013 The Authors.

40|$|The global {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} biodiversity and biomes {{is determined by}} species-specific <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> to climatic constraints. Current models implement empirical bioclimatic relationships to predict present-day vegetation patterns and to forecast biodiversity changes and biome shifts under climatic change. In this paper, we consider plant functional trade-offs and their interactions with climatic changes to forecast and explain biodiversity changes and biome shifts. The Jena Diversity model (JeDi) simulates plant survival according to essential plant functional trade-offs, including eco-physiological processes such as water uptake, photosynthesis, allocation, reproduction and phenology. We apply JeDi to quantify biodiversity changes and biome shifts between present-day {{and a range of}} possible future climates from two scenarios (A 2 and B 1) and seven global climate models using metrics of plant functional richness and functional identity. Our results show (i) a significant biodiversity loss in the tropics, (ii) an increase in biodiversity at mid and high latitudes, and (iii) a poleward shift of biomes. While these results are consistent with the findings of empirical approaches, we are able to explain them in terms of the plant functional trade-offs involved in the allocation, metabolic and reproduction strategies of plants. We conclude that general aspects of plant <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> can be derived from plant functional trade-offs, which may provide a useful process- and trait-based alternative to bioclimatic relationships in order to address questions about the causes of biodiversity changes and biome shifts...|$|R

50|$|One {{interesting}} {{finding in}} studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments. When bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in the population size and may constrict genetic variation, the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic variance. This conversion can actually lead to increased variance in the founding populations which then allows for rapid adaptive evolution. Following invasion events, selection may initially act on the capacity to disperse as well as <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerance</b> to the new stressors in the environment. Adaptation then proceeds {{to respond to the}} selective pressures of the new environment.

40|$|The {{distributions}} of species {{are determined by}} intrinsic factors such as <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> as well as extrinsic factors of the environment such as the availability of resources. While <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> generally change over evolutionary time scales, changes in environmental productivity due to processes such as succession or seasonal progression often occur over ecological times. I address both physiology and resource availability as drivers of the distributions and diversity of endothermic birds and mammals using a macroecological approach and a metabolic perspective. Migratory birds, altering communities over seasonal cycles, provide {{a unique opportunity to}} investigate the drivers of distributions and diversity that act over ecological time scales. In my first chapter, I show that energy use by migrants in North American breeding bird communities tracks the seasonal dynamics of resource availability. Migrants dominate consumption in tundra and boreal forests where the summer pulse of resources is large relative to winter productivity. While migrants are more prominent during the breeding season, many species overwinter throughout the temperate zone where their role in communities is understudied. In my second chapter, I quantify the contribution of migrants to diversity and energy use in North American winter bird communities. Overwintering migrants contribute little to diversity but dominate energy use in many temperate communities. My third chapter represents the efforts of myself and colleagues to understand the physiological adaptations that determine the thermal environments in which species can persist. By expanding on the Scholander-Irving model of heat transfer, we show that mass independent changes to basal metabolic rate and thermal conductance allow endotherms to inhabit nearly the full breadth of thermal environments on Earth.

40|$|Tropical crabs are {{abundant}} {{and seem to}} play an important role in mangrove ecosystems. Two crab groups are dominant: sesarmids (Grapsidae) and Uea (Ocypodidae). Australian Uea are poorly known. To understand the significance of crab activity on mangrove communities, the behavioural ecology of Uea found in Darwin Harbour was investigated. The aims were to describe distributional patterns and to identify factors important to these patterns. An observational sampling method, developed for quantifying apparent abundance of Uea, was used at various spatial-e. g. creek, habitat, microhabitat-and temporale. g. year, season, tide-scales. Behaviour of different popUlations was observed. Results were used to develop hypotheses that were tested by examining <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances,</b> morphology, changes in abundance at experimental treatments and survival in different habitats. Ueajlammula were active in lower forests, at wetter, cooler times. This species avoided buttress roots, often interacted with sesarmids and had inconspicuous behaviour.

Uea elegans 2 ̆ 7 foraging and social behaviours were correlated with crab density. Uea signata 2 ̆ 7 s habitats were more vegetated at higher elevations.

Oxygen consumption rates were also monitored at 10 °C, 15 °C and 20 °C to investigate changes in metabolism as a result of temperature acclimation. Species-specific behaviour was observed in the field and laboratory, with O. lineatus consistently showing higher levels of activity, while G. cineraria was the least active. Inter-species variability in oxygen consumption was associated with body mass and size-related relationships rather than a temperature-related metabolic effect. The results were linked to distinct <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> and habitat preferences. The results demonstrated that phylogenetically similar species respond differently to change, both behaviourally and physiologically. Responses may vary further as climate warms as a consequence of size-related temperature effects having different metabolic costs between species.

It can saprophytically live in the intestines of vertebrates including amphibians (e.g. frogs, lizards, toads, turtles, salamanders), reptiles (e.g. chameleons, wall geckoes, snakes), and fishes (e.g. sturgeon, mudpuppy). In addition, studies also reported occasional presence of B. ranarum in the intestinal contents of mammals such as one bat in India and the kangaroos in Australia. Moreover, other habitats including compost heaps, decaying plant material and soil can also be their place to live. However, the habitat for B. ranarum is not fixed and a life-cycle illustration of it might provide a better idea of the variation of its habitats. First, insects might eat feces and decaying plant materials in which B. ranarum might be present, or insects might have physical contact with the strains so that the strains can attach to the insects externally. Then, those insects might be devoured by predators, such as frogs. Next, the fungi will travel through the predator’s gastrointestinal tract and might either stay a little bit longer (as long as 18 days) at or leave from the intestine along with the feces. Eventually, the strains in those feces will end up in the soil and some of them will be further transported to decaying plant materials or other organic contents. Also, the tissues that the pathogenic strains of B. ranarum infect can also be considered as its habitats, B. ranarum can also live in both human and non-human animal (e.g. horses, frogs) tissues. However, instead of {{a worldwide}} distribution, the pathogenic lifestyle of B. ranarum only exists in tropical and subtropical regions.|$|E

There are three types of edge effects that influence habitat fragments: (1) abiotic effects, which result from the proximity to a structurally dissimilar matrix and involve changes in environmental conditions; (2) direct biological effects, which involve changes in the abundance and distribution of species, either {{as a direct result of}} altered physical conditions or indirectly, as mediated through the <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> of species to conditions at and near the edge (for example, higher light levels, wind exposure, temperatures and humidity); and (3) indirect biological effects, which involve changes in species interactions, such as predation, brood parasitism, competition and herbivory, biotic pollination and seed dispersal (Murcia, 1995).|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{invasion}} of the Gulf of Maine, in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, by the largest red seaweed in the world, the Asian Grateloupia turuturu. First detected in 1994 in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, south of Cape Cod, this alga had expanded its range in the following years only over to Long Island and into Long Island Sound. In July 2007 we found Grateloupia in the Cape Cod Canal and as far north (east) as Boston, Massachusetts, establishing its presence in the Gulf of Maine. Grateloupia can be invasive and may be capable of disrupting low intertidal and shallow subtidal seaweeds. The plant 2 ̆ 7 s broad <b>physiological</b> <b>tolerances</b> suggest that {{it will be able to}} expand possibly as far north as the Bay of Fundy. We predict its continued spread in North America and around the world, noting that its arrival in the major international port of Boston may now launch G. turuturu on to new global shipping corridors...|$|R
