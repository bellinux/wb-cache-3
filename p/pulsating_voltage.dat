30|$|The {{treatment}} {{was conducted in}} a cylindrical reactor with inner diameter of 45  mm and height of 85  mm. The reaction mixture was cooled by the continuous circulation of cold water in the outer jacket. One of stainless steel electrodes (diameter 4  mm) was located in {{the lower part of}} the reactor, and the other (diameter 2.4  mm) was located 10  mm above the surface of the solution. The initial voltage was delivered to the step-up transformer. The ac current from the secondary coil was delivered to the bridge rectifier and then, now <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage,</b> was delivered via a ballast resistor to the reactor electrodes. The igniting unit was additionally connected to the anode. This unit formed pulses with amplitude of up to 15  kV at a width of 1.5  ms. The pulses were strictly synchronized with the phase of the <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage.</b> At the instant when the igniting pulse was formed, there was a breakdown between the reactor electrodes in the vacuum space created by rarefaction to 0.06 – 0.08  MPa. The resistance sharply dropped, and an anode current started to flow thereby creating a discharge. The discharge burning voltage remained nearly unchanged at 750 – 900  V. The current in the discharge gap was determined by the plasma resistance and the voltage applied to the system formed by the plasma discharge and the ballast controller. The voltage was controlled by the phase method principle, i.e., the average anode voltage applied to the reactor depended on the phase of the <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage</b> at the anode and on the instant at which an ignition pulse was delivered.|$|E

Torque is controlled at constant switching frequency, via the closed loop regulation of the stator flux linkage vector and of the current component in quadrature with it, using the stator flux oriented reference frame. A hybrid flux and position observer combines back-electromotive force integration with <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage</b> injection around zero speed. Around zero speed, the position observer takes advantage of injected <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage.</b> Instead of the commonly used current demodulation, the position error feedback is extracted here at {{the output of the}} observer's flux maps, thus resulting in immunity towards the cross-saturation position error. The Maximum Torque per Ampere (MTPA) strategy is used. A detailed analysis puts in evidence the key advantages and disadvantages related {{to the use of the}} MTPA in the sensorless control of the Synchronous Reluctance machine, for both the saliency based and the back-EMF based sensorless methods. Extensive experimental results are reported for a 2. 2 kW {{synchronous reluctance motor}} prototype, showing the feasibility of the proposed method. These include speed response to step and sinusoidal load disturbances at standstill, up to 121 % of rated torque, and speed response tests covering the flux weakening speed region...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{injection}} axis switching (IAS) sensorless control scheme using a pulsating high-frequency (HF) signal {{to minimize the}} position detection error and the velocity estimation ripple due to the zero current clamping (ZCC) effect for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in an estimated synchronous frame, the envelope of the resulting HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an amplitude-modulated pattern. Using this information, the IAS technique allows avoiding multiple zero-crossings of HF currents by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. At no-load, the <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage</b> is injected only on the d-axis while the d-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value. Under the loaded condition, the injection voltage is switched to the q-axis and the d-axis current drops back to zero. Thus, the proposed sensorless control enforces a much better estimation performance during ZCC region without a pre-defined offline commissioning test than the standard pulsating injection scheme. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by experimental results.

40|$|Abstract- This paper proposes an {{injection}} axis switching (IAS) sensorless control using a pulsating HF signal to minimize ZCC effect for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in a synchronous frame, the envelope {{of the resulting}} HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an oscillating pattern with a maximum to zero magnitude. Taking this effect into account, multiple zero-crossings of HF currents around the zero-crossing region can be avoided by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. For this purpose, we develop {{an injection}} axis switching scheme according to the load condition. At no-load, the <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage</b> is injected only on the d-axis while the d-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value. Under the load condition, the injection voltage is switched to the q-axis and the d-axis current drops back to zero. Thus, the proposed sensorless control permits the HF current magnitude to be zero at every zero-crossing point. The minimization result leads to an accurate position estimate during ZCC region and the proposed scheme does not require any additional test prior to start-up. Experiments demonstrate {{the superiority of the}} proposed method in suppressing the voltage distortions caused by ZCC effect. I...|$|E
40|$|The rotor {{position}} of a synchronous permanent magnet (PM) motor can be detected {{by means of the}} injection of a high-frequency stator voltage superimposed to the fundamental component. Thanks to the rotor anisotropy, the corresponding high-frequency current is modulated and used to determine the rotor position. Two techniques are considered: the first one adopts a <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage</b> vector in the estimated synchronous reference frame, while the second one adopts a rotating voltage vector. These techniques are effective at zero and at low motor speed. The accuracy of the rotor position detection depends strictly on the rotor saliency, that is, on the geometry of the PM rotor. In fact both saturation and d-and q-axis cross-coupling have a heavy influence on the correct rotor position detection. The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare the two sensorless control techniques, together with two rotor geometries, that is, IPM and inset rotor. In order to highlight the effectiveness of the sensorless technique, the tests are carried out at various operating conditions. It is found that the effectiveness of the sensorless rotor position detection strongly depends on the PM rotor geometry. Conversely, the choice of the sensorless control technique affects slightly the rotor position detection...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the self-commissioning of {{synchronous}} reluctance motors. Previous work has demonstrated that the motor flux maps can be accurately identified at standstill by exciting the machine with square-wave voltage pulses of large amplitude, of the same order of the machine nominal voltage. This was made without the need of rotor locking and without using position sensors. The knowledge of the d and q axes position was obtained by a preliminary sensorless commissioning and then used for directing the d and q voltage pulses accordingly, in open-loop fashion. At free shaft, the position tends to oscillate under such alternated excitation, introducing position error and thus inaccuracy. For high values of the torque current component the rotor can even start spinning suddenly, thus stopping the identification. The loss of control impedes of identification of the flux maps above a certain limit, {{at least in the}} q direction. In the past, polynomial fitting was used to extrapolate the flux map in the missing parts of the dq current domain, with good results. In this paper, the rotor position is closed-loop estimated during the motor commissioning, so to counteract the occurrence of sudden spin and extend the explored current area in the q direction. An additional <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage,</b> also of the square-wave type, is superimposed to the main excitation voltage, and the position is tracked through current demodulation. In this way, the area explored in the dq current plane is substantially extended, if compared to previous method. The proposed approach is verified through experimental results on one synchronous reluctance motor prototype...|$|E
40|$|Suitable {{integration}} of several energy sources profoundly {{depends on the}} power electronic converters which interface multiple energy sources that having different characteristics. Conventionally, multiple sources are connected either in series or parallel configurations. However, these configurations have disadvantages such as having difficulty to achieve regulated output voltage and produce high ripples. Consequently, it is more beneficial to use a multi-input converter rather than several independent converters, as it results in less components, simpler control, more stability, and also lower ripples. In this research, a double-input boost DCDC converter (DIBC) is proposed using the concept of <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage</b> source cells (PVSCs) for synthesis and generation of input sources circuit combined with double inductors interleaved concept as ripple reduction technique {{in order to reduce}} the current ripple. The proposed double-input converter is composed of two voltage sources that accommodated with converter cell and the conduction of interleaving switches decides the interleaved operating mode and boosting level. Different operating modes of the proposed converter are obtained as well as its corresponding voltage ratios are derived. In the controller design, a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique is used to control the commuting switches while the neural network (NN) control algorithm is used to manage and regulate output voltage of the proposed DIBC. The NN controller is trained by the online back propagation algorithm to achieve output voltage regulation despite variations in line voltage and the load; as well output voltage tracking capability.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two transient {{models for}} a prototype integrated charger {{for use in}} a plug-in hybrid-electrical vehicle application. The models can be useful in order to develop control algorithms for the system or to recommend improvements to the machine design. A flux map based method, obtaining input data from simulations using the finite element method (FEM) is used to model the grid synchronization process. The grid side voltage can then be predicted by incorporating spatial flux linkage harmonics. The model is implemented in Matlab/Simulink and compared to stand alone FEM simulations with good agreement. The charging process is modeled using an inductance based model also requiring FEM simulations as input data. Since the flux linkages in the grid and inverter side windings are dependent on each other, the presented transient model is linearized around a specific operating point. This model is also implemented in a Matlab/Simulink environment. Sensorless control of a PMSynRel drive is also studied in this thesis. Focus is put on operating limits due to magnetic saturation when operating at low speeds. The rotating and <b>pulsating</b> <b>voltage</b> vector injection methods for sensorless control are studied in detail. A technique to map the feasible sensorless control region is proposed which utilizes the resulting position error signal rather than data of differential inductances. This technique is implemented experimentally and compared to corresponding FEM simulations with good agreement. The impact of spatial inductance harmonics {{on the quality of the}} position estimates is also studied. A method to predict the maximum position estimation error due to the inductance harmonics is proposed based on simplified analytical models. A technique is presented and experimentally verified which can compensate for this effect by injecting a modified rotating voltage carrier. Lastly, the impact of saturation in the rotor structure on the initial magnet polarity detection is investigated. The experimental results, in good agreement with the corresponding FEM simulations, indicate that the impact of saturation in the magnet bridges of rotor is the dominant phenomenon at lower peak current magnitudes.

40|$|Theoretical {{prediction}} of bending behavior of IPMC {{is an important}} task {{for the purpose of}} achieving a practical IPMC actuator. It has gradually become apparent that the bending of IPMC is dominated by the charge imposed on it. However, our latest study revealed that the dependency of the Selenium CMV-based IPMC bending behavior on the charge was unexpectedly a bit complex. The relationship of curvature of the Selenium CMV-based IPMC vs. the total charge imposed on it formed a certain trajectory with time. It was observed that the trajectory formed a clockwise rotational curve, when the Selenium CMV-based IPMC underwent the rectangular <b>pulsated</b> <b>voltage</b> at the environmental absolute humidity less than 10 gm- 3. On the other hand, when the environmental absolute humidity was greater than 10 gm- 3, the rotational trajectory was counterclockwise with respect to time.

The circuit model well explained such unusual and complex behavior. Another physics-based analysis, employing viscoelastic model also successfully explained the clockwise and counterclockwise trajectory formation. It was concluded that such a complex bending behavior was due to the mutually distinctive influences of individual charges induced within the IPMC on the bending induction and due to the change of material characteristics of Selenium CMV...|$|R
