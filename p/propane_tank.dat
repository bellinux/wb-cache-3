5|$|Lesnar's {{rapid rise}} to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The Undertaker, which {{involved}} a match at Unforgiven on September 22. The match ended in a double disqualification and Lesnar retained the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at No Mercy, this time in a Hell in a Cell match. Leading up to the match, in the storyline, Lesnar broke The Undertaker's hand with a <b>propane</b> <b>tank.</b> Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match went on as planned. At No Mercy on October 20, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to retain the title. After his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker, Lesnar successfully retained the WWE Championship in a handicap match with Heyman against Edge at Rebellion on October 26.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds of yards and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near Flat Rock and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away. A heavy <b>propane</b> <b>tank</b> was lofted and thrown 100 yards from one of the chicken houses, and 19 cattle on the property were killed. Remarkably, a family of four taking shelter inside the house were completely unharmed. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it tore through the rural community of Shiloh, sweeping away numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes and killing 5 people at that location. Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a van was lofted and dropped into a field 400 yards away from where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people. Dozens of homes in Trenton were completely destroyed, 18 others sustained major damage, {{and tens of thousands of}} trees were downed in the area. A grocery store, two apartment complexes, and a funeral home were destroyed as well.|$|E

25|$|On October 3, 2012, Byron and Belleci made a guest {{appearance}} on the Discovery series Sons of Guns. They test-fired some of the weapons in the Red Jacket shop, then watched as the staff re-tested a myth busted by the Build Team in 2008: that a <b>propane</b> <b>tank</b> could explode when hit with a bullet.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, Big Daddy (who has {{gathered}} {{a large group}} of zombies) learns that they can walk safely underwater. He leads the zombies to cross the river to the human city. They take the guards by surprise and begin massacring the people. As a result of the zombies making it into the city, the electric fences that once kept the zombies out have now become a wall to trap them and the humans inside. Seeing the city overrun, Kaufman runs with his money, and encounters a zombie Cholo in the parking garage. As the two struggle, Big Daddy kills both with a <b>propane</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carol covers {{herself in}} walker viscera to {{blend into the}} horde as to {{approach}} the train yard unseen. She ignites a <b>propane</b> <b>tank</b> near the fence that explodes, creating a breach for the walkers to enter; this creates a panic throughout Terminus that allows Rick and the others to overpower their captors and kill them. They free {{the others in the}} box car and make their way out of Terminus. Carol, meanwhile, discovers the supplies taken from Rick's group and recovers some of them. She then finds Mary, and gets into a fight with her when she refuses to tell her where Rick's group was kept. When Carol gets the upper hand, Mary pleads for her life, insisting they were good people once, but Carol, disgusted with their cannibalism, shoots at her leg and leaves her to be overwhelmed by walkers.|$|E

25|$|The {{surviving}} officers {{retreat to}} an empty apartment as they are cornered by more armed thugs. To create an escape route, Rama uses an axe to cut {{a hole in the}} wooden floor so the team can descend to the lower level. Dropping to the room below, the team struggles to fend off Tama's horde of thugs and Officer Bowo is critically injured in the process. In a last-ditch effort to defend his team, Rama uses a stove <b>propane</b> <b>tank</b> to construct an improvised explosive device that successfully eliminates the invading henchmen, giving the officers a small window of time. Out of ammunition, and with more of Tama's reinforcements approaching, the team splits into two groups: Jaka, Dagu and Lt. Wahyu retreat to the fifth floor, while Rama and a critically injured Bowo ascend back above in search of the law-abiding tenant they encountered earlier.|$|E
25|$|Alongside the episode's opening, several scenes {{utilized}} practical effects. During Talking Dead, Nicotero {{said that}} one of his favorite walkers was the one who fed on the nose of a Terminus resident; the crew used a puppet that was lit on fire as a walker, while a stuntman who portrayed the walker's victim wore a silicone mask that protected him from the fire. The walkers Carol Peletier and Tyreese encounter on the train tracks {{in the beginning of the}} episode were rotting; this was indicative of Nicotero's intention for the walkers in the fifth season to look more skeletal, with several body parts missing. In the episode's climax, Carol blows up a <b>propane</b> <b>tank</b> to attract walkers to Terminus and distract the captors there. In filming the scene, the special effects team custom built the tank out of foam to control the size of the explosion.|$|E

The Corps also installed a gas line to a <b>propane</b> <b>tank</b> [...] away to feed the torch. A mound of evergreens was placed {{around the base of}} the flame to cover the tubing and torch mechanism, and the head of the grave dug in front of the flame.|$|E
2500|$|Ellendale, {{like many}} towns {{established}} in the mid-19th century, had a railroad based economy. Ellendale was centered around a junction of two rail lines. The north-south rail line is still in operation today as a freight line, operated by Delmarva Central Railroad and known as the Indian River Subdivision, although passenger operations have ceased. This secondary is designated as the area running from Harrington, Delaware south to the NRG Energy power plant. The main freight hauled on the track is coal for the NRG power plant located near Millsboro, Delaware. Other freight includes a mix of fertilizer, grain, paper, food products, chemicals, and stone. The Delaware Coast Line Railroad also operates a rail line in Ellendale, the Milton Branch of the former Queen Anne's Railroad, which leaves the Delmarva Central Railroad at Willow Street and heads east to Milton, Delaware. This line is [...] from interchange to endpoint, and is currently used to store covered hoppers for Perdue and for other railcar owners. Plans are currently underway for this line to reopen with more operations to a <b>propane</b> <b>tank</b> farm being constructed in Milton.|$|E

25|$|The bombs used by {{the pair}} varied and were crudely made from carbon dioxide canisters, {{galvanized}} pipe, and metal propane bottles. The bombs were primed with matches placed at one end. Both had striker tips on their sleeves. When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head would light the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased <b>propane</b> <b>tanks</b> and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family's garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs.
