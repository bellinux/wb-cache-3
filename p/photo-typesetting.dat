The Johnston typeface was developed in upper and lower case in 1916, and {{a complete set of}} blocks, marked Johnston Sans, was made by the printers the following year. A bold version of the capitals was developed by Johnston in 1929. The Met changed to a serif letterform for its signs in the 1920s, used on the stations rebuilt by Clark. However, Johnston was adopted systemwide after the formation of the LPTB in 1933 and the LT wordmark was applied to locomotives and carriages. Johnston was redesigned, becoming New Johnston, for <b>photo-typesetting</b> in the early 1980s when Elichi Kono designed a range that included Light, Medium and Bold, each with its italic version. The typesetters P22 developed today's electronic version, sometimes called TfL Johnston, in 1997.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s, {{the paper}} became {{a pioneer in}} {{newspaper}} production. Early experimentation led to development of the first practical <b>photo-typesetting</b> machine. Newspaper executives from throughout the world visited the paper {{to learn about the}} new process.|$|E
50|$|The {{work was}} {{presented}} to Letraset, but it was Robert Norton, founder of the Photoscript Ltd <b>photo-typesetting</b> company, who decided to produce it. The font was named by Norton and, according to Microsoft, it received {{its name from the}} then Westminster Bank Limited (now NatWest) from the United Kingdom, that helped fund its production.|$|E
50|$|Despite initial {{liquidity}} problems, Intertype {{was quite}} successful in later years, producing mixer machines, high speed machines, {{and the first}} photo-type compositor. In 1957, Intertype merged with Harris-Seybold, a manufacturer of presses and paper cutters, to become Harris-Intertype Corporation. After the merger, the Harris-Intertype Fotosetter was introduced. It was the first <b>photo-typesetting</b> machine and was based upon the standard Intertype machine, replacing the brass type matrices with small film negatives and instead of casting, used these to expose photographic paper.|$|E
50|$|A {{year after}} Cal Pack Industries was founded, Tobin founded Software Concepts, Inc., {{where he served}} as {{president}} and CEO for 8 years. The company developed software programs for computers, including a map downloading program for the CIA, {{and one of the}} first patented software programs in the United States for spelling verification. The latter program was used by most major word-processing and <b>photo-typesetting</b> systems, including Lanier, Philips, and Xerox, among many others. The patent he was issued in 1980 for the Spell-Checking program was one of the first software patents issued in the United States, Canada, and Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{with the}} American {{newspaper}} USA Today as an inspiration, launched on Tuesday 4 March 1986, {{with the front}} page headline, [...] "Second Spy Inside GCHQ". At 18p, it was a middle-market tabloid, a rival to the long-established Daily Mail and Daily Express. It pioneered computer <b>photo-typesetting</b> and full-colour offset printing {{at a time when}} national newspapers were still using Linotype machines, letterpress and could only reproduce photographs in black and white. The colour was initially crude, produced on equipment which had no facility for colour proofing, so the first view of the colour was on the finished product. However, it forced the conversion of all UK national newspapers to electronic production and colour printing. The newspaper's motto, hung in the newsroom, was [...] "propa truth, not propaganda".|$|E

50|$|Rather {{than simply}} {{producing}} a phototype {{of the original}} design, Johnston was redesigned in 1979 by Eiichi Kono at Banks & Miles to produce New Johnston. The new family comes in eight members: Light, Medium, Bold weights with corresponding Italics, Medium Condensed and Bold Condensed (the old family had only two weights: Regular and Bold, and the latter had no lowercase letters). After all precisely hand-drawn letters (nearly 1,000) were completed and sent to AlphaType for digitisation in the USA in 1981-82, New Johnston finally became ready for Linotron <b>photo-typesetting</b> machine, and first appeared in London's Underground stations in 1983. It is the official typeface exclusively used by Transport for London and The Mayor of London ever since. The New Johnston Medium as the new standard is slightly heavier or bolder than the original Johnston Regular (or sometimes confusingly called Medium) and lighter than the original Bold, and has a larger x-height, made suitable for main text setting as well as large display sizes. The average x-height of the New Johnston is roughly 7% larger than the original as the limit for keeping the original Johnston flavour, which was fundamental. The larger x-height allowed larger counters, and type size (size of x-height in particular) and weight are reciprocal factors for legibility, but enlarging x-height can affect style and appearance. Since the original Johnston weights, Regular and Bold, were maintained as closely as possible, inevitably New Johnston Medium appears very close to Light and Bold. This is {{the whole point of}} this particular solution because New Johnston Medium works as the one-fits-all standard font for virtually every application from large type sizes for posters and signs to minute type sizes for pocket map maintaining much improved legibility. Punctuation marks are matched the diamond tittle, differing from Johnston's original design, enhancing the identity of London Transport.|$|E
